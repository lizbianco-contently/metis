Under the previous order, there is \n30 minutes of debate on amendments Nos. 709 and 716, with the time \nequally divided between the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, and the \nSenator from North Carolina, Mr. Burr.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nHatch and Senator Rockefeller as cosponsors of our bipartisan \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is my intent to take a couple of minutes \nto lay out the reason it is so important to pass this county payments \namendment this morning. Then I plan to yield 5 minutes to my good \nfriend and teammate on this issue, Senator Craig, and then it is my \nintent to close for our side.\n  This issue of county payments funding is literally an issue of \nsurvival for rural counties across this country. It is going to \ndetermine whether the Federal Government will keep a more than 100-year \nobligation to rural communities or whether the Federal Government is \ngoing to turn its back on these communities and allow them to become \nnational sacrifice zones.\n  Mr. President, 100 years ago, the Federal Government entered into an \nagreement with rural communities in exchange for creating national \nforests and restricting how local communities manage their forest \nlands. The Government would provide a partial payment so those local \ncommunities could pay for essential services, such as law enforcement \nand education. But the most recent law guaranteeing those payments--the \nlaw the distinguished Senator from Idaho and I wrote, the Secure Rural \nSchools and Community Self-Determination Act--has expired. If the law \nis not extended--the safety net payments rural communities need in \norder to carry out essential services--without those dollars, there \nwill be havoc in rural communities across our country.\n\n  The votes the Senate is going to soon take are going to decide the \nfuture of a lot of these rural communities, and there are two \napproaches. First, there is the approach Senator Craig and I and a \nbipartisan group of 17 Senators favor that is flexible, that ensures we \ndon't make the decisions in Washington, DC, we don't micromanage these \nlocal communities but give them the flexibility at the local level to \nmake choices that make sense for them.\n  This legislation is sponsored by both Republican Senators from Idaho, \nboth Democratic Senators from Washington State, and many others. We \nhave a broad coalition. The National Association of Counties, labor \ngroups, education advocates--all have said that the approach that makes \nsense for them is our bipartisan amendment, and they have not been in \nfavor of the amendment offered by the Senator from North Carolina.\n  I am now going to make 5 minutes from our time available to my friend \nand colleague, Senator Craig. I thank him again for his support.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for \nyielding. He has clearly outlined the critical nature of this \nlegislation and its reauthorization from the original Secure Rural \nSchools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2005. Out in Oregon, \nthey called it Wyden-Craig; in Idaho, they called it Craig-Wyden. But \nin reality, it became a lifeline for the rural communities that since \n1908 had become increasingly dependent upon the revenues that flowed \nfrom our public lands. In fact, on and after May 23, 1908--and I am \nquoting specifically from the law--``25 per centum of all moneys \nreceived during any fiscal year from each national forest shall be paid \nat the end of such year by the Secretary of the Treasury to the State \nor the territory'' in which that money was generated for the purpose of \nit flowing down to, it very specifically says, ``public schools, public \nroads of the county or counties in which such national forests are \nsituated.''\n  During the decade of the eighties, we reduced the allowable cut on \nour forested lands by nearly 80 percent. What Senator Wyden and I \nrecognized at that time--we had counties in near bankruptcy--as a \nresult of that, in 2000, we passed the Secure Rural Schools and \nCommunity Self-Determination Act. That act expired on September 30, \n2006. Whom did it impact? It impacted 700 counties, 4,400 school \ndistricts in 39 States, 8 million schoolkids, and approximately 15,000 \nmiles of roads.\n  We knew that probably the formula would have to change, and the \nSenator from Oregon and I have worked mightily on that issue. He \noffered a reauthorization of the old formula. I finally offered a 1-\nyear extension. We were able\n\n[[Page S3987]]\n\nto get the funding for a 1-year extension in the underlying vehicle, \nbut as a result of all of that work, a new formula, a compromise, has \ncome to be that the Senator brought to the floor as an amendment \nyesterday to this bill.\n  This is a formula which takes us out to 2012. It is a formula which \nstabilizes these communities. It is also a package that extends and \nimproves the PILT, or the payment in lieu of taxes, to these large, \nfederally dominated rural counties. It is awfully important to remember \nthat point.\n  A lot of folks east of the Mississippi don't recognize sometimes that \nwe have counties that are 80 percent and 90 percent public lands. They \nhave no fee-simple private land base from which to fund their public \nneeds and facilities. Yet those are the very lands on which people love \nto come and recreate. People from the East love to go out there and \nrecreate. They can get hung up on a cliff somewhere and they can't get \ndown, so local search and rescue has to get a helicopter for $10,000 \nand pluck them off a cliff. And who pays for it? They have enjoyed \ntheir recreational experience on the public land, but it is the county \nand the private funding resource that has to pay for it.\n  So the extension of PILT, in combination with what we are doing to \nsustain our rural schools and counties and their roads and bridges, is \nabsolutely critical. It is why we created PILT years ago. It is why, \nwhen Teddy Roosevelt asked the American people to create Federal \nreserves, he wanted to tie the communities of interest to the Federal \nreserves, and out of it came the 25-percent formula that I just quoted. \nThe extension of that is critical in western rural public land, timber, \nand U.S.-forest-land-dominated States. It is not, however, just in the \nWest. Other States across the country recognize it, from the East to \nthe South; as I said, 700 counties, 4,400 school districts, 39 States, \nwith 8 million kids.\n\n  What does it mean in some districts? It means a third of their \nbudget, gone. Can you raise that much revenue in a local area? Probably \nnot. So the reality of what we are doing is important, it is very \nnecessary, and I thank my colleague from Oregon for persisting in \nworking with us on this formula and developing what is a new approach, \nprobably more balanced and sustainable in the long run than what the \nold, original bill was, in recognition that times have changed and we \nneed to adjust and change to them.\n  Let me close with this one thought--48 million kids and their \neducation. That need has not changed, and that is why we are on the \nfloor of the Senate today insisting that this be a part of this \nsupplemental emergency funding program to assure the stability of those \nrural school districts and those rural counties.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding to me, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon has a \nlittle over 6 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Idaho for \nan excellent assessment of where we are now, both with respect to the \nneed here and our bipartisan amendment.\n  Here is what it is going to come down to, colleagues. There are going \nto be two different approaches. One is offered by the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, the other is a bipartisan one offered by many Senators, \nand I and Senator Craig have outlined it. Ours is supported by the \ngroups that have the most expertise in this area: the National \nAssociation of Counties, educators, labor organizations, and those who \nare on the ground.\n  The Senator from North Carolina seeks to dictate from Washington, DC, \nhow this program would operate. I will just say to the Senate, it seems \nto me what is best for Ashville, NC, may not be best for Amity, OR. \nLet's make sure these local communities have the freedom to make \nchoices, make judgments with respect to essential services in the law \nenforcement area and in the roads area. I pointed out yesterday that if \nthe approach offered by the Senator from North Carolina were to \nprevail, we couldn't, for example, do upkeep of rural roads, which get \nvery snowy in the winter. If we don't make improvements in them, the \nkids aren't even going to get to the schools, which is the point my \ncolleague from Idaho has mentioned as well.\n  As Senators think about this, I would like to also stress that this \nis not some kind of welfare program. I know many Senators are still not \nup on all the details. They do not live and breathe this subject on a \ndaily basis as Senator Craig and I do, but these are not handout \npayments. This is not welfare. This is part of a 100-year deal which \ncame about when the Federal forest system was created.\n  As we move on our side to the end of our presentation, I would like \nfor folks to understand what the stakes are in rural communities and \ngive some accounts from my State that are very similar to what Senators \nare hearing from officials in their States.\n  In my State, for example, the sheriff of Grants Pass--and I was \nrecently there for a community meeting--told me that without county \npayments funding, he may have to call out the National Guard to protect \npublic safety. The approach that is offered by the Senator from North \nCarolina wouldn't make it possible for those local law enforcement \nofficials to be on the front lines in terms of fighting crime, in terms \nof fighting meth, which is a scourge in so many communities across our \ncountry.\n  The county commissioners of Curry County, a beautiful community on \nthe Oregon coast, report that without county payments funding, they may \nhave no choice but to dissolve their county altogether. They have \nalready begun discussions with our State about dissolving the county. \nYou can be sure if county payments funding is not available, those \ndiscussions will continue and, in my view, based on a recent community \nmeeting there, I am of the view that their county may not survive.\n  Local officials in Coos County, just at the prospect of losing county \npayment funds, have already been releasing prisoners. So when people \ntalk about what this issue can mean and what it really comes down to in \nlocal communities, this isn't an abstract issue in Coos County, OR. \nThey have released prisoners--they have released prisoners--and they \nare going to lay off people who have had 25 years of service in that \ncommunity. There are reports in the newspaper that they have already \nbeen terminated from their jobs, and I believe that we are going to \nsee, in other communities across this country, similar problems.\n  I understand my friend from Idaho would like me to yield to him, and \nI am happy to do so.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for \nyielding for a moment, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter from the National Association of Counties \nsupporting the new version of what we call Wyden-Craig, and also the \nNational Governors Association and its support, and a good, balanced \nobservation of the difference between the Wyden amendment as offered \nand what the Senator from North Carolina is offering.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                                  of Counties,\n\n                                                   March 27, 2007.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Larry E. Craig,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Wyden and Craig: On behalf of the National \n     Education Association, the American Association of School \n     Administrators and the National Association of Counties we \n     thank you for your leadership in developing the amendment to \n     H.R. 1591 to reauthorize the secure rural schools and \n     community self-determination program and to provide funding \n     for the payments in lieu of taxes program.\n       We understand that Senator Burr intends to offer an \n     amendment to your amendment which would divert increases \n     realized by counties under your amendment to be used solely \n     for education. While well-intentioned, we fear the Burr \n     amendment is ill-conceived and would result in negative \n     consequences.\n       The Burr amendment requires ``new money'' to be spent on \n     education. This would deny communities and their elected \n     leaders to set their own priorities, superimposing a \n     Washington, DC, one-size-fits-all mandate on those rural \n     forest counties already severely restrained by the presence \n     of tax-exempt federal land.\n       Further, it appears that the Burr amendment would shift the \n     hard-won increase to\n\n[[Page S3988]]\n\n     PILT funding offered by the Wyden-Craig amendment away from \n     the counties' general funds to schools, which was never the \n     purpose of the PILT Act.\n       We also are concerned that the Burr amendment interferes \n     with the authority states have had since 1908 to allocate \n     forest reserve funds--authority explicitly and deliberately \n     retained by Congress in Title I of the Secure Rural Schools \n     and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. Congress should \n     not upend a 100-year old precedent that has served the forest \n     counties and schools well.\n       Finally, as you know all too well, your amendment is the \n     result of months, if not years, of dialogue and discussion, \n     among all the stakeholders. It represents a carefully \n     calibrated compromise which should be respected by the \n     Senate.\n       Please urge your colleagues on our behalf to reject the \n     Burr amendment.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                      Larry Naake,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                               September 19, 2006.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist, Senator Reid, Speaker Hastert, and \n     Representative Pelosi:\n       We write to urge reauthorization this Congress of Public \n     Law 106-393, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\n     Determination Act. This extremely successful law sunsets at \n     the end of September 2006. Failure to reauthorize this law by \n     passing either H.R. 517 or S. 267 would be a significant blow \n     to over 800 counties in 42 states that depend on the program \n     to fund their schools, roads, forest improvement projects and \n     other essential services.\n       P.L. 106-393 maintains a congressionally approved \n     arrangement to share revenue generated from our national \n     forests with the rural counties that play host to these \n     federal lands. Without reauthorization, rural forest \n     dependent communities across the nation will lose over $400 \n     million annually. This economic loss will be devastating to \n     the economy and spirit of rural America, as well as to the \n     timber, mining and recreation industries.\n       Beyond the revenue sharing provisions of P.L. 106-393, the \n     law augments federal and non-federal wildfire management, \n     habitat improvement and watershed restoration. Through the \n     work of citizen-based Resource Advisory Committees, over 2500 \n     projects have been completed on federal lands and not one has \n     been appealed or litigated. Many of these projects leverage \n     the federal dollars to obtain matching private, county and \n     state dollars to conduct a range of essential federal forest \n     management activities, such as necessary fuel reduction to \n     protect our national forests from major fires.\n       If Congress is unable to adopt a comprehensive \n     reauthorization of the program, we urge at a minimum that \n     funding for the program be extended for at least one year to \n     provide adequate time to build a consensus supporting a \n     longer-term solution.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr.,\n       Chair, Natural Resources Committee.\n     Governor Bill Richardson,\n       Vice Chair, Natural Resources Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                                   March 28, 2007.\n     YES on Wyden Amendment--NO on Burr Amendment\n       We understand that Senator Burr intends to offer an \n     amendment to the Wyden-Craig amendment which would divert \n     increases realized by counties under Wyden-Craig amendment to \n     be used solely for education. While no doubt well-\n     intentioned, we fear the Burr amendment is ill-conceived and \n     would result in negative consequences.\n       The Burr amendment requires ``new money'' to be spent on \n     education. While it sounds fine at first, this would deny \n     communities and their elected leaders the ability to set \n     their own priorities, superimposing a Washington, DC, one-\n     size-fits-all mandate on those rural forest counties already \n     severely restrained by the presence of tax-exempt federal \n     land.\n       We also are concerned that the Burr amendment interferes \n     with the authority states have had since 1908 to allocate \n     forest reserve funds--authority explicitly and deliberately \n     retained by Congress in Title I of the Secure Rural Schools \n     and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. Congress should \n     not upend a 100-year old precedent that has served the forest \n     counties and schools well.\n       Finally, as you know all too well, the Wyden-Craig \n     amendment is the result of months, if not years, of dialogue \n     and discussion, among all the stakeholders. It represents a \n     carefully calibrated compromise which should be respected by \n     the Senate.\n       Please support the Wyden-Craig amendment and oppose the \n     Burr amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Larry Naake,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has a minute and a \nhalf.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think the Senate has had a chance--and I \nthank particularly my friend from Idaho for coming to the floor today--\nto get a sense of what this issue is all about. I close by saying that \nSenator Craig and I and all those who have been involved in this issue \nunderstand that as a result of this updated, modernized approach to the \nSecure Rural Schools Act, we are going to make sure the rural \ncommunities of this country can survive and help them make a transition \ninto other areas.\n  Senator Craig and I held many hearings and have heard from rural \ncommunities about how they would like to have very strong thinning \nprograms. This is something you don't know a whole lot about in \nBaltimore, Mr. President, but we have a lot of overstocked stands in \nour part of the country. If you don't thin them out, it makes for a big \nfire risk. If you thin them out, you bring the communities together--\nlabor folks, environmentalists, and others--and you deal with the fire \nrisk and get the material to the mill. Plus you put people to work.\n  Senator Craig and I and others on our committee are prepared to have \nthose kinds of programs. However, if these rural communities can't \nsurvive, and I am of the view that many of them won't without this \namendment, then we are not in a position to look at the next steps, \nwhich are approaches like I have outlined for thinning and biomass, \nwhere we take the woody waste off the forest floor, which makes for \nclean energy. Senator Craig and I have heard a great deal of testimony \nabout that.\n  I hope our colleagues will support the bipartisan amendment that \nSenator Craig and I have talked about this morning, along with 17 of \nour colleagues, and reject the Burr amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 697, as Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification to \namendment No. 697, which is filed at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Hearing no objection, the amendment \nis so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF CAPABILITIES OF THE IRAQI \n                   SECURITY FORCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The responsibility for Iraq's internal security and \n     halting sectarian violence must rest primarily with the \n     Government of Iraq, relying on the Iraqi Security Forces \n     (ISF).\n       (2) In quarterly reports to Congress, and in testimony \n     before a number of congressional committees, the Department \n     of Defense reported progress towards training and equipping \n     Iraqi Security Forces; however, the subsequent performance of \n     the Iraqi Security Forces has been uneven and occasionally \n     appeared inconsistent with those reports.\n       (3) On November 15, 2005, President Bush said, ``The plan \n     [is] that we will train Iraqi troops to be able to take the \n     fight to the enemy. And as I have consistently said, as the \n     Iraqis stand up, we will stand down''.\n       (5) On January 10, 2007, the President announced a new \n     strategy, which consists of three basic elements: diplomatic, \n     economic, and military; the central component of the military \n     element being an augmentation of the present level of the \n     U.S. military forces with more than 20,000 additional U.S. \n     military troops to Iraq to ``work alongside Iraqi units and \n     be embedded in their formations. Our troops will have a well-\n     defined mission: to help Iraqis clear and secure \n     neighborhoods, to help them protect the local population, and \n     to help ensure that the Iraqi forces left behind are capable \n     of providing the security that Baghdad needs''.\n       (6) The President said on January 10, 2007, that ``I've \n     made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders \n     that America's commitment is not open-ended'' so as to dispel \n     the contrary impression that exists.\n       (7) The latest National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on \n     Iraq, entitled ``Prospects for Iraq's Stability: A \n     Challenging Road Ahead,'' released in January 2007, found: \n     ``If strengthened Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), more loyal to \n     the government and supported by Coalition forces, are able to \n     reduce levels of violence and establish more effective \n     security\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\n     for Iraq's population, Iraqi leaders could have an \n     opportunity to begin the process of political compromise \n     necessary for longer term stability, political progress, and \n     economic recovery''.\n       (8) The NIE also stated that ``[d]espite real improvements, \n     the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF)--particularly the Iraqi \n     police--will be hard pressed in the next 12-18 months to \n     execute significantly increased security responsibilities''.\n       (9) The current and prospective readiness of the ISF is \n     critical to (A) the long term stability of Iraq, (B) the \n     force protection of U.S. forces conducting combined \n     operations with the ISF; and (C) the scale of U.S. forces \n     deployed to Iraq.\n       (b) Independent Assessment of Capabilities of Iraqi \n     Security Forces.--\n       (1) In general.--Of the amoung appropriated or otherwise \n     made available for the Department of Defense, $750,000 is \n     provided to commission an independent, private-sector entity, \n     which operates as a 501(c)(3) with recognized credentials and \n     expertise in military affairs, to prepare an independent \n     report assessing the following:\n       (A) The readiness of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) to \n     assume responsibility for maintaining the territorial \n     integrity of Iraq, denying international terrorists a safe \n     haven, and bringing greater security to Iraq's 18 provinces \n     in the next 12-18 months, and bringing an end to sectarian \n     violence to achieve national reconciliation .\n       (B) The training; equipping; command, control and \n     intelligence capabilities; and logistics capacity of the ISF.\n       (C) The likelihood that, given the ISF's record of \n     preparedness to date, following years of training and \n     equipping by US forces, the continued support of US troops \n     will contribute to the readiness of the ISF to fulfill the \n     missions outlined in subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 120 days after passage of this \n     Act, the designated private sector entity shall provide an \n     unclassified report, with a classified annex, containing its \n     findings, to the House and Senate Committees on Armed \n     Services, Appropriations, Foreign Relations, and \n     Intelligence.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 716\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I would ask that the \nChair alert me when I have 3 minutes remaining on my 15 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I want to make two points right up front. The first \npoint is that I support the Wyden bill. I think if you listen to the \ndebate, you would think I am urging my colleagues not to extend this \nprogram. North Carolina is 25 percent national land. We benefit from \nit.\n  The second point is that I have tremendous respect for Senator Wyden \nand for Senator Craig, and the realities are that if you take \neverything that was said at face value, one of two things exists: \neither we are stretching the truth or we haven't read my amendment \nbecause there is no way for my amendment, which deals only with title I \nof Forest Service payments, to affect law enforcement. Title I of the \nForest Service payments specifically says, since 1908, when it was \ncreated, that it can be used for schools or roads.\n  What does my amendment do? It is very simple. There are three \npayments the Wyden bill addresses: Forest Service payments, BLM land, \nand payments in lieu of taxes. Within the framework of the Forest \nService payment there are three titles: title I, which is schools and \nroads; title II, which is forestry programs and others; and title III, \nwhich is sheriff's search and rescue, law enforcement.\n  What does my amendment do? My amendment says simply all the new money \nthat goes to title I, schools and roads, which is an increase of \napproximately $177 million since it was reauthorized in 2000--title I \nhad $300 million in 2000; fiscal year 2007 is projected to be $477 \nmillion--so $177 million of new money shall be devoted, 80 to 85 \npercent, to schools.\n  My good friend from Oregon said the issue is survival. I would say he \nis correct. I agree with him. More than 40 percent of America's schools \nare in rural areas, and approximately 30 percent of all students attend \nthose rural schools. The Senator from Idaho said 8 million kids. To be \nsure, our rural schools face unique challenges. Often their geographic \nisolation makes it difficult for teachers to access professional \ndevelopment opportunities. It is often difficult for rural schools to \nrecruit and retain high-quality, gifted teachers.\n  Additionally, it is also often difficult for high school students in \nrural areas to access the advanced placement programs that students in \nurban areas have access to, which sets them on a course ahead of other \nstudents for higher education. Nationally, one-third of our students \nwho enter high school in the ninth grade drop out before they receive a \nhigh school diploma. If this were a disease in America, it would be \ncalled an epidemic. If there were a disease in America, we would take \nFederal funds, State funds, local funds, and we would focus them to try \nto solve the problem.\n  Here we have an opportunity. We are not stealing any money. We are \nnot changing the 1908 agreement. But as we plus up the money, all I am \nsaying to my colleagues is, shouldn't we take the $177 million of new \nmoney and shouldn't we devote it to education? Shouldn't we say to \nthese 8 million kids and their families, in 40 percent of America's \nschools: You know what. We are going to give you extra funds to address \nthe geographical challenges you are faced with because you happen to be \nlocated in rural America. It affects North Carolina just as it does \nIdaho and just as it does Oregon.\n  As I said, in 1908, Congress first passed this bill and required that \n25 percent of the revenues derived from national forest lands be paid \nto States. I am not trying to change that. I want to make sure that all \nof these payments--BLM payments, payments in lieu of taxes, Forest \nService payments--go. I don't want to get into title III, where law \nenforcement is affected. I don't want to get into title II, where \nforestry programs and forestry management are affected. I do believe, \nhowever, that we can look at the challenges that we are faced with and \nsay: If we are going to put new money into it, why don't we put 80 \npercent of it in education, the No. 1 challenge we have in America \ntoday.\n  I don't have any statements in support of my amendment. As a matter \nof fact, yesterday, the National Education Association sent out an e-\nmail alert to Senators warning them of this amendment. It basically \nsaid that a potential amendment would be offered by an unnamed \nSenator--they knew exactly who I was--that would divert funds away from \nthe Secure Rural Schools Community Self-Determination Act. We urge you \nto oppose any such amendment.\n  I am beginning to figure out what is wrong with education. We are \nletting other people influence what we do, people who do not care \nwhether we get our kids educated. Here is the National Education \nAssociation, the labor union of teachers, the ones who are supposed to \nbe most concerned about our kids. Here is an amendment that puts $177 \nmillion into rural schools in America, and they are telling everybody \nto vote against it. Aren't they the ones who are supposed to stand up \nfor our kids?\n  The ones who need to stand up for our kids are Members of this \ninstitution. They need to listen to the parents or these kids back at \nhome and not listen to the organization that says they represent \nteachers and children that, frankly, when offered more money--it \ndoesn't disrupt anything--they say oppose it.\n  The information contained in the NEA's e-mail is blatantly false. I \nam not trying to do anything to ensure anything other than 80 percent \nof new money, $177 million, goes, 80 percent, to schools. As a matter \nof fact, if you do the math, it means there is more money in 2007--\nwhere the other 20 percent is dedicated to roads--than there was under \nthe 2000 reauthorization of this program. So, in fact, communities that \nare affected are going to have more money to put into roads. But, you \nknow, an amazing thing is going to exist. They are also going to have \nmore money to put into schools, exactly where I think we need to go.\n  One can look at the history of how this money has been spent. It \nmight give you an indication as to why there is opposition and concern. \nOregon, which will receive over $300 million, spends almost all of its \nmoney on roads. In 2004, Oregon spent $433 per student, compared to \n$7,388 per mile of road, out of title I, the Rural Schools Act. Let me \nsay that again: $433 per student, compared to $7,388 per mile of roads.\n  Idaho spends almost 10 times the amount it spends on roads to what it \nspends on education, out of this program. Maine will see its share of \nfunding increase from $40,000 per year to almost $1 million when this \nis reauthorized, and I support its reauthorization.\n\n[[Page S3990]]\n\nBut in 2004, Maine spent only $4.12 out of this program, per student, \ncompared to almost $700 per mile of road.\n  There are some successes, though. Alaska dedicates all its title I \nmoney to public schools, about $10 million in 2006. If this bill is \nreauthorized, Alaska will receive almost $20 million. That will double \nthe amount that Alaska invests in its rural schools through the same \nprogram that the National Education Association says would be \ndevastating to the education of our children in this country.\n  As a matter of fact, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Vermont, and \nVirginia commit 100 percent of their money to education.\n  I am not here amending the legislation to say you have to spend the \n100 percent. I am not here taking title I in total and saying let's \nchange the formula for the entire thing. All I am saying is, if we are \ngoing to put new money in it--and we are putting new money in--why not \ntake the bump-up of money and say, with what we are faced in this \ncountry, with only 70 percent of our kids graduating with a high school \ndiploma, on time, maybe we ought to try to address that. It certainly \nis higher in rural America than it is in urban America.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BURR. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator quoted States that, by the action of their \nlegislatures, directed full amounts to education. I understand in the \nSenator's State that is also true, 100 percent.\n  Mr. BURR. That is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. So what does the Senator's formula do to his State \nlegislature's allocation of money? Does it cut it back, adjust it or \nchange it?\n  Mr. BURR. No, it has no effect.\n  Mr. CRAIG. So, in other words, the impact the Senator is advocating \nnationwide already happens in his State?\n  Mr. BURR. That is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. And States have that option, if they so choose, based on a \nState decision as to the importance of it rated as compared to public \nrural schools.\n  Mr. BURR. The Senator is correct. The Senator's point is I am taking \npower away from the decisions of the local community. The Senator is \nright. I make no bones about it. I plead guilty. I wish they were as \nconcerned about their children's education as I am.\n  I have a school system where the graduation rate this year was 46 \npercent. The amazing thing is nobody has been fired. As a matter of \nfact, nobody is outraged at it. Today's jobs that we create in the 21st \ncentury require a different level of education for our children. If you \nare not competitive--you will not be invited for an interview if, in \nfact, you do not have a high school diploma.\n  The reality is, here is one little way we can have an impact on it, a \nlittle way that doesn't cost anybody anything because, as I said, this \nis all new money, from 2000 when it was at its peak. That is because, I \nremind everybody, in 2000 this was a 7-year program that was set to \nsunset, to go away. It was going to be no more. This was the adjustment \nperiod for all the States, including North Carolina, that received \nFederal money.\n  It is not going away. We are going to reauthorize it until 2012, and \nin 2012 it will be reauthorized until 2020, and the likelihood is the \nmoney will go up every year.\n  Our responsibility is, is the taxpayer money being used in a way that \nhas a positive effect on the communities with Federal money? All I am \nsaying is, as we put new money in, maybe we ought to have some Federal \nhand in saying let's focus it where we have a cancer. That cancer is in \neducation. If we can't raise the graduation rate from 70 percent to 100 \npercent, we have individuals who come into our system incapable of \ncompeting for a job.\n  This is a very simple decision for Members of the Senate. I am sad \ntoday to tell you I do not expect to win on my amendment. Some will say \nI have tried to undo 100 years of public policy. I have changed the \nnext 100 years, possibly.\n  They say I have trampled on States' rights by choosing how they pay \nfor it. I am guilty. I admit it. Why? Because of our children. Our \nchildren's future is important. If it were not, we wouldn't be good \nparents. I am convinced this can have a small but a positive impact on \nrural schools and the education of our kids in rural communities. I \nurge my colleagues to consider supporting my amendment, which will, in \nfact, alter in a very small way the impact of the total Wyden \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the debate \ntime on the two amendments--the Wyden amendment, the bipartisan \namendment and the Burr amendment--be extended until 11 a.m. and that \nthe time be equally divided, which would mean, I think, we would have \n10 minutes on our side so that I and Senator Craig would continue this \ndiscussion and then the distinguished Senator from North Carolina would \nhave 10 minutes as well. I make that unanimous consent request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to continue the discussion on the \npoint made by our friend from North Carolina. He is going to be the \nranking member on the forestry subcommittee. He and I are going to sit \nnext to each other for a great many hours during the course of this \nsession of the Senate. I know there are going to be many times when we \nagree because that has certainly been the case during our long years of \nservice, both in the House and it is now an honor to serve with him in \nthe Senate.\n  I wish to pick up on a couple of points. Senator Craig, in the very \nimportant discussion he had with the Senator from North Carolina, \npointed out that North Carolina already spends every dollar of their \ncounty payments money. The distinguished Senator from North Carolina \nindicated his concern about the 40-percent graduation rate in one of \nhis school districts. But the amendment offered by the Senator from \nNorth Carolina will not provide an additional dollar for that school \ndistrict because under his State statute, every dollar of county \npayments his State gets already has to go to schools, and the amendment \nwould not change that.\n  I think this has been a very instructive discussion. As Senators \nconsider the next 15 or 20 minutes of this debate, I want to come back \nto where the organizations that are most intimately involved in this \nprogram, on a day-to-day basis, stand.\n  The Senator from North Carolina made mention of our support from \nlabor. We are very proud to have a strong cross-section of labor groups \nthat are aligned with our proposal. But in addition, the support from \nthe National Association of Counties and the National Governors \nAssociation for our bipartisan effort is particularly important. I wish \nto read a little bit from the National Association of Counties' letter \nto myself and Senator Craig. It says, with respect to Senator Burr--and \nthe National Association of Counties does not talk about anonymous \nSenators. They are very much aware of who is involved in this debate. \nThe National Association of Counties wrote:\n\n       While well-intentioned, we fear the Burr amendment is ill-\n     conceived and would result in negative consequences.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The Burr amendment requires ``new money'' to be spent on \n     education. This would deny communities and their elected \n     leaders to set their own priorities, superimposing a \n     Washington, DC, one-size-fits-all mandate on those rural \n     forest counties already severely restrained by the presence \n     of tax-exempt federal land.\n\n  This is a particularly important point and a very telling one about \nthis debate. I think the Senator from North Carolina and I have been in \nscores of discussions over the years where the charge always was it was \nthe Democrats who were coming up with this ``big Government, run from \nWashington, DC,'' kind of approach. Here we are with a bipartisan \namendment that I, as a Democratic Senator, spent a lot of time talking \nabout with local communities, and the counties say they\n\n[[Page S3991]]\n\nfavor our approach because it does give them the flexibility on the \nground--in Asheville, NC, and Amity, OR, across the country, to make \nthe choices that are best for them rather than to have somebody inside \nthe beltway take out a cookie cutter and stamp all these programs as if \none size fits all. That point in the National Association of Counties' \nletter strikes me as extremely important as well.\n  The counties also go on to say:\n\n       . . . .it appears that the Burr amendment would shift the \n     hard-won increase to PILT funding [the payment in lieu of \n     taxes program offered by the Wyden Craig amendment] away from \n     the counties' general funds to schools, which was never the \n     purpose of the PILT Act.\n\n  I say to my colleague, we are going to hear a lot of testimony about \nthis in our forestry subcommittee as well. The changes in the PILT \nProgram, in particular, so that every county with Federal land can get \na boost, are going to be especially helpful as we make this transition.\n  Mr. BURR. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Of course.\n  Mr. BURR. Does the Senator agree with the letter from the \ncommissioners that I affect the PILT payments in my amendment?\n  Mr. WYDEN. My understanding is that the Senator's amendment does not \naffect it.\n  Mr. BURR. Does or does not?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Does not.\n  Mr. BURR. So the letter and the accusation the Senator received from, \nI think, the counties, is, in fact, inaccurate?\n  Mr. WYDEN. My sense says the county folks had some difficulty \nfollowing the Senator's amendment as it went through its evolution. But \nwhat we do know is our amendment clearly protects the PILT funding, and \nthat is why it is preferable on all counts.\n  Now, continuing with what the counties have had to say: We are also \nconcerned that the Burr amendment interferes with the authority States \nhave had since 1908 to allocate forest reserves funds, authority \nexplicitly and deliberately retained by Congress in title 1 of the \nSecure Rural Schools and Communities Self-Determination Act.\n  This point from the counties is especially critical because it goes \nto the 100-year obligation with respect to county payments. We can \ndebate who has better ideas about PILT. We think we do. That is why so \nmany Senators have been attracted to our proposal, because of the \nadditional support for PILT. But what the counties go on to say here is \nthey are concerned about the 100-year precedent with respect to Federal \nforest systems.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina has been very \ngracious. We are dividing the time. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Oregon has 3 \nminutes 10 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time to the \nchairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, a \ncosponsor of the amendment, and I thank him for his many hours of \nsupport in putting this together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and congratulate \nhim on his leadership on this issue. His amendment is well designed and \nmeritorious. I urge all colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I wish to speak about why I think this is so important to our rural \ncounties. I do think the legislation is important because it lays out a \nperiod of years during which counties will know they have a set amount \nof money coming in to assist with the various responsibilities they \nhave put upon them.\n  This amendment also, of course, involves a full funding of the \npayment in lieu of taxes, which is extremely important to many of the \ncounties in my State, particularly. This payment in lieu of taxes is \ndesigned to provide some funding to those counties that have lost their \ntax base by virtue of the Federal Government owning so much of the land \nin those counties.\n  Both programs were authorized through the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, and the committee has remained active on both issues \nin recent years. With regard to the Secure Rural Schools, or ``county \npayments'', program, we have held a number of oversight and legislative \nhearings during the last couple of years. Accordingly, I would like to \nbriefly explain some of the key changes that this amendment makes to \nthe original program.\n  The most significant change is in the formula. The new formula has \nthree components: the original formula, the number of qualifying acres \nof Federal land, and per capita personal income. The mathematics of the \nformula are rooted at the county level, and the ultimate payments are \ndetermined by calculating what would be each participating county's \nportion of the total annual funding for the program. As a result, \nunlike the original formula, the new formula responds to the annual \nfunding amount, permitting an orderly phase-down of the total annual \nfunding levels.\n  The legislative text memorializes the component of the original \nformula at the county level in the definition of ``base share'' in \nparagraphs (2)(B)(i) and (9)(B)(i) of section 3. In developing the \nformula, we looked to existing data from the Federal agencies, \nrecognizing that the specific data may change as a result of updating \nor correction. For the Forest Service, paragraph (2)(B)(i) of section 3 \ndescribes what the Forest Service referred to as the ``potential county \nshare'' when it calculated payment amounts under the original formula \non March 1, 2002. For the Bureau of Land Management, paragraph \n(9)(B)(i) of section 3 describes what the BLM referred to as ``payment \namounts to each eligible county'' on its November 14, 2002, \ncertification to the Treasury Department of payments made under the \nSecure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. The \nper capita personal income data was gathered from the Bureau of \nEconomic Analysis' Regional Economic Accounts, Table CA1-3, 030.\n  Total funding for the program would be gradually reduced to \napproximately 72 percent of the fiscal year 2006 level by the end of \nthe 5-year reauthorization. During the first 4 years of the \nreauthorization, additional funds would be provided to the uniquely \naffected States of Washington, California, and Oregon to ensure that \nthey can make a reasonable transition to the new funding levels under \nthe new formula. For fiscal year, 2007, the transition funding would \nprovide the three States an amount equal to last year's levels, and \nthen their total county payments funding would be reduced by 10 percent \nannually through 2010. Total funding levels in each of those States \nwould be determined under the new formula in 2011. If counties that \nreceived county payments in fiscal year 2006 decided to optout of the \ncounty payments program, then those counties would instead receive the \npayment amounts required by the 1908 or 1937 acts and the county \npayments funding to their States during that fiscal year would be \nreduced by their corresponding share of the fiscal year 2006 county \npayments funding.\n  The amendment also focuses the county payments funding on resource \nadvisory committee, ``RAC'', collaboration, which was one of the most \nsuccessful aspects of the original law. Most counties are required to \nspend at least 13 percent of their total county payments program \nfunding on special projects on federal land--unless they choose to \nforego that portion of the funding. Exceptions have been made where \nexperience has shown that the 15-20 percent of total program funding \navailable for special projects on Federal land, under title II, may be \ninadequate.\n  As recommended by an in-depth study of RACs under the county payments \nprogram, we have made a few changes to the RAC representation. The \neditions allow some key interest groups that currently are not \nadequately represented to participate on RACs. They also provide \ncommunities with some flexibility where existing requirements were \nunnecessarily difficult or awkward to fulfill.\n  As discussed in the study, in a number of cases, the Federal land \nmanagement issues in any particular region simply were not relevant to \na couple of the interest groups required to be represented under the \noriginal law. For example, while wild horse and burro interest groups \nare key stakeholders on many RACs, there also are many RACs in areas of \nthe country with no wild\n\n[[Page S3992]]\n\nhorses or burros. In such cases, the study found that some counties \nsimply could not find individuals willing to serve on RACs that met the \nletter and spirit of the existing criteria.\n  None of the editions exclude any of the interest groups currently \nrepresented on RACs, and the Secretaries retain appointment authority. \nAs a result, the modest expansion should neither disadvantage any group \ncurrently participating on RACs nor disrupt in any way the \ncollaboration on RACs. To the contrary, it should improve the \ncollaboration by ensuring that RACs are adequately staffed with the \nappropriate interest groups.\n  County funding under title III has been restricted and focused on \nprograms that indirectly benefit public land management. In addition, \nprovisions have been added to title III to encourage compliance with \nits terms and greater awareness of the counties' efforts by Federal \nland managers.\n  Finally, a degree of stability for revenue sharing payments to \ncounties is provided under the amendment. Stabilizing payments is one \nof the primary purposes of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\nDetermination Act, but as the recent experience with its expiration in \n2006 exemplifies, a degree of stability remains necessary over the \nlongterm. Section 3 of the amendment provides for 25 percent payments \nto be distributed based on a 7-year rolling average. This will ensure \nthat counties receive the same level of overall payments while at the \nsame time reducing to a significant degree the sometimes dramatic \nannual fluctuations of Federal payments that make county budgeting \ndifficult.\n  By ensuring full funding for PILT, annual fluctuations in those \npayments also will be reduced through 2012. PILT also is a crucial part \nof ensuring an orderly transition for the States of California, Oregon, \nand Washington. And finally, full funding for PILT will provide a more \nequitable level of support to those counties with Federal land that \ndoes not qualify for the county payments program.\n  In all, the amendment provides for more secure rural schools in more \nStates and counties around the country, healthier National Forests for \nall Americans to enjoy, and the foundation for a legacy of public lands \ncollaboration that we hope will provide for community, economic, and \nenvironmental benefits for decades to come.\n  Let me also speak briefly about the amendment my friend from North \nCarolina has offered to insist and to require, I believe, 80 percent of \nthe funds to be used for schools. It will be a substantial mistake to \nadopt that amendment, because it is a one-size-fits-all solution, when \nwe have very different circumstances in each State.\n  For example, in my State, we have what we call an education \nequalization formula. That means the State takes credit for whatever \nthe counties were to put into education. So the effect of giving this \nmoney to the counties would be that the State would reduce its \ncontribution to the schools in that county by a proportionate amount or \nby 95 percent of that amount. This would not work in my State. It would \nnot have the intended effect of getting more money to the schools, \nwhich I know is the purpose the Senator from North Carolina has.\n  It is better to stick with the amendment Senator Wyden has crafted \nhere, and give the discretion to each State and each local community to \ndecide how to best spend those funds to meet the obligation they have \nto their constituents. That is the purpose of the legislation. That was \nthe original purpose of the county payments legislation, certainly the \noriginal purpose of the PILT legislation, as well. That is the best \nresult.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the Wyden amendment and will not \nsupport the Burr amendment. That is the best result for us. I hope that \nis the end result once the voting is concluded.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for a spirited debate, \nand before my colleague from New Mexico leaves, I want to make sure I \nhave the opportunity to share with him, because he did not hear the \nfirst part, that there are three funding pieces to this bill. I am \nsupportive of all three of them. It is the Forest Service payment, the \nBLM lands payment, and the payment in lieu of taxes.\n  My amendment affects one piece of one section, the Forest Service \npayment that is broken down into three titles: title 1, which is \ndesignated schools and roads; title 2, which goes to forestry programs \nand other management programs; and title 3, which goes to law \nenforcement search and rescue.\n  I do not affect title 2; I do not affect title 3. I only affect the \nnew funding in title 1. There is no county that will be affected on \nwhat they have received up until that point. But of the $177 million of \nnew money in title 1 of the Forest Service payment section only, he is \nexactly right. I would say 80 to no more than 85 percent has to go to \nthe schools. And if, in fact, New Mexico is structured in a way that \nwhen a county ups its investment the State decreases its investment in \neducation, he is exactly right, he would end up with no net gain.\n  That is where our problem is across the country, our students have no \nnet gain. We have been stuck in this rut and we will not do what it \ntakes to get out of it. Five years ago we passed No Child Left Behind. \nNationally we are making progress. We actually see the trend going up. \nWe see K-8 performing at math and science levels that, quite frankly, 5 \nyears ago we did not know if we could reach. It is not a plateau they \nhave gotten to; they are on the climb. We have challenged our \nelementary school students and they have responded, because we have \nmade a commitment we are going to put highly qualified teachers in \nclassrooms. We have made a commitment to them that we are going to \nprovide the flexibility of Federal money so they can decide how best to \nuse that so kids can learn.\n  In return, we are going to measure their progress. For the first \ntime, America now knows the progress our students make. Parents are no \nlonger reliant on the arbitrary A, B, C, D or, in some cases, pass-\nfail. Why is that important? It is important because we have got a 21st \ncentury economy. We are creating jobs that, quite frankly, without a \nhigh school diploma you are not competitive for.\n  My kids are still in college. I am fortunate in the fact that at \nleast the tools are available to them. But it is their choice now as to \nwhether they absorb it and use it. What about those kids who are still \nin K-8? Could this have an impact? Yes, it could have a real impact. It \nis not a whole lot of money. But when you move from, in Oregon I think, \n$433 per student, compared to $7,388 per mile, if you were to increase \nthat investment locally, I think it would affect the outcome.\n  What you would be looking at is the outcome. That is the whole spirit \nbehind No Child Left Behind. What is the result of K-8 not working? It \nis a 70-percent graduation rate, on time, of our high school students \n9-12 today.\n  As I said earlier, if this were a disease, we would call it an \nepidemic. We would send every Federal, State, and local resource to try \nto cure the problem. Well, here is one of those ways: We can say, with \nthe increased money, the $177 million worth of new money these counties \nhave never had, let's use 80 to 85 percent for schools.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Would the Senator from North Carolina yield?\n  Mr. BURR. I yield.\n  Mr. WYDEN. We continue to look at the language. I think it goes back \nto the reason the counties and the Governors were so troubled by it. \nWhere in my friend's amendment does it say it applies only to increases \nin funding? Because, as we read it, it would apply to all of the \nfunding in section (2) of the amendment, subsection (d) payments \nreceived by a State under subsection (a) and distributed to eligible \ncounties shall be only for public schools----\n  Mr. BURR. Reclaiming my time. I will say to the Senator, if for some \nreason it is not perfectly clear--and we have had the best legislative \nfolks in the Senate who wrote the amendment; I do not think they got it \nwrong, but if they did, it will change.\n  But the reality is, it is not going to pass and the Senator from \nOregon knows it is not going to pass, not because there are questions \non whether it is all title 1; it is not going to pass because they are \nnot willing to let the $177 million worth of new money be devoted to \neducation. It is not because of some technical problem we have with\n\n[[Page S3993]]\n\nmy amendment. The Senator's bill was awfully large, and there were \nstill changes being made to the bill yesterday. It was a moving target \nto try to figure out exactly how to do an amendment. The Senator may \nremember, yesterday it was a second-degree amendment, but to \naccommodate the majority leader, we decided to do it as a side-by-side, \nwhich meant I had to incorporate now my amendment into the Wyden bill. \nSo we have got a Wyden bill by itself, and a Wyden bill with this \nchange. What my colleagues are going to be asked to do is not to vote \nagainst Wyden; either way they vote, they get the Wyden bill. But if \nthey vote for the Wyden bill with the Burr amendment, they have now \nmade a commitment to education. They have now made a commitment to the \nchildren. They have now made a commitment to 40 percent of America's \nschools that are located in rural areas, 8 million kids. That is the \ndecision. It is very simple.\n  So it is not do we understand where it fits. Clearly since the \nSenator thought it applied to more, since the county letters he got \nthought it applied to payments in lieu of taxes, since Senator \nBingaman, when he came to the floor, was concerned about payments in \nlieu of taxes, we do not affect those. All we affect is title 1 of the \nForest Service payments that are already designated in roads or \nschools, and we do not affect what we have spent in the past, up to \nthat level. We only affect new dollars.\n  Of those new dollars, 80 to 85 percent has to go to education. So it \nmeans for your State, where it predominately goes for roads, they are \nnot disadvantaged. They are actually going to get 20 percent more for \nroads. They are just going to have to take 80 percent of the new money \nand make more of an investment than $433 per student.\n  It is simple for our colleagues. We are going to vote on this, I \nthink now the order calls for about 11:45 or 12 o'clock. I am not sure \nif it is going to be a series of three votes. I would encourage my \ncolleagues to vote for the Wyden amendment, but vote for the Wyden \namendment that has the Burr language in it, so that, in fact, we have a \ncommitment to our kids, their future, and their education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, when we debated the Senate budget \nresolution in committee and on the floor over the last few weeks, I \nraised a concern about the transparency of the budget. One of the \nproblems I pointed out was the over reliance of the budget resolution \non unspecified revenue raisers. As ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, I referred mainly to Finance Committee policy demands that \nweren't realistically reflected in the budget. I referred to currently \nexpiring tax, trade, and health and welfare spending provisions. The \nexpiring tax relief provisions within the first year of the budget \nresolution alone amount to $135 billion.\n  In discussing the budget, I also referred to the track record of the \nDemocratic leadership, while in the minority, of spending the same \nrevenue raising offsets over and over again. There is a clear risk of \nthis deceptive behavior having a real fiscal impact now that Democrats \nare in the majority. As has been proven over the last few weeks, the \nDemocratic majority can't reduce spending. So taxes are raised to pay \nfor more spending while the spending-driven deficit remains high.\n  What we have seen is an obsession by the Democratic leadership for \ngoing to the tax side of the ledger and gross up the spending side of \nthe ledger. Once again, spending wins out and the taxpayer loses.\n  Now, comes the Wyden-Craig amendment. It increases popular spending--\nin this case we are talking about rural schools--and uses revenue \nraisers to mask the deficit effect of the spending. The budget \nresolution contains 39 reserve funds that authorize new spending, paid \nfor with unspecified revenue raisers. This rural schools spending \nprogram is the subject of 1 of those 39 reserve funds. So, today, \nSenators Wyden and Craig go to the tax ledger and remove some of the \nwork product of the Finance Committee tax staff to use for their new \nspending program.\n  As ranking member of the Finance Committee, I view this effort as an \nintrusion on the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. During my \ntenure as chairman, I am pleased to say that this jurisdiction was \nprotected. I have indicated my concern to my friend, Chairman Baucus, \nthat this is the start to a slippery slope of erosion of our \ncommittee's jurisdiction.\n  We have seen that those who advocate new spending can't find a dollar \nof spending offset within a $2.7 trillion budget. From this fiscal \nbehavior, we can expect that the spending of these amendments will \ncontinue to be offset from the same pool of offsets. The Finance \nCommittee tax staff can't do the heavy lifting of finding offsets for \nevery new popular spending program.\n  By the terms of the Senate Democratic budget resolution, that pool of \noffsets has already been subscribed for expiring tax, trade, and health \nand welfare spending.\n  The Wyden-Craig amendment goes to part of the limited group of \noffsets and draws from previously passed Senate offsets and a small \ngroup of already identified tax gap offsets. These offsets are drawn \nfrom the limited group of $43 billion in revenue raising offsets I \nreferred to in my floor statements.\n  There is a new revenue raiser in the Wyden-Craig amendment. I support \nit. It would permit section 457 retirement plans to employ a Roth IRA \noption.\n  Some will recall from last year's tax reconciliation conference \nreport a similar proposal. The proposal permitted more taxpayers to \nconvert traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs. That proposal met with severe \ncriticism from the Democratic leadership, their allied liberal think \ntanks, and some in the east coast media who tend to be sympathetic to \nthe views of the Democratic leadership.\n  I am pleased to see the Democratic leadership has changed its mind. \nWith the Wyden amendment, and the Roth section 457 plan proposal, the \nDemocratic leadership is now on board with the merits of the Roth IRA \nconversion concept. It will be interesting to see if the liberal think \ntanks and east coast media are consistent critics or whether they have \nchanged their minds, now that this concept is employed by Senate \nDemocrats. I will be looking for their reaction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 716 \noffered by the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Burr, is modified to be \na first-degree amendment.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To reauthorize the secure rural schools and community self-\n determination program and to provide funding for the payments in lieu \n                           of taxes program.)\n\n       Beginning on page 75, strike line 25 and all that follows \n     through page 76, line 15, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2601.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, under the previous order, I believe I have \nseveral amendments pending. I rise to discuss those with my colleagues. \nI will call up several of them as I go along.\n  It is important for the American public to know what is going on. If \nwe go back to 2003, what we can see is a major growth in emergency \nspending. Why is that important? It is important because emergency \nspending is totally outside the budget parameters on which the Senate \nworks. Emergency spending doesn't count against any total cap on what \nour spending will be. It doesn't count against the budget deficit, and \nit doesn't count against the budget rules. We merely spend the money \noutside of any rules of control, and we charge it. We take a credit \ncard and we say: Kaching, grandchildren, you are up.\n  As my colleagues can see from this chart, from 2003, 2004, 2005, \n2006, to 2007, as the bill before us today, we see an average of over \n$100 billion a year, about $110 to $115 billion a year outside of a $3 \ntrillion budget. So no taxpayer dollars presently are going to go to \npay for any of this. What we are going to do is ask the Treasury to \nissue bonds and notes. Guess who will be redeeming those notes. Our \ngrandchildren. Who is at fault in all this? Partly the administration \nbecause part of this funding has been for a war that should have been \nbudgeted through the Defense appropriations bill. That will happen next \nyear. But the fact is, we can take $80 billion out of this across the \nyear and apply it to the war.\n  What about the other $30 billion every year on average that doesn't \nhave anything to do with the war and doesn't have anything to do with \nan emergency? Remember, this is supposedly emergency spending. How long \nhave we been in this war? Four years. There is nothing emergency about \nit. We know the spending. It should go through the regular process. Our \nbudget rules define ``emergency'' as something unforeseen, unexpected. \nWe have to question the intellectual honesty of our body when the $18.7 \nbillion that is added on to the defense request in this bill is deemed \nan emergency.\n  The first amendment I will talk about is $100 million that is an \nemergency to fund increased security at the conventions, both in \nMinneapolis-St. Paul and in Denver. We have known we were going to have \nconventions every 4 years for a long time. Never before have we funded \nthe security required for these conventions out of an emergency bill. \nSo in essence, what we are going to do is we are going to have two big \nparties and we are going to send the bill for those parties to our \ngrandkids.\n  The first amendment I have actually eliminates that $100 million. We \nhave plenty of time under the regular appropriations process with which \nto supply the money within the budget guidelines. Every billion we \nspend outside of the budget guidelines means that is another billion \nwhich is going to be spent inside, which means we are actually doubling \nthe spending. Something that should have been inside, now we are going \nto spend outside of the budget. We are going to charge it to our \nchildren, and then we are going to spend more money.\n  How did we get where we are? The important thing to look at as to how \nwe got where we are is to look at what has happened to Defense \nappropriations every year. There is a requirement that is asked for \nfrom the Pentagon in the budget. It is within our budget numbers. What \nhappens when it comes out of here? What happens is, it gets underfunded \nintentionally. Why does it get underfunded intentionally? So that we \ncan create, in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007, additional spending \ninside the budget, and then we come back and get the actual defense \nneeds in an emergency. It is a shell game that is being played on the \nAmerican public that says: We are going to underfund what we know we \nneed in defense. Then we know there is going to be an emergency \nsupplemental, and we will make up for that when the emergency \nsupplemental comes. But because we underfunded defense, we can \ntherefore spend the money somewhere else outside of the budget. It is a \ngame that we continue to play that is unfair to the American public.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 648\n\n  I call up amendment 648.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. COBURN. Amendment No. 648 removes $100 million. This is not about\n\n[[Page S4000]]\n\nbeing against security for people who are going to attend the \nconventions. It is ironic that the decisions which are made at the \nconventions will have already been made probably in February or March. \nBut we are going to charge the American taxpayers $100 million for \nsecurity outside of the budget. Who are we really charging? We are \ncharging our grandkids. This has never before happened. Always before, \nif we funded money for convention sites, we have done it within the \nbudget. So it isn't an emergency, and it is markedly unethical to take \nmoney that should be inside our budget and place it outside and ask our \ngrandchildren to pay for us to all have a party in August and \nSeptember.\n  H.R. 4613, the fiscal year Department of Defense appropriations bill, \nprovided $50 million for discretionary grants for this same purpose \nassociated with the 2004 nominating conventions. We did that in the \n2005 bill. We did it within the budget. We have done it before.\n  Let's talk about the criteria of what is an emergency: necessary, \nessential, and vital, plus sudden, quickly coming into being, not \nbuilding up over time, an urgent, pressing, compelling need requiring \nimmediate action, subject to unforeseen, totally unpredictable and \nunanticipated, not permanent and temporary nature. There is no question \nthe funding for the conventions for the Democratic and Republican \nparties does not meet any of those criteria. Yet here it is in the \nbill. Why do we find it in this bill? So we don't have to spend the \nmoney inside the budget limitations that are placed on Congress. Here \nis $100 million outside of that budget limitation that we are then \ngoing to spend, another $100 million, because we have not paid for this \none, and we should have paid for it within the budget.\n  This isn't sudden. It is not urgent. It is not pressing. It does not \nrequire immediate action, is not unforeseen, not unpredictable, and it \nwas not unanticipated. There have been nominating conventions since \n1832. The year 2008 will be the second Presidential election since the \n9/11 terrorist attack. There is no question that increased security is \nrequired. But this is the first time we have said it is an emergency. \nIt is like saying we don't know the census is coming in 2010. We will \nhave an emergency supplemental for the census. As a matter of fact, we \nhave done that before. The war on terror is an emergency. Having a \nparty for politicians and their political parties doesn't qualify.\n  We are going to have a vote on this amendment. I expect to lose the \nvote. But I also expect the American people will ask: Why in the world \nwould we be doing this? Why would we violate their good will by playing \ngames for the political parties? Why would we do that? It comes back to \nthe point of where we are in the Senate, why are we addressing this \nlegislation? Why is there $18.7 billion worth of additional items added \nto this bill other than to fund the Defense Department?\n  We will hear all sorts of answers: We need it. We didn't do it. We \nhave emergency agricultural appropriations in this bill.\n  Actually, I believe there is an emergency in farm country, and we \nought to be doing something about it. But we ought to be paying for it. \nI haven't yet talked to a farmer from Oklahoma who thinks his \ngrandchildren ought to be paying for us to do an emergency supplemental \nin terms of agriculture. They believe we ought to find it within.\n  The fact is, Senator Carper and I held 49 hearings in the last \nCongress and discovered over $200 billion of waste, fraud, abuse, or \nduplication within the discretionary budget. That is within $1 \ntrillion, 20 percent. Most Americans probably believe that. The problem \nis, most politicians don't have the nerve to challenge where that \nspending is because there is an interest group that wants it spent. \nThere is an interest group, and it is us. It is self-serving that we \nare going to spend $100 million on increased security for the \nconventions and not pay for it and spend that money inside the budget \non something else. Probably the greatest moral question is, Are we \ngoing to have a party on our unborn next generation?\n  They are going to be the ones who pay back this $100 million. It is \nnot going to be $100 million when they pay it back; it will probably be \n$500 million or $600 million by the time we get to paying it back with \nthe compound interest.\n  What would this $100 million do if we were not spending it on \nsecurity at party conventions? It would buy 31,797 sets of body armor. \nIt would uparmor 658 humvees. It would uparmor 529 ambulances, medic \ncarriers for the guys who are helping our guys in the field.\n  Instead, we are going to use a bill, intended to cover the cost of \nwinning the war, to protect our national security, fight the war on \nterrorism, to add $100 million to our national debt that already \nexceeds $8.7 trillion. We added $1,000 to that debt last year for every \nman, woman, and child. We added $1,000. If you pass this bill--\n``emergency''--what we are going to do is add another $400 for every \nman, woman, and child in this country--the debt just for this bill. So \nit ought to be about real emergencies.\n  Federal funding also is already planned for the conventions. The \nDepartment of Justice did not request this $100 million. The \nadministration budgeted $15 million for the Secret Service to provide \nthe security at these conventions. Each convention has been designated \nas a national security, special security event, making security \npersonnel eligible for other Federal tax dollars through grants to \ncover the expenses. Why are we doing it? There has not even been a \nsecurity plan for which we are throwing $100 million at formalized for \nthe conventions.\n  I believe if you are a young person in this country today, what we \nare doing on this bill, especially with this item, has to be \nheartbreaking. April 15 is coming up pretty soon. We all look at our \npay stubs and see what we are paying in Federal taxes. What you do not \nsee when you get that pay stub is how much additional you are going to \nowe at the end of the year because we were not responsible. We were not \nresponsible with the taxpayers' money. Yet we play all these shell \ngames of hiding money, underfunding defense so we can bring it back in \na supplemental, so we can spend money elsewhere rather than making the \ntough choices.\n  Let's read about what was in the news after the last conventions. It \nis pretty interesting to know. One hundred million dollars of your \nmoney for the following: USA Today reported the convention featured \nmore than 200 parties by corporations, lobbyists, trade groups, and \nother organizations. These were in addition to the high-dollar donor \nmeals, golf tournaments, sporting events held during the convention \nweek. Top sponsorship at these events can cost up to $250,000--golf \ntournaments, breakfast at Tiffany's, Yankee Stadium fundraisers, \nchampagne and cigar celebration, baseball games.\n  We are going to spend $100 million of our grandkids' money to protect \npoliticians while they have a party. To me, it is unconscionable. It is \neven more unconscionable to do it in this bill. There is nothing about \nthis that is an emergency. There is nothing about this that was not \nforeseen. There is nothing about this that was not anticipated. This is \na game.\n  The last election reminded us--my party--you cannot say one thing and \ndo another, except that is what we are seeing with this bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 649\n\n  Mr. President, I wish also to spend some time on amendment No. 649. \nOver the last 5 years, the University of Vermont has received $400 \nmillion in earmarks for things for that university. In this bill is an \nearmark for $2 million. The first thing we said is we are not going to \nhave earmarks that are not published: who put them in, who sponsored \nthem, and what they are for. This is an emergency bill. There is no \nquestion we ought to honor former Senator Jeffords. There is no \nquestion we ought to do that. But in an emergency bill that is unpaid \nfor, that does not have anything to do with fighting the war on terror, \nwe are going to send another $2 million to a university that has gotten \n$400 million over the last 5 years? This is not a place for it. It is \nnot the time for it. It is not the way to do it. Supposedly, we are \nfree of earmarks, and yet here is an earmark for which we do not have \nthe money. We are not going to be able to pay for it, even though the \nclaim is this is offset. It is offset with student loan management \nmoney. That is how they have offset it to say it does not\n\n[[Page S4001]]\n\ncost any money. Which is more important? More students getting loans \nand effective management so more people get student loans or giving \nanother $2 million to a university that has already gotten $400 million \nof the taxpayers' money? I do not think there is any question in the \naverage American's mind in regard to that.\n  Let me read what the University of Vermont has gotten: year 2000, $54 \nmillion for 201 different programs; year 2001, $60 million; year 2002, \n$69 million; year 2003, $76 million for 249 different programs; year \n2004, $70 million; year 2005, $68 million. There is a lot of money that \nhas already gone up there, a lot of it borrowed.\n\n  At the present time, the University of Vermont has an endowment of \n$282,594,000. Now, the interest on that, at 6 percent, gives you about, \noh, close to $15 million a year--just the interest off that endowment. \nI believe they have plenty of money to fund this chair to honor Senator \nJeffords.\n  The endowment grew 16 percent last year. Its growth last year was 20 \ntimes the amount of this earmark. Again, it is not unanticipated, \ncertainly not an emergency, certainly it is not something we have to do \nnow.\n  Again, is it necessary? Essential? Is it not merely useful or \nbeneficial? It is useful. It will be beneficial. Did the demand for \nthis quickly come into being? No. It was part of an earmark in the \nLabor-HHS bill that was not included in last year's appropriations. Is \nit urgent, pressing, and compelling, requiring immediate action? No. \nWas it unforeseen or unpredictable or unanticipated? Is it temporary in \nnature? No. It is not temporary. It is the start of many years of \ngiving $2 million a year on the same thing.\n  This project violates the Appropriations Committee's own earmark \nmoratorium. On December 11, Chairman Byrd and Congressman Obey \nannounced there would be no more congressional earmarks until the new \nrules were put in place to make the process more transparent and more \naccountable. Those rules are not in place. The transparency and \naccountability is not there. Yet we see an earmark.\n  Here is what the joint statement said:\n\n       We will place a moratorium on all earmarks until a reform \n     process is put in place. Earmarks included in this year's \n     House and Senate bills will be eligible for consideration in \n     the 2008 process subject to new standards for transparency \n     and accountability. We will work to restore an accountable, \n     above-board, transparent process for funding decisions and \n     put an end to the abuses that have harmed the credibility of \n     Congress.\n\n  More of the same. There is no end in sight. This earmark was \npreviously included in the report language--not the law, in the report \nlanguage--for the fiscal year 2007 Labor-HHS appropriations bill. That \nwas on page 251 of that report. It is the first of the earmarks to be \nresurrected from last year.\n  I might say as an aside, the Congressional Research Service has \nrefused to honor a request from myself and Senator DeMint to give us a \nlist of the earmarks in the 2007 appropriations bills--a flat-out \nrefusal. There is a lot of speculation as to why they do not want the \nAmerican people to know what the earmarks were last year. Come 2008, we \nare going to get to find out them all under the Transparency and \nAccountability Act that myself and Senator Obama and several others \ncosponsored, which became law last year.\n  When we questioned the University of Vermont about this earmark, we \nasked: What were the estimated costs of the project long term? They \ncould not give us an answer. Who was going to finance it after the \nprogram was established? They could not give us an answer. How will the \nFederal funding be expended? They could not tell us that. Did the \nuniversity request the funding? We do not know the answer to that \neither. None of these questions have been answered by the University of \nVermont.\n  This $2 million could be spent for our troops. It would buy 2,857 \ncarbine rifles the National Guard presently does not have so they could \nconduct training. It would buy 4 mine-protected vehicles or 13 \nuparmored humvees.\n  Mr. President, I wish at this time, without giving up my right to the \nfloor, to yield time to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 697, as Modified\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate, a few minutes ago, acted on an amendment, \nthe Warner-Byrd amendment. It is a rather unique one. I first thank my \ndistinguished colleague and mentor in many ways, Robert C. Byrd of West \nVirginia. We have collaborated together many times on pieces of \nlegislation.\n  But I approached him, and he concurred in my observations, that this \nwas badly needed by the Congress, by the country, and indeed by the \nPresident and his staff, as well as the Department of Defense.\n  Our amendment calls for the appropriation of a sum of money to enable \na private sector entity to make an independent--independent of all \nentities, the Pentagon and otherwise, in the Federal Government--\nassessment of the status of the Iraqi security forces, most \nspecifically the army, the national guard, and other elements which are \nfighting alongside the coalition forces, and primarily the U.S. forces \nnow in the operations in Baghdad.\n  I have followed this issue for a number of years, and I have referred \nto the report to the Congress of May 2006, roughly a year ago. In that \nreport, they talk about the:\n\n       Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) continue to grow in strength \n     and capability as indicated by:\n       progress in the training and equipping of ISF personnel;\n       assessed capabilities of operational units; and\n       progress in assuming responsibility for security of areas \n     within Iraq.\n\n  In another part, on page 46:\n\n       With the generation of Iraqi Army battalions now more than \n     89 percent complete, the focus of the Army's train-and-equip \n     effort has shifted towards building combat support and combat \n     service support forces.\n\n  Now, this is a report, as I say, of a year ago. Compare that to the \nreport Congress received this month, March of 2007, and the following \nparagraph, observation, from page 25:\n\n       By the end of 2006, the United States and its Coalition \n     partners met their force generation targets, while continuing \n     their efforts to expand the size and capability of the ISF--\n\n  ``ISF'' being Iraqi Security Forces--\n\n     to meet emergent requirements. As of February 19, 2007, \n     approximately 328,700 forces (not including replenishments) \n     have been trained. The actual number of present-for-duty \n     soldiers is about one-half to two-thirds of the total due to \n     scheduled leave, absence without leave--\n\n  That is referred to by those of us who served as ``AWOL''--\n\n     and attrition.\n\n  So it is not nearly, in 2007, as encouraging as the report in 2006. I \nfelt, together with Senator Byrd and a group of cosponsors on this \namendment, it was imperative we get an independent analysis of some of \nthe reports of the Department of Defense and others to determine what \nis the viability of this force.\n  Every plan we lay down and discuss here on the floor regarding Iraq--\nthe amendment yesterday adopted narrowly by Senator Reid, calling on \ncertain troop deployments and dates; the President's program of January \n20 of this year, in which he revised strategy and initiated what we \ncommonly refer to as the surge operation in Baghdad today--every single \nplan, concept for the future of Iraq is dependent upon the military \nproficiency, the viability, the capability of the Iraqi security \nforces. I felt very strongly that we had to go and get a second \nopinion--a phrase often used in medicine, but it is just as important \nhere in diplomacy. It is just as important in military analysis. Let us \nget a second independent opinion about these forces.\n\n  Drawing on my own modest military career but a lifetime of experience \nin working with our military and having served in the Pentagon for over \n5 years as Under Secretary and Secretary of the Navy, I have had some \nexperience with training of forces. Our great country, since World War \nII, took recruits, brought them into recruit training, and in 6 to 7 \nmonths they were trained, capable individuals. They were then assigned \nto other units to have additional training, but they were often ready. \nToday, those same recruits in this generation of forces that we have \nserving on active duty in the Army and particularly the National Guard, \nthey are trained in a period of 6 to 8 to 9\n\n[[Page S4002]]\n\nmonths, and then they go into combat situations. We have been training \nthese 325,000 people, most of them, for a period of 2\\1/2\\ years. We \nneed to know at what point this heavy investment of American taxpayers' \ndollars, the work of the U.S. military to train these individuals, at \nwhat point are we able to say: This force is able to take on these \noperations and perform them because all our planning is dependent on \nthat.\n  I find it most difficult to see how we have trained 325,000--that is \nover twice the number of U.S. forces in Iraq--we have trained them for \nthese many years. Why are they not able to step up and take on the \nmajor operations now being performed by the U.S. forces? Our President \nhas indicated we will continue to embed our forces with Iraqi units and \ncontinue to give them certain supplies and logistics and equipment. It \nseems to me the fighting, the brunt of the fighting ought to be borne \nby the Iraqi forces, and we, the United States, be it the Congress or \nthe executive branch--but most importantly the people--are entitled to \nhave an assessment of what we have created with the expenditure of \nthese hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars to \ntrain these forces.\n  Now, the concept is--and I will be working with the administration \nand hopefully this becomes law and work through the process of \nappropriations--this sum of money would go to a private, independent \nentity to engage individuals to make this report, and then the report \ncomes back to the Congress of the United States.\n  I thank my colleagues who have supported me, particularly my \ndistinguished, longtime friend and associate from West Virginia, \nSenator Robert C. Byrd. We have done our work to initiate this all-\nimportant study because every plan we have is dependent upon a better \nunderstanding and knowledge of what has or has not been created in \nterms of the Iraqi security forces.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am pleased to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I respect the Senator and his service to our country in \nuniform as well as the Secretary of the Navy and of course his service \nin the Senate. I ask him this question:\n  Let's assume that 120 days from now, the report comes back and says \nthe Iraqi military is not prepared to stand and defend its own country. \nWhat responsibility then falls on our shoulders?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it seems to me we have to face the reality \nof fact. Now, this would be an independent report. Obviously, I think \nthe Department of Defense would come back and provide some rebuttal or \nsome additional information, so we would have to take all the \nviewpoints and put them together. But what I say to my distinguished \ncolleague from Illinois is we are still relying solely upon these \nreports that come on an annual basis. I read through them, and I \nencourage others to do so. It is very difficult to glean from these \nreports that sound, basic fact: Are they trained? Are they equipped? \nAre they ready? Most importantly, I say to the Senator, do they have \nthe commitment in their hearts to take orders and fight on behalf of \nthe Iraqi people? That is what concerns me because of the large amount \nof AWOL, absentees, and all the other types of things that are \nreflected in this report.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, reclaiming my time, as the floor is \nunder my control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 657\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I would like to continue, since my time is going to be \nlimited by what I will be allowed to discuss on my amendments in terms \nof total time, I wish to spend a minute talking about amendment 657. \nThere is no question we have some critical needs among many of our \nagricultural suppliers in this country--needs that were unforeseen, \nneeds that were unanticipated, needs that we should have addressed last \nyear but didn't; needs that we should have addressed in the CR, but we \nwere precluded from offering an amendment to offer a way to supply \nthose needs. What this amendment does is it provides farm relief to \nboth our production agriculture individuals, as well as our cattle, in \na fiscally responsible manner.\n  I wish to give some quotes, before I go into the details, from last \nyear's debate with Senator Conrad and Senator Dorgan. Here are the \nfollowing quotes:\n\n       I am very much in sympathy with Senator Coburn on the \n     notion of paying for this. I appreciate very much--as the \n     Senator knows, I wish to pay for this all as well. We have a \n     way to do a pay-for, but I am precluded from doing so by the \n     rules. On the question of paying for it, I have complete \n     agreement with the Senator from Oklahoma. I wish the rules \n     permitted us to offer an amendment for pay-for. I don't have \n     disagreements about the issues of paying for it. I suggest we \n     do a unanimous consent. I would do a unanimous consent to pay \n     for it. These things ought to be paid for. We have hundreds \n     of billions of dollars come through here with hardly a blink, \n     none of it paid for. That ought to change. I am with the \n     Senator from Oklahoma. Let's try to change that.\n\n  The fact is this does not have a pay-for, not because Senator Conrad \ndoesn't want it there or I don't want it there; it ought to be there.\n  Well, here is the chance to put those words into action. What this \namendment does is strike all nonessential items in the farm title so \nthe scarce resources we have can be maximized for crop and livestock \ndisaster assistance. The language in this amendment leaves verbatim \nthat language in the underlying bill. It requires, though, the \nunderlying funding for the emergency in this bill to be paid for within \nexisting funds at the Department of Agriculture. You are going to hear \nall this screaming: They can't do it. You know what. They have $8 \nbillion in the bank right now unspent, unobligated; money that is \nsitting there from this last year and this year that they haven't \nspent. This total will come to $4.15 billion, $4.15 billion to take \ncare of the real needs of the consumer, the production agriculture in \nthis country that has had 3 years of drought, has had 3 years of \nfloods, has had 3 years where they didn't produce a crop. Those who \nactually bought crop insurance are going under anyway. What it would \nnot do is add the other $1 billion to the outside of that for special \ninterests that aren't the heart of agriculture in this country and when \nwe do that, we are going to pay for it.\n  How dare you take money from the Department of Agriculture. The \nDepartment of Agriculture is, if you compared it on size and budget, \nthe sixth biggest business in the United States. There isn't a big \nbusiness out there that if they had to scrimp, couldn't save 4 or 5 \npercent on their business. As a matter of fact, they do it every day. \nAs soon as their stocks start getting low, they start trimming, \nbecoming more efficient, better ideas, better efficiency, and they cut \ntheir costs. We can do that at the Department of Agriculture.\n\n  This body isn't about to vote for this amendment because they don't \nwant to have that fight. They don't want to have the hard work of \nmaking the Department of Agriculture efficient and not allowing the \nwaste, fraud, abuse, and duplication that goes on in the Department of \nAgriculture. The $1.6 billion of food stamp payments that are paid out \nto people who are ineligible every year, who are ineligible, who have \nplenty of money, yet they are getting food stamps. All the other \nprograms that have waste, fraud, and abuse in them, we are not going to \ntake the step and say: Department of Agriculture, take the money that \nyou have now--you have almost $8 billion in the bank--work real hard, \ntrim yourself about 2 or 3 percent, save the money and go out and do \nwhat is going to make a difference to the production of agriculture in \nthis country. No, we are going to do what is easy when this amendment \ngoes down.\n  What we are going to do is we are going to say: Grandkids, we didn't \nhave the courage to do what was right in 2007. We didn't have the \ncourage to look at the programs that weren't efficient. We didn't have \nthe courage to challenge somebody when they were being wasteful. We \ndidn't have the courage to find it within ourselves to not lessen your \nstandard of living because we wanted our standard of living taken care \nof.\n  So what they are going to see is an extra $5 billion or $6 billion \ncoming out of their pockets 20 and 30 years from now when we attempt to \ntry to pay back this money, and they are going to wonder: What did we \ndo? What were the standards under which we operated?\n\n[[Page S4003]]\n\nWhat was the character trait in us, as a body, that allowed us to not \ndemand efficiency from an agency of the Federal Government and yet go \nthe easy way and demand it out of the livelihood and opportunity of our \ngrandchildren? That is what they are going to ask. What is the \ncharacter flaw in that? Is it laziness? The Members of this body \nobviously care about this country. What is it? What is it that would \nnot make them do the hard work of challenging the inefficiency that we \nall know is out there in the Federal Government and we all know is \nwithin the Department of Agriculture? Not that the Department of \nAgriculture employees aren't great. They are. They work hard. They are \ndedicated. But there is still enough money in the sixth largest \ncorporation in America, the Department of Agriculture, to find $4.15 \nbillion and bail out the guys and gals who need to be bailed out right \nnow, just like we have tried to bail out Louisiana.\n  What is the character flaw? Is it self-centeredness? Is it laziness? \nIs it not willing to fight to make things better? Or is it so easy to \nput the credit card into the machine and say: I am not going to worry \nabout tomorrow. I am going to think about the short run right now. Long \nterm doesn't have any consequence to it. I am not going to consider \nthat.\n  Now, what does this amendment get rid of? What it keeps is $2.09 \nbillion in crop assistance and $1.64 billion in livestock assistance. \nWhat does it get rid of? It gets rid of individual earmarks for \nindividual Senators. It gets rid of $40 million for the tree assistance \nprogram which includes Christmas trees, shrubs, nursery bushes. It gets \nrid of $30 million in administration for hiring additional Farm Service \nAgency personnel and computer upgrades. You tell me we can't find $30 \nmillion in the sixth largest corporation in this country to finally fix \nthe computers? Sure we can. It will be hard, but we can do it. But it \nwill never happen unless Congress asks for it to happen--demands that \nit happen. Once you start asking one agency to do that, it will be easy \nto ask the next agency to do that. Pretty soon, before you know it, \nAmericans are starting to get good value for their money.\n  If, in fact--it is not ``if, in fact,'' it is actually a fact. \nEighteen to twenty percent of all the discretionary funds spent by the \nU.S. Government are either waste, fraud, abuse or duplicative. Think \nabout that. That means 20 cents out of every taxpayer dollar you pay in \nthe discretionary side of the budget, one-third of the budget--the rest \nof it is Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security--is not efficiently \nmanaged, spent or directed for the purposes it was intended. So why \nwould we not force this? We are going to hear it is impossible. You \ncan't ask them to find it. I will guarantee, if they were a public \ncompany and their stock was tanking and they weren't doing well, they \nwould hire a new CEO and, before you knew it, that would happen. The $4 \nbillion would be made up through efficiency, innovation, and \nprogrammatic changes that directed the programs to the most needy at \nthe best time, at the best efficiency, with the least cost and the \ngreatest skill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nprevious order be further modified to provide that the cloture vote \noccur immediately; that the other two votes with respect to the Wyden \nand Burr amendments occur at 2 p.m. under the same conditions and \nlimitations; provided further, that notwithstanding rule XXII, the \namendments remain in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, we are working on scheduling additional votes at 2 \no'clock beyond those specified in the consent now pending.\n  I intend to vote for cloture. I hope everyone on my side will vote \nfor cloture. We are going through an exercise that is going to \nultimately lead to a vetoed bill that doesn't get money to the troops. \nThe sooner we can get this bill out of the Senate and into conference, \nget the conference completed, and get the bill down to the President \nfor veto, the sooner we can get serious about passing a bill and \ngetting money to the troops.\n  Ultimately, I recommend that Republican Senators vote for cloture.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I want to get along, but we are serious \nabout this legislation. We believe it is a good piece of legislation. \nWe understand the President wants a bill. If he wants a bill, we can \nhave final passage in about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, further reserving the right to \nobject, if we must debate this now, we will. The fundamental issue \nbefore us is whether we are going to get money to the troops, not \nwhether we are going to deal with $20 billion of additional spending \nover and above the request to get money for the troops.\n  The only way this bill has a chance of becoming law in time to \nprovide money for the troops, and not send a date for surrender to our \nenemies, is to get through the process as rapidly as possible.\n  The leader and I had very cordial conversations earlier today about \nvotes on amendments postcloture. We think we have an understanding that \nwill be satisfactory to both sides.\n  There will be additional votes this afternoon. There is a possibility \nthat we might finish the bill today but certainly tomorrow. My \nrecommendation is that we invoke cloture and move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republican leader and I had cordial \nconversations this morning. We will have them this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we will now move to the cloture vote. \nFollowing the cloture vote, it is our understanding that Senators Hagel \nand Webb, under the previous agreement, will speak on the amendment to \nwhich they would like to speak. For the information of all Senators, \nonce this vote occurs, Senator Hagel and Senator Webb will be speaking, \nand then we will have votes at 2 o'clock, which were just ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close the debate on Calendar No. \n     84, H.R. 1591, the emergency supplemental 2007 appropriations \n     bill.\n         Harry Reid, Robert C. Byrd, Jack Reed, Patrick Leahy, \n           B.A. Mikulski, Byron L. Dorgan, Christopher J. Dodd, \n           Dianne Feinstein, Richard J. Durbin, Chuck Schumer, \n           Debbie Stabenow, Barbara Boxer, Herb Kohl, Jay \n           Rockefeller, Joe Biden, E. Benjamin Nelson, Daniel K. \n           Akaka, Ted Kennedy.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on H.R. \n1591, an act making emergency supplemental appropriations for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2007, and for other purposes, as \namended, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory \nunder the rule. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect to \namendment No. 690.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 690 is now the pending question.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 823 to Amendment No. 690\n\n  Mr. REID. I now call up my amendment No. 823.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 823 to amendment No. 690.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       The provision in this section shall become effective 2 days \n     after enactment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 707\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is now my understanding that there is \ngoing to be an amendment that is going to be offered by the Senator \nfrom Nebraska and the Senator from Virginia; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is appropriate for the Senator to call for \nthat amendment at this time, if he wishes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I haven't had an opportunity to speak to my \nfriend from Nebraska, but I have spoken to my friend from Virginia, and \nI have a statement I would like to give. There is 90 minutes for \ndebate. I don't know what their pleasure is or when they would want me \nto speak.\n  Mr. President, the amendment is at the desk; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is pending.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I want to acknowledge how \npleased I am to join as cosponsor of this extremely important \namendment. I applaud Senators Hagel and Webb for returning the focus of \nthe Senate to the issue of our troops and their readiness.\n  There is a lot of talk around here about supporting the troops. Too \noften we don't take the kind of action that can achieve that goal. \nYesterday, when the Senate voted to maintain the language on changing \ncourse in Iraq, it was a good day for our country and for our troops \nwho may finally get the new policy they deserve.\n  With yesterday's vote, the Senate finally acknowledged the reality in \nIraq: The President's policy is not working. It is time to change \ncourse. This bipartisan position was backed up in the newspapers around \nthe country today. USA Today and the Associated Press have an article \ntoday detailing how the surge is not working. Baghdad, in some \ninstances, may be quieter, but according to the news outlets I have \njust mentioned, insurgents have taken their attacks elsewhere. I quote:\n\n       Nationwide, the number of deaths from car bombs has \n     decreased slightly since the Baghdad Security Operation \n     began. However, the death toll from car bombs has more than \n     doubled in areas outside the capital compared to the previous \n     6-week period.\n\n  Violence has not stopped in Iraq. It has gotten worse. Earlier today, \nShiite militants, including local police, went on a violent rampage. \nWhen it ended 2 hours later, we do not know how many Sunnis have been \nkilled, but at least 60. The victims were men between the ages of 15 \nand 60, most of them killed with a shot to the back of the head.\n  These reports fly in the face of what we heard in the Senate \nyesterday from some quarters, and we hear from President Bush that \nthings are better in Iraq. The idea that the surge is working or that \nit needs more time is a fantasy. What we see today in Iraq, months into \nthe surge, is more of the same--the same violence, the same chaos, the \nsame loss of life we have seen over the last 4-plus years, with 3,200 \ndead Americans and $500 billion spent. It is long past time to change \ncourse in Iraq.\n  If, yesterday, the Senate acknowledged the reality of the Iraq war, \ntoday we must acknowledge the reality of what the Iraq war is doing to \nour military and their ability to defend this Nation everyplace.\n  Mr. President, we have no better advocates to learn about the reality \nof combat than Senators Hagel and Webb. The authors of this amendment \nhave authority on this subject based on their experience in battle, in \nwar--not the classroom. When Chuck Hagel and Jim Webb speak for a \nchange of course, we should all listen.\n  Chuck Hagel is a Vietnam combat veteran. He served with his brother \nTom. Both of them were infantry squad leaders with the U.S. Army's 9th \nInfantry Division. For his service, Senator Hagel earned many military \ndecorations, including having been wounded twice--two Purple Hearts. \nWhen I say Chuck Hagel is a combat veteran, I mean it. I mean it. Here \nis a description from a 2005 Washington Post profile of what Senator \nHagel faced in Vietnam:\n\n       In Vietnam, Chuck, 21, and his brother Tom, 19, had fought \n     and nearly died together as infantry squad leaders. In 1968, \n     their armored personnel carrier hit a 500-pound mine. It blew \n     out Chuck's eardrums, set him on fire--``the whole left side \n     of my face bubbled.'' Chuck pulled Tom, unconscious, from the \n     burning gunner turret. Chuck saved his brother's life just \n     months after Tom had saved his [brother Chuck's life], when \n     shrapnel ripped through [Senator Hagel's] chest.\n\n  That is only part of the story. Jim Webb was also in Vietnam. He was \na marine with the Fifth Marine Regiment. For his service he was awarded \nthe Navy Cross, the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, and also two Purple \nHearts. Here is an excerpt from his citation for the Navy Cross:\n\n       Continuing the assault, [Webb] approached a third bunker \n     and was preparing to fire into it when the enemy threw \n     another grenade. Observing the grenade land dangerously close \n     to his companion, First Lieutenant Webb simultaneously fired \n     his weapon at the enemy, pushed the marine away from the \n     grenade, and shielded him from the explosion with his own \n     body.\n\n  Webb's service did not stop on the battlefields of Vietnam. In 1984, \nhe was appointed the inaugural Assistant Secretary of Defense. In 1987, \nunder President Reagan, he became the first Naval Academy graduate in \nthe history of our country to serve the military and then become \nSecretary of the Navy.\n  These two men are authorities on war, authorities on war and the \nmilitary. All of us would be wise to heed their counsel. Chuck Hagel \nand Jim Webb are certified heroes. That is all you can say.\n  This morning I got up early and went to Walter Reed. I met a new \ngeneration of heroes, men and women injured serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. I was accompanied by my friend, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington, Mrs. Murray. To say I left depressed is an \nunderstatement. We have all heard the stories about Walter Reed.\n  I have two observations from my visit. I have been there on other \noccasions, but I have two observations from my visit today.\n  First, private contracting is destroying the ability of the military \nto care for our troops. Go to Walter Reed. Listen to the parents. \nListen to the people who are there, who are hurt. I was walking into \nWalter Reed and I introduced myself to a man dressed in civilian \nclothes. He told me who he was: a college graduate.\n  I said: What do you do?\n  He said: I am an industrial hygienist.\n\n[[Page S4005]]\n\n  I said: What do you do?\n  He said: I am one of those guys who goes around trying to make sure \nthat these places are sanitary and safe. I check for mold.\n  I said: How are you doing?\n  He said: Terrible.\n  I said: Why?\n  He said: Because of contracting out we went from 15 industrial \nhygienists at Walter Reed to 5.\n  So contracting out is hurting our ability to care for our troops.\n  No. 2, one soldier said it the best. He was sitting there, leg off \nmidthigh. He said: Everyone thinks that this is my problem. He said: \nThat's not my problem. He said: It's this leg--and he had a leg that \nwas terribly mutilated--the calf blown off, dropped foot, scars all up \nand down it.\n  He said: You know, but I'm really fortunate because I'm alive.\n  He went on to say: We amputees are treated pretty well. It's the \npeople with injuries that you can't see who are having a difficult \ntime.\n  That is the way it is. One young man from Cincinnati, OH, just turned \n20 years old--big, as big as the Presiding Officer--big man. He said: I \nonly got shot once. He said: I had a protective vest. I was shot in the \nstomach. It didn't hurt me too bad. But I survived multiple explosive \ndevices.\n  He said: My friend--these are his words--``vaporized sitting next to \nme.''\n  He is now in big trouble--emotionally, mentally. He has a lot of \nproblems. He said: I have nightmares, I sweat, I become violent, I \ncan't remember anything. He said: I don't know what I'm going to do. He \nwas one of a number whom we visited with there.\n  Walter Reed is a metaphor of what is happening to our military as a \nwhole. We don't have a single Army unit that is nondeployed that is \nbattle ready. We hear today from one of the generals that in the \nNational Guard, 40 percent of the units are not capable of anything \nrealistically connected to battle. It will take $40 billion to bring \nthe Guard alone up to what it was before the war. The war has badly \nstrained our military. The administration's policies have reduced our \nmilitary readiness to levels not seen for a long time. Not a single \nunit, nondeployed Army unit, I repeat, is combat ready. Multiple and \nextended deployments overseas have reduced readiness and damaged \nrecruiting, retention, and morale. Units have been sent into battle by \nthis administration without the proper training and equipment, in my \nopinion. That is not supporting the troops; that is breaking the force. \nWe have to do better.\n  This is not just my opinion. It is the opinion of current and former \nsenior Army officers.\n  Colin Powell:\n\n       The active Army is about broken.\n\n  Arnold Punaro, Chairman of the Commission on the National Guard and \nReserves 15 days ago said:\n\n       We can't sustain the [National Guard and Reserves] on the \n     course we're on.\n\n  Peter Schoomaker, Chief of Staff of the Army, said:\n\n       To meet combatant commanders' immediate wartime needs, we \n     pooled equipment from across the force to equip soldiers \n     deploying into harm's way. . . . This practice, which we \n     are continuing today, increases risk for next-to-deploy \n     units and limits our ability to respond to emerging \n     strategic contingencies.\n\n  I spoke yesterday to a man in my security detail on his way to Iraq \nfor the third time. Sadly, his story is the norm, not the exception. Of \nthe Army's 44 combat brigades, all but one permanently based in South \nKorea have been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. Of those 43 brigades, \n12 deployed once, 20 deployed twice, 9 deployed three times, 2 have \nbeen deployed 4 times.\n  Today we have soldiers serving in Iraq who have been fighting in \nbattle well over a year. We have other soldiers who were on their way \nto Iraq after having been home with their families for a matter of \nmonths.\n  That is not supporting the troops. It is hurting the troops. Our men \nand women cannot and should not continue to bear the burden of this \nmismanaged war. We have to do better. That is why the Webb-Hagel \namendment is so important.\n  This amendment will ensure our troops have the equipment they need \nbefore they go to battle--before they go to battle. It explicitly \nstates that our troops must have the training and equipment they need \nor they cannot be sent overseas.\n  This amendment will also enhance the quality of life for troops and \ntheir families and, as a result, improve recruiting and retention. It \nsays that after our brave men and women serve 365 days in Iraq, they \nare entitled to a significant period of rest back home before they can \nbe redeployed. In short, this Hagel-Webb amendment will improve \nreadiness and our ability to respond to other threats and project power \naround the world.\n  We live, we all know, in a dangerous world. We face many threats. \nFrom destroying al-Qaida to deterring Iran and North Korea from gaining \nnuclear weapons, there are critical challenges around the world that \nwe, the superpower, America, must confront. Unfortunately, we have a \nmilitary stretched too thin to meet these challenges.\n  After years of overuse and neglect, we must reinvest in the military. \nWith this amendment we will take the necessary steps to make a \ndownpayment on rebuilding our fighting force and keeping our families \nsafe.\n  I so appreciate these two combat veterans, these two unique, good \nSenators leading us down this road on which we must be led.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are now \ngoing to turn to Senator Hagel and Senator Webb, who are both here. We \nhave time allocated until 2 o'clock, at which time, I remind my \ncolleagues, we will have two votes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Nebraska yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. HAGEL. I do yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be listed as a cosponsor of \nthe amendment, the Hagel-Webb amendment, or the Webb-Hagel. The \namendment speaks with real power about what we need to do. They have \nworked very hard on it. I wish we could adopt it. I know they are going \nto speak on it now. I just want to indicate my support for their \ntremendous effort. I ask to be a cosponsor of their amendment.\n  I think all of us would join in Senator Reid's comments. They were \neloquent and powerful, and we thank him for them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 707\n\n                      (Purpose: Relating to Iraq)\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Michigan who occupies the chairmanship of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 707, offered by \nSenator Webb and myself, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Hagel], for himself, Mr. \n     Webb, and Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 707.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I wish to offer my thanks as well to the \ndistinguished majority leader of the Senate for his comments and his \nsupport of the amendment that I am about to address, as well as my \nfriend and colleague, the distinguished junior Senator from Virginia.\n  The war in Iraq has pushed the U.S. military to the breaking point. \nOur troops are being deployed longer than they should be, more \nfrequently than they should be, and without full training and \nequipment. When we deploy our military, the President and the Congress \nhave a responsibility, an obligation to ensure that our troops are \nrested, ready, fully trained, and fully equipped.\n  Senator Webb and I have introduced this amendment to protect and \nmaintain the readiness and strength of our Armed Forces. Our amendment \nrequires, with the force of law, that our\n\n[[Page S4006]]\n\ntroops are only deployed to Iraq when they meet the military's own \nstandards for readiness and deployment. We are not creating new \nstandards. We are simply requiring that the military's own standards be \nmet so that our men and women in uniform are sufficiently rested, \nready, fully equipped, and fully trained when deployed.\n  That is the President's and the Congress's responsibility. No \nAmerican wants to allow a single soldier to be deployed without meeting \nthe required standards of readiness. Our amendment gives the President \nappropriate flexibility. Our amendment has a 4-month delay, before the \nprovisions come into force, to give the President time to comply.\n  The President can waive the readiness requirement in case of a \nnational emergency and under circumstances where a unit will receive \nits full complement of equipment in the theatre of operations. Our \namendment exempts from the deployment cap all headquarters personnel \nand any other U.S. military personnel who are needed in Iraq to ensure \ncontinuity of mission between rotating forces.\n  This amendment will help our troops in a way that avoids having \nunintended operational consequences for our commanders in Iraq. Our \namendment is about our troops. It is about readiness. It is about \npreventing our troops from being extended 3, 4, 5 or 6 months, as has \nbeen and is currently the case today. It is about ensuring a minimum \ntime home between deployments.\n  This amendment is also about addressing deployment rotations of our \ntroops in Iraq. Many are there for their third and fourth tours of \nduty. The United States will not be able to sustain the greatest all-\nvolunteer military that the world has ever known if we allow the status \nquo to continue.\n  We are witnessing a clear and dangerous consequence of the \nadministration's Iraq policy in Army recruitment. To meet recruitment \ntargets, the military is being forced to issue waivers today. These \nwaivers are for violent offenders, criminals, and for drug abuse. We \nare waving education requirements. The result is a defining down, a \ndefining down of the standards of the U.S. Army. No institution can \nmaintain any aspect of excellence by dumbing down its standards. If we \ndo not stop this dangerous trend, it will affect the entire institution \nof our military, an institution that has taken great American leaders \n30 years to build.\n  After the disaster of Vietnam, our military was shredded. Ask Colin \nPowell. Ask Norman Schwarzkopf. Ask other great military leaders who, \nin fact, after Vietnam said: No more. We are going to build the finest, \ngreatest, most responsible, best force structure the world has ever \nknown, and they did.\n  The deployment and operations tempo our military has had to endure in \nboth Iraq and Afghanistan over the last 4 years cannot be sustained \nwithout inflicting unacceptable costs to our military power and our \nstanding and influence around the world.\n  As the Washington Post reported today, General Barry McCaffrey, the \nformer four-star commander of the U.S. Southern Command, tours in \nVietnam, led a division in 1991 in the Gulf War, he now believes--\naccording to the article in today's Washington Post--that the U.S. \nmilitary is in, his words, ``strategic peril.''\n  Yesterday, LTG Steven Blum, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, \ntestified before the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. \nGeneral Blum said the National Guard is, in his words:\n\n      . . . now in a degraded state back at home . . . The Army \n     National Guard has on-hand only 40 percent of its equipment \n     requirement . . . This hinders the ability of our units to \n     train. It also can slow our response to disasters and \n     terrorist incidents in the homeland.\n\n  In February, GEN Peter Schoomaker, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. \nArmy, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee. General \nSchoomaker said: ``I am not satisfied with the readiness of our non-\ndeployed forces.''\n  At the same hearing, GEN Peter Pace, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, acknowledged that today our Army units ``do not have the \nopportunity that they would normally have in a two-year cycle to train \nfor the combined arms that they may be required to execute elsewhere in \nthe world.''\n  On March 1, the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves issued \na report that concluded that: Nearly 90 percent of Army National Guard \nunits are rated as--their words--``not ready.''\n  There have been repeated reports that senior Army officials now \nbelieve there are no nondeployed Army brigades who are rated as combat \nready.\n  Now in our fifth year of the war in Iraq, the Congress must assert \nitself in a very real and responsible way to fulfill our constitutional \nresponsibilities in matters of war as a coequal branch of our \nGovernment.\n  Over the last 4 years, the Congress has been absent from this \nresponsibility. The American people now expect us to step into this \ntragedy that we have allowed to happen and begin to reshape our policy \nin Iraq by placing responsible conditions on our continued military \ninvolvement in this war in Iraq.\n  We are abusing our all-volunteer force in a dangerous and \nirresponsible way. We are abusing our people. We are abusing their \nfamilies. We cannot continue to burden our military by continuing to \nplace our military in the middle of a civil war in Iraq and loading \nonto them, continuing to load onto our military, expectations that they \nare incapable of fulfilling.\n  We are asking our military to accomplish things they cannot \naccomplish, not because they are not brave enough, not because they \nhaven't fought valiantly--they have fought valiantly and we are proud \nof them--but it is new diplomatic initiatives that must now drive our \npolicies in Iraq. There will not be--nor cannot be--a military victory \nin Iraq that will achieve peace or any form of stability or security \nfor the Iraqi people or the Middle East.\n  The future of Iraq will be determined by the political accommodations \nof the people of Iraq which will result in a political resolution that \nwill be supported by the Iraqi people, its regional neighbors, and \nother powers, including the United States. Our military should not be \nasked to do it all. Our military should not be expected to do it all. \nThey have done more than their part.\n  Our men and women in uniform and their families deserve policy worthy \nof their sacrifice. I do not believe that to be the case today. \nUnfortunately, today the Senate will not vote on our amendment. But \nSenator Webb and I are committed to this amendment, and we will \ncontinue to push for a vote in the Senate in the coming weeks, and we \nwill be back and we will be back.\n  We have been assured by the majority leader that we will get a vote \non this amendment in the Senate. I conclude with this: I often ask \nmyself, who speaks for the rifleman? Who cares about the rifleman? War \nis not a distraction. Those whom we ask to go fight and die are a very \nsmall percentage of our population whom we ask to carry all the burden \nand make all the sacrifices. But who speaks for them?\n\n  Of course, we have a responsibility for a larger geopolitical \nstrategic policy for our interests. We have interests in Iraq. We have \ninterests in the world. We have interests in the Middle East. But do we \never stop enough and listen enough and focus enough on these soldiers, \nthese marines and their families who have nothing to say about policy; \nbut they do what their country asks them to do.\n  When we frame policy in Washington, part of that prospective of \nframing that policy must include the right because it must ultimately \nget to this question: Is the cost worth what we are attempting to \naccomplish? Is the cost worth the high price we are asking others to \npay?\n  Ultimately, that is the question we should always ask ourselves, \nthose of us who have the privilege and the responsibility to frame \npolicy--if Congress must be part of that--not just constitutionally but \nmorally, but morally.\n  We each represent constituencies from around this country. We are \nclose to those constituencies. We mirror those constituencies. We are \nproducts of those constituencies. We are close to those constituencies. \nWe must do better for our military. We will pay a high price if we do \nnot turn this around. We will pay a high price, indeed, not just in \nAmerica's blood and treasure but for our future interests and security \nin the world.\n  We have not paid attention to our military, we have not paid \nattention to\n\n[[Page S4007]]\n\nthe rifleman, and now is the time to start paying attention. I \nappreciate the time to offer this amendment with my friend and \ncolleague who, as the majority leader noted minutes ago, was one of the \nmost decorated veterans of the Vietnam war. He understands this issue \nvery well. He understands it from the bottom up.\n  It does not mean Senator Webb and Senator Hagel are always right on \nanything. But we do try to bring a frame of reference to this debate \nthat is relevant, that is important, and focus our attention on the \nvery critical element of who we are. It is our people. Nothing is more \nimportant than our people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to first express my profound \nappreciation for the majority leader's words today. Senator Reid likes \nto say he is not a speaker of eloquence, but I have rarely heard such \neloquence of words on this particular issue. They were from the heart, \nthey touched me deeply, and also they were humbling. But most \nimportantly, having the majority leader stand here and bring words to \nthe floor today, as my colleague, Senator Hagel, and I are attempting \nto do, in an attempt to inject a reality, a responsible reality to this \ndebate that in many cases has been lacking, is greatly gratifying to \nme.\n  I also would like to thank and congratulate my good friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Nebraska. I greatly respect his service to \nour country. I greatly admire his courage and his willingness to speak \nout on this issue over the past several years. I would point out that \nhe and I began our Government service many years ago as people who had \ncome back from a different war and decided we would devote a good \nportion of our lives to trying to take care of those who had served.\n  The motivation behind the amendment he and I have worked so \nassiduously on over the last couple weeks is that same motivation that \nbegan nearly 30 years ago. I have seen a lot of comments over the past \n3 months, some of it accusatory with respect to people who are trying \nto bring a different focus to our situation in the Middle East, saying \nthat the people who are doing this were somehow hurting the troops.\n  The question becomes, how do you support the troops? What does it \nmean to support the troops? Who is really speaking for the troops? We \nhave a good many Members of this body--and I respect them all--who have \ncome back from multiple trips to Iraq. They have sat down with the \nmilitary leaders who are charged with the responsibility of carrying \nout our policies. They have heard in many cases optimistic predictions. \nIn too many cases, they have come back and basically said: If you want \nto do something different, you are affecting the options of the \nCommander in Chief, and you are being disloyal to the troops.\n  Who is really listening to the troops? On the one hand, the people \nwho have been serving in this war are justifiably proud of their \nmilitary service. On the other, they are carrying out the policies of \nour political process. If we look at polls--our best way of trying to \nfigure out how the average military person feels about this war--we \nwill see they share the same concerns in the aggregate as everyone else \nin the country. A little more than a year ago, when I announced for the \nSenate, there was a poll of our Active-Duty people actually serving in \nIraq. Seventy-two percent of those people believed the United States \nshould withdraw from Iraq by the end of last year. This included 70 \npercent of the Regular Army and 58 percent of the regular Marine Corps.\n  Our motivation today is to try to put a formula together that will \nrespect the policies of the United States and truly show the best way \nto take care of the troops.\n  I note with some irony that the bill before us is called an emergency \nsupplemental appropriation. Beginning the fifth year in this war, we \nare now calling it an emergency that we need to bring more money to the \ntable. Why? There are a lot of different possibilities, but let's start \nwith this: This has been a war which has been fought without a \nstrategy. You do not have a strategy unless you can clearly articulate \nthe end point of your military operations. I have been saying this for \nmore than 4 years. But what we have had instead of a strategy is the \nplan of the week. We have had a lot of flailing around from the \npolitical leadership that has spilled over into the military \nleadership--let's try this; let's try that; let's extend our troops; \nlet's deploy our troops early; let's send them back before they have \nhad a chance to rest, recuperate, and refurbish. We are seeing now, as \nmy good friend from Nebraska mentioned, the military cost of that kind \nof policy. We are also seeing a human cost. Who pays for this lack of \nclarity? The troops pay. They are sacrificing. They are proud to serve \ntheir country, and they can't plan their lives. They have kids being \nborn, weddings to go to, people to visit, holidays to enjoy--all a part \nof the plan when they were deployed.\n  This amendment goes to that point, the proper utilization of our \nmilitary. The first thing that it does is it establishes clearly, as \nSenator Hagel and I and others have been saying for a long time, that \nthe primary U.S. policy objective in Iraq should be a political \nsolution that can be obtained through increased, concerted regional and \ninternational diplomacy. We have seen the seeds of that over the past \ncouple of months. We are stating that this should be recognized as our \nprimary goal.\n  The second point is that we are putting in, as the Senator from \nNebraska mentioned, legally binding restrictions calling for the \ncertification of any unit in the U.S. military that is going to be \ndeployed, that it be fully mission capable. We have a reality check in \nthis provision. We understand that in terms of heavy equipment, many \nunits deployed fall onto equipment inside the theater of operations. We \nare not requiring that they have that equipment with them when they \nfirst deploy. We also have Presidential waivers in terms of possible \nnational emergencies that might occur. Other than that, we should have \nunit-ready deployments.\n  The third portion of this amendment goes to extending deployments. We \nare basically saying Army units that deploy for a year should come back \nin 365 days. Marine units that are deployed for 7 months should come \nback at the end of 210 consecutive days with certain, again, realistic \nexclusions.\n  The fourth provision goes to the minimum period between deployments. \nYou are not going to deploy military units until they have been home at \nleast the amount of time they previously were deployed. This goes for \nindividuals as well as units. It is quite possible in today's military \nfor an individual to come back from deployment and, after a very short \nperiod of time, be backfilled into another unit that is going. \nTechnically, the unit may have been back here for a year or 7 months, \nbut the individual has not. That has to stop.\n  We are also saying in terms of the Guard and Reserve that they need a \none for five. They need to be able to be home for five times the length \nof time they have been deployed. On this one-to-one cycle for Active \nForces, the military itself, the Commandant of the Marine Corps has \nsaid they would like to have a two-for-one cycle--for every year you \nhave been gone, 12 years home. In my experience in the Pentagon, as \nAssistant Secretary of Defense and as Secretary of the Navy, we looked \nat a two-for-one ratio for our ships, for our troops, a period of time \ndeployed, a period of time to come back, get reacquainted with your \nfamily, get some down time, and then an equal period of time to \nrefurbish and get ready to go again. All we are asking for here is a \none-for-one.\n  If you look at what has happened in the conduct of this war, it has \nnot been operational demands that have created the situation for our \ntroops; it has been a lack of proper leadership. There is nothing in \nIraq that would require this sort of chaotic planning. There is no \nemergency right now that can justify the unpredictability we have built \ninto these deployments.\n  At the right time, when the Senator from Nebraska is able to \nnegotiate this with the leadership--and I will pursue this as well--we \nwant a vote. We are working to get a vote.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n[[Page S4008]]\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I believe we have until 2 o'clock; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Seeing no other Senators on the floor wishing to speak on \nthis amendment, unless the Senator from Virginia has additional \ncolleagues that need time, I would, without objection, yield back our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I am aware of at least one other Senator who \nwants to speak, Senator Nelson of Florida. I don't know procedurally \nhow we would go about that. I assume we could get a call from the \ncloakroom and see if he could come down. If we could reserve 10 minutes \nfor the Senator from Florida at the time he arrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. With that understanding, and without objection, I yield \nback the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 762\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside, and I call up Voinovich amendment No. \n762.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Montana, I \nobject.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I understand. Therefore, I would like to speak on \nbehalf of the amendment.\n  This amendment would strike section 1502 from the underlying bill. I \nam pleased to be joined by Senators Inhofe, Warner, Hutchison, Enzi, \nCraig, and Coburn in offering the amendment.\n  Section 1502 would allow State and local governments to trump the \nFederal Government in matters of national security involving privately \nowned chemical plants. Concerns have been raised by many about the \nsecurity of chemical facilities since the tragic events of 9/11. After \n5 years of negotiation and several unsuccessful attempts to pass \nmeaningful legislation, a carefully crafted compromise was included in \nthe fiscal year 2007 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations \nAct.\n  This act authorized the Department of Homeland Security for the first \ntime to establish and implement risk-based performance standards at our \nNation's high-risk chemical facilities. In order to meet its statutory \ndeadline, the Department of Homeland Security has begun the process of \nimplementing that language and will publish its final interim \nregulation within the next 2 weeks. Effectively changing recently \npassed legislation giving DHS the long-sought authority to regulate \nchemical facilities is premature at best.\n  In other words, what this amendment would do is strike some language \nthat is going to try to amend this piece of legislation which we passed \nless than 6 months ago and which was signed by the President 6 months \nago. It hasn't even really been implemented thus far. My colleagues do \nnot want to further delay the process of securing our Nation's chemical \nfacilities from future attack.\n  The legislation we passed less than 6 months ago to protect our \nchemical facilities from attack anticipated the need for flexibility in \nsetting standards to protect our chemical facilities. The law \nspecifically states that the Secretary ``may approve alternative \nsecurity programs established by private sector entities, Federal, \nState, or local authorities, or other applicable laws if the Secretary \ndetermines that the requirements of such programs meet the requirements \nof this section and the interim regulations.''\n  Basically what that means is that if a State or other local \njurisdiction would come to the Department of Homeland Security and ask \nthat they be able to enforce other rules and regulations, this \nlegislation says they have an entree to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, at which time they would be able to discuss what they would \nlike to do.\n  Along those lines, the draft regulations issued by the Department of \nHomeland Security in December 2006 invite Federal consultation with any \nStates or localities that want to enact their own chemical facility \nrequirements. For example, the State of New Jersey has some very robust \nchemical security regulations. I heard the woman that runs that \ndepartment talk about them. I would suspect that under those \ncircumstances, the Department of Homeland Security would grant the \nState of New Jersey the right to regulate what they have been \nregulating for the last couple of years. Specifically, the regulations \nstate that it would ``permit State or local governments and/or covered \nfacilities to seek opinions on preemption from the Department.'' This \nprocess fosters collaboration among parties and prevents unnecessary or \nunforeseen Federal preemption from occurring. I would argue that this \nflexibility alleviates the concerns expressed--I repeat--by the Senator \nfrom New Jersey on this issue.\n  I believe Federal preemption is necessary to give the chemical \nindustry a single set of comprehensive national standards that are \nuniformly applied. Without the Department determining the applicability \nof Federal preemption, we would end up with a confusing situation.\n  Somebody has to decide whether--if this legislation is passed in the \nrespective States, if they do it--it fits in and is consistent so we do \nnot end up with an inconsistent patchwork of security regulations.\n  I understand the National Governors Association has sent a letter \narguing against preemption. I think many of my colleagues know that as \na former mayor and Governor, I do not advocate lightly Federal \npreemption of State and local action. I usually am a staunch advocate \nof States rights and have opposed legislation, such as No Child Left \nBehind, because I believed it was an intrusion by the Federal \nGovernment in policy areas that have been traditionally left to the \nStates.\n  But the security of our Nation from foreign attack is not an arena \ntraditionally left to the States. Article I, section 8 of the \nConstitution clearly states that Congress is delegated the power to \nprovide for the common defense. We in the Congress have the duty to \nprovide for the security of our States and our people. If there were \never a case for the Federal Government determining the applicability of \npreemption under the Constitution, the defense of the homeland \ncertainly is the best example of that.\n  There is ample precedent for Federal preemption in regulatory matters \ndealing with security of industry. I think some of my colleagues are \nnot aware of this. When Congress developed the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission in the interest of national security, it gave the Federal \nGovernment exclusive regulatory authority. The Hazardous Materials \nTransportation Act explicitly preempts State action and authorizes a \nwaiver only if the State regulation is ``not an unreasonable burden on \ncommerce.'' The preamble to the final rule implementing the Maritime \nTransportation Security Act of 2002--another act we put in place to \nprotect our ports--explicitly states that it preempts State regulations \nrelating to the security of facilities if such regulations would \n``conflict or would frustrate an overriding federal need for \nuniformity.''\n  I would say to my colleagues, the chemical security legislation \nprovides the Secretary with greater flexibility than the three examples \nI have just discussed. In other words, the ability to grant preemption \nis a lot more liberal in the Department's regulations dealing with the \nissue of chemical security in this country than in the cases that dealt \nwith the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Maritime Transportation \nSecurity Act, and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, where one \nof them specifically preempts only if the State regulation is ``not an \nunreasonable burden on commerce.''\n  So the fact is, granting State and local governments authority to \nsupplant Federal chemical manufacturing law is not just a minor carve-\nout. This preemption language in the bill before us overhauls 30 years \nof settled law regarding the Federal-State relationship on industrial \nchemical manufacturing laws as established under section 18 of the \nToxic Substances Control Act. The Toxic Substances Control Act gives \nEPA the ability to track the 75,000 industrial chemicals currently \nproduced or imported into the United States.\n  I want to ask my colleagues: Does it make sense to undermine the \ncritical work of Congress last fall to enhance\n\n[[Page S4009]]\n\nour Nation's security by eliminating our ability to set and enforce a \nsingle national standard for chemical security? Really, fundamentally, \nwhat this is about is to give the Department of Homeland Security the \noption of determining whether a State or locality that comes in and \nsays: We want to regulate chemical security--it gives them the final \nsay as to whether preemption will occur.\n  As to the language that is inserted in the supplemental, what it does \nis leaves it in the hands of the court to determine. For goodness' \nsake, the last thing we want right now--after 5 years of negotiation \nand several unsuccessful attempts to pass legislation, is to hinder the \nimplementation of the regulations governing chemical security in the \ncountry. Why would we want to throw it up in the air and cause a lot of \ncontroversy and court action?\n  I want to read the words of Section 1502, which was put in the \nsupplemental bill, in regards to the Chemical Security language that \nwas included in the Fiscal 2007 Department of Homeland Security \nAppropriations Act, which came out of the conference committee less \nthan 6 months ago. It says:\n\n       This section shall not preclude or deny any right of any \n     State or political subdivision thereof to adopt or enforce \n     any regulation, requirement, or standard of performance with \n     respect to chemical facility security that is more stringent \n     than a regulation, requirement, or standard of performance \n     issued under this section. . . .\n\n  Now, the issue is, who determines whether it is more stringent? Let's \nsay I am the Governor of a State and I come in and say: My State laws \nare more stringent than Federal laws. Then Homeland Security comes back \nand says: We don't agree with you. Who decides? The Federal court.\n  Section 1502 goes on to say:\n\n      . . . or otherwise impair any right or jurisdiction of any \n     State with respect to chemical facilities within a State, \n     unless there is an actual conflict between this section and \n     the law of that State.\n\n  Again, it just throws the issue about who determines whether a State \nis going to be allowed to do what they want to do into a court's hands \nrather than letting the director of Homeland Security make that \ndetermination.\n  I think what we are arguing for today is sensible. I would also like \nto quote from Section 550 of the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, \nwhich gives direction to the Department of Homeland Security on how the \nregulations are to be implemented. The law says:\n\n       No later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this \n     act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall issue interim \n     final regulations establishing risk-based performance \n     standards for security of chemical facilities and \n     requiring vulnerability assessments and the development \n     and implementation of the site security plans for chemical \n     facilities.\n\n  That basically talks about how they go about developing the \nregulations. Then the law goes on to say:\n\n       The Secretary may approve--\n\n  Very important: ``The Secretary may approve''--\n\n     alternative security programs established by private sector \n     entities, Federal, State or local authorities, or other \n     applicable laws if the Secretary determines that the \n     requirements of such programs meet the requirements of this \n     section and the interim regulations.\n\n  In other words, there is room for the Department to sit down with \nother people and say: Let's hear what you want to do, and if we think \nit makes sense, go ahead and do it.\n\n       Additionally, in the regulations issued to implement \n     Section 550 it says:\n       To meet this need, the proposed regulations at section \n     27.405, would permit State or local governments, and/or \n     covered facilities to seek opinions on preemption from the \n     Department. Such a process has been used by Congress in other \n     contexts.\n\n  They make reference to other sections of the code:\n\n       In most cases, the Department would utilize the process to \n     address quickly a specific conflict between a particular \n     application of State law or local law with an approved site \n     security plan or other elements of the section 550 program. \n     Note the Department has the authority to make preemption \n     determinations as it administers the chemical security \n     program under section 550.\n\n  So I think the Department, through the regulations, is carrying out \nthe legislation that was passed last October. We should let the law go \ninto effect and not tinker with it today, particularly in the \nsupplemental bill, which, quite frankly, has not a single thing to do \nwith chemical security. It does not make sense to have this into the \nsupplemental bill because Congress has already acted on chemical \nsecurity.\n  I suspect that this discussion may become moot because we are going \nto pass this bill, it will go to conference, the conference will do \ntheir thing, they will send it back here, it will be voted on in both \nHouses, it will go to the President, he will veto it, and then--in \nbasketball parlance--it will be a jump ball in determining what we are \ngoing to do at that stage of the game.\n  I wanted to come to the floor and share my concern about the language \nwhich was inserted in the supplemental. Again, it should not have been \nput in the supplemental. I have spent hours of my time in the Senate on \nchemical security in the United States. We worked this through the \ncommittee and thought we had it taken care of it, and here we are \nagain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the underlying bill, \nsupplemental appropriations, is a must-pass piece of legislation. \nAttached to it is the language that has caused some controversy because \nit is an attempt at defining what the policy of the U.S. Government is \nwith regard to the beginning of a redeployment from Iraq.\n  This Senator from Florida will vote for the funding bill with this \nlegislation attached because America needs a new direction in Iraq. For \n4 years, what we have been doing has not been working. It has not been \nworking because--and I am not talking about all the mistakes of why we \nwent into Iraq under misinformation and lack of intelligence and, in \nsome cases, I think massaged intelligence. I am not talking about that. \nI am talking about that we did not have a sufficient understanding of \nthe history of Islam and the history of that part of the world to \nunderstand how much enmity there is between the different sects of \nIslam and how, ever since 680 A.D.--the Battle of Karbala right in what \nis, today, Iraq--the Sunnis and the Shiites have been at each other's \nthroats, and we are seeing that played out in gruesome detail right \nnow.\n  Our men and women in uniform and not in uniform--because we have a \nlot of people over there defending the interests of the United States \nwho are not in uniform: CIA, DEA, FBI, the State Department; you can go \non and on--our men and women are right in the middle of that crossfire, \nparticularly in Baghdad.\n  Now, when you talk about Iraq, you are talking about multiple \ndifferences in the country.\n  The northern part of the country is predominantly Kurd. They, for all \nintents and purposes, have an autonomous government. They even had that \nwhile Saddam Hussein was in power because the northern part of Iraq was \nprotected by American air cover. They can basically provide for their \nown protection and their own governance.\n  The central part of Iraq is predominantly Sunni. It was from the \nSunnis that the Baathist Party, the party of Saddam Hussein, dominated \nthe rest of the country.\n  The south of Iraq is predominately Shiite. This is a Shiite \nkindredship which we now find--with the disintegration of Iraq--the \nkinship, the commonality of interests between the Shiites in Iraq and \nthe Shiites in Iran. The big difference between the two is in Iran, \nthey are Persians; in Iraq, they are Arabs.\n  Now, it took, for years, the hand of a brutal dictator who was \ngruesome beyond any measure to keep all those factions together because \nhe was so brutal in his tactics. We are certainly glad Saddam Hussein \nis gone. Nobody like that who would just murder people at will deserves \nto be in power. You can understand it was a dictator who kept that \npower and kept that country, with all of its centrifugal forces, \ntogether. We as occupiers, as an occupying military force, thought we \ncould keep it together, but we didn't understand the centrifugal forces \nof Iraq. Instead of being hailed as liberators, as there definitely was \na lot of personal thanks toward the generosity of America for deposing \nthe hated dictator, yet you see what started to kick in was the natural \ncentrifugal forces. Will a democracy work in a country such as that? It \nwould be nice if it would, but\n\n[[Page S4010]]\n\nI think now, after 4 years, we are seeing it is going to be very \ndifficult.\n\n  That is why in a political settlement, at the end of the day there is \nprobably going to be some separation of those sects with autonomy and, \nhopefully, with a national government that can provide for the common \ndefense and the distribution of the oil revenues according to \npopulation. But how do you get there? We thought as an occupying force \nwe could keep the country under control until those seeds of a \nrepresentative government could start to sprout. But that was one of \nthe mistakes the United States made, because the Secretary of Defense \nwould not listen to the top general, General Shinseki, when he answered \nthe question in our Senate Armed Services Committee: How many and for \nhow long are the American forces in occupation? He said: Several \nhundred thousand for several years. So with too little forces, you see \nthe results. The question is: What do we do now?\n  That brings us to the present moment. People criticize what we are \ndoing here and say: You don't have a plan. We most certainly do have a \nplan. The plan was laid out in a bipartisan commission, unanimously; \nfive very prominent, erudite Republicans and the same, five Democrats, \nled by the former Secretary of State and the former chairman of the \nHouse International Relations Committee, unanimously, and they laid out \na plan. They said to start a redeployment, and in the process of that \nredeployment, still have the American Army present so you are \nprotecting the forces, those who are there, protecting the \ninfrastructure. I would interpret that also to mean helping to control \nthe borders of Iraq. Then they said, No. 2, train and equip the Iraqi \nArmy. The Iraq Study Group even gave specifics of how you could embed \nadvisers and then have a method for protecting the advisers embedded in \nthe Iraqi forces. They said also to continue to go after al-Qaida. It \nis al-Qaida we are seeing, particularly in the western part of Iraq, \nthat is getting insurrection among the predominant ethnic group there, \nthe Sunnis, and they are causing mayhem all over. That is a mission we \nshould continue.\n  It also said: Go aggressively after an international and diplomatic \ninitiative, bringing all the countries in the region that would then \nenforce a political settlement that could be brought about. This is, in \nessence, what is a part of this bill. I suspect we are going to be able \nto pass the bill because the funding for the military is absolutely \nnecessary, so it is going to be hard for people to vote ``no'' on this. \nWe already had the real test vote that was a two-vote margin yesterday \nthat kept basically the language in the bill I have just outlined. So I \nthink we are going down the right road. This isn't a mandate. This sets \nas a goal over a year from now a redeployment of those troops with \nthose three main statements of purpose to continue, and it says we \nought to have a comprehensive strategy, a comprehensive diplomatic, \npolitical, and economic strategy that includes sustained engagement \nwith Iraq's neighbors and the international community. That is exactly \nwhat the Iraq Study Group brought to us unanimously.\n  This Senator from Florida wanted to state very clearly that is why I \nthink the Senate ought to support this funding bill, not only for the \npurposes of the funding, but also for the statement of what should be \nthe policy of the United States Government with regard to Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have offered an amendment to the \nunderlying bill, the supplemental appropriations bill. I wish to \ndescribe it for a moment, and then I wish to respond to some comments \nthat were made earlier by my colleague from Oklahoma who is offering an \namendment dealing with the agriculture disaster piece I included in \nthis bill as well.\n  First, an issue I am very familiar with and concerned about. It is an \nissue called country-of-origin labeling. For those who don't know what \nthat means, it means in 2002, 5 full years ago, the Congress mandated \nwe would have country-of-origin labeling for beef, lamb, pork, fish, \nfruits, vegetables. Essentially, what you eat shall be labeled. If \npeople walking around this Chamber would take their shoes off, they \nwould find their shoes are labeled. If they took off their T-shirts, \nthey would find they are labeled. Almost everything is labeled these \ndays--made in Taiwan, made in China, made in wherever--so you can get a \nsense of where things are made. Go to the grocery store and pick up a \npackage of pasta, linguini, spaghetti, take a look on the side and you \nwill see what is in it. You will see where it was made. Labeling.\n  The only problem is we don't require labeling, for example, on a \npiece of steak. One day some while ago I brought to the floor of the \nSenate a piece of steak. I held it up and I said, I challenge anybody \nin the Congress to tell me where this piece of meat came from. Of \ncourse, no one tried and no one could. No one knows where that meat \ncame from. As I asked about where this meat might have come from, I \nread from an inspector's report who went to a processing plant in \nHermosillo, Mexico, the first time any inspector had ever been there to \ninspect the conditions of the processing of meat in that plant that was \nbeing shipped to American consumers. I read from the report. It said:\n  Carcasses of meat were hanging in rooms that were not refrigerated, \nlayered with feces and flies, and some from diseased animals ready to \nbe put back into the same vat where they were going to grind it for \nbeef and so on. I read the description of what the inspector found.\n\n  They shut down that plant. They shut down that plant in Mexico. Then \nit was reopened because it had new ownership. They made a few changes, \nreopened the plant, and still ship meat from Mexico to the United \nStates from that plant, and there has never been an inspector back to \ntake a look.\n  I asked the question: Can anybody tell me this piece of meat didn't \ncome from that plant? Well, of course, nobody could. So you might ask \nwhy, if 5 years ago we mandated that there be country-of-origin \nlabeling for meat in this country, why is there no labeling on meat? \nWell, the majority party in recent years apparently cared a lot about \nwhat the big packers thought and all the folks who were opposed to \nlabeling these meat products. I was in a conference committee over in \nthe middle of this Capitol in a small room. We were all packed into \nthis little conference, an Appropriations Committee conference, and it \nwas November of 2005. Country-of-origin labeling, remember, was \nsupposed to have gone into effect on September 30, 2004. But then the \nmajority party got involved and they extended it once.\n  In November of 2005 I was part of a conference on the Agriculture \nappropriations bill and I was prepared to debate this issue on country-\nof-origin labeling. The chairman of that conference banged the gavel, \nrecessed the conference, and we never met again. The next time we saw \nthe results of what those folks had done in a smoky back room some \nplace, they had further extended country-of-origin labeling to \nSeptember of 2008. They keep extending it and extending it. The law \nsays meat must be labeled by September 30, 2004. It is not now labeled. \nWhy? Because it has been extended and extended again, always done in \nthe dead of night, always done in an amendment that is brought up not \nin the House or the Senate, but stuck in a conference some place--an \nunbelievable practice.\n  The result is we come now to this piece of legislation, an emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill, and I say: You know what. Let's \ndecide that country-of-origin labeling for meat takes effect this \nSeptember, several months ahead. Let's decide it does that.\n  One of the culprits here has been the U.S. Department of Agriculture \ntoo, because they almost wore out their shoes by dragging their feet. \nThey have no interest in doing anything this aggressive, even though \nthe Congress said: You must do it. They drug their\n\n[[Page S4011]]\n\nfeet, got their heels stuck in the ground. That gave their friends here \nin Congress enough time to do these extensions. The result is in this \ncountry today there is no labeling of meat products.\n  It is interesting. The other day I was listening to news reports, \ntragic news reports about pet food in this country--millions, tens of \nmillions, I guess, of people who have fed pet food to their pets, \napparently containing ingredients they had no notion of, filler wheat \nfrom China, apparently rat poisoning, and pets have died. A tragedy for \nthose pet owners. But how would they have known? There is no label. \nThey don't know what is in it. They don't know where it comes from. I \nassume even if it had a label, it wouldn't say rat poison. I don't know \nhow rat poison would get into pet food. But in any event, as I was \nlistening to the news and watching some owners of pets who had \ndescribed the terrible, agonizing death of their pets from eating \ncontaminated pet food, it reminded me again of this issue of labeling \nand of my description of the investigator who went to the one \nprocessing plant in Mexico, processing meat for this country.\n  Why in these circumstances and in this day and age, do we not have \nlabeling on meat that is sold to the American consumer?\n  Up north in Canada--my heart goes out to those livestock producers in \nCanada. They are trying hard. They are trying to make a living like \neverybody else is, but the plain fact is they have had 10 cases of mad \ncow disease in Canada. Nine of them in Canada, one recently, and one \nCanadian cow discovered in the State of Washington. That is 10 cases of \nmad cow disease, including the most recent case a couple of months ago. \nYet, even at that point, it seems as if the Secretary of Agriculture \nwants to do a mad cow cattle drive from Canada to the United States. He \nis all anxious about opening this market right now; got to do it right \nnow. I am wondering why his inclination isn't first to protect our \ndomestic industry. We have other countries that say, we want to trade \nwith you. We want to buy some beef from you, but we are not interested \nin buying beef that is intermixed with other kinds of beef. We want \nbeef that is certified as American beef. Why? It is the safest in the \nworld. But if you open this border wide open to the Canadian cattle at \nthis point, especially at this point, given what we have known about \nBSE in Canada, how can we tell other countries without country-of-\norigin labeling that we have segregated and we know exactly where this \nmeat comes from?\n  I think the USDA is making a business mistake. I say to the USDA \nSecretary this: If you are going to do this, at least be consistent and \nsay you cannot do it without implementing country-of-origin labeling \nimmediately; you must argue for both. Yet he has not been willing to do \nthat.\n  I don't want, by talking about this, to suggest in any way that \npeople in this country should be concerned about their supply of meat. \nThey should not. We have a lot of ranchers and folks in this country \nwho do a lot of work to keep our beef, lamb, pork, and poultry supply \nsafe. But the American consumer wishes to purchase that which comes \nfrom American ranchers. That is why country-of-origin labeling is \nimportant, to give the American consumer the choice and the \nopportunity. I am telling you something. It is long past time when this \nshould have been done. Those who serve in this Congress who want to \ncontinue to prevent the consumer from knowing where this meat comes \nfrom do no favor to the American consumer, and they certainly do no \nfavor to the producer who is producing the best quality of supply that \nexists in the world but are told it doesn't need to be labeled because \nthe consumer doesn't need to know. Boy, I think that is dead wrong.\n  So I have introduced a piece of legislation that will move country-\nof-origin labeling up to September of this year. It is long past time \nfor this Congress to take action to undo what others have done in the \nappropriations process in the dead of night to extend this country-of-\norigin labeling.\n  Let me also talk for a moment about amendments that will likely be \noffered to strike from the emergency legislation some assistance to \nfamily farmers who suffered weather-related disasters. Almost all of us \nwere here when we debated what to do about Hurricane Katrina, which \ncame roaring onto the shore in this country and devastated a \nsignificant part of this country. It flattened it, killed people, \nravaged houses, destroyed a city, and then another city. It rendered \nthe gulf coast in shambles. Included in that is the crop that the \nfarmers planted, the crop they put in the fields, hoping it would \ngrow--the destruction of all that crop that was put in for that year by \nthose farmers.\n  What do we do about that? What we decided to do was to provide \nemergency help, billions and billions of dollars of help, to those \npeople who were injured by Hurricane Katrina. At least one part of that \nwas to help family farmers who lost everything in the gulf. We said: \nYou are not alone, you didn't cause this hurricane, you are the victims \nof it. Just like the other victims of this weather-related disaster, we \nwant you to know we are with you and we want to help you.\n  And we did. Family farmers in that region got disaster assistance and \ngot it with my help. I insisted on supporting that, and I know my \ncolleagues did as well. We had a responsibility to say to those \nfarmers: You lost everything. You are the victims of this weather-\nrelated disaster. We want to help you get back on your feet and \nrecover. We want you to be able to continue living and working on a \nfamily farm.\n  So we did that. But that was not the only weather-related disaster. \nIn the last 2\\1/2\\ years, we have had torrential flooding in my State, \nfor example. At one point, we had 2 million acres of land that was \nplanted and completely washed away, or not planted at all. If you are a \nfarmer who owns land in that 2 million acres, you didn't have a crop, \nor didn't plant one, and you don't have any hope.\n  Last year, we were the epicenter of a devastating drought. The \npasture down near Zeeland, ND, when I drove there to go to a meeting \nwith ranchers and farmers, looked exactly like a moonscape. Nothing was \ngrowing at all. Under the best of circumstances--I come from a semiarid \narea, where 17 inches of rain fall a year. Put that in the epicenter of \na drought and you have real trouble. We had farmers who lost everything \nand not just us, but in other parts of the country the same was true.\n  We name hurricanes but not droughts or floods. The drought didn't \nhave a name. It wasn't ``Drought Kenneth'' or ``Drought Irma.'' Because \nthese farmers lost everything to disasters that didn't have a name, are \nthey any less deserving? Do we think any less of the interest in \nkeeping them on the land and giving them help to continue farming? The \nanswer ought to be, no, of course not. That is why I added a disaster \npiece for family farmers in this appropriations bill.\n  My colleague, Senator Conrad, and I, and so many others, on a \nbipartisan basis--Senators Bond, Feinstein, Boxer, and others--have all \nworked together to try to reach out to family farmers and say: When \ntrouble visits your farm and you have lost everything, you are not \nalone. This Congress wants to help. This is not a recent urge of ours. \nWe have always done this. We have always done it. So I was proud to be \na part of putting this in the appropriations bill. It is on the floor. \nIt should not be controversial. I spoke to President Bush last night \nand said: Mr. President, do not call this pork; it is not pork. You \ndon't legislate pork, you eat pork. We understand about meat and pork \nand so on. This is not pork, but some want to call it that. Say that to \na farmer and the farmer's family living under that yard light 10, 15 \nmiles from town who lost everything; say to him: By the way, when the \nCongress wants to help you, somebody believes it is pork. It is not \npork; it is in this country's interest to help those family farmers. It \nis simply in our interest. That is why we have added this, and I know \nwe will have amendments to strip it out or make changes.\n  The fact is this is a worthy and a noble thing for the Congress to \ndo. I hope that when the amendments are offered, we will be able to \ndefeat them.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for his leadership on behalf of \nfamily\n\n[[Page S4012]]\n\nfarms. I will ask the Senator a couple of questions because he has been \nhere a long time in Congress and we have served together for many \nyears. I see Senator Conrad coming to the floor as well. The fact is--I \nwant the Senator to let me know if he agrees with this--that the whole \npurpose of these emergency supplementals, if you look at the Web site \nthat explains to people who want to know more about what we do on \nemergency supplementals, they have always been used--at least my \nresearch shows--is for emergencies, including especially natural \ndisasters. Doesn't it strike the Senator as odd that the President of \nthe United States would support $100 billion for the country of Iraq \nbut tell us he doesn't support anything in this bill for the American \npeople? Isn't that an odd thing?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from California is absolutely \ncorrect. It has always been the case that there are certain things you \ncannot predict in the coming year. You can budget for expected \nexpenditures and programs you want to fund, but there are some things \nyou probably cannot predict; for example, Hurricane Katrina is probably \nthe prime example or a devastating drought or torrential rains or ice \nstorms in California this spring. So what we have always done is we \nhave always done emergency supplemental bills to try to respond to \nthose. Only in this Presidency have those emergency bills \noverwhelmingly been defense bills because the President decided to move \nour armies overseas. We got involved with respect to Afghanistan and \nIraq, and we asked for no expenditures, except he would later ask for \nemergency funding for it. We have passed roughly $450 billion in \nemergency funding for defense. That is not the basis, generally, of \nwhat emergency supplemental bills have been about. They have been to \nrespond to the unanticipated events in this country, such as \nagricultural disasters and other things.\n  I said yesterday, when I spoke on the floor, I thought it curious \nthat in the Senate, when we did an $18 billion emergency funding for \nreconstruction of Iraq, nobody stood up, that I am aware--and Senator \nWyden and I cut it by about $1.8 billion--and said: OK. You are going \nto invest in health clinics. If you do that in Iraq, it is national \nsecurity; if you do it in America, it is pork. You are going to invest \nin road programs. In Iraq, it is for national security; in America, it \nis called pork. You are going to invest in any number of dozens of \nother things, and as long as it is in Iraq with the reconstruction \nprograms, that is OK, that is part of our national security issue. But \nif it is doing it in this country, they say, no, no, no, no, you cannot \ndo that.\n  I observe one thing. Some of what we do is flatout spending. I \nunderstand that. We need to tighten our belts. But some of what we do \nis investing in this country's future. I think investing in this \ncountry's future includes saying to family farmers that this country \nvalues having you on the farm. You are the seedbed of family values \nthat nourishes our country from the small towns to the big cities. \nCulturally and economically, you matter to this country.\n  When we pass a disaster bill that includes disaster help for family \nfarmers, I think it represents the best instincts of this country and, \nfrankly, it is what we must do if we are going to maintain a network of \nfamily farms producing America's food. Finally, we understand, all of \nus, that big corporations could probably farm from California to \nMaine--buy up the whole country and farm it. We know what would happen \nto food prices. Our country is much better served by having a network \nof family farmers out there, with their families living under yard \nlights, producing America's food supply. That is why I think the best \ninstincts of this Congress is to do what we did in this legislation, to \nprovide disaster help for those who need it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to my friend from North Dakota, \nthank you for being here to talk about this issue because there is a \nhuge misconception out there that is being perpetrated by the \nadministration and that is that there is something wrong with the \nDemocrats in Congress who are insisting the emergency needs of the \nAmerican people be met in this bill.\n  Mr. President, in my question to the Senator from North Dakota, I was \ntrying to make the point that history will show these emergency \nsupplementals have always been used to help the American people. After \nall, it is their taxpayer dollars being used. The reason I wanted to \ntake the floor this afternoon is because there are a number of \namendments coming that will strip from this bill the help for the \nAmerican people they deserve. Many of these people are the ``salt of \nthe Earth'' people that we all know, that we visit, and I will talk \nabout them in a minute. I will talk about the hardships they have gone \nthrough.\n  Here is something interesting. If you look at the Senate's Web site--\nthis is not part of my Web site; this is the Senate's Web site, so it \nis written with Republicans and Democrats--you will find a glossary of \nterms that is intended to help the public understand what it is we are \ntalking about when we use terms of art on the floor, such as \n``emergency supplemental appropriation.''\n  The Senate glossary--and remember it is bipartisan--states this:\n\n       Supplemental appropriations generally are made to cover \n     emergencies, such as disaster relief, or other needs deemed \n     too urgent to be postponed until the enactment of next year's \n     regular appropriations act.\n\n  So the supplemental appropriations are meant to cover emergencies in \nAmerica. Now, the President has tried to lead people astray when he \nsays: No, no, this is only about the war in Iraq; I want all of the \nmoney to go to Iraq. I don't want any money to go to the people of \nAmerica because this isn't the right vehicle to take care of those \nproblems. Not true.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am delighted to yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask the Senator, is it not a curious thing that the \nPresident, in his proposal on the supplemental appropriations bill, has \na plan to rebuild Iraq but has no plan to rebuild parts of America that \nhave been devastated by disaster? Is that not a curious thing?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is not only curious, it is wrong. That is why I am so \nproud of the work that Senator Conrad and so many others did to make \nthis bill a balanced bill that meets the needs of our people. Yes, we \nare giving the President what he is asking for in Iraq. We have been \ncritical that the President has not funded Iraq in the regular budget. \nSo we are saying: OK. We are not happy about it, but, yes, we will give \nyou every penny, plus what you ask for, for Iraq. But for goodness' \nsake, you are getting $102 billion for Iraq. How about $20 billion for \nthe needs at home? I think my friend is right. It is curious, and it is \nwrong that he didn't balance his request.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. And isn't it the case, I ask the Senator from \nCalifornia----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if I can inform our colleagues, we are in \nthe process of working to get a unanimous consent agreement to move the \ntwo votes that were scheduled for 2 o'clock to 2:30 p.m. We are going \nto be putting that together. We should have it in just a few minutes. \nIf our colleagues will allow us to let Senator Boxer continue for a few \nminutes, we will have that put together.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I believe I have the time. I ask unanimous \nconsent for the additional time, if there are no objections.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I have no objection. I wish to make a request. Is it \npossible for me to speak for 5 to 10 minutes before 2:30, after the \nSenator from California speaks?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I inform the Senator that we have about \neight Senators here who are all wanting about 5 minutes between now and \n2:30 p.m. If the Senator wouldn't mind withholding, we will try to \naccommodate him after the votes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from California is recognized for an additional 10 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to yield to my friend for a \nquestion. But I say to my friend, Senator\n\n[[Page S4013]]\n\nMurray, when she has that agreement, I will be happy to suspend at that \ntime.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask the Senator, in conclusion, isn't it the case that \nthe history in the Senate has been that emergency matters, of whatever \ntype--whether they flow from a war or whether they flow from natural \ndisasters--in this country are dealt with in a supplemental \nappropriations bill? There is nothing new in this at all. Isn't that \nthe case?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My colleague is not only correct, but as I said, if we \nlook at the Senate glossary written by both sides, its agreement on \ndefining what a supplemental appropriations bill is--and I am going to \nquote it exactly for my colleague:\n\n       Supplemental appropriations generally are made to cover \n     emergencies, such as disaster relief, or other needs deemed \n     too urgent to be postponed until the enactment of next year's \n     regular appropriations act.\n\n  So it is absolutely in the definition on our Senate Web site.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think that is clearly the case. I have served here--I \nam in my 21st year. This has always been the case with supplemental \nappropriations bills, that disasters are dealt with in this manner. \nHere we have a case where we had damage from Katrina that is addressed \nin this bill; where we have had devastating natural disasters affecting \nagricultural producers, whether it was drought or flooding or freeze, \nthat are dealt with in this supplemental appropriations bill, which is \nthe regular order, is it not, in the Senate?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My colleague is exactly right. All we are saying as \nDemocrats to our friends is: Take care of the American people. Take \ncare of them. They deserve it.\n  I am waiting for some photographs of the freeze that occurred in my \nhome State. I see they have arrived. I need to share these with my \nfriends.\n  There is a song called ``Strawberry Fields Forever.'' I want my \ncolleagues to look at what happened to the strawberry fields in \nCalifornia as a result of the freeze. When we look at this, I say to my \ncolleague from Washington--I want to get her attention just to look at \nthis and to thank her for helping us. This is a strawberry field. It \nlooks like an ice rink. The strawberries are destroyed.\n  I want to show my colleagues our oranges. This is an orange tree. \nThis is what has happened because of the frost. This picture is of an \norange. You can hardly see it beneath the frost. A picture is worth a \nthousand words. I say to the President and my Republican friends: Don't \nturn your backs on these good people who endured these losses. And, by \nthe way, in my State, in the most Republican part of my State, what are \nyou doing? We need to help people. We need to help the workers. That is \nwhat is in this bill.\n  Yes, we provide all the funding for the troops and more. And, yes, \nthanks to the leadership of the Senator from Washington and the \nSenators from Hawaii and the majority leader, we have funds in this \nbill for Walter Reed Army Medical Center. And, yes, we look at what \nhappened in Louisiana. We look at what happened with the levees, and we \ntried to help those living in FEMA trailer parks.\n  Why would this President turn his back on the people of Louisiana \nonce again? Once again. We saw the lack of response, and now in this \nbill we are saying help the people, Mr. President. You went down to New \nOrleans. You stood there--I will never forget the speech--and you said: \nWe will stand with you. Yet he says he doesn't want help for the people \nof Louisiana in this bill.\n  My farmers have suffered $1.3 billion in losses. I showed the \npictures of the freeze. We know about the drought that hit the Midwest. \nSo instead of pledging to work together, we find this administration \nthreatening to veto this bill.\n  I say to this President: If you veto this bill, then you come to my \nState and you look into the eyes of these farmers and you look into the \neyes of these workers and you tell them they didn't have an emergency. \nYou tell them they don't qualify for assistance from a country they \nlove, to which they are devoted. It isn't right.\n  And, yes, we added some language to the bill that says: We are not \ngoing to have an open checkbook forever for Iraq, and we are not going \nto have this continuous stream of wounded and dead coming back. Yes, we \nwant to have a timeline that is fair and just.\n  If the President vetoes that, he is ignoring the will of the people.\n  I will suspend, Mr. President, withhold my time, not lose the floor, \nand let the Senator from Washington make her request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if the Senator from California will yield \nfor a minute for a unanimous consent request.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous \norder be further modified, for the last time, and that the votes slated \nto occur at 2 p.m. be delayed until 2:40 p.m., and that the time until \n2:40 p.m. be divided 30 minutes in opposition to the Coburn amendments \nNos. 657 and 648, and that Senator Coburn control 5 minutes; that upon \ndisposition of the Burr amendment, the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the Coburn amendment No. 657, to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 648; that no amendments be in order to either \namendment; that there be 2 minutes for debate prior to each amendment \ncovered under this agreement; and that after the first vote, the time \nbe limited to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we \nwill then have four votes beginning at 2:40 p.m.\n  I thank the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was happy to yield. Mr. President, how much time do I \nhave remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the new consent agreement, \nthe Senator could control 30 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I won't do that, of course. I will complete in 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 5 additional minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have spent half a trillion dollars from \nour Treasury on the war in Iraq, and we know there are 3,000-plus dead, \n20,000-plus wounded. I think it is instructive to listen to what \nPresident Ronald Reagan once said. He said:\n\n       History teaches that war begins when governments believe \n     the price tag of aggression is cheap.\n\n  Let me say that again:\n\n       History teaches us that war begins when governments believe \n     the price tag of aggression is cheap.\n\n  Well, the Bush administration thought the price of this war would be \ncheap. They were wrong. We heard Secretary Rumsfeld tell Congress: The \nwar will last 6 days, 6 weeks, I doubt 6 months. Budget Director Mitch \nDaniels said Iraq ``will be an affordable endeavor.'' And we remember \nthe President saying, ``Mission accomplished,'' when it wasn't anywhere \nnear accomplished. We remember Vice President Cheney proclaiming \n``they're in the last throes, if you will, of the insurgency.''\n  They were all wrong, and Congress has to weigh in. That is what this \nlast election was about. We were weighing in with the help of a couple \nRepublicans yesterday. We said to this President: Your one-man show in \nIraq is over, Mr. President. You need to deal with the people of this \ncountry through their elected representatives. And don't issue these \nveto threats because that doesn't move us forward.\n  Senator Reid has asked the President to please meet with us; we can \ntalk, we can work things out. So it is really up to him. He is wielding \na veto pen because he doesn't like the fact that Congress has finally a \nspine to say, no, we are not going to have an open checkbook anymore \nfor Iraq, we are not going to keep sending our troops over there to \ndie, we are not going to put them in the middle of a civil war, we are \ngoing to change the mission in Iraq from a combat mission to a support \nmission.\n  We say to this President: Accept reality, please; it is time you do \nthat. If you love the troops, you have to give them a mission they can \naccomplish. If you love the troops, you don't send them to moldy \nhospital rooms to recuperate from their injuries. And thanks\n\n[[Page S4014]]\n\nto the Senator from Washington, we have money in this bill to fix \nWalter Reed. If you love the troops, you don't send them back to fight \nwith a post-traumatic stress disorder and a bottle of antidepressants.\n  We will give the troops what they need, but we will also be heard \nwhen we say: Don't put them in the middle of a civil war, Mr. \nPresident. Give them a mission that works, a support mission, to train \nthe Iraqis. It is their country. They have to stand up and fight. We \ncan no longer do it for them. And that was the importance of \nyesterday's vote.\n  In this bill, we do a lot of good things. We deal with the problems \nwe are facing in Iraq. We say we ought to change the mission and make \nit binding and give a date that says, yes, start bringing the troops \nhome and a goal for when we will bring them all home, except for those \nlimited missions.\n  It is a smart piece of legislation, I say to the President.\n  And, yes, don't forget America. Don't forget the people, the ``salt \nof the Earth'' people who are suffering because of this freeze. I will \nshow a few more pictures as I wind down on my time.\n  My State was devastated by the freeze. It left thousands of farm \nworkers without employment. One of my constituents, a 46-year-old \nsingle mother of two in Tulare County, spent years working in the \ncitrus fields and now has no job.\n  In this picture we can see the ice icicles near these avocados.\n  A look at this picture tells a thousand words. We can't turn our \nbacks on these people. We can't turn our backs on our salmon fishermen \nwho have been suffering so much. We can't turn our backs on the \nAmerican people.\n  In conclusion, we have to serve as a check and balance on the \nExecutive. When this Executive says it has an open checkbook for Iraq, \nnothing for America, we say: Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mr. President. That is \nnot right for the American people. Look at the people who have been \nsuffering because of natural disasters. Look at for what we are \nsupposed to use emergency appropriations bills. Come to the table with \nus. Don't wave your veto pen because we have a spine and we stand up \nfor these people and we stand up for our fighting men and women. Come \nto the table, we say, let's work things out.\n  If we read the Constitution, that is exactly what we are supposed to \ndo.\n  I was interested to hear Senator Hagel talk about the fact that this \nis not a monarchy, and he is right. We already had one King George, and \nthat was enough.\n  It is my sincere hope that the President will respect the rule of the \npeople and come to the table. I strongly support this bill, and I will \nvote against any amendment that hurts the people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, and 10 minutes to the Senator from Colorado, \nMr. Salazar.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 648\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly about the \nsecurity funding the State of Minnesota and the State of Colorado need \nto prepare for the Presidential and Republican National Conventions. \nThe Republican Convention is going to be held in Minnesota in September \nof 2008. I know the Senator from Oklahoma disagrees with our efforts to \nget funding for this important convention, for its security, but today \nI stand tall to protect the security of Republicans across the country \nwhen they come to my State.\n  The need for funding is obvious and urgent. As my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are well aware, preparations for the convention \nhave already begun. I imagine they would want security to be a high \npriority on the list of preparations. As a former law enforcement \nperson, and someone who was a prosecutor, I know you have to plan ahead \nfor these things. Delaying this funding until the normal appropriations \nprocess would prevent Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nagencies from conducting the proper planning they need to do. This is \nan enormous effort that involves law enforcement from all over our \nState. We have to be reimbursed or taxpayers all over our State will \nhave to foot the bill.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security has already designated next year's \nevent to be held in Minnesota a national special security event based \non threat assessment. There is clear precedent for Congress providing \nconvention cities with security funding. Four years ago, Congress gave \n$50 million each to New York and Boston, the two cities hosting \nPresidential nomination conventions, to help them defer their security \ncosts. This included a total of $50 million designated as emergency \nspending.\n  The bill provides an equal amount of money this year to Minnesota and \nColorado, and nothing more. The funding was approved by the \nAppropriations Committee with bipartisan support, including Chairman \nByrd and Ranking Member Cochran. Senator Coleman also supports this \nfunding.\n  I support this funding, and I join my Minnesota colleague and my \nfriends from Colorado in insisting that the States we represent receive \nsupport equal to that support which Congress has provided in the past, \nand that the funding for security for the Republican Convention in \nMinnesota be protected in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to \namendment No. 648 offered by my friend from Oklahoma. I commend the \nSenator from Minnesota for her comments and standing tall for security \nfor the national Republican Convention in Minneapolis, and I am here to \nstand tall in support of that Republican Convention in Minneapolis as \nwell as to say we have to do the same thing in Denver, CO, where we \nwill have the national Democratic Convention in November 2008.\n  Why is this money important, and why is it important at this point in \ntime? We are living in a new world, as everybody in this Chamber \nrecognizes. In these days after 9/11, we have to realize targets in \nAmerica are vulnerable areas that would likely be hit by those who wish \nto do our Nation harm. If you are one of the bad people and you say, \nwhere am I going to do the most harm in this Nation, you would want to \nfocus on those places where you have the national leadership assembled. \nIn the conventions for both the Republican Party and the Democratic \nParty in these two cities, you will have the President of the United \nStates, you will have the Vice President of the United States, you will \nhave 100 Members, I am sure, of the Senate, and you will have 435 \nMembers of the House of Representatives, as well as the national \nleadership all located in one place. Therefore, it makes sense to have \nthese events designated as security events, as Secretary Chertoff has \nalready done on March 5 when he said these are security events we ought \nto provide funding for so we can provide the kind of security that will \nprotect the Americans who will be attending these events.\n  I wish to look back at what has happened in the past, in terms of \nwhat happened in Boston and New York, and I will make a couple of \npoints. The first is for those conventions, back in 2004, when \nPresident George Bush was elected to be President of the United States, \nthis Congress provided emergency funding to take care of the security \nneeds in both Boston and New York. We did that in an emergency \nsupplemental attached to the Department of Defense appropriations bill \nback in 2004. If it was good enough to do it in 2004, it ought to be \ngood enough to do it in 2008.\n  Secondly, there is an enormous amount of planning that is required \nwhen you put on these kinds of events where you have hundreds of \nthousands of people who are watching and coming to these events in both \nof these cities. As the former attorney general for the State of \nColorado, and having been involved with local, State, and Federal law \nenforcement, and planning for these kinds of events in the past, I can \ntell you the enormity of planning that has to take place is something \nthat boggles the mind.\n  We are not that far away from these national conventions. These \nnational conventions are going to happen in August of 2008. That is a \nlittle more than\n\n[[Page S4015]]\n\na year away. How can we provide the security needs for these two \nconventions, how can we provide the security needs that are required to \nprotect this country and the leadership of America, unless we provide \nthe funding now? It is necessary for law and order to be able to take \nevery precaution and to provide security at these events.\n  Third, I say to my friend from Oklahoma, who has said we can do this \nin the normal course of the appropriations cycle, if we look at what \nhappened in 2006, there was a failure of the appropriations cycle in \nthis Congress. If that were to occur again in this Congress, which I \ndearly hope does not happen under this leadership, but if it were to \noccur again, that we are not able to get to the normal appropriations \ncycle, we simply would not have the resources and the time to be able \nto put together the kind of security plan for the 2008 conventions in \nMinneapolis and Denver.\n  It is important to this country that these two historic events, which \nwill ultimately lead to the election of the next President of the \nUnited States in 2008, have the kind of security that is required to \nmake sure all of the people in the communities which are hosting these \nconventions have the kind of security we can all be proud of.\n  I ask my colleagues in this Chamber to join me in opposition to \namendment No. 648, the amendment that is offered by my friend from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire as to the time remaining for myself?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time under general allotment \nretained for the majority is about 12\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an \nadditional 5 minutes to speak about another amendment, No. 657, which \nhas been offered by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered. The Senator may proceed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 657\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise also to speak in opposition this \nafternoon to amendment No. 657, which again my friend from Oklahoma has \noffered to strip out agricultural disaster emergency assistance to our \nfarmers and ranchers across this country.\n  I came to this Senate 2 years ago and began at that time to work with \nSenator Kent Conrad and Senator Byron Dorgan and a number of other \nMembers of this Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, to try to \nfigure out how it is we could help out those areas of our country that \nwere facing agricultural disaster emergencies. We saw it in the places \nof North Dakota and South Dakota and in many States across our country, \nbut we certainly have seen it in my State of Colorado as well.\n  In many places in my State, across the vast eastern plains, we are \nnow in the seventh year of what is an unprecedented drought--the \nseventh year of what is an unprecedented drought--including one of \nthose years being the driest year of record in the entire history of \nthe State of Colorado. On top of that drought, we also saw this last \nyear in the State of Colorado, in January of this year, a blizzard that \ncame in unexpectedly and ended up killing approximately 15 million \ncattle across all of the eastern plains. So today, I stand with my \ncolleagues who say that kind of emergency and that kind of disaster \nrequires us to act, to take some action to help those farmers and \nranchers of America who are often forgotten by Washington simply \nbecause Washington can't connect to those farmers and ranchers and to \nthose small rural communities across America.\n  This is our opportunity to make sure we are providing the kind of \nemergency disaster assistance that will help these ranchers and farmers \nsee their way through the disaster they are currently facing. If we \nfail to act, what will end up happening is these ranchers and farmers \nacross rural America are going to be so hurt that many of them are \ngoing to be driven off their farms and their ranches.\n  As I have traveled the eastern plains of my State, I have met with \nranchers who have lost upwards of 50 percent of their herd. I am sure \nthey are wondering, and we should be wondering in this body today as \nwell, how are they going to pay off their bank note? How is it they are \ngoing to continue to provide for their livelihood? Are they going to \nhave to sell off their farms or their ranches in order to continue?\n  Today, we have an opportunity to stand for rural America, for the \nforgotten America, and to say we believe in the food security of this \nNation, we believe in our rural communities and in those farmers and \nthose ranchers who are out there struggling every day to make sure we \nhave the food on the table that feeds this Nation. I ask my colleagues \nto join me and others, both Democrats and Republicans in this Chamber, \nin casting a ``no'' vote against amendment No. 657, which would strip \nthe agricultural emergency disaster assistance from this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, under the order, how much time remains on \nour side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. About 14 minutes.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 707 Withdrawn\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Hagel \namendment, No. 707, be withdrawn, as outlined under a previous order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                    Regional Impact of Darfur Crisis\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding me the \ntime. I don't think I will need to use all of it, but I appreciate it.\n  Time and time again, history has taught us that preventing a crisis \nis much less complicated and costly than ending and repairing the \ndamage caused by a humanitarian tragedy. The clumsy and irresolute \nresponse to the current crisis in the Darfur region of Sudan, however, \nshows we still have not learned this painful lesson. While the world's \nleaders condemn the atrocities but delay taking strong action, the vile \nhatred and unspeakable violence that has resulted in the death and \ndisplacement of hundreds of thousands of innocent people in Darfur has \nnow spread to actually infect nearby areas, destabilizing neighboring \ncountries and fueling a downward spiral of conflict and insecurity \nthroughout the region.\n  I am especially disturbed by evidence that the brutal tactics of \nDarfur--and their tragic consequences--have now, in part, been \ntransferred across the distant western border into eastern Chad and the \nCentral African Republic. Last week I held a hearing in the Foreign \nRelations Subcommittee on African Affairs to examine the regional \nimpact of the Darfur crisis. The overwhelming message from our \ndistinguished witnesses was that the victims and perpetrators of the \nDarfur conflict are no longer simply confined within Sudanese borders, \nso both our humanitarian response and our strategy for peace need to \nincorporate these new regional dimensions.\n  Nearly a quarter of a million Darfur refugees have fled into eastern \nChad, compounding an existing political and humanitarian crisis in that \ncountry. Lax security along Sudan's porous border has also allowed \nweapons and Darfur-based rebel groups to spread violence into Chad. \nBoth the Chadian and Sudanese Governments accuse each other of \nsupporting rebel factions seeking to overthrow the neighboring state. \nLast Saturday, the Chadian Government claimed Sudanese aircraft had \nshelled four Chadian towns. Ironically, the UNHCR has now begun moving \nChadian refugees into Darfur for their safety.\n  Even before the recent outbreak of hostilities in the north, the \nCentral African Republic was suffering extreme poverty and was deemed \nby the UN as ``the world's most silent crisis.'' Displacement--much of \nit the result of house-burning and other cruel tactics by Government \nforces--rose fourfold in the past year, with more than 200,000 unable \nto return to their homes. Since the displacement has been more gradual \nthan in Darfur or eastern Chad, the growing humanitarian crisis has \nreceived little attention and the response of aid agencies has been \nslow and limited.\n  There is not yet a humanitarian emergency in the CAR, but if the \nfighting between the Government and rebel\n\n[[Page S4016]]\n\nforces continues and the UN doesn't begin to respond more effectively, \nconditions could worsen dramatically. Rather than allow another crisis \nto break out, we could help avert massive starvation and disease with a \nrelatively minor intervention now. That is why I have proposed to \ninclude $10 million for the Central African Republic in the fiscal year \n2007 supplemental so as to provide seeds and tools, basic shelter \nmaterials, and medicine now, a month or two before the rainy season, to \nreduce the risk of a widespread humanitarian disaster.\n  While U.S. attention to Darfur is essential, the expansion of this \ncrisis now requires a more comprehensive approach that addresses the \ninterrelated emergencies and underlying causes of instability in this \nvolatile region. Conflicts in these countries will continue to simmer \nand spread unless the international community musters the political \nwill and material resources to act upon the conviction so often \nexpressed.\n  As the violence in Darfur worsens and spreads, we cannot pretend we \ndid not see this coming. For nearly 3 years now, my colleagues and I \nhave stood on this floor and called for an end to the genocide in \nDarfur. It makes me ill to think of how many lives have been lost and \ncivilians displaced since then, but I become even more upset when I \nconsider how much worse this crisis could still become. There is no \nexcuse for the persistent reluctance of the U.S. Government and the \ninternational community to begin applying the economic and military \nleverage at their disposal to end the violence in Darfur and beyond.\n  I will continue to call for courageous U.S. leadership to defend \nthese innocent people and demand accountability for the perpetrators of \nthe atrocities that have been allowed to continue for far too long.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, may I ask how much time do we have on our \nside?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Almost 9 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield that time to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized for 8 minutes 42 seconds.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 648\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to \namendment No. 648, offered by my colleague, the Senator from Oklahoma. \nThe Senator from Colorado and my colleague from Minnesota have already \nspoken in opposition to the amendment. I wish to add one other \nperspective and that is the perspective as a former mayor of the city \nof Saint Paul.\n  I have in my hands a letter from the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nMichael Chertoff, dated March 5, 2007, in which he says: After careful \nconsideration, this letter is to advise you that the Republican \nNational Convention, which will be held in St. Paul, MN in 2008, will \nbe designated as an NSSE. That is a National Special Security Event.\n  As a result of being designated a National Special Security Event, \ndone by Presidential directive which was established in 1998, you will \nhave the Secret Service designated as the lead agency for design and \nimplementation of the operational security plan, you will have the FBI \ndesignated as lead agency for crisis response, you will have FEMA \ndesignated as the lead agency for crisis or consequence management, \nworking hand in hand with folks at the local level.\n  The bottom line is what we have here is designated a National Special \nSecurity Event. In effect, I view this almost as an unfunded mandate--\nvery similar to that; that local agencies in St. Paul, Minneapolis, and \nDenver will face the responsibility of dealing with the national \nsecurity event, working hand in hand with the Secret Service, the FBI, \nand FEMA, who will be leading the way. They simply do not have the \nresources to deal with the magnitude of security that will have to \naccompany this convention.\n  In conventions in Boston and New York, I was looking at some of the \ndata, you are looking at 165,000 people passing through magnetometers, \nalmost 10,000 packages screened, dealing with demonstrations, 9,500 \nU.S. Secret Service credentials be issued to local law enforcement, 200 \nMembers of Congress, 20 to 30 Governors, national delegates, and \nobviously Presidential candidates.\n  The bottom line is some have characterized this as booze rather than \nbullets. This is not about booze. This is about security at an event in \nwhich there will be 14,000 international media present, in which much \nof the leadership of each of our parties will be present across the \nboard, Federal, State, local.\n  In the past in this post-9/11 world, it has become very clear that \nlocal communities do not have the capacity to deal with this, so this \nCongress acted wisely in providing resources to the city of New York, \nacted wisely providing resources to the city of Boston.\n  I have trouble with the underlying bill. I oppose the language \ncalling for withdrawal. I hope, after the President vetoes this bill, \nthat this bill then comes back to us and we can vote on it without that \nlanguage in it.\n  But this is a security issue. This is something that has to be done \nin a timely fashion. You can't wait until next year to develop these \nsecurity plans.\n  I am raising my voice in concert with my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle. I am raising my voice in opposition to amendment No. 648, \nwhich seeks to strip out the funding for this National Special Security \nEvent. As a former local elected official, I understand folks at the \nlocal level simply do not have the capacity for what would be imposed \non them in many instances, with national law enforcement directives \ntelling them you have to do this and you have to do that. That, as we \nsaid before, was what we used to call unfunded mandates. It is \nsomething locals cannot do. Every dollar will be focused on security. \nThere will be an accounting process for it.\n  The beginning of that process dealing with the security issues has to \nbe now. This is something that should be dealt with. I think it is \nappropriate to be in this supplemental. Again, I have problems with \nother parts of the supplemental, other language. I suspect we will have \na chance to vote on it again. But in whatever form it leaves this body, \nthis language should be there. It is the right thing to do if you care \nabout national security.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nthe Department of Homeland Security, Secretary Chertoff, declaring the \nRepublican National Convention to be a National Special Security Event.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Department of\n\n\n                                            Homeland Security,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2007.\n     Hon. Tim Pawlenty,\n     Governor of Minnesota,\n     Saint Paul, MN.\n       Dear Governor Pawlenty: On January 31, 2007, you requested \n     that the Republican National Convention (RNC), occurring in \n     the City of St. Paul, Minnesota, from September 1-5, 2008, be \n     designated as a National Special Security Event (NSSE). After \n     careful consideration, this letter is to advise you that the \n     RNC will be designated as an NSSE.\n       The U.S. Secret Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, \n     and Federal Emergency Management Agency serve as the Federal \n     agencies with lead responsibilities for NSSEs. Those agencies \n     will partner with other Federal, State, and local law \n     enforcement and public safety organizations in the \n     development of a comprehensive strategy addressing all \n     security and incident management related aspects of the NSSE. \n     Additionally, at the appropriate time prior to the \n     convention, I will assign a Principal Federal Official.\n       I would like to commend you, your staff, and the event \n     planners in the City of St. Paul for the detailed security \n     planning that has been accomplished thus far.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael Chertoff,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining to both sides?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington has 4 \nminutes; 5 minutes for the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I don't see the Senator from Oklahoma. He has some time. \nI assume he will be coming to the floor, since we will be going to a \nvote shortly.\n\n[[Page S4017]]\n\n  I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nWashington. When we go to the two amendments on the Secure Rural \nSchools Act under the order, I have a couple of minutes and the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina, Senator Burr has a couple of \nminutes. But since there was this opportunity as a result of the \ngraciousness of Senator Murray, I wish to mention a letter that came in \nfrom the sheriff of Douglas County, which is in southwestern Oregon. \nThis is an area he is policing, the sheriff notes, that is slightly \nlarger than Connecticut. In other words, his county is extraordinarily \nlarge.\n  If this money is not forthcoming, funds that would be made available \nunder the county payments, this is what the sheriff says will take \nplace:\n\n       There are no Troopers. We are running out of deputies. And, \n     if we lose access to this Federal funding, the people will \n     essentially be left to provide their own public safety. There \n     is no fallback position for the citizens.\n\n  The sheriff goes on to say:\n\n       This is not a matter crying wolf or exaggerating our \n     problems. This is quite simply the fork in the road where we \n     make a choice. Does local government in rural Oregon cease to \n     exist, or are we partially and temporarily spared in hopes of \n     securing some means of providing for ourselves?\n\n  I think the comments from Chris Brown, the Douglas County sheriff, \nwhich just came in, say it all. What the legislation we are going to be \nvoting on in a few minutes is all about is ensuring the Federal \nGovernment keep its obligation to rural communities, where the Federal \nGovernment owns most of the land. This is not welfare. I have tried to \ngo into how this came about several times in the course of the debate \nover the last couple of days. The reality is that when the Federal \nForest System was created more than 100 years ago and these rural \ncommunities were in a position where they could not maximize their \nrevenues from these lands, the Federal Government struck an agreement. \nThe Federal Government said: We will be there to at least partially \noffer funding for the essential services such as those that Chris \nBrown, the Douglas County sheriff, has written to us about.\n  The reality is, the distinguished Senator from Washington knows--and \nwe are very pleased that she is a cosponsor with 18 other Senators in \nthe bipartisan ``county amendments'' legislation--we have huge problems \nin our part of the world, with serious drugs, particularly \nmethamphetamine. What Chris Brown is saying, this Douglas County \nsheriff, with respect to his area--which is, as he notes, as large as \nthe State of Connecticut--is that he is going to be essentially \ndefenseless in terms of protecting public safety for his folks in \nsouthwestern Oregon without this funding. He is not alone. The sheriff \nof Grants Pass told me recently that without this funding he is looking \nat the prospect of calling out the National Guard.\n  We will have our debate for 2 minutes each when we go to this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield back all time on both sides.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 709\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has been yielded back. \nThere will now be 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation \nto the Wyden amendment.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to support the bipartisan \ngroup of 19 Senators and vote for the Wyden amendment and reject the \nBurr amendment. In voting for the Wyden amendment and rejecting the \nBurr amendment, Senators will be standing with the National Association \nof Counties, the National Governors Association, the 1,500 member \norganizations of the National Forest Counties and Schools Coalition and \nlabor groups from across the land.\n  The Burr amendment purports to affect only the increase in funding \nbut, as was pointed out in this morning's debate, the Burr amendment \naffects all funding, new and existing. As a result, the Burr amendment \nwould stand in conflict with numerous State laws. The new formula in \nthe bipartisan Wyden amendment is fair, fully paid for, and would \nensure that America's rural communities can survive. I urge my \ncolleagues to not walk away from the Federal Government's 100-year \npromise to rural America. Support the Wyden amendment and reject the \nBurr amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to my friend and cosponsor, Senator \nCraig.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon has spoken well to \nthis issue. It is critical we vote now, that we vote for the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Oregon and reject the amendment of the \nSenator from North Carolina for micromanaging a decision that ought to \nbe made at the local school district level when it comes to the \nallocation of these resources. The Federal Government and this Senate \nshould not be telling the local school district in Nezperce, ID, or in \na county such as Idaho County, ID: Here is how you are going to spend \nyour money. We know better than the local school district or the local \npatrons of that district.\n  I hope you vote no on Burr and support the bipartisan amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Wyoming (Mr. Enzi) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 716\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is now in order to consider the\n\n[[Page S4018]]\n\nBurr amendment, with 1 minute of debate on each side.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in a moment, we are going to hear from \nSenator Burr and Senator Wyden on this amendment. I would tell our \ncolleagues that we have three more votes that will be limited to 10 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, let me ask my colleagues to listen because I \nthink there are some misconceptions about what I am trying to do.\n  In 1908, we created this program. We reauthorized it in 2000. It was \nsupposed to sunset a year ago. We have decided to continue the program. \nI supported the Wyden amendment.\n  There are three areas that receive funds from this amendment: Forest \nService payments, BLM land, and the third fund is payments in lieu of \ntaxes. I am only affecting one title of the first item, which is Forest \nService payments. It is not doing anything to payments in lieu of taxes \nor BLM land.\n  Title 1, since 1908, has said the money could be used for schools or \nroads. That one title has 177 million new dollars in it. My amendment \nsays 80 percent of the new dollars will go to education, to educate our \nchildren. It does not affect title 2, which is forest programs; it does \nnot affect title 3, which is law enforcement, search and rescue. It is \nbasically saying: At this time, our investment is going to go to our \nchildren.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to vote against the Burr \namendment because it significantly undermines what the Senate just \nvoted for. The Burr amendment purports to affect only the increase in \nfunds, but, as was pointed out in this morning's debate, the Burr \namendment would affect all funding, new and existing, and as a result, \nthe Burr amendment would stand in direct conflict with numerous State \nlaws.\n  What the Burr amendment would do is disrupt funding decisions and \nlocal government operations around the country. In many localities, \ncounty governments and school districts operate separate and distinct \nbudgets. Under the Burr amendment, local government decisions would, in \neffect, be overturned and we would go to a one-size-fits-all Federal \nmandate instead of local communities deciding about their future and \ntheir kids' education. Their hands would be tied in Washington, DC.\n  I urge the Senate to reject this bureaucratic straightjacket and vote \nno on the Burr amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment of the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There will now be 2 minutes evenly divided on \namendment No. 657.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, has 1 minute.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the amendment we are considering says the \nagriculture supplemental we put forward is going to be paid for. The \nAgriculture Department is the sixth largest corporation in the United \nStates, when you look at it. What it says is we ought to be able to use \nsome of the $8 billion they have sitting in the pot now and we ought to \nbe able to find a way to make them 3 percent more efficient so we can \nactually pay $4.1 billion to help in the agricultural emergency we have \nin this country.\n  It does not add it. We do not charge it to our grandchildren. We say \nwe are going to be responsible, and we are going to take it out of the \nmoney that is in there now that is easily findable. We will actually \npay for helping our farmers who need our help today.\n  It is the exact same language the appropriations bill has for both \ncattle producers and grain producers. It just says: Find it within the \nagency, pay for it, and we will do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I hope the Senate will oppose this \nmeasure. The agricultural disaster program that was put in the \nsupplemental bill is a bipartisan piece of legislation. Senator Conrad, \nmyself, Senator Kit Bond, Senator Dianne Feinstein--many of us worked \ntogether to put this in the legislation.\n  It is very simple. It reaches out a helping hand to those farmers, in \nmany cases who lost everything, to say: You are not alone. This country \nwants to help you during tough times.\n  We have always--we have always--provided disaster relief on an \nemergency basis, except for the last several years; it has been \nblocked. This is the opportunity, on a bipartisan basis, for us to say \nto family farmers: You matter to this country. We want to help you. \nWhen you have had a weather-related disaster, we are here to help.\n  I hope we will turn down the amendment offered by my colleague from \nOklahoma.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on the previous vote, vote No. 120, I \nvoted ``yea.'' I wish to change my vote to ``nay.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be permitted to change my vote from ``yea'' to ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on amendment No. 648.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. This is simple. It is not an emergency. Eighteen months \nfrom now we are going to have the Presidential nominating conventions. \nIn Atlanta, during the Olympics, for a month the entire security was \n$10 million. If we triple that amount for a month, you have $30 \nmillion. This bill allows $100 million for conventions and for \ndecisions that are already going to be made prior to that so that the \npolitical parties can have a good time. Yet we are going to ask our \nchildren to pay for it. You are going to vote to ask your grandchildren \nto pay for a party you aren't having now, when the President already \nhas $15 million in his budget for Secret Service for both of these \nconventions, which they feel is adequate at this time.\n  The question is not whether we should do it. If we are going to do \nit, we should do it inside the confines of the budget. Two, it is not \nan emergency. We have 18 months. We have plenty of appropriations bills \nto pay for this.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield a minute to the Senator from Minnesota and then \na minute to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, the world has changed since Atlanta. \nSince 9/11, this type of funding was available to Boston and it was \navailable to New York City. There is absolutely no flexibility in \nscheduling the security in these cities. This month, the Director of \nHomeland Security declared Minneapolis-St. Paul a National Special \nSecurity Event. Secret Service will be the lead agency for one part of \nit, the FBI will be the lead for another, and FEMA for another part.\n  I say to my conservative colleagues, this is an unfunded mandate. \nThese cities don't have a choice. The Feds tell them what they have to \ndo. There is no flexibility in scheduling. This money needs to be put \ninto place. We know the uncertainty of the appropriations process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. In a March 5 letter from Secretary Chertoff, he \nindicated the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, MN, will be \ndesignated a National Special Security Event. In a March 9 letter, \nSenators Allard, Coleman, Klobuchar, and myself asked for this \nassistance in appropriations, and it was included in there.\n  We have to remember we are living in a post-9/11 world. We are going \nto have 100 Senators, 435 Members of Congress, the President of the \nUnited States, and the Vice President all in this place at that one \ntime. It is important for us to make sure we are providing the kinds of \nsecurity they need.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). All time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Iowa be recognized for 10 minutes; that immediately \nfollowing the Senator from Iowa, the Senator from South Carolina be \nrecognized for 5 minutes, and then we immediately return to regular \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the Durbin amendment is a perfect \nexample of why authorizing on an appropriations bill ought to be \ndiscouraged. I know many Members are under extreme pressure from their \nhospitals to support the Durbin amendment, but I would encourage you to \nread the actual language and consider the consequences of what this \namendment actually does.\n  This amendment will lead to anarchy in the Medicaid financial \narrangements. As a result of the amendment, CMS will be prohibited from \nbanning bad-actor States from reinstating the questionable schemes \nCongress has been trying to root out since 1991. This is because the \nDurbin amendment broadly--very broadly--prevents CMS from taking any \naction relating to this rule or any rule that would affect Medicaid or \nSCHIP in a similar manner.\n  For years, Medicaid was plagued by financial gamesmanship. States \nused so-called intergovernmental transfers to create scams that milked \ntaxpayers out of millions, even billions of dollars. An example: A \nState bills the Federal Government for a $100 hospital charge. The \nhospital gets the $100 payment, and then the State would require the \nhospital to give $25 of it back to the State. In my view, that is a \nscam. What happens, then, to the $25? In the days before Congress and \nCMS cracked\n\n[[Page S4020]]\n\ndown on the behavior, the money could go to roads or to stadium \nconstruction. That is right, Medicaid paid for roads and stadiums \ninstead of health care for the very poor. Because of the way the Durbin \namendment is written, States could return to the financial schemes \nwhere they used Medicaid funds for porkbarrel projects.\n  In 1991, 1997, and again in the year 2000, Congress took specific \naction to limit a State's ability to use payment schemes to avoid \npaying a State's share of Medicaid. The Durbin amendment blows all that \naway.\n  I would like to read from a letter from Leslie Norwalk, Acting \nCommissioner of CMS, released today:\n\n       The Durbin amendment is so broadly drafted that it would \n     seriously limit the agency's ability to do the normal program \n     oversight to ensure program integrity. If enacted, it could \n     prevent CMS from disapproving State plan amendments that \n     violate, for example, the 1991 provisions on taxes and \n     donations, the 1997 limitations on limiting Federal \n     expenditures to the State plan, and the 2000 phase-down of \n     upper payment limits.\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       We are deeply concerned that if enacted, the Durbin \n     amendment would reverse this progress and reopen the Federal \n     Treasury to the abuses of the past.\n\n  Madam President, it is one thing to complain about the CMS rule; it \nis quite another thing entirely to overturn 16 years of congressional \naction with this amendment.\n  Let us talk for a moment about the rule in question. The core goal of \nthe rule is to limit provider reimbursement to actual cost. What is \nwrong with just paying actual cost? I know some people consider this a \nradical idea, but I just don't understand why anyone thinks it is a \ngood idea to have hospitals paid more than the cost so that they can be \npart of these scams which rob the taxpayers to fund State pork.\n  Restricting payments to cost is not exactly a new idea. In 1994, the \nGovernment Accountability Office recommended that payments to \nGovernment providers be limited to cost. This is a fundamental issue of \nprogram integrity.\n  What did the GAO find in their 1994 report leading to that \nconclusion? The State of Michigan used these questionable transfers to \nreduce its share of Medicaid programs from 68 percent, which is what it \nshould have been, to 56 percent. The GAO found evidence that in October \nof 1993, the State of Michigan made a $489 million payment to the \nUniversity of Michigan. Within hours, the entire $489 million was \nreturned to the State. The report found that in fiscal year 1993, \nMichigan, Tennessee, and Texas were able to obtain $800 million in \nFederal matching funds without putting up the State's share.\n  Congress and CMS have spent the last 15 years combating this \nbehavior. It makes no sense for Congress to roll back the clock and \nallow these crazy practices to come back.\n  Over the past 4 years, CMS has been working with States to try to \nlimit these scams. These efforts have not been without their \ncontroversy. States have been very concerned about exactly what the new \nstandards are. Senator Baucus and I wrote to the Government \nAccountability Office and asked them to look into what CMS has been up \nto. We have been concerned that there has not been enough transparency \nin what CMS has done.\n  CMS has now published a rule. It is out there in the--government for \neverybody to look at. The rule stops improper transfers. The rule \nlimits providers to cost. The rule requires payments matched up to \nclaim. Just good accounting.\n  Let me speak to that last one specifically--matched up to claim. Too \noften in Medicaid, States are allowed to bill for services without \nbeing able to document that an actual service occurred. We have a \nprogram which spends hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars. We have \na rule which requires that the program better document where the money \nis spent.\n  What on Earth is going on that I have to come down to the floor to \nobject to an amendment on an appropriations bill that tries to prevent \na rule that protects the integrity of the Medicaid Program from going \ninto effect, especially a responsible rule?\n  In 2005, the Finance Committee held a 2-day oversight hearing on the \nMedicaid Program. As a part of that hearing, we focused on continuing \nproblems of States recycling funds. CMS has acted to stop that. If some \npeople think CMS has gone too far, then we should review their actions \nin the Finance Committee. We should call CMS in, make them testify, and \nask the tough questions to which we need answers. If we think there are \nthings we should have done differently, then we should legislate. That \nis the way it ought to be done.\n  I want us to ask tough questions about the definition of ``Government \nprovider.'' I want to make sure that requiring schools to file claims \nisn't going to impede access to care for kids. I would like to know if \nthe rule overturns arrangements such as the one the State of Iowa has \ncreated to provide a lump-sum payment to the University of Iowa and \nBroadlawns Hospital in Des Moines to care for the Medicaid patients. \nThat is the right way to operate. We should deal with it in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  That is why I have, as a general rule, objected to moving legislation \nin our jurisdiction on appropriations bills. The issues here are \nextremely complex. They deserve thorough consideration so we can assure \nthe right action. Instead, we are here with this amendment. No hearings \nhave been held, no testimony submitted, nothing.\n\n  This amendment throws the baby out with the bathwater. Then the \nbathtub goes out, and then the bathroom--this is the whole house. It \nundoes 16 years of sound public policy.\n  My amendment allows CMS to move forward to protect the Medicaid \nProgram from fraud, to protect Medicaid integrity, and to ensure \npayments are not made inappropriately. We should stop an amendment that \ngives CMS a 2-year holiday from stopping fraud. We should stop an \namendment that gives CMS a 2-year holiday from protecting program \nintegrity. We should stop an amendment that gives CMS a 2-year holiday \nfrom stopping inappropriate payments.\n  Members should vote on my amendment so that it forces us to sit down \nand take a serious look at what we are doing here before we make a \nserious mistake we will all regret.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. At this time, then, I would ask unanimous consent to \nset aside the amendment before the body and that we take up Grassley \namendment No. 701 to the Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I heard the objection. I can't believe anyone would \nobject. So we are objecting to protecting Medicaid from fraud? We are \nobjecting to protecting the integrity of the Medicaid Program? We are \nobjecting to stopping inappropriate Medicaid payments?\n  We are making a mistake. I hope this gets fixed in conference, and I \nam going to work to do that. I regret the objection, but I understand \nwhy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, this bill is moving along very fast, and \nI compliment the majority and minority leaders for allowing the process \nto move forward in a quick fashion, because we understand the outcome. \nThe bill most likely will pass in its current form, maybe with some \nchanges, but at the end of the day, it will be vetoed.\n  I was listening earlier in the day to Senators Hagel and Webb discuss \nan amendment they had proposed. I am not sure whether it is germane, \nbut the two Senators, who do deserve the respect of everyone in this \nbody because they have been in combat, they have been in harm's way, \nhad an amendment talking about force structure, how you would change \nthe rotations, and the concerns this war has placed on the military. \nWell, those concerns are real, and I understand what they are trying to \nachieve there.\n  The reason I wanted to speak before we went to final passage is I \nknow why the veto is coming. There are two components to this bill that \nthe President should veto the bill over: No. 1, the restrictions we are \nplacing on our military, and the deadlines and the timelines and the \nbenchmarks all add up to making it impossible for the new\n\n[[Page S4021]]\n\nstrategy of General Petraeus to be successful, if it became law. This \nis a constitutional encroachment upon the power of the Commander in \nChief which I believe is unprecedented. There is an honorable path for \nCongress to take; that is, just stop funding a war that you think is \nlost. But the combination of deadlines, benchmarks, timelines, and \nmicromanaging troop rotations all adds up to Congress really taking \nover wartime activity in a way that was never envisioned before. I \ndon't think any other commander is going to have to go through what \nGeneral Petraeus would have to go through if we did pass this bill and \nit were not vetoed.\n  I have been a military lawyer for 20-some years. The combat folks in \nhere have been in harm's way. As a military lawyer, I have had some \nclients who wanted to kill me, but that is about it. So my hat is off \nto the warfighters. I have been in a support role, and there are \nthousands of doctors and nurses and lawyers and other support personnel \nserving in Iraq, and they are very much needed. There is no front line \nin Iraq or Afghanistan, so my hat is off to all of them. But the \nwarfighter's point of view is what we need to be thinking about.\n  From the commander's point of view, General Petraeus has been \nassigned to a mission. He has come up with a new doctrine. Even the \nworst critic cannot say it is not something new. It is clearly \nsomething new. Whether it works I can't promise, but I think it has a \ngood chance and there are early signs of success. It is making up for \npast mistakes.\n  The President is going to veto this bill because Congress has come up \nwith a constitutional construct that, if allowed to exist, I believe \nwould create dangers for future Commanders in Chief and future wars \nthat are just unnecessary. I know the political moment for Iraq is not \npopular. I know people are frustrated and upset and we have made tons \nof mistakes, but the biggest mistake would be to throw the \nconstitutional balance we have enjoyed for 200 years out of kilter and \ntry to take over this war in a way we are not built to take over as a \nCongress.\n  There is a way to cut off this funding. We just haven't chosen to go \ndown that road, and I don't know why. If you think it is lost, then \nthat is the road to go down.\n  The second part of the bill that has met with objection is the number \nof projects unrelated to the war--for lack of a better word, porkbarrel \nspending. And it may not be porkbarrel spending. Some of these projects \nare probably very worthy. I just don't believe this is the way to fund \nthem.\n  The emergency supplemental appropriations process for the war is \nneeded, but we shouldn't have an emergency appropriation. This war has \nbeen going on for 4 years, so hopefully next year we will not find \nourselves in this spot. If we do not get the funds over to our \ncommanders and into the DOD pipeline, then readiness is hurt, the \nability to prosecute the war is compromised beginning April 15, and \nevery month thereafter, it gets more difficult.\n  So the President is going to veto the bill for two sound reasons. The \nconstruct Congress has created is taking the Congress in an area we \nhave never gone before that I believe would be devastating to future \nwars. It would undermine General Petraeus' ability to be successful in \nhis mission. The spending practices this bill embraces is what has put \nCongress in such low standing with the American public.\n  Republicans lost for a reason. We didn't treat the process in a \nrespectful way. Our Democratic friends, with some Republican help, are \nmaking the problem worse when it comes to fiscal matters. So I do hope \nthat once the veto is rendered we can find a way to get the money to \nthe troops who are desperately in need of it over time, and we can find \na way to come together and give General Petraeus a decent opportunity \nto turn Iraq around.\n  I end on this note. What drives my thinking and what makes me \ndisagree with Senator Webb and Senator Hagel--people who have \nexperienced combat--is that I believe the outcome in Iraq is part of \nthe overall war on terror. If we lose in Iraq--and I think this bill \nwould ensure a loss if it ever became law--the ripple effect is \ncatastrophic; the war gets bigger, not smaller. A failed state in Iraq \nis a huge loss in the war on terror. It compromises our national \nsecurity for decades.\n  That is the way I see it, and I will take every vote in this body \nviewing Iraq as a central battlefront in the war on terror, one we \ncannot afford to lose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator \nfrom Kentucky be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes on the \nunderlying bill, and at the end of that time or yielding back of that \ntime we return to the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I rise today to voice my strong \nopposition to the emergency supplemental bill. The supplemental bill on \nthe floor today is irresponsible. Since coming to the Congress 20-plus \nyears ago, I have pushed for accountability and fiscal responsibility. \nWhen the Democrats took a page from the Republican playbook and said \nthey would be responsible with the taxpayers' money, I wanted to \nbelieve them. I can see now that all the Democratic promises to the \nAmerican people last fall were only empty words.\n  This bill is an insult to our men and women in uniform and every \nsingle American taxpayer. To me, this is not a political game. I came \nto the floor last year to oppose additional spending in the emergency \nsupplemental bill. It had nondefense spending like $20 million for \noyster fishermen in New England and $4 million for erosion control \nprojects in California and Michigan, and that draft was put together by \na Republican Congress.\n  The extra funds I opposed last year pale in comparison to what the \nDemocrats have done this year. Unfortunately, it has become routine to \nsee emergency spending bills on the Senate floor. I understand the \npressing need for this legislation to defend America from terrorism and \nsupport our ongoing efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The purpose of the \nPresident's request is to protect and pay the men and women serving in \nour Armed Forces.\n  It also provides the funding needed to restore damaged military \nequipment and to purchase new state-of-the-art technology. This \nemergency supplemental is important to provide for American armed \nservices the additional funds they need right now. However, this \nlegislation goes far beyond necessary emergency defense spending. The \nmajority is using budgetary gimmicks to pay for political handouts and \nentitlements on the backs of our fighting men and women. Mixed in the \ndefense spending is a complicated list of earmark legislative language \nand program expansions.\n  Let me walk you through part of the bill. The hurricanes of 2005 were \ntruly devastating, and I have supported the Government's rebuilding \nefforts in the region. But this bill before us today includes $1.45 \nbillion in unrequested and unnecessary funding for the Corps of \nEngineers. It also eliminates a 10-percent local matching requirement \nfor FEMA funds and eliminates the prohibition on forgiving community \ndisaster loans.\n  These are two provisions Congress has supported in the past to ensure \nresponsible spending. These provisions are not only inappropriate for a \nwartime supplemental, but they are also bad policy.\n  Another area of extra spending relates to agriculture. I have been a \nstrong supporter of America's farms, but the programs in this bill are \nroutinely funded through the regular process. I cannot justify \nsupporting $3 million for Hawaiian sugar cane co-ops or $20 million for \ninsect damage in Nevada on a wartime supplemental bill. This bill is \nabout our troops, not our farmers.\n  There are even more glaring examples in this bill. There is $3.5 \nmillion for Capital Guide Services to provide service for tourism in \nthis very building. It adds $100 million for dairy production losses; \n$13 million for a lamb replacement and retention program; $40 million \nfor the tree assistance program; $6 million for flooded croplands in \nNorth Dakota; $25 million for asbestos abatement at the Capitol \npowerplant; $23 million for geothermal energy research. The list goes \non and on.\n  I cannot support requests like these on the backs of our fighting men \nand\n\n[[Page S4022]]\n\nwomen. I will support every effort to strip all the nondefense funding \nout of this bill. It is time to show fiscal restraint and use emergency \nwartime spending legislation for precisely that purpose--to pay for the \nwar and not for domestic pork projects.\n  Finally, I want to address the single most important issue in the \nsupplemental, the shortsighted and political call for troop withdrawal. \nThis bill includes similar language to that which was rejected by the \nSenate 2 weeks ago. It calls for the withdrawal of troops starting 120 \ndays after passage of the bill and sets an arbitrary goal of full \nwithdrawal from Iraq by March 31, 2008. I voted against this language 2 \nweeks ago, I voted against it yesterday, and I will continue to vote \nagainst it. As I have stated repeatedly, I do not support micromanaging \nthe war. It is counterproductive and sends a detrimental message to our \ntroops and emboldens our enemies.\n  I want my colleagues to understand that without the U.S. military, \nIraq would become a vacuum that would threaten the stability of the \nentire Middle East. I share the desire to have the Iraqis defend \nthemselves, and our military is providing them with important training. \nBut that cannot happen based on an arbitrary deadline.\n  I want to warn the other side of the aisle, if you try to force the \nAmerican military out of Iraq, you will be responsible for the chaos \nthat will ensue. Without the United States, Iraq would emerge as a \ntraining ground for all al-Qaida and terrorist organizations. I believe \nthe power vacuum would lead to genocide and murdering far worse than \nthe terrorist attacks that are now occurring in Iraq.\n\n  Without the United States, there would be greater threat to Israel, \nand Iran would become the dominant country in the Middle East.\n  I want my colleagues to think about the path this troop withdrawal \nlanguage takes us down. I stand for the men and women serving in Iraq \nby supporting their mission, but this bill does the opposite. It \nundermines the military's ability to act.\n  We need to listen to the commanders on the ground instead of pulling \nthe rug out from under them. This supplemental is not a strategy for \nsuccess. It is a recipe for defeat. Now is precisely the wrong time to \nsend this message. I believe we may be turning the corner in Iraq. We \nmay already see some success, based on recent reports from General \nPetraeus. Sectarian killing has been lowered in Baghdad over the last \nseveral weeks, and many Iraqi families have been returning to their \nhomes. Some of my colleagues would rather ignore these small signs and \nthe opportunities to succeed in Iraq by pursuing a partisan political \nagenda.\n  This bill should be a commitment to General Petraeus and our \nsoldiers. It should be a mandate for them to secure democracy in Iraq \nand protect America from terrorism. I rise to ask my colleagues to join \nme in opposing this bill. This may be the most important legislation we \naddress all year. It is an opportunity to tell General Petraeus and our \nfighting men and women in uniform that we support them. It is an \nopportunity to tell the people of Iraq that we will not cut and run and \nwill not give in to political pressure, allowing us to affect our \ndecisions on the floor of the Senate. It is an opportunity to defend \nAmerica from terrorism.\n  This bill is a mistake that we cannot afford, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator \nfrom Nevada be given 10 minutes to speak, and after using his time or \nyielding back his time we revert to the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 752 and 753\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator allowing me to \nspeak. There is an amendment being negotiated and, hopefully, we will \nbe able to have a vote on what I believe is a very important amendment.\n  In this emergency bill there are some things that some might consider \nan emergency, and there are others that I would not classify as an \nemergency. But there are things in the country that truly are an \nemergency. My amendment attempts to address one of the most pressing \nissues happening in our country today.\n  My amendment provides additional funding for the Adam Walsh Act that \nwe passed last year. As each Senator knows, the Adam Walsh bill \nprovides law enforcement with the tools to go after child predators. It \nalso gives parents the tools they need to protect their own children. \nMy amendment provides funding for the Adam Walsh bill. Simply, my \namendment provides $12.5 million in funding for U.S. Marshals to track \ndown the estimated 100,000 convicted sex offenders who have failed to \nregister as a sex offender. It provides $12.5 million in funding for \nthe U.S. Attorneys Offices to prosecute child pornographers and people \nwho exploit children.\n  This amendment does not include any new spending. This amendment is \noffset by eliminating the $25 million in funding in this bill for the \nDepartment of State's Educational and Culturing Exchange Program. While \nthat might be a worthy program, certainly I do not believe it compares \nto the priority of locking up sexual predators and protecting the \nchildren of the United States. Earlier this year, just less than 2 \nmonths ago, we provided over $445 million for this same exchange \nprogram.\n  There are many true emergencies, but this Congress is required to \nmake difficult decisions. We were elected to make sure that we spend \nmoney on what is most important. For a parent, protecting their child \nfrom harm is one of their top priorities. It certainly is for myself \nand my wife. Protecting children from an online predator has to be \nabsolutely one of our nation's top priorities. That is why I believe my \namendment is necessary.\n  According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, \nwe know there are about 100,000 unregistered sex offenders in the \nUnited States.\n  The dangers these predators present to our children are very serious. \nLast year, I chaired a subcommittee hearing at the Commerce Committee \nabout this very issue. What we discovered--what the testimony revealed \nwas shocking. The average sexual predator who targets females will \nmolest, on average, 130 young girls over the predator's lifetime. Let \nme say that again, on average one predator will victimize 130 young \ngirls.\n  If the predator targets males, the predator will molest 180 young \nboys. I know that these statics sound so unbelievable that they could \nnot possible be true, but sadly they are. That is why the dangers these \npredators present to our children is very real.\n  Giving law enforcement the tools to track down unregistered sex \noffenders, to give prosecutors the tools to prosecute people who \nexploit these children is critical.\n  I have heard from law enforcement agencies in my home State, that the \nAdam Walsh bill is making a real difference in our neighborhoods and \ncommunities.\n  Our children are safer for it. We need to continue to do everything \nin our power to eradicate child predators in our communities or as \nparents we won't be able to have a moment of peace. Too many families \nand children have been victimized by these predators who leave wounds \nthat do not heal. That is why we must commit the resources necessary to \nprotect our children. That is why I believe that funding the Adam Walsh \nbill is so important. I urge my colleagues to adopt this important \namendment.\n  Now, I am sure that cultural exchange is important, but can we \ncompare cultural exchange programs to the importance of protecting the \nAmerican children? Madam President, I think not. I would urge my \ncolleagues to adopt this amendment unanimously.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S4023]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 675\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk. My \namendment deletes unrelated measures to the spending bill. It includes \na number of things, as you know, that we have talked about some. It \nincludes the Transportation Department backlog of $389 million; \nfisheries, $216 million; conservation security, $115 million; tree \nassistance, $40 million; asbestos abatement, $25 million; Presidential \nnominating conventions, $180 million; MILC programs, $31 million; \nLIHEAP, $640.\n  As you know, the purpose of this bill is an emergency spending bill. \nI came to the floor during the budget debate to express my displeasure \nabout the process and specifically with emergency spending. The bill \nbefore us now is a prime example. It started out as $100 billion in \nemergency spending for ongoing combat, added another $18 billion of \nadditional nonemergency spending and a host of other things.\n  So I simply wish to make it clear that these provisions--many of them \nhave merit, no question about that but, unfortunately, this bill is not \nwhere they belong. It is the wrong vehicle. I have tried for a number \nof years to get drought relief in the normal course of funding and will \ncontinue to do that for agriculture. But it does not make it emergency \nspending.\n  So, in any event, in the beginning of the fiscal year, Members of the \nSenate have said they were going to get our financial house in order. \nWe are hoping to do that. I think this is not the way to do that. The \nAmerican public deserves to know whether Members of the Senate who have \ncommitted themselves to get their financial house in order will back up \ntheir words with action.\n  So these are extraneous provisions that have little or nothing to do \nwith meeting the supplies needed by our troops. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment. I have amendment 675 at the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I am disappointed that the majority has \nnot allowed me the chance to offer my amendment. We have a long \ntradition of Members debating and considering amendments. I have been \ndenied the opportunity, and other Members have been denied the \nopportunity. I am very sorry for that.\n  I think it is fair to say the majority party in the Senate is \nattempting to turn the body into the House where the rights of the \nminority are ignored.\n  It is a sad day for the body. The American public wants Congress to \ndebate these tough issues. In any event, after the election, the new \nmajority indicated it will not be business as usual.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Colorado be recognized for 7 minutes and that upon the completion \nof his remarks or yielding back of his time we revert to the regular \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nallowing me to speak and granting me the time right here in my \nschedule.\n  I rise today to reflect on the current emergency supplemental bill \nthat is before us. I believe, as many do in this body, the current \nsituation in Iraq is not sustainable but that it requires positive \nchange, not defeatism. I think the worst thing we could do would be to \ngive the terrorists of the world an opportunity to declare victory. In \nthe long run, that would make it more difficult to assure Americans \nwill be safe.\n  This bill includes conditions that do not support the commanders on \nthe ground and sets artificial deadlines for troop withdrawal. I have \nconsistently said we should give the President's plan time to work. \nThere are signs it is.\n  I read today General McCaffrey's assessment. While not upbeat, he did \nfind that ``the situation on the ground has clearly and measurably \nimproved.'' He says we have ``little time left.'' I agree. But ``little \ntime'' is not to set a deadline. Doing so changes the entire strategic \npicture. If you will forgive me some frivolity, it is the difference \nbetween the 2-minute warning and the ninth inning. We do not want to \nlet the insurgents know they just have to let the clock run down. The \ninsurgents might not be actually watching C-SPAN, but they do know what \nwe do here, what we say here and can plan accordingly. This is not the \ntime to micromanage the war from Washington and the Congress.\n  Outside this body, decisions have been made for a new direction in \nIraq. The President has laid out his new strategy to the public. ADM \nWilliam Fallon is in place as CENTCOM commander whose area of \nresponsibility is Iraq. We have a new commander of our forces in Iraq, \nand that is GEN David Petraeus. Let me remind those who need to hear it \nthat we sent him to Iraq by a vote of 81 to 0 to win, not to withdraw. \nSoon we will have a new diplomatic team on the ground in Baghdad as \nwell.\n  This shift in strategies also includes something I believe is \nabsolutely imperative to success: a real commitment from the Iraqi \nPrime Minister to get his Government to play a much stronger role in \nthe destiny of Iraq. The President is confident we now have that \ncommitment. I hope we can move on to more pressing issues in the Senate \nrather than repeating the same ones time and again.\n  One reason I do not support the withdrawal language is I believe it \nis based on an assumption that by leaving Iraq Americans will be safer. \nThe terrorists have made it abundantly clear that Iraq is central to \ntheir war against the civilized world. They are committed to fighting \nthere and will not stop unless we defeat them. If we have to fight, it \nis preferable not to fight on our own soil.\n  We are also facing a credible veto threat. This bill is going \nnowhere--at least nowhere beyond the President's desk, which means we \nare delaying the needed funds for our military. This is no surprise. \nThe President has been very clear. When he has been this clear, he has \nnot deviated from his described track that he will follow.\n  I hope we can get past this and move on to more pressing issues such \nas passing a bill that will provide our troops the money they need.\n  Finally, I will not support this bill because the last thing we need \nto do in Congress is hurt the morale or the mission of our men and \nwomen fighting in Iraq, especially when we have adopted the President's \nplan, which is a brandnew plan to succeed in Iraq. I believe it is the \nright course for our troops on the ground at this time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Idaho be allowed to speak for 5 minutes, that the Senator from \nVermont be allowed to speak for 1 minute, and that the Senator from \nIllinois be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the manager of the \nbill, the Senator from Washington.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On Page S4023, March 28, 2007, the following appears: I believe \nit is the right course for our troops on the ground at this time. \nMr. President, I rise today....\n  \n  The online version has been corrected to read: I believe it is \nthe right course for our troops on the ground at this time.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized. Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the \nmanager of the bill, the Senator from Washington. Mr. President, I \nrise today ....\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the dangers of \ncongressional micromanagement of war and the dangers of a precipitous \nwithdrawal from Iraq. Yesterday, the Senate cast a historic vote to \nwithdrawal our troops from a field of combat. I believe that this vote \nwas a mistake of enormous proportions. Now both the Senate and House \nhave included language in an emergency supplemental funding bill to \nmicromanage the war and take the authority from our commanding officers \nand our Commander in Chief. The President has rightly expressed his \nconcern over this legislation, stated that he will veto this \nlegislation, and I will vote to uphold his veto.\n  The commanding general in Iraq, General Petraeus, had a large part in \ndrafting this new plan forward. Yet now, numerous Senators have called \nto override his expertise and pull out our troops before this plan has \ntime to work. We are not a body of generals, but of policy makers, and \ntherefore we should not be in the business of setting arbitrary \ndeadlines for retreat, deadlines which are rejected by our military \ncommanders and the Commander\n\n[[Page S4024]]\n\nin Chief. It is the responsibility of the civilian leadership to set \nthe political goals of an engagement, but leave the strategy decisions \nto the experts, the military leadership. It is clear to me that the \nmajority leadership in the House and Senate see fit to preempt our \nmilitary experts and inject their own political ideals into our \nNation's military strategy. I believe that such actions are a great \ndisservice to our men and women fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I \nwill continue to oppose their continued efforts to command our military \ntactics from the U.S. Capitol Building.\n  This bill contains critical funding for our military to ensure that \nour soldiers do receive the body armor, up-armored HMMWVs, and other \nnecessary equipment to keep them safe in combat and allow them to seek \nout and destroy our enemies. The majority party is using this bill to \nplay politics and score points with their base, delaying these \nnecessary funds from reaching our troops. It is absolutely regrettable \nthat my colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted to include this \ndefeatist language on this critical funding bill for our soldiers.\n  I have heard a lot of my colleagues speak out against this war \nbecause of the duration of the war, that we have been in Iraq longer \nthan in World War II, and that because of the duration of our efforts, \nwe should simply retreat and come home. The fact is, we are not engaged \nagainst a standing Nazi German Army. While the United States continues \nto base large numbers of soldiers in Europe and on the DMZ in South \nKorea, we are told by some of our colleagues in the majority that we \nneed to remove our footprint from Iraq completely and immediately, and \nallow these radical fundamentalists to butcher each other in our wake \nand create a new safe haven for terrorism in the Middle East.\n  Our soldiers in Iraq are fighting an insurgency that wears no uniform \nand fights with remote-controlled devices so they remain hidden on the \nbattlefield making the job of our soldiers that much more difficult, \nbut also making it that much more important that our Government \ncontinue to support their mission. No, this is not World War II. But \nthe seriousness of this war is just as critical to the security of our \ncountry and the world.\n  I have stood on this floor several times this year talking not only \nabout the implications to Iraq if we were to suddenly pull our troops \nout without a stable government and security forces in place, but about \nthe implications to our own national security and the larger Middle \nEast. If we were to pull our troops out tomorrow, the kind of \nhumanitarian crisis we would see in Iraq, which would spill into \nneighboring countries in the form of violence and refugees, would be \nastronomical.\n  What then? Do we send more troops back in? Do we rely on an \nineffective United Nations to send in corrupt officials and \npeacekeepers in an attempt to regain some sort of control? No, I do not \nbelieve that the United States should nor can afford to do that, and I \nwill not cast a vote on this floor to allow that to happen.\n  Stability in Iraq, my colleagues say, is merely a pipe dream. \nHowever, we have already seen this new strategy start to work. Violence \nis down in Baghdad and the insurgence and terrorists are pulling out of \nthe capital city and fleeing to the outskirts. Without a stable \nBaghdad, the Iraqi Government cannot rule. Our soldiers, aided by the \nreinforcements sent to Iraq by President Bush, are working very hard to \nprovide the stability they so desperately need. Like every Member of \nthis Chamber, I believe that we need a political solution to the \nsituation in Iraq. However, a political situation cannot be met if \nthere is not stability in the capital city of Baghdad. Some of my \ncolleagues believe that if we pull our troops out of Iraq immediately, \nthe violence will cease and the Government will stand up. It is my \nbelief that the exact opposite will occur.\n\n  As I mentioned, our success in Iraq does not contain itself within \nthe borders of Iraq. Our moderate allies in the Middle East are also \ncounting on our success in the region to ensure that radical states, \nsuch as Iran, do not expand their powerbase to the entire Middle East. \nWithout success in Iraq, and stability in the Middle East, our security \nand that of our allies will be in serious jeopardy.\n  We are already seeing what an instable leader of Iran is capable of \ndoing. After defying U.N. resolution after resolution, the Iranian \nGovernment is moving forward with the enrichment of uranium; a move \nthat could someday soon give them nuclear weapons. Can we trust the \nIranian Government not to use those weapons against Israel, a country \nthat their President has blatantly stated should be ``wiped off the \nmap'', or Europe, or elsewhere around the world? No, I do not believe \nwe can trust their Government to live peacefully with nuclear weapons. \nAnd our presence in the Middle East, along with success in Iraq, will \ngo a long way to prevent that and keep the Iranian Government \ncontained.\n  To those who contend that the United States does not have a very real \ninterest in the Middle East and in a stable Iraq, I would say you are \nwrong. We have both security and economic interests in this part of the \nworld and we cannot ignore that fact. I have been actively engaged in \nour Nation's energy debates to break our dependency on foreign oil. \nHowever, I recognize that this is not a problem that can be achieved \nover night. Our Nation has a real dependency on Middle Eastern oil, and \na destabilized Iraq or a Middle East dominated by Iran would cause \nserious turmoil in the world's oil market and the economies of the \nUnited States and the world. I am working very hard to move our economy \naway from this dependency on foreign oil, and move towards more \ndomestic production; but I also realize that if we leave Iraq before it \ncan be stabilized and allow the Middle East to fall into the hands of \nradical fundamentalists, our economy will be in very real trouble.\n  We live in very serious times, a world where our enemies do not \nobserve internationally recognized sovereign boundaries or governments, \nbut instead choose to rule by terror and fear. If we allow these \ntactics to govern our way of life instead of standing up to them, we \nare essentially inviting the fight to our own backyard. We have the \nbattleground established and we are taking the fight to our enemies; \nyet we are being pushed by the Democrats to pull back from the fight, \ncome home to our shores, and hope that our enemies do not cross the \noceans and follow us home. In our modern world, the vast Pacific and \nAtlantic Oceans are not the barriers they once were, and we need to \nensure we do not end up fighting our enemies at home, when we could \nfight them abroad.\n  I would like to close by saying, again, unequivocally, that I believe \nthe vote yesterday to retreat from Iraq was a serious mistake. Our \nenemies now look upon the United States as a country with no resolve, a \ncountry that will cut and run when things get tough. That, I firmly \nbelieve, is a very dangerous message for this country to be sending to \nour enemies and our friends. The Congress has a responsibility to \nconduct oversight over wars and to provide the necessary funding for \nour soldiers; but Congress does not have, nor should it have, the \nresponsibility to dictate war strategies and tactical decisions. Those \ndecisions should and must be left to the Commander in Chief and our \nexpert military commanders. The President has made very clear that this \nbill will be vetoed, and I will vote to uphold that veto. The Senate \ncast a dangerous precedent yesterday with a vote to play general in \nwar, and I hope that future Congresses choose not to go down this path.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 672\n\n  Mr. President, the senior Senator from Washington, the manager of the \nbill, and I have worked cooperatively together over the last several \nyears for VA funding. But as to the VA funding that is in this bill, \nwhile I am not going to quibble with the amount, I am going to discuss \nwith you for a moment what it does and how it does it.\n  Before I explain to my colleagues the amendment I was going to \noffer--amendment No. 672 that the majority will disagree with, and I \nwill not offer that amendment--I wish to talk about the context of what \nis being offered. Does that sound technical? Well, it is, and it is \nnot.\n  Under the current appropriations law, VA's health care system is \nfunded through three separate accounts: the medical services, the \nmedical administration, and the medical facilities accounts. That may \nsound simple\n\n[[Page S4025]]\n\nenough. However, similar to a lot of things in health care, it is not \nsimple at all.\n  Consider paying a chief of radiology at a VA hospital. You might say: \nWell, he is a health care provider and, therefore, should be paid out \nof the medical services account. However, some of what a chief does--\nmonitoring credentials, overseeing reviews, ordering equipment, et \ncetera--is administrative in character. So some portion of his salary \nis literally charged to that account.\n  That is not simple accounting. It is literally two financial \ntransactions from two separate accounts--just to pay one person's \nsalary.\n  VA has tens of thousands of employees just like this one who must be \npaid out of at least two accounts. How cumbersome is this three-account \nstructure? Consider this: Prior to the enactment of the three-account \nstructure that we currently operate under, about 5 years ago, VA \naveraged 25,000 financial transactions each year to run its health care \nsystem--25,000 transactions.\n  Since we enacted the three-account structure, VA is averaging 70,000 \ntransactions per year in operating the same system. I know some of my \ncolleagues believe that three accounts help Congress better track VA \nspending in certain areas. However, we can track spending very \neffectively through VA's budgeting process; we do so on a quarterly \nbasis today, and we are doing it effectively. We do not need 70,000 \nfinancial transactions to do that.\n  When you are talking bureaucracy, folks, this has become one of the \nbiggest bureaucracies of the Federal Government. What is being offered \nin this supplemental is simply going to make it more bureaucratic.\n  Unfortunately, the legislation before us would exacerbate the \nproblems associated with the three-account structure. That is because \nthe bill carves out more accounts for specific types of care or care to \nspecific populations.\n  For example, while the bill provides $454 million for the medical \nservices account, it requires that VA ``quarantine'' $202 million of \nthat money for use only in treating veterans of OIF and OEF. Further, \nthe bill requires that $100 million be fenced off and used only for \nmental health care, $30 million only for substance abuse treatment, and \n$20 million on readjustment counseling.\n  That all sounds great. But here is the problem: The problem is that \nas the money makes its way down to the VA facilities in all our States, \nbe it in Spokane or Walla Walla or Boise, ID, all the States and local \nmanagers will be confronted with the task of trying to find out which \naccount to charge when, for example, providing care to an OIF veteran \nfor substance abuse treatment and anger management counseling.\n  Which account do I charge? If I charge the wrong account, I \ncomplicate the process. Does that visit get charged to an OIF or an OEF \naccount? The mental health account? The substance abuse account? The \nreadjustment counseling account? Who knows?\n  Under what is happening tonight, we are complicating that process \ndramatically, and the issue goes on and on.\n  I respect very much the right of Congress to give direction to the \nexecutive branch on how to spend the public's money. But I would \nrespectfully suggest that specificity of this type in the operations of \na health care system belongs more appropriately in report language, not \nin bill language.\n  I realize that this is a small amount of money in the larger scheme \nof a $36 billion VA budget. But, it sets a precedent for funding that I \nbelieve is wrong and we must stop. Unfortunately, Republicans have been \ncomplicit in this type of budgeting already--over my objections.\n  A few years ago, the House of Representatives sent the Senate an \nAppropriations bill that required at least $2.2 billion of VA's overall \nbudget be spent on mental health treatment. In spite of my private \nobjections to the Appropriations Committee at the time, that language \nwas retained. Congress just had to show it cared about mental health \ntreatment.\n  Well, here we are now carving out money not just for mental health \ncare, but also substance abuse, blind rehabilitation, readjustment \nassistance, et cetera.\n  Where does it end? I think it should end here. If we do not stop this \ntype of appropriating, we are very soon going to find ourselves \ninundated with special funding requests for ``politically popular'' \ntypes of health care. What we must remember is that VA clinicians \nprovide comprehensive medical services to all of their patients--even \nthe kind that isn't considered ``politically special care''.\n  We simply should not get in the business of feeding the politics of \nhealth care by carving out specific accounts for certain types of care. \nI realize it is good politics. But it is bad government and very bad \nmedicine. And it creates even more complications with the actual \nfinancial operations of the VA health care system. We will soon \napproach 100,000 transactions to do the same job.\n  I urge my colleagues to stop this bad trend from continuing.\n  Mr. President, the reality is, I was not going to change the money; I \nwas simply going to simplify the process. To be politically correct, we \nare making this process so complicated the question is: What account do \nI charge so I am not in violation of the law?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Idaho has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 649\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am sorry I even have to be on the floor, \nbut I know the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, offered an amendment \nto strike a $2 million provision in the supplemental designated for the \nJames M. Jeffords Institute. That is something, incidentally, that is \nalready 100 percent paid for. It is not like the $1 trillion the \nSenator from Oklahoma supports for a needless war in Iraq.\n  The money, the $2 million identified to fund this center, is not \ndesignated as emergency or new. It is funded through a rescission to \nalready existing dollars for the current fiscal year. It was going to \nbe appropriated last year, but we never finished our appropriations \nbills and had to go to a continuing resolution.\n  These funds were included because Senator Jeffords championed policy \ninitiatives and investments that focused on the long-term well-being \nand educational needs of all Americans. It was put in in a bipartisan \nway by Senators from both parties reflecting that.\n  Along with the leadership of the Appropriations Committee and the \nSenate, on both sides of the aisle, I felt this would be a fitting way \nto honor Senator Jeffords' service to our country while there is still \ntime. Clearly, Senator Coburn does not feel that way. Sadly, that is \nnot going to happen today. I think it is a disgrace.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I am disheartened that I need to come to \nthe Senate floor to debate an amendment this afternoon that would \nstrike a $2 million provision in the supplemental designated for the \nJames M. Jeffords Institute that is 100 percent paid for already.\n  The U.S. Senate has many important issues to deal with right now. And \nthis is just not one of them.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has every right to offer this amendment. It \nis interesting, however, that he does not find it a priority to \nquestion the $1 trillion that our country has spent to fight the war in \nIraq.\n  I can comfortably conclude, and this will be no surprise to the \nSenator from Oklahoma, that we share a different view about what the \nU.S. Senate should take time to debate on the floor.\n  The fiscal year 2007 supplemental appropriations bill includes $2 \nmillion to further the establishment of the James M. Jeffords \nInstitute, a center for educational excellence at the University of \nVermont. This is an effort to acknowledge the long and distinguished \nservice to Vermont and our Nation of our former colleague and friend, \nSenator Jim Jeffords, in promoting educational and policy excellence in \nthe fields of education, environment, health, and agriculture.\n  As a tribute to Senator Jeffords for his 32 years of service in both \nthe House and Senate, $3 million was included in the fiscal year 2007 \nLabor-HHS Appropriations bill to support the UVM Education in \nExcellence program. However, because the fiscal year 2007 \nappropriations bills were left uncompleted by the last Congress, and\n\n[[Page S4026]]\n\ndue to the need to wrap up the process with a continuing resolution, \nthis program, which had been the work of Senator Jeffords, was not \nfunded.\n  Senator Jeffords did not seek reelection last fall so he could spend \nmore time with his family and to address ongoing health issues. I am \nsad to note that these health issues continue.\n  In light of these developments with his health, I have worked with \nthe chairmen of the Appropriations Committee and Labor-HHS Subcommittee \nand Senate leadership to include funding for the Jeffords Institute in \nthe bill we now consider.\n  I will note that the $2 million identified to fund the center is not \ndesignated emergency or new. The project is funded through a rescission \nto already existing dollars for the current fiscal year and therefore \ndoes not increase the overall spending level of this bill or existing \nfiscal year 2007 spending levels.\n  Throughout his life in public service, Senator Jeffords championed \npolicy initiatives and investments that focus on and enhance the \noverall well-being and educational success of individuals from early \nchildhood through later years.\n  He championed legislation to strengthen our Nation's education system \nand increase the opportunities for individuals with disabilities. In \n1975, he entered the House of Representatives as a new Member wearing a \nneck brace--as Jim was fond of saying, he was the walking wounded from \na tough election--and went on to coauthor what would later be known as \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. That landmark \nlegislation has provided equal access to education for millions of \nstudents with disabilities, students who otherwise would have been \nshunted aside and this country would not have had the value of their \nachievements. As chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and \nPension Committee, he continued to work tirelessly on education, job \ntraining, and disability legislation.\n  The Jeffords Institute continues those efforts by identifying and \ndeveloping research and best practices that inform educational and \nsocial policies on early childhood, literacy, and youth development. A \nmajor focus of the institute will include collaboration with and \npreparation of teachers, administrators, and policymakers in the \ndevelopment and implementation of programs, policies, and practices \nthat lead to positive, demonstrable outcomes in education and policy \npractices. Beyond the initial focus, which Senator Jeffords has been \ninstrumental in shaping, the institute will expand its efforts to \naddress policy and practice in the fields of environmental, health, and \nagriculture and their interrelationship with one another, with \neducation being the overarching mission.\n  Senator Coburn's amendment to strike this provision from the \nsupplemental appropriations bill is ill-considered. I think my \ncolleagues will agree that Senator Jim Jeffords served Vermont well \nand, just as importantly, he served the House, Senate, and our Nation \nwell. Were circumstances different, I would say that we could wait and \nfind regular appropriations vehicles through which to fund this \nproject.\n  I, along with the leadership of the Appropriations Committee and the \nSenate, believe this would be a fitting way to honor Senator Jeffords' \nservice to our country while there is still time. Clearly, Senator \nCoburn does not feel that way. Sadly, that will not happen today. But I \nexpect that the Senate will in due time give proper recognition to \nSenator Jeffords who we are so proud of in Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier today, when I was at a hearing, my \nfriend and colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, came to the floor to \nspeak about a provision which I have added to this bill. I would like \nto address Senator Grassley's remarks.\n  Senator Grassley said that an amendment which I added in the \nAppropriations Committee, in his words, would ``lead to anarchy in the \nMedicaid financial arrangements.'' He said it would prevent CMS from \ntaking any action relating to the rules related to Medicaid \nreimbursement and SCHIP reimbursement.\n  Senator Grassley recounted a time not that long ago when there was \nabuse of the Medicaid Program; where, in fact, States had figured ways \nto receive Medicaid funds and multiply them through accounting methods \nand use them in many instances for other purposes. In fact, Senator \nGrassley talked about the fact that under this behavior of the past, \nthe money the States managed to multiply through accounting techniques \ncould be used for roads or for stadium construction. That is true. I \nthought it was an outrage. As a result, there was a hue and cry on \nCapitol Hill for a change in the law or more enforcement and these \nabuses were rooted out. I am happy to say my State of Illinois did not \nparticipate in any of these scams. I am proud they did not. Other \nStates did, and it stopped, as it should have.\n  Then there was a negotiation between the Federal Government and \nStates about this Medicaid formula. It is extremely complex. I wish it \nwere as easy as some would portray, but it is not. So many States had \nnegotiated with the Federal Government to reduce the Medicaid payments \nor to adjust Medicaid payments to acceptable levels. Many provisions of \nMedicaid reimbursement that had been agreed to by the Federal \nGovernment were changed and amended. That happened. The Federal \nGovernment, through CMS, had the authority to do that, and they did.\n  There are still several States in negotiation about this \nreimbursement from the Federal Government. I am hoping that negotiation \nwill end in a positive way, as others have in the past, and I think it \nwill. In the meantime, the Department of Health and Human Services \ncomes in with a rule, a proposed rule, and says: Well, we would like to \nchange the law in terms of these Medicaid reimbursements. \nUnfortunately, this rule they proposed is so sweeping it would cut off \nin my State of Illinois some $600 million in reimbursement to Medicaid \nproviders, primarily public hospitals serving poor people.\n  I want this negotiation to continue. Clearly the Federal Government \nhas the authority to continue this negotiation. I will not stand and \ndefend any misuse of Federal funds or fraud. My concern, and the reason \nI offered this amendment, was the rule is so sweeping it goes too far.\n  Senator Grassley has made a point, and others have backed him up, \nthat this is probably the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee of the \nSenate, not the Appropriations Committee that brings this bill to the \nfloor. I will acknowledge that point, but I also want to make it clear, \nthis isn't the first time we have talked about this issue. In fact, it \nhas been 2 years now when Senator Grassley was chairman of the Finance \nCommittee that we appealed to him to have Congress take the initiative \nand work out this problem. Unfortunately, Senator Grassley couldn't \nschedule it in his busy schedule on the Finance Committee, and nothing \nwas done.\n  The purpose of this amendment is simply to declare a moratorium on \nthe new rule until we can put together this new approach through the \nFinance Committee. That is it. I am not standing here to defend any \nfraudulent practices. I don't want to take away from our Government any \npowers to enforce the law to stop any waste of taxpayers' dollars, but \nI want to make one point clear as well. When our State of Illinois \nentered into an agreement with the Federal Government about Medicaid \nreimbursement, it wasn't so we could use some backhanded accounting \napproach to build a road or a stadium. No. What we tried to do was to \nuse accounting methods which would increase our opportunity to provide \nmedical services to poor people and uninsured people. Our money we are \nreceiving through Medicaid is used for health care and health care \nexclusively. This is the way it should be. It is a Medicaid program for \nhealth care. What we have done in Illinois with these funds is extend \nthe reach of health care to uninsured people and provide services that \notherwise would not be provided, such as specialized services many poor \npeople never have a chance to receive.\n  I am proud our State has used this opportunity to expand care to \npeople who need it: neonatal care for children who were born too soon \nand need the absolute best care immediately, and specialized care for \nthose in every stage of life that otherwise wouldn't be available to \nthem.\n\n[[Page S4027]]\n\n  I say to my colleagues first, Senator Grassley is right, we should \nnot tolerate fraud in any way in Medicaid. This amendment does not. \nSecondly, we should urge every State to negotiate their accounting \nstandards so they are consistent with the Federal Government, and I \nthink that is taking place and should continue. In addition, I think \nthis rule needs to be stopped at this point in time. Let the Finance \nCommittee step in. Let us come up with an approach that works. In the \nmeantime, some States that could be affected by this rule are \nconcerned. If there is a cutoff of funds from the Federal Government to \ntreat poor people, we know what will happen. These people will fall \nbetween the cracks, they will come to an emergency room for charitable \ncare if they are lucky, they won't have the preventive care they need \nto keep themselves and their families happy, and they will pay a price \nin their life in terms of the quality and length of their own lives \nthat are at stake here.\n  I urge my colleagues: Let's keep this provision in this supplemental \nappropriations bill. I urge my colleague Senator Grassley, whom I \ndearly respect as a real leader here in the Senate, to work with \nSenator Baucus and others. Let us address this issue, not with this \nsword hanging over our heads about a rule that could come down and cut \noff hundreds of millions of dollars worth of funds for health care for \npoor people, but in a rational way that gives to each State what it is \nentitled to, and no more.\n  Mr. President, I ask how much time I have remaining on the time \nallocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 784\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I also wish at this moment to mention an \namendment I am going to offer to this supplemental appropriation to \nincrease funding for international peacekeeping by $50 million. It is \namendment No. 784, cosponsored by--I am not offering it at this time, \nbut I will at a later time--Senators Biden, Menendez, Levin, and \nothers, to meet the urgent needs in Darfur, Sudan, and the surrounding \nregion.\n  I believe these urgent peacekeeping needs constitute a true emergency \nby definition in this bill and should be funded. That was the amendment \nI originally filed and my colleagues joined in cosponsoring. I also \nrecognize we are under severe budgetary pressure and I have been told I \nhave to find an offset for the $50 million.\n  I do this with reluctance, but let me share with my colleagues a few \nnumbers. The United States has spent $592 million in the construction \nof a gigantic Baghdad embassy--$592 million. For 2007 and 2008, the \nadministration has requested $2.8 billion for mission operations in \nIraq. To put this in perspective, the State Department's request for \ndiplomatic and consular operations for the rest of the world for fiscal \nyear 2008 is $5 billion. So $2.8 billion for Iraq, $5 billion for the \nworld. This supplemental as passed out of the committee contains over \n$700 million for diplomatic and consular operations intended for Iraq.\n  This amendment, as I modified it, would shift $50 million from this \nsum to peacekeeping. Why do we need the peacekeeping? Because there are \n7,000 African Union forces who are doing their best to protect hundreds \nof thousands, if not millions, of poor people in Darfur. I think this \n$50 million is not too much to ask. A slight trim, a little trim on the \nmoney that might be available for the $592 million Baghdad embassy, is \nnot something that is unreasonable. They will have time to come back \nfor more money if they need it.\n  At the appropriate moment I will offer this amendment. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, a few moments ago the Senator from Idaho \ncame to the floor to talk about an amendment he had regarding the \nlanguage in the underlying bill covering veterans and he described it \nas ``too prescriptive.'' I think it is imperative that we keep the \nlanguage the way it is written.\n  For 4 years, the Bush administration has conducted this war with very \nlittle regard for the tremendous strain it is putting on the VA and it \nis putting on veterans and their families. Last month we saw this \nhorrible reality exposed at Walter Reed. So today, in this supplemental \nbill, we are helping to put an end to that neglect. We are not going to \nwait for the President to fix these problems. We have waited too long. \nWe are facing the cost of war in the supplemental, and we are putting \nthe money where it is needed.\n  This supplemental does include $1.7 billion for veterans health \nfunding. We put this money in because this administration has fallen \nshort in meeting the needs of our returning veterans. The supplemental \ndoes direct the VA to prescriptively put in $50 million for new \npolytrauma centers, as we have learned of the traumatic brain injury \nimpact to many soldiers and their families. It does direct $100 million \nfor mental health care, because we know more than a third of our \nsoldiers who are returning home are suffering from post-traumatic \nstress syndrome and too often are being turned away for care. It does \ninclude $201 million to treat these recently returning veterans, \nbecause we know they are waiting in line and cannot get their benefits, \nand too many of them today are ending up homeless simply because they \ncan't get the check they need to be able to pay for basic costs for \nthemselves.\n  It does include $30 million for research on the best prosthetics for \namputees. We were at the VA hearing a few days ago and heard from a \nwonderful woman, Tammy Duckworth, talking about our veterans today who \nare coming back who need prosthetics, not just to be able to walk but \nto be able to ski or to be able to rock climb. Those are the kinds of \nprosthetics that take a great deal of training. We want to make sure \nthose young men and women who are coming back today who have lost limbs \nhave the best prosthetics available for what they need in their lives. \nIt does include $870 million to fix those problems that were uncovered \nat the VA facilities across the country, not just at Walter Reed, but \nfor tiles falling off ceilings, bats that haven't been eliminated in \nOregon, facilities that have peeling paint at care facilities that \nwould not be accepted by any of us in this country. It does include $46 \nmillion to hire new claims processors so our veterans don't have to \nwait for their benefits.\n  Why are we being so prescriptive? Well, we are here today because we \nhave seen the VA not spend the dollars wisely, to move the dollars \naround in different accounts to cover the lack of funding they have \nneeded, and we are going to make sure in this bill we take care of the \nneeds we have heard so vividly about from so many men and women who \nhave returned from Iraq and Afghanistan and around the globe, and who \nare facing long lines, who aren't getting the mental health care they \nneed, who need access to care for traumatic brain injuries, the \nsignature injury of this war, and we are going to make sure we hold \nthis administration accountable by finally being prescriptive so it is \nspent wisely.\n  I reject the Senator from Idaho's arguments on our amendment, and I \nthink we have wisely held the administration and ourselves accountable \nto make sure the men and women who have served us so well are treated \nwith respect when they come home.\n  Mr. President, we have a number of amendments we are going to go \nthrough at this time. I believe we are ready to accept them. I ask \nunanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 655\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 655 on behalf of \nSenator Hutchison and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for Mrs. \n     Hutchison, proposes an amendment numbered 655.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I wish to speak to an amendment that, if \nenacted, will serve to fix a program at the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, that was designed to help small businesses \ndependent on a military reservist who is called to active duty. Since \n2002, fewer than 300 loans have been made to these businesses, despite \nseemingly ever-increasing numbers of reservists sent overseas. \nReservists and their small businesses have been asked to sacrifice \nenough without having to incur the financial hardships associated with \nbusiness failure, and we should be doing everything we can to help \nthese businesses stay afloat.\n  According to a February 2007 report by the General Comptroller's \nOffice, there are approximately 1.1 million reservists serving our \ncountry today, which represents about 44 percent of the Nation's entire \nmilitary force. On March 1, 2007, the Independent Commission on the \nNational Guard and Reserves issued an interim report stating that, \nsince September 11, 2001, the deployments of U.S. military reservists \nhave risen from approximately 12.7 million days of annual service to an \nestimated 63 million days in 2006.\n  Additionally, a recent Congressional Budget Office, CBO, analysis \nfinds that only about 6 percent of businesses employ reservists. \nSmaller firms--those with fewer than 500 staff--employ 35 percent of \nall reservists. Eighteen percent of reservists work for firms with \nfewer than 100 employees. This report concluded that reservist \nactivations are creating vacancies that firms would not otherwise have \nhad, and, while larger businesses may absorb the loss of personnel at \nlittle cost, many small firms struggle to compensate for the absence of \na key employee who has been called to active duty.\n  In an attempt to help reservists and businesses that incur economic \nhardships as a result of an essential employee or small firm owner \nbeing deployed, I authored legislation to create the Military Reservist \nEconomic Injury Loan Program, MREIDL, in 1999. The program's goal is to \nassist reservist-dependent small businesses with the ordinary, day-to-\nday operating costs of running a business. The law provides these \nemployees access to low interest loans from the SBA when they are \ncalled up to active duty.\n  Unfortunately, the intent of the law has not been put into action. \nDue to poor marketing of this program and the inability of a business \nto apply for a loan prior to a reservist's being called to active duty, \nas well as a very limited window of time in which a business can apply \nfor a loan following a reservist's discharge, businesses are either \nreluctant to take on additional debt due to already declining revenues \nor are unaware of the program altogether.\n  My amendment serves to address these issues. First, my amendment \nextends the window of time for a reservist dependent business to apply \nfor a loan from 90 days following the date of discharge to 1 full year. \nReservists need ample time to return and get their feet underneath \nthem. Often 90 days is not enough time to realize that the business is \nin need of assistance. This extension will allow a returning reservist \nto better understand the financial situation and to act accordingly in \na reasonable amount of time.\n  Second, this amendment directs the SBA to create a preapproval \nprocess for reservist dependent businesses so that businesses can begin \nto draw down funds immediately upon the reservist being called to duty. \nBusinesses that depend on reservists should not have to wait until they \nare failing in order to receive the financial assistance they require \nto stay afloat.\n  Third, this amendment establishes a coordinated, proactive marketing \nplan to be conducted by the SBA, the Veterans' Administration, and the \nDepartment of Defense to more effectively get information in the hands \nof reservists and their families. This program is of little help unless \nreservists and their families are aware of its benefits, and this \nprovision addresses that simple fact.\n  Finally, the amendment directs the SBA to report back to the Small \nBusiness Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives on \nthe status of this program, as well as additional steps that may be \ntaken to improve the program for reservist-dependent small businesses.\n  Mr. President, this is a noncontroversial amendment that simply seeks \nto fix a program that is not serving its original intent. The \nprovisions in this amendment, including the extension of the \napplication period and the preapproval process, were created in \nresponse to testimony heard earlier this year during a hearing in the \nSenate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, which I \nchaired and at which the administration testified. These are \ncommonsense solutions for fixing this program and for helping our small \nbusiness owners who have sacrificed the service of a key employee to \nmilitary service. These small businesses are serving their country in a \ntime of war. They should not be asked to sacrifice their livelihood as \nwell. I would like to thank Senator Hagel for his support of this \nimportant amendment. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment as \nwell.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator Specter and I have joined together \nto offer amendment No. 755 the supplemental appropriations bill to \nauthorize a cost-of-living adjustment, COLA, for the salaries of \nJustices and judges of the United States for fiscal year 2007.\n  I thank my friend, Senator Specter, for his leadership on this issue. \nI also thank the chairman of the Financial Services Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Durbin, and the chairman of the full \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, for working with us on the \nmodifications made to this amendment.\n  This is a step I supported taking--and that we should have taken--in \nthe last Congress. As the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \nhave worked diligently to preserve the independence of our Federal \njudiciary and to treat its members fairly.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, Senator Specter and I introduced \nlegislation, S. 197, to authorize this COLA.\n\n[[Page S4030]]\n\nIt passed the Senate by unanimous consent and now awaits consideration \nby the House. That bipartisan effort--designed to protect and \nstrengthen the integrity and independence of our coequal branch of \ngovernment--is a modest step towards addressing the issues raised by \nChief Justice Roberts in his ``Year End Report on the Federal \nJudiciary.''\n  In 1975, Congress enacted the Executive Salary Cost-of-Living \nAdjustment Act, intended to give judges, Members of Congress and other \nhigh-ranking executive branch officials automatic COLAs as accorded \nother Federal employees unless specifically rejected by Congress. In \n1981, Congress enacted section 140 of Public Law 97-92, mandating \nspecific congressional action to give COLAs to judges. During the 21 \nyears of section 140's existence, Congress has always accorded to the \nFederal judiciary co-equal respect by suspending section 140 whenever \nCongress has granted to itself and other Federal employees a COLA.\n  The modified bipartisan amendment offered by Senator Specter and I \ntoday authorizes a COLA for Federal judges consistent with the law and \nwith fairness. The fiscal year 2007 joint funding resolution approved \nby Congress and signed into law by the President earlier this year \nincreased the Judiciary budget by $250 million over fiscal year 2006 \nlevels. It did not, however, suspend section 140, thus ensuring that no \nCOLA would be provided for Federal judges during the current fiscal \nyear unless other action is taken. Our amendment will rectify that \nsituation.\n  I thank my colleagues for agreeing to this amendment to authorize the \nannual judicial COLA in fiscal year 2007. With it, we take another step \ntoward preserving the judicial independence critical for upholding our \nsystem of government and protecting the rights of all Americans.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Like \nmany here, including, I suspect, the two Senators from Washington, I am \nsupposed to be attending the correspondents dinner tonight.\n  I am informed that my amendment will actually be called up tomorrow \nas part of a series of votes. I would like to speak tonight as I have \nbeen told there will not be adequate time tomorrow.\n  For my colleagues' information, the amendment I will be discussing is \nNo. 739. I ask unanimous consent to add as cosponsors Senator Byrd of \nWest Virginia, Senator Bond, Senator Pryor, Senator Kennedy, Senator \nDurbin, and Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I wish to begin by stating very simply \nthat this amendment is literally, not figuratively, a matter of life \nand death. I have been here for many years. I have never begun a \ndiscussion of an amendment--and I have sponsored some serious \namendments and pieces of legislation--by saying something as graphic \nand drastic as this is literally a matter of life and death. But it is. \nThis is not hyperbole. This is not an exaggeration.\n  What my amendment will do is allow the military to put 2,500 more \nmine resistant ambush protected vehicles--known in the military by its \nacronym, MRAP--in the field by the end of this year.\n  Now, let me explain what I am talking about. First, I want to point \nout that the committee acknowledged the need for these vehicles and \nincluded $2.5 billion in this bill. But what I propose in this \namendment is forward-funding money from next year's 2008 budget into \nthis supplemental. In that way, we can build more of these vehicles \nwhich have one purpose--the specific purpose of saving lives, American \nlives.\n  The fact is, as most of my colleagues know, 70 percent of American \ncasualties in Iraq are caused by improvised explosive devices, or IEDs.\n  Many of my colleagues, including the Presiding Officer, have been to \nIraq. They have had the same experience I have in my seven trips--\nvisiting field hospitals. There, you see amputees and people with \nserious head injuries who, because of the incredible skill and triage \ncapability of our military doctors and nurses, are able to be kept \nalive. Most of those injured at Walter Reed and at Bethesda naval \nhospital are victims of these devices, sadly now familiar to all \nAmericans from the nightly news. We have tried very hard--although this \nadministration has done so belatedly--to better equip our troops to \nwithstand IEDs. God forbid they find themselves victim of an IED \nattack, but if they do, we want them to be able to survive.\n  MRAP vehicles provide four to five times more protection to our \ntroops than up-armored HMMWVs. That statement, that these MRAPs provide \nfour to five times more protection than up-armored HMMWVs, is not my \nestimate. That is the judgment of our military leaders. The Commandant \nof the Marine Corps, GEN James Conway, with whom I spoke as recently as \nthis afternoon, wrote on March 1 to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. He said:\n\n       Multi-National Forces--West [that is, the Marines in Iraq] \n     estimates that the use of the MRAP could reduce the \n     casualties in vehicles due to IED attack by as much as 80 \n     percent.\n\n  He went on further and said that even though the MRAP is not \nexpeditionary:\n\n       It is, however, the best available vehicle for force \n     protection.\n\n  He concluded by saying:\n\n       Getting the MRAP into the Al Anbar Province is my number \n     one unfilled warfighting requirement at this time.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       Getting the MRAP into the Al Anbar Province is my number \n     one unfilled warfighting requirement at this time.\n\n  He went on to tell me today that although there is some disagreement \nin terms of priorities within this building, he was speaking to me from \nthe Pentagon, he said, ``I believe this is a moral imperative.''\n  How many generals with four stars or three or two or one on their \nshoulders have you heard use that phrase? How often is something so \nfundamental it is called ``a moral imperative''? This is a man who is \nheading back out to Iraq soon. He is talking about protecting his kids, \nhis troops.\n  On my last trip into Anbar Province last summer, I went to Fallujah. \nI met with the commanding Marine general and roughly 30 to 40 of his \ncommanders and noncommissioned officers. I was taken outside a building \nto see what they were trying to do to diminish the casualty rate of \nAmerican forces required to patrol Fallujah. They showed me what they \ncalled a rhino, a big vehicle, looks like a Caterpillar bulldozer with \na great big proboscis on it, a great big arm that is used when an IED \nis identified, to disarm it. It was interesting. I observed for the \nfirst time--maybe others knew about it--the hull. The bottom of it \nlooked like a ship out of water. It had a V-shaped bottom. A humvee, \nlike your SUV or your automobile, has a flat bottom. In a humvee, even \nif it is reinforced, it is still flat. The rhino had a V-shaped bottom \nor floor. I asked why. They said it made them much more blast resistant \nand it could protect the troops inside. That is the first time I heard \nabout this concept. They did not have MRAPs yet, but they had this \nrhino, a much bigger vehicle for a different purpose.\n  As I talked to them, I remember asking the question, why aren't we \nbuilding more of these things? You know, the folks on the ground, these \nkids and many not so young women and men who are climbing into these \ncoffins, know that even in an up-armored vehicle if they are struck, \ndeadly force may be exerted, scrambling their brains or outright \nkilling them. The number one requirement of the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps is to get more of these vehicles. I respectfully suggest \nto all who care--and every one of us cares about the fate of the \ntroops--if there is any place we should not consider the cost--\nemphasize again, not consider the cost--it is when there is a consensus \nthat what we are purchasing can save lives. We have made no sacrifice \nin this country to fight this war except for the families of those who \nhave gone to the war. We should not hesitate to save the lives of those \nwho are sacrificing because of cost.\n  A couple of my colleagues off the floor, none of whom are on the \nfloor at this moment, have told me it might not be cost effective \nbecause the military is working on a new vehicle. Give me a break. Cost \neffective? I wonder how many people asked, when we were talking about \nthe invasion of Normandy in World War II: You know, we better be \ncareful. We may build too many landing craft. We might have some left \nover. What are we going to do with them after the war?\n  We have no higher obligation than to protect those we send into \nbattle. We have received a pretty good dose of this administration's \nwillingness to send people into battle not prepared. Rumsfeld's famous \ncomment: You go with the Army you have, not the Army you like or need. \nThat is paraphrasing him from a couple of years ago. When we find a way \nto protect people better in battle, then it seems to me we have an \noverwhelming obligation to act.\n  Let me explain the specifics of the MRAP. Each vehicle can hold 4 to \n12 troops. Like the rhino, these vehicles have raised steel, V-shaped \nhulls and chassis. The raised hull is valuable because it gives the \nblast more time to expand, lessening the impact. The V-shape pushes the \nblast up the sides of the vehicle and away from the occupants. With an \nup-armored HMMWV or any humvee, the flat bottom sends the blast through \nthe floor right into the occupants. In addition, the vehicles have side \narmor and bulletproof glass, and they also have tires that can be \ndriven when flat.\n  Ever since the military began using MRAPs in Iraq, the requirement \nhas grown, as commanders realize how much better they are at protecting \ntheir personnel. In May of last year the requirement was only 185. By \nJuly, it had risen to 1,185. By November, it had risen to 4,060. By \nFebruary of this year, after the supplemental request was submitted, it \nrose to 6,738. One month later, the requirement went up again to the \ncurrent level of 7,774. At this point every one in the military agrees, \nwe need 7,774 MRAPs.\n  The Marines are the executive agents for this program, meaning they \nare\n\n[[Page S4034]]\n\nmanaging it for themselves and the other services. Every service has a \nneed for the vehicle for explosive ordinance units as well as regular \npatrols. The Marines need 3,700 of them. The Army needs 2,500. The Air \nForce needs 697. The Navy needs 544, and the Special Operations Command \nneeds 333. The cost of 7,774 MRAPs is $8.4 billion. This \nadministration's current plan is to spend $2.3 billion this year and \n$6.1 billion next year. But I believe we can and must do much better, \nand so do the Marines. If we simply put more funds up front, spend them \nin the supplemental rather than allocate them a year later in the 2008 \nbudget, the same money that we are going to spend anyway next year, if \nwe move it up, we can accelerate production drastically.\n  Some have said the extra production capacity does not exist. Again, \nspeaking to the Commandant of the Marine Corps today, he indicated that \nthere are eight companies they are dealing with and he has confidence \nthat they can build all they can purchase, all they can afford. That is \nalso what the Chief of Staff of the Army thinks.\n  On March 14, General Peter Schoomaker told the Appropriations \nCommittee that with the MRAPs, ``We can build what we get the funds to \nbuild. It is strictly an issue of money.''\n  Let's assume the Commandant of the Marine Corps and General \nSchoomaker are wrong. Let's assume they have made a mistake. Let's \nassume we can't build as many as the money we give them. So what. So \nwhat. We are not talking about building a highway on time. We are \ntalking about an informed judgment by the United States military, to \nbuild not a new weapons system, but to build a new protection system \nfor their forces.\n  I respectfully suggest, if we are going to err on one side or the \nother, for God's sake, for a change, let's err on the side of doing \nsomething that will protect American fighting women and men.\n  Quite frankly, if the Marines believe we can do it, then my money is \non the Marines getting it right. If General Schoomaker says he needs \nit, and more money will get the vehicles, then I take him at his word. \nI would rather take a chance, and I believe the American people would \nalso, to protect more Americans under fire than not.\n  What does this mean specifically? Well, by adding $1.5 billion, which \nmy amendment does, to the supplemental today, the Marines will have $4 \nbillion to work with. Based on their estimates, that will mean 2,500 \nvehicles get to the field 6 months sooner than under the current plan. \nYou may say: What is 6 months? Ten of thousands of lives is what 6 \nmonths is. Figure it out: Four to twelve people in 2,500 more vehicles. \nAdd up the numbers. That's 10,000 to 30,000 Americans. Look at the \ncasualty rates that come from IEDs striking up-armored HMMWVs. Do the \nmath, and tell me if their lives are not worth taking a financial risk \nto protect.\n  If we move this money forward, on October 1 of this year, instead of \nhaving only 2,000 MRAPs, we would have 4,500 in the field. On January \n1, 2008, instead of 3,500 MRAPs, we would have 6,000 in the field. By \nFebruary, we would fulfill the entire requirement, instead of waiting \nuntil next July. We are still going to spend $8.4 billion, but spending \nit faster will make a major difference.\n  If you want to be callous about this, it would also save the American \ntaxpayers a whole lot of money because for every one of those injured \nsoldiers who comes back--to put it in Machiavellian terms--who needs a \nlifetime of medical care, there are hundreds of thousands of dollars \ncommitted per casualty.\n  I can find no logical argument for delaying this.\n  Let me end where I began. This is a matter of life and death. Madam \nPresident, 2,500 more vehicles means literally that 10,000 to 30,000 \nmore Americans will have a four to five times greater chance of \nsurviving a hit with an IED while on patrol than exists today if we do \nnot act. Madam President, 10,000 to 30,000 Americans will not be added \nto the casualty and death numbers if we move this money up.\n  To use the phrase of the Commandant of the Marine Corps, at 3 or 4 \no'clock today, on the phone with me:\n\n       This is a moral imperative.\n\n  I agree. It is a moral imperative that we protect these troops as \nsoon as possible.\n  So tomorrow, when I have my 1 or 2 minutes to speak to this issue \nbefore we vote, I will urge all my colleagues to vote for this \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 808\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I would like to briefly discuss \namendment No. 808 which will be voted upon tomorrow. This amendment \ndeals with a very serious problem facing our country; that is, we have \nmillions of low-income Americans who lack the resources to properly \nweatherize their homes.\n  I know, coming from a cold-weather State such as Vermont, this is a \nvery serious problem. It gets cold in Vermont, sometimes 20 or 30 below \nzero. It is a real shame we have people who simply lack the financial \nresources to put in the proper insulation, roofing material, windows, \ndoors to keep heat from literally disappearing. The result of that is \nlow-income people are forced to pay a higher and higher heating bill, \nat a time when many of them do not have the funds to do that.\n  The other aspect to this issue, which is equally or even more \nimportant, is if the U.S. Congress and the American people are serious \nabout dealing with the issue of global warming, then we have to make a \nmajor effort to retrofit homes all over this country so we are not \nwasting enormous amounts of energy.\n  We cannot come here and say we have a major global warming crisis and \nnot be serious about energy efficiency and not be serious about making \nsure all our homes, especially those of lower income people, are \nproperly weatherized.\n  As part of the continuing resolution, Congress level-funded the \nweatherization program at $242.2 million. Unfortunately, the \nadministration's spending plan for fiscal year 2007, which came out \nabout 2 weeks ago, reduced funding for the weatherization program by \n$38 million compared to what it received in fiscal year 2006.\n  In other words, despite the global warming crisis, despite the \nincrease in poverty, despite the need to spend substantially more to \nweatherize homes throughout this country, the administration is \nactually lowering the funds available for weatherization. This makes no \nsense to me at all.\n  Tomorrow, I am going to be offering an amendment which is \ncosponsored--it is a bipartisan amendment--by Senators Sununu, \nBingaman, Jack Reed, Menendez, Kerry, Harkin, Dodd, Wyden, and Clinton.\n  This amendment will add $25 million more to the weatherization \nprogram compared to last year's level. I hope we will have strong \nsupport for this effort. It will help us address global warming, and it \nwill provide real assistance to many low-income families throughout \nthis country.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 835 and 755\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that action on \namendment No. 835 be vitiated and the amendment be modified with the \nchanges at the desk, the amendment, as modified, be agreed to, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table; further, that action on \namendment No. 755 be vitiated and the amendment be modified with the \nchanges at the desk, and the amendment be agreed to, as modified, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Had I been present, I would have voted in the \nnegative.\n\n\n                  minimum wage in the u.s. territories\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources which has jurisdiction regarding the insular \nareas of the United States, I am concerned about provisions in the \nHouse passed supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 1591, that would \nalter the way minimum wage levels are set in the U.S. territories of \nAmerican Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, \nCNMI. Senators Akaka and Inouye share my concern and we would like to \nenter into a colloquy with the distinguished manager of the bill \nregarding our concerns.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I would be pleased to enter into a colloquy.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. As the Senator may know, in recognition of the special \nchallenges that the territories face in promoting economic development, \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act. FLSA, provides that the transition from \nthe territories' historic subminmum wage levels up to the national \nminimum wage is managed by special industry committees. These \ncommittees convene ever 2 years, carefully analyze the islands \neconomies, and recommend incremental increases toward the national \nminimum wage based upon those analyses.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, that is my understanding.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. This process has worked well and has successfully \nraised the minimum wage in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands up \nto the national minimum wage. The process currently applies in American \nSamoa which continues to have regular increases in its minimum wage \ntoward the national level. However, this Special Industry Committee \nprocess does not apply in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands, CNMI, because the minimum wage provisions of the FLSA have \nnever applied there. Section 503(c) of the Covenant to Establish the \nCNMI in Political Union with the United States--approved by P.L. 94-\n241--specifically authorized Congress to extend the national minimum \nwage to the CNMI and, in 1998 the Committee Energy and Natural \nResources favorably reported legislation Senate Report 105-201 that \nwould have extended the national minimum wage as authorized. That \nlegislation would also have extended the FLSA's Special Industry \nCommittee transition provisions to the CNMI just as they apply to \nAmerican Samoa.\n  On March 1, 2006, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held \nan oversight hearing to examine economic conditions in the islands and \nwe found the situation in both the CNMI and American Samoa very \nworrisome. More recently, I met with the Governor of American Samoa, \nTogiola Tulafono, and with a delegation from the CNMI headed by the \nresident representative, Pete Tenorio, and the Lieutenant Governor, Tim \nVillagomez, who expressed their concern about the House-passed minimum \nwage legislation that would increase their islands' minimum wages based \non a fixed schedule, and without the periodic economic analyses \nconducted by the Special Industry Committees under the FLSA. These \nisland leaders asked for my support in assuring that the FLSA's \ntransition process will be used to assure a smooth transition from the \nlocal territorial minimum wage to the national minimum wage.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the \ncomments of my colleague from New Mexico. I have also met with the \nGovernor of American Samoa regarding his concerns on proposed changes \nto the minimum wage law as it applies to American Samoa. In addition, I \nhave met with the distinguished delegate from American Samoa, Eni \nFaleomavaega, who has been working with his colleagues in the House, \nChairmen Obey and Miller, on this matter and he has their assurances \nthat they will continue to work with him as this bill is considered in \nthe conference committee. I have joined the delegate on a letter to the \nHELP Committee urging continuation of the current FLSA policy of having \nSpecial Industry Committees periodically determine the rate of increase \nin the territorial minimum wage.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I share the concerns of my colleagues. I \nhave met with representatives of the Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands, CNMI, on this matter and understand the risks that \ntheir economy is currently facing. We in Hawaii are particularly \nconcerned that an inflexible approach to minimum wage increases in the \nCNMI and American Samoa could seriously disrupt those economies, cause \nunnecessary hardship, including the need for residents to emigrate to \nHawaii or the mainland to find new job opportunities.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. We share the concerns that these island leaders have \nbrought to our attention and recognize that they have no representation \nhere in the Senate. Accordingly, we ask the distinguished manager and \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, as this legislation is \nreconciled with the House bill in conference committee, that he\n\n[[Page S4036]]\n\nseeks an agreement that the FLSA's Special Industry Committees will be \nused in these two territories, as they were used in Puerto Rico and the \nU.S. Virgin Islands. We believe that this is important to assuring a \nsmooth transition to the national minimum wage in these islands, and to \navoiding unnecessary economic disruption.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senators and want to assure them that I \nunderstand their concern. Although I cannot commit to any particular \noutcome, I will work with them during the conference committee to \naddress their concerns, and those of the American Samoa and the CNMI \nleadership, regarding their desire for Special Industry Committees \nunder the FLSA to assure a smooth transition from the current local \nminimum wage to the national minimum wage.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the distinguished manager and look forward to \nworking with him to develop appropriate language as H.R. 1591 is \nconsidered in the conference committee.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I also thank the chairman and manager for his \nunderstanding and cooperation on this matter.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I too appreciate the willingness of the \ndistinguished manager to consider our concerns, and his willingness to \nwork with us during conference to find an acceptable solution.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 697\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today Senator Warner and I have introduced \nan important and potentially landmark bipartisan resolution. My good \nfriend and colleague from Virginia has correctly highlighted what is \none of the most critical issues before us as we debate our continued \noccupation of Iraq: the capacity of the Iraqi Government to take \nresponsibility for the security of its own country. The President said \nin November 2005 that ``as the Iraqis stand up, we will stand down.'' \nBut are the Iraqis standing up? If, in the President's formulation, our \ncontinued military occupation of Iraq is dependent on the readiness of \nthe Iraqi security forces, is it not crucial that we know what kind of \nprogress those Iraqi forces are making? The Warner-Byrd resolution will \nhopefully provide the Congress with the unvarnished truth about this \nissue, instead of more of the same rhetoric and obfuscation doled out \nto the Congress since the war began. Under Warner-Byrd, within 120 days \nof passage of this Act, a designated independent private sector entity \nwill report to Congress on the readiness of the ISF to assume \nresponsibility for maintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq, \ndenying terrorists a safe haven, and bringing an end to sectarian \nviolence. The report will also address whether continued support by \nU.S. troops is likely to contribute to the ISF's readiness to take on \nthose missions in the coming months.\n  We have had 4 years now of rosy reports coming from the Pentagon and \nthe White House about the steady progress being made in Iraq, but \nevents on the ground regularly belie those sunny assessments. Our \nsoldiers have been training and equipping Iraqi troops and police \nfor several years, and the White House continues to tout the ``real \nprogress'' made by the Iraqi security forces. However, an article in \nthe February 5 edition of the New York Times noted that the Iraqi units \narriving in Baghdad are showing up at 55 to 60 percent of their full \nstrength. Even more problematic, the Iraqi police force is itself seen \nby many in Iraq as simply an extension of the sectarian militias, \nterrorizing the population with rape, extortion, and murder.\n\n  Considering the record to date of the Iraqi troops, will any amount \nof training produce a reliable and capable national army? If this is \nwhat we are waiting for--if we are truly planning to ``stand down'' \nonce the ISF ``stands up''--I, for one, want to know when we can expect \nthat to happen. And if it is not going to happen, we should know that \nas well. How long will we continue to spend American lives and treasure \ntraining Iraqi troops that can't be counted on? Six months? A year? \nFive years? If this is an ultimately hopeless endeavor, we should find \nout now, and change our strategy accordingly.\n  The situation in Iraq has devolved into a full-blown civil war, as \nsects which have been battling for centuries continue to attack each \nother--and us--in an ever-widening bloodbath. In the words of the \nPresident's own National Intelligence Estimate, the term `` `civil war' \naccurately describes key elements of the Iraqi conflict,'' which has \nbecome a ``self-sustaining inter-sectarian struggle between Shia and \nSunnis.'' U.S. troops have no constructive role to play in fighting \nanother country's civil war. Increasingly in Iraq, there is no clearly \ndefined ``enemy'' for our soldiers to engage, only various indigenous \ngroups that hate us almost as much as they hate each other. The \nPresident's plan calls for the Iraqi troops to assume responsibility \nfor halting this death spiral, but the NIE again casts doubt on this \nstrategy. It states that ``the Iraqi security forces--particularly the \nIraqi police--will be hard-pressed in the next 12-18 months to execute \nsignificantly increased security responsibilities.''\n  I suspect that further training is not really the answer. We can \ntrain a soldier how to fire a weapon; we can give him communications \nequipment; we can teach him how to conduct a raid or defend a post. But \nwe cannot give him a sense of national identity. We cannot provide him \nwith allegiance to government and country that transcends ethnic or \nsectarian hatreds. The bottom line is that the violence in Iraq \nrequires a political solution. Everyone--everyone--now acknowledges \nthat. Only when the Iraqi people, through their government, are able to \novercome the sectarian divisions that are splitting the country apart, \nwill stability and peace be achieved. U.S. Central Command Commander \nGen. John Abizaid said it himself in testimony before Congress on \nNovember 15, 2006: ``I believe that more American forces prevent the \nIraqis from doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \nfuture.''\n  The Warner-Byrd resolution seeks to address that issue head-on, with \nan unbiased, nonpartisan report on the likelihood that continued U.S. \ninvolvement will contribute to the capacity for the Iraqis to take \nresponsibility for their own future. This report will provide us with a \nclear-eyed view of what is going on in Iraq, and whether the \nPresident's plan has any realistic hope of success.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 740\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, yesterday I filed amendment No. 740, which \nallows dairy farmers in Pennsylvania to receive a one-time emergency \nassistance payment of $2.50 for every hundredweight of milk they \nproduced over the past 6 months. Because the Senate invoked cloture on \nthis spending bill and we are quickly wrapping up our work to get \nfunding to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, I will not have the \nopportunity to offer my amendment today. I will, however, continue to \npursue this critical emergency funding for our dairy farmers.\n  Dairy farmers in my home State and other Northeastern States are at \nthe end of their rope. They have cut corners and pared their operations \ndown to the absolute necessities, but they simply cannot make ends \nmeet. Prices for feed and fuel have more than doubled over the past \nyear and a half, but the price farmers get for their milk has not kept \npace. Consequently, dairy farmers in Pennsylvania are losing about $5 \non every hundredweight of milk they produce. For a small dairy farmer \nwith 75 or so cows, this could mean a loss of around $20,000 year.\n  During the last congressional recess, I toured two dairy farms in \ndifferent regions of Pennsylvania and talked to dozens of farmers. I \nheard stories about draining savings accounts, trying to patch repair \nbroken equipment, leaving bills unpaid, and selling cows just to keep \nthe farm going. Our farmers are doing everything in their power to keep \ntheir businesses going. Unfortunately, many of them are now faced with \ntheir last option--to sell everything and shut down the farm. I want to \nbe sure colleagues understand that this is happening right now, today. \nThe prospect of mass closings of dairy farms is not something off in \nthe distant future. Pennsylvania is losing 250 to 350 dairy farms every \nyear. Today, dairy farmers in my home State are sitting down with their \nfamilies and making tough decisions about the future of their farms. \nMany of them won't be able to stay in business while they wait for \nCongress to finish work on the new farm bill.\n  The result would be devastating. Dairy is Pennsylvania's top \nagricultural commodity, contributing $4.2 billion annually to the State \neconomy\n\n[[Page S4037]]\n\nand employing 40,000 people. This is what we stand to lose if we stand \nby and watch as our dairy farmers close down. I am not willing to risk \nit.\n  I also want to point out that the impacts of the loss of \nPennsylvania's dairy industry will be felt throughout rural \ncommunities. As farmers go out of business, feed stores, fertilizer \nstores, and milk haulers go out of business, feed stores, fertilizer \nstores, and milk haulers go out of business. Without the economic \nengine provided by dairy, people are left out of work and our rural \ntowns and counties will crumble.\n  I will do everything in my power to prevent that from happening.\n  I am committed to finding short-term relief to keep Pennsylvania \ndairy farmers in business while we make long-term fixes in Federal \ndairy policy in the next farm bill. I hope that all of my colleagues \nwill support our hard-working dairy farmers and work with me to find \ncommonsense solutions to avert an impending crisis in rural America.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last December, 10 of America's most \ndistinguished senior statesmen and -women made public a blueprint for \nsuccess in Iraq and in so doing opened up the possibility for the \nadministration and the Congress to come together on a bipartisan basis \nto begin a new direction in Iraq. The Iraq Study Group, led by former \nSecretary of State James Baker and former Congressman Lee Hamilton, \npresented our Nation with a fully bipartisan Iraq strategy--a strategy \nthat all of America could get behind, with clearly defined benchmarks, \nrealistic goals, and a sensible approach for protecting U.S. security \ninterests.\n  Today, the U.S. Senate is finally considering legislation that would \nhelp take us in the direction outlined by the Iraq Study Group, over 3 \nmonths ago. Under the leadership of Senator Byrd, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has presented this body with a chance to get \nthe mission right, namely by beginning the phased redeployment of our \ncombat units from Iraq.\n  Thanks to additional language spelling out a clearly defined \nbenchmarks for Iraqi authorities to meet, from Senator Ben Nelson, \nCongress has finally put the Iraqi Government on notice that it is time \nfor them to step up to their responsibilities. It is time for the \ngovernment of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to start providing for \nIraq's own security and making the difficult but necessary political \ncompromises to bring all parties in Iraq to the table, thereby ending \nthe untenable situation of American troops being forced to referee a \ncivil war there. Iraqi compromises will only emerge through serious \ndiplomatic engagement by the U.S. State Department, Iraqi politicians, \nand neighboring countries in the region.\n  But this isn't just my view. This is also the view of Iraq Study \nGroup cochair, Congressman Lee Hamilton. Before the Senate bill was \nmade public in its entirety, Congressman Hamilton had an opportunity to \ncomment on the House's version of the supplemental appropriations bill. \nIn a Washington Post op-ed, he pointed out that ``The House Bill lays \nout the steps that the Iraqi Government must take . . . At issue is the \nconditionality of U.S. support. Time and again, Iraqis have missed \ndeadlines. Time and again, deadlines have been extended, and U.S. \npolitical, economic and military support has continued and even \nincreased. The House bill breaks that cycle.''\n  Most crucially, Congressman Hamilton went on to say that the House \nbill, ``by tying continued U.S. support--including the presence of U.S. \ntroops--to benchmarks, uses the strongest possible leverage to press \nIraqi leaders to meet their commitments.''\n  Clearly, in the view of Cochair Hamilton, the current majority in \nCongress is taking the necessary steps to address our national security \nneeds, and doing so in a manner consistent with the recommendations of \nthe Iraq Study Group.\n  Without such a strategy, U.S. Iraq policy amounts to little more than \nan open-ended commitment which has not translated to progress on the \nground in Iraq; and is causing significant long-term costs to our \nmilitary and to our national security.\n  We have already lost over 3,200 brave American servicemembers in \nIraq, and regrettably, that number continues to grow.\n  We have spent over $400 billion since the war began, with an \nadditional $121 billion in the underlying bill being debated today.\n  And our Armed Forces have been left so depleted of combat gear due to \nthe war in Iraq, that vast segments of our military are reporting ``not \nready'' for duty--including two-thirds of the Army in the United States \nand nearly 90 percent of our National Guard.\n  As these figures demonstrate, our Armed Forces and America's national \nsecurity simply cannot afford the Bush administration's ``stay the \ncourse'' policy in Iraq any longer. It is quite literally breaking our \nmilitary. And it is endangering our Armed Forces' ability to respond to \nfuture challenges to America's national security--whether on the Korean \nPeninsula, the Middle East, or elsewhere in the world.\n  As Army Chief of Staff GEN Peter Schoomaker testified to the Senate \nArmed Services Committee: ``We have a strategy right now that is \noutstripping the means to execute it.'' His deputy, GEN Richard Cody, \nfurther stated: ``The readiness continues to decline of our next-to-\ndeploy forces.''\n  Yet, today, we find the administration still engaging in its smoke \nand mirror campaign to purposefully downplay the monetary and human \ncosts of this war. They do it by forbidding the taking of photos of our \nhonored fallen heroes coming back to Dover Air Force Base and by \nfunding the war through emergency supplementals that are used to \nobscure the war's impact on our budget deficit. They do so by \nshamefully neglecting the needs of our returning heroes, too many of \nwhom have come home broken in body or spirit.\n  Despite all of these efforts, the impact of the Iraq war has been so \ntransparently damaging to America's security that it has been \nimpossible even for this White House to keep the facts from the \nAmerican people--particularly in terms of our military's combat \nreadiness.\n  According to a March 19 Washington Post report, ``it will take years \nfor the Army and Marine Corps to recover from what some officials \nprivately have called a `death spiral,' in which the ever increasing \npace of war-zone rotations has consumed 40 percent of their total gear, \nwearied troops and left no time to train to fight anything other than \nthe insurgencies now at hand.''\n  We are over 4 years into this war, and the administration is still \ndecrying those of us trying to help address these serious concerns. And \nall the while, it is the administration who is still continuing to \npropose budgets, with too few resources for our deployed troops.\n  In fact, the President and the Vice President have continued their \ndisingenuous claims that Democratic proposals would actually cut \nfunding for our troops even while they are the ones proposing budgets \nwith shortfalls in critical combat equipment, military hospital upkeep, \nand veterans health priorities.\n  It is time for Congress to finally say ``enough is enough.''\n  The Iraq Study Group was very clear on the need to restore our own \nmilitary's combat readiness, as spelled out in recommendations 48 and \n49 of its report. According to that report, ``the defense budget as a \nwhole is in danger of disarray, as supplemental funding winds down and \nreset costs become clear. It will be a major challenge to meet ongoing \nrequirements for other current and future security threats that need to \nbe accommodated together with spending for operations and maintenance, \nreset, personnel, and benefits for active duty and retired personnel. \nRestoring the capability of our military forces should be a high \npriority for the United States at this time.''\n  I wholeheartedly agree with this statement.\n  As my colleagues know, since the war began in 2003, I have to come to \nthe Senate floor time and again to offer amendments to spending bills \nto address shortfalls in the administration's proposed budget--largely \nover the objections of the White House and its congressional allies.\n  In 2003, I offered an amendment to the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill to add $322 million for critical protective gear \nidentified by\n\n[[Page S4038]]\n\nthe Army that the Bush administration had failed to include in their \nbudget. But it was blocked by the administration and their allies.\n  In 2004 and 2005, I authored legislation, signed into law, to \nreimburse troops for equipment that they had to purchase on their own \nbecause the Rumsfeld Pentagon failed to provide them with the body \narmor and other gear they needed to stay safe.\n  And last year, working with Senators Inouye, Reed, and Stevens, I \noffered an amendment to help address a $17 billion budget shortfall to \nreplace and repair thousands of war battered tanks, aircraft, and \nvehicles. Without these additional resources, the Army Chief of Staff \nclaimed that U.S. Army readiness would deteriorate even further. This \nprovision was approved unanimously and enacted in law. But much more \nremains to be done.\n  A recent report by the independent National Guard Commission says \nthat 88 percent of our National Guard is reporting ``not ready'' for \nduty. To address this concern, I introduced S. 756 to provide the $38 \nbillion over the next 5 years the National Guard says it needs to \nrestock its depleted equipment inventories and restore its \npreparedness, for both wartime and homeland security missions. Doing so \nis critical to our national security, and we owe our country and our \ntroops no less.\n  Thankfully, here again, Senator Byrd and the Appropriations Committee \nhave demonstrated their leadership by adding $1 billion to address \ncritical equipment shortfalls for our National Guard in 2007. This is a \ngood first step as we work to ensure that America's citizen soldiers \nare fully prepared to fight our enemies abroad and respond to domestic \nemergencies here at home. I am joining my colleagues, Senators Leahy \nand Bond, in offering an amendment to add another $1 billion to meet \nother immediate National Guard short-term needs. In addition, I intend \nto work throughout this year to ensure that we address all of the \nGuard's critical equipment needs.\n  In the meantime, this supplemental appropriations bill will begin to \nput us on the right track, to reverse 4 years of the administration's \nmismanagement of a war, and 6 years of its reckless battering of \nAmerica's great Armed Forces. We should have no higher priority than \nthe safety and well-being of our troops. Plain and simple.\n  But a great deal more remains to be done. We need to redeploy our \ncombat forces out of Iraq's urban areas to Kurdistan, other rural areas \nof Iraq, and to bases in Kuwait and Qatar, where they can focus on \ncounterterrorism operations, train and equip Iraqi security forces, and \noffer force protection to U.S. personnel and infrastructure which \nremain in Iraq after the redeployment of combat forces has been \ncompleted early next year.\n  But more than that, we need to stop allowing ourselves and our Nation \nto be cowed by the administration's fear-mongering. We must embrace the \nmany recommendations of the Iraq Study Group and engage in a ``New \nDiplomatic Offensive'' in Iraq and the wider region because, as the \nIraq Study Group wisely concluded, only a political solution which the \nIraqi people buy into can salvage Iraq.\n  Mr. President, the United States has a moral obligation to assist \nIraqi and Afghan refugees and those internally displaced by violence. I \ncommend the Appropriations Committee for beginning to effectively do \nso, by increasing such assistance by $50 million for Iraq, and $18 \nmillion for Afghanistan.\n  The Brookings Institution estimates that nearly one-quarter of all \nphysicians have fled Iraq. There are nearly 2 million Iraqi refugees in \nJordan and Syria. These refugees have placed a tremendous strain on the \nessential social services and infrastructure of those two countries, \nwhich have begun to close their border crossings. Emergency funding is \nnecessary to provide these individuals with basic medical care, food, \nhousing and to ensure that their children are able to attend school.\n  We cannot afford to miss another opportunity to change our course in \nIraq and to support the men and women sacrificing their lives there--\nopportunities this administration has resisted at every step of the \nway. The new Democratic majority in Congress has already begun doing \nso. The passage of this bill will represent another step toward a \nstronger and safer America, and more secure and stable Iraq.\n  If President Bush is wise he will reconsider his threat to veto this \nmeasure and begin to embrace the call for change embodied in this \nlegislation. If not, I will continue to do all that I can to keep the \npressure on the administration. I know that the majority of the Members \nin this body will as well. That is our responsibility as the people's \nrepresentatives.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, during the last election, the American \npeople spoke loud and clear: they want a new direction in Iraq. In my \nown state of Maryland, I have heard from a strong grassroots movement--\nthey want Congress to act now to end this war. I will vote for this \nemergency supplemental bill because it: fully funds the needs of our \nwarfighters on the battlefield; adds $454 million to ensure veterans \nget the health care they need when they come home; requires the \nPresident to immediately change our mission in Iraq; and sets the goal \nof bringing our troops home by March 31, 2008.\n  This bill states clearly that Congress and the American people will \ncontinue to support and protect our troops. Our troops must understand \nthat Congress will never abandon them: not while they are fighting on \nthe battlefield and not when they come home. The best way to support \nour troops is to bring them home--swiftly and safely.\n  I am not new to this position. I never wanted to go to war in the \nfirst place. I was one of the 23 who voted against this war, 4 years \nago, on October 11, 2002. I opposed giving the President unilateral \nauthority to launch a preemptive attack. I said the United States had \nto exhaust our diplomatic options. I encouraged the administration to \nstick with the United Nations, U.N., to let the U.N. meet its \nresponsibility to deal with the threat from Saddam. The day of the \nvote, I said, we don't know if we will be greeted with flowers or \nlandmines. Well, now we know: when we got to Iraq, there were no \nweapons of mass destruction, but the destruction happened, and it \nhappened fast.\n  The United States went to war with Iraq, but today we are at war \nwithin Iraq. Saddam is gone, but we are still there, mired in a civil \nwar. No one could ask more of our troops. They are brave and courageous \nand have fought valiantly. And it is time to bring them home.\n  We need a way forward in Iraq. The Iraq Study Group gave us 79 \nrecommendations as a way to go forward, but the President has \ncompletely ignored this report. Surely out of 79 recommendations, there \nare 50 we can agree on. The Iraq Study Group report calls for new and \nenhanced diplomatic and political efforts in Iraq and a change in the \nprimary mission of U.S. forces in Iraq to enable the United States to \nbegin to move our forces out of Iraq responsibly. It provides a \ndirection for the U.S. and Iraqi governments to follow that could lead \nto withdrawal of American forces by first quarter of 2008.\n  This is exactly the approach called for by this supplemental bill, \nwhich will have most of our troops out of Iraq by March 31, 2008. What \nare we voting for? This bill contains a binding resolution that directs \nthe President to promptly transition the mission of U.S. forces in Iraq \nand begin a phased redeployment within 120 days. It sets a goal of \nbringing U.S. combat forces home by March 31, 2008, except for a \nlimited number of troops essential for force protection, training and \nequipping Iraqi troops, and targeted counterterror operations. It also \nrequires the President to develop a comprehensive diplomatic, political \nand economic strategy for Iraq, including greater U.S. engagement with \nIraq's neighbors and the international community to work together to \nbring stability to Iraq.\n  This resolution also says success in Iraq depends on the Iraqi \nGovernment's ability to meet important benchmarks, including: the \ntraining and equipping of Iraqi security forces so they can control the \ncapital city of Baghdad; giving Iraqi military commanders the authority \nto conduct operations without political interference; disarming \nsectarian militias and ensuring that Iraqi security forces are loyal to \nIraq's Government; drafting and implementing\n\n[[Page S4039]]\n\nlegislation to ensure the equal division of Iraqi oil revenues; \ndrafting and implementing legislation to reform the de-Ba'athification \nprocess; implementing a fair process for amending the Iraqi \nConstitution to ensure minority rights are protected; and implementing \nnew rules to protect minority rights in the Iraqi Parliament.\n  I support this Iraq resolution. It says what the Iraq Study Group has \nalready told us: the problems in Iraq cannot be solved by the U.S. \nmilitary--they require a political solution by the Iraqis and \ndiplomatic engagement with Iraq's neighbors. It says Congress and the \nAmerican people will not only support the troops but continue to \nprotect them as well.\n  I want to end this war, and the resolution in this bill will do just \nthat. Yet in ending the war, it is my responsibility as a Senator to \nensure that our troops are brought home not only swiftly but safely. I \nwill not vote to end funding for the pay that supports military spouses \nand children; body armor and armored humvee's our troops need for \nsurvival; tourniquets and surgical hospitals on the battlefield; jet \nfuel for the airplanes that take injured troops from Baghdad to Germany \nand then home; or the medical care they need when they get here.\n  In the last few weeks, we have all been shocked and awed by the \nconditions facing our wounded warriors. We know that more than 22,000 \nPurple Hearts have been awarded in Iraq. Yet our troops are being twice \nwounded. We know that acute care for our injured troops has been \nastounding, with historic rates of survival from even the most brutal \nbattlefield injuries. Yet while we have saved their lives, we are \nfailing to give them their life back. Outpatient care, facilities, \nsocial work, case workers, disability benefits--the whole system is \ndysfunctional.\n  I thank Senator Inouye and Senator Byrd for their leadership in \nproviding funding in this bill for military and veterans' health care. \nThis supplemental includes an additional $20 million to improve \nconditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and an additional $100 \nmillion for research and treatment of traumatic brain injury, \nposttraumatic stress disorder, and other physical and mental trauma. It \nalso adds $454 million for veterans health care, including $73 million \nfor new polytrauma facilities and services and $100 million for mental \nhealth treatment.\n  We know this is only a downpayment for our troops and veterans. We \nneed to overhaul the disability benefits system that is outdated and \nadversarial. We need a better system for transitioning our troops from \nactive duty to the Veterans Administration to ensure they get the \nhealth care, job training, and educational benefits they deserve. We \nneed to hear the recommendations of the Dole-Shalala Commission on how \nto fix the problems in our military and veterans' hospitals. And I look \nforward to working with Senator Murray, Senator Levin, and Senator \nInouye on a comprehensive reform package that will ensure our troops \nhave the medical care they will need for the rest of their lives.\n  This supplemental supports our troops, follows the will of the \nAmerican people, and follows the advice of the Iraq Study Group. It is \ntime to change our direction in Iraq and bring our forces home. Let's \nsend in the diplomats and bring our troops home safely and soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/28/senate-section/article/S4039-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I wish to speak today about the recent \nreport by the inspector general of the Department of Justice on the \nFBI's use of national security letters. According to the inspector \ngeneral's testimony before the Judiciary Committee, there was \n``widespread and serious misuse of the FBI's national security letter \nauthorities''--misuse that violated statutes, Attorney General \nguidelines, and internal FBI policies. I was deeply concerned by the \nfindings in that report. Unfortunately, I was not surprised.\n  The national security letter, or NSL, authorities were dramatically \nexpanded by Sections 358 and 505 of the PATRIOT Act. Unfortunately, in \nits haste to pass this flawed legislation, Congress essentially granted \nthe FBI a blank check to obtain some very sensitive records about \nAmericans, including people not under any suspicion of wrong doing, \nwithout judicial approval. So it is not surprising that the inspector \ngeneral identified serious problems with the implementation of these \nbroad authorities. Congress gave the FBI very few rules to follow. As a \nresult, Congress shares some responsibility for the apparently lax \nattitude and in some cases serious misuse of these potentially very \nintrusive authorities by the FBI.\n  This inspector general report proves that ``trust us'' doesn't cut it \nwhen it comes to the Government's power to obtain Americans' sensitive \nbusiness records without a court order and without any suspicion that \nthey are tied to terrorism or espionage. It was a grave mistake for \nCongress to grant the Government broad authorities and just keep its \nfingers crossed that they wouldn't be misused. We have the \nresponsibility to put appropriate limits on Government authorities--\nlimits that allow agents to actively pursue criminals and terrorists \nbut that also protect the privacy of innocent Americans.\n  But let me back up a few steps. What are NSLs, and why are they such \na concern? I am going to spend a little time on this because it is \nimportant. I believe there should be a legislative response to this \nreport, so I want my colleagues to understand what we are dealing with \nhere.\n  National security letters are issued by the FBI to businesses to \nobtain certain types of records. So they are similar to the \ncontroversial section 215 business record orders but with one very \ncritical difference. While section 215 involves an application to the \nFISA Court, the Government does not need to get any court approval \nwhatsoever to issue NSLs. It doesn't have to go to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court or any other court and make even the \nmost minimal showing. Under the PATRIOT Act, the FBI can simply\n\n[[Page S4040]]\n\nissue the order signed by the special agent in charge of a field office \nor some other supervisory official--although we now know that many NSLs \nwere issued without even the signatures required by the PATRIOT Act.\n  Prior to the PATRIOT Act, the FBI had to certify specific and \narticulable facts giving reason to believe that the records sought with \nan NSL pertained to a terrorist or spy.\n  But the PATRIOT Act expanded the NSL authorities to allow the \nGovernment to use them to obtain records of people who are not \nsuspected of being or even being connected to terrorists or spies. The \nGovernment need only certify that the documents are either ``sought \nfor'' or ``relevant to'' an authorized intelligence investigation, a \nfar-reaching standard that--even if followed closely, which we now know \nit was not--could be used to obtain all kinds of records about innocent \nAmericans. Indeed, as the inspector general suggested, it could be used \nto ``access NSL information about parties two or three steps removed \nfrom their subjects without determining if these contacts reveal \nsuspicious connections.'' And just as with section 215, the recipient \nis subject to an automatic, permanent gag rule.\n  NSLs can be used to obtain three categories of business records, \nwhile section 215 orders can be used to obtain ``any tangible things.'' \nBut even the categories reachable by an NSL are quite broad, and the \nPATRIOT Act and subsequent legislation expanded them further.\n  Specifically, NSLs can be used to obtain the following: First, \nsubscriber and transactional information related to Internet and phone \nusage, including information about the phone numbers and e-mail \naddresses that an individual is in communication with. Second, full \ncredit reports. Prior to the PATRIOT Act, the FBI could not get a full \ncredit report without obtaining a court order--it could only obtain \nwhat is called ``credit header'' information, which includes name, \ncurrent and former addresses, current and former places of employment, \nand the names of financial institutions at which the individual has \naccounts. But the PATRIOT Act expanded that authority to include full \ncredit reports, which generally include many personal details about \nloans, credit scores, and other aspects of individuals' financial \nsituations. And the third category is financial records, a category \nthat includes bank transactions but also was expanded in 2002 to \ninclude records from all kinds of everyday businesses like jewelers, \ncar dealers, travel agents and even casinos.\n  Unfortunately, the PATRIOT Act reauthorization legislation that was \nenacted last year--over my opposition--did nothing to address the \nstandard for issuing an NSL. It left in place the breathtakingly broad \n``relevance'' or ``sought for'' standards. Not only that, but it left \nin place the automatic gag rule for NSL recipients, albeit with a new \nexception for notifying a lawyer.\n  What did the reauthorization legislation do with regard to NSLs? \nWell, primarily it created the illusion of judicial review, both for \nthe letters themselves and for the accompanying gag rule. At a \nJudiciary Committee hearing this week, the FBI Director pointed to this \nafter-the-fact judicial review provision as a privacy protection for \nNSLs. But if you look at the details, it was drafted in a way that \nmakes that review virtually meaningless. With regard to the NSLs \nthemselves, the reauthorization permits recipients to consult their \nlawyer and seek judicial review, but it also allows the Government to \nkeep all of its submissions secret and not share them with the \nchallenger, regardless of whether there are national security interests \nat stake.\n\n  The other significant problem with the judicial review provisions is \nthe standard for getting the gag rule overturned. In order to prevail, \nthe recipient has to prove that any certification by the Government \nthat disclosure would harm national security or impair diplomatic \nrelations was made in bad faith. This is a standard of review that is \nvirtually impossible to meet.\n  Now, judicial review is not at issue in the IG's report, and indeed, \nthe chances that a business receiving an NSL would seek judicial review \nrather than just comply are relatively slim, but I think it is \nimportant to point out that even on the one issue that the \nreauthorization legislation did address with regard to NSLs, judicial \nreview, the result was entirely inadequate.\n  I want to make one additional point about national security letters. \nThere is a crucial difference between obtaining records in national \nsecurity investigations and in standard criminal investigations. As the \nGeneral Counsel of the FBI testified before the House Judiciary \nCommittee last week, actions in national security investigations ``are \ntypically taken in secret and they don't have the transparency of the \ncriminal justice system.'' She explained that in the criminal system, \nagents know that ``if they mess up during the course of an \ninvestigation, they're going to be cross-examined, they're going to \nhave a federal district judge yelling at them.'' That means that more \nvigorous controls and compliance mechanisms are needed with respect to \nsensitive authorities like national security letters than their \nanalogues in the criminal justice system--something I think the \ninspector general report demonstrates.\n  With that background, what did the inspector general find as a result \nof his audit of the use of NSLs from 2003 to 2005? He found that even \nthe very limited protections in the existing statute were not being \nfollowed.\n  The inspector general found, based on FBI records, that the FBI's use \nof NSLs expanded exponentially after the PATRIOT Act, moving from \napproximately 8,500 requests in 2000, to 39,000 requests in 2003, \n56,000 requests in 2004, and 47,000 requests in 2005. The total number \nof requests was 143,074 over the 3-year period.\n  But the inspector general also found that even those numbers are \ninaccurate because the FBI had no policies in place with respect to the \nretention or tracking of NSLs. In many cases, agents did not even keep \ncopies of signed NSLs. As a result, the FBI significantly undercounted \nits NSL requests. In a sample of 77 case files that the IG looked at, \nthe NSL requests were undercounted by roughly 22 percent.\n  Although it is hard to know how much can be extrapolated from that \nfigure, if that figure holds throughout the Bureau, that could mean \nthat there were roughly 30,000 more NSL requests issued that the FBI \ndidn't keep track of. That is appalling--that the privacy rights of \nAmericans would be treated so cavalierly that there are potentially \ntens of thousands of NSL requests out there that the FBI itself doesn't \neven have a record of. And it resulted in inaccurate information being \nreported to Congress about the use of NSLs, raising another grave \nconcern.\n  What else did the inspector general find? He found that the use of \nNSL requests regarding U.S. persons--that is, citizens and legal \npermanent residents--shifted from 39 percent of all NSL requests in \n2003 to 53 percent of all NSL requests in 2005, at least with respect \nto the NSL requests for which the FBI kept track of the U.S person \nstatus of the target. And, until 2006, the FBI did not keep track of \nhow many NSL requests pertain to individuals who are not the subjects \nof authorized national security investigations. Obviously, if the FBI \nis using NSLs frequently to obtain information about people who are not \nthe subjects of open investigations, that would present serious \nconcerns about their use.\n  The inspector general also found that the FBI significantly \nunderreported violations of the NSL statutes and internal guidelines \nfrom 2003 to 2005, with respect to notifying both the FBI's Office of \nGeneral Counsel, or OGC, and the President's Intelligence Oversight \nBoard, or IOB, as required by Executive order. FBI employees did report \n26 violations to OGC, but the IG found examples of 22 more unreported \nviolations in 17 investigative case files out of a sample of 77 \ninvestigative files in 4 field offices.\n  Some of these were significant violations, others less so. But that \nmeans that 22 percent of investigative files surveyed by the IG \ncontained one or more violations not identified by the FBI or reported \nto the Intelligence Oversight Board, as required. According to the IG, \n``we have no reason to believe that the number of NSL-related possible \nIOB violations we identified in the four field offices was skewed or \ndisproportionate to the number of possible IOB violations that exist in \nother\n\n[[Page S4041]]\n\noffices.'' Thus, the IG's findings ``suggest that a significant number \nof NSL-related possible IOB violations through the FBI have not been \nidentified or reported by FBI personnel.''\n  What else did the inspector general find? Perhaps the most disturbing \nrevelation in his report, among many disturbing revelations, is that on \nmore than 700 occasions, the FBI obtained telephone toll billing \nrecords or subscriber information from 3 telephone companies without \nfirst issuing NSLs or grand jury subpoenas. Instead, it relied on what \nit called ``exigent letters'' signed by personnel not authorized by \nstatute to sign NSLs. Although the Electronic Communications Privacy \nAct does contain an emergency provision permitting the FBI to obtain \ncertain communications records in emergencies where there is an \nimmediate threat to a person's physical safety, many of these exigent \nletters were issued, admittedly, in nonemergency circumstances. Indeed, \nthey were used as a matter of course by one headquarters unit. This \nviolated both the statute and internal FBI policy.\n  The inspector general also found that FBI headquarters issued more \nthan 300 NSLs without determining whether there was an authorized \ninvestigation in progress. Issuing an NSL without tying it an \nauthorized investigation is a violation of the statute.\n  The inspector general also found that internal FBI guidance on how to \nproperly use NSLs was woefully lacking, and that even to the degree \nthere were FBI policies in place to govern the use of NSLs, those \npolicies were not being followed. In 60 percent of the 77 case files \nthat the IG examined in detail, there was some infraction of FBI \nguidance. Sixty percent. That is absolutely astounding.\n  But that is not all. Once information is obtained through an NSL, the \nInspector general reported that the FBI retains it indefinitely and \nuploads it into databases like the ``Investigative Data Warehouse,'' \nwhere it is retrievable by the thousands of authorized personnel, both \ninside and outside the FBI, who have access to these types of FBI \ndatabases. The FBI has no process for removing that information from \nits databases depending on the results of the investigation. So if a \nperson's full credit report is obtained with an NSL as part of a \npreliminary investigation and that preliminary investigation is closed \nbecause the FBI determines that the person has done nothing wrong, it \ndoesn't matter--the FBI can keep it anyway.\n  Although the FBI keeps all the data it collects using NSLs, it does \nnot tag or mark that information to indicate that it was derived \nthrough an NSL. So the FBI does not track whether information from NSLs \nends up in intelligence analysis products or is passed on to \nprosecutors for criminal investigations. You would think that these \nwould be key indicators of the usefulness and effectiveness of NSLs, \nbut that information is not available, other than anecdotally.\n  That is what the inspector general's report told us. The report \nrevealed that the FBI took a shockingly cavalier attitude toward the \nprivacy of innocent Americans in its implementation of the PATRIOT Act \nNSL authorities.\n  Congress meant for the inspector general's report to help it in its \noversight of the use of national security letters, which are issued and \nenforced entirely in secret, and there is no question it has done that. \nThe inspector general deserves a great deal of credit for his thorough \nand careful report. As I have already mentioned, much of the reporting \nto Congress on the use of NSLs since the PATRIOT Act has been \ninaccurate or misleading due to FBI recordkeeping problems, so having \nthe results of this independent audit is invaluable.\n  But the report also reveals that the Justice Department essentially \ntried to whitewash this issue over the past several years. When \nCongress was considering whether to make changes to the NSL authorities \nas part of the PATRIOT Act reauthorization debate, the Attorney General \ncame to Congress and resisted any changes, touting the strength of the \nchecks on its power to obtain NSLs and assuring us that the power was \nbeing used carefully.\n  On April 5, 2005, Attorney General Gonzales told the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, ``[T]he PATRIOT Act includes a lot of safeguards that \ncritics of the Act choose to ignore.'' On November 23, 2005, the \nJustice Department wrote Senators Specter and Leahy a ten-page letter \ndefending the FBI's use of National Security Letters, asserting that \n``the use of NSLs is subject to significant internal oversight and \nchecks,'' and that there are ``robust mechanisms for checking misuse,'' \nand that ``[t]he FBI must and does conduct its investigations within \nthe bounds of our Constitution, statutes, strict internal guidelines, \nand Executive Orders.''\n  On December 14, 2005, the Washington Post quoted Attorney General \nGonzales as saying, ``[T]he PATRIOT Act has already undergone extensive \nreview and analysis by Congress, by the DOJ Inspector General, and by \nother bodies . . . This extensive review has uncovered not one verified \nexample of abuse of any of the Act's provisions.''\n  It is now quite evident that the Attorney General must not have been \nlooking very hard, and certainly not trying very hard to ensure the \nprotection of Americans' privacy rights. There is a lot going on right \nnow that suggests we should be skeptical of assurances from the Justice \nDepartment, but this report highlights just how overtly political, and \nhow lacking in fact, were DOJ's representations regarding the \nimplementation of the Patriot Act.\n  Indeed, as recently as November 2006, the Justice Department \nasserted--in response to an inspector general memo warning against the \npotential for abuse of national security letters--that the FBI is \n``aggressively vigilant in guarding against any abuse,'' a claim we now \nknow was simply false.\n  It is an understatement to say that the inspector general's report \nuncovered serious flaws in the use of national security letters. But \nthese were flaws waiting to happen. It should not have taken this type \nof highly critical report to convince Congress to do something about \nsuch wide-ranging Government power.\n  In fact, a bipartisan group of Senators proposed changes to the NSL \nstatutes years ago, in the Security and Freedom Enhancement Act, or \nSAFE, Act. I, along with Senators Craig, Durbin, Sununu, Murkowski, \nSalazar, and many others, pushed for changes to the NSL statutes to try \nto prevent precisely the types of abuses that have now come to light. \nFor example, the SAFE Act would have required that agents demonstrate \nthat the records pertain to a suspected terrorist or spy before the FBI \ncan issue an NSL, rather than the extremely loose standard in the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  The SAFE Act also would have given the recipient of an NSL a \nmeaningful right to challenge the letter and the nondisclosure \nrequirement, and placed a time limit on the nondisclosure requirement, \nwhich could be extended by the court. As is the case for FISA \nauthorities, the SAFE Act would have required notice to the target of \nan NSL if the Government sought to use the records obtained from the \nNSL in a subsequent proceeding and given the target an opportunity to \nchallenge the use of those records.\n  So the idea that the NSL statutes need to be revised is not new. But \nthe inspector general's report has now highlighted the need for \nlegislation and suggested some problems with the statutes that had not \npreviously been identified.\n  The time for changing the lax and unchecked system for issuing \nnational security letters is now. The hearings the Judiciary Committee \nhas held with the inspector general and the FBI Director have been \nimmensely helpful.\n  But we must not stop there. Legislation is needed. During the \nreauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, we were unable to fix the NSL \nstatutes. The administration and its supporters even refused to put a \nsunset on the NSL powers. So we need to act, and soon. I hope to work \nclosely with the bipartisan group of Senators who cosponsored the SAFE \nAct. I plan to press for Senate action on sensible reforms to help \nprevent future abuses of national security letters.\n  Let me say, in conclusion, that this report shows beyond doubt that \nCongress made a grave mistake when it let this administration \nintimidate us into silence and inaction rather than protecting the \nrights and freedoms of the American people. The Justice Department's \ncredibility concerning the powers contained in the PATRIOT Act is in\n\n[[Page S4042]]\n\nshreds. Congress needs to exercise extensive and searching oversight of \nthose powers, and it must take corrective action. The inspector \ngeneral's report has shown both that current safeguards are inadequate \nand that the Government cannot be trusted to exercise those powers \nlawfully. Congress must address these problems and fix the mistakes it \nmade in passing and reauthorizing the flawed PATRIOT Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/28/senate-section/article/S4042-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO HOWARD ARTHUR TIBBS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, it is my privilege to call to the attention \nof my colleagues a great Ohioan and distinguished Tuskegee Airman, \nHoward Arthur Tibbs, who this week will be posthumously awarded the \nCongressional Gold Medal.\n  Much has been written about the valiant service and tremendous \nbravery of these African-American men during World War II. Collectively \nthe Airmen flew over 15,000 sorties and 1,500 missions in their \nlegendary P-51 Mustangs. They were awarded two Presidential Unit \nCitations, 744 Air Medals, 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses, and \nnumerous individual bronze and silver stars.\n  But this simple listing of their military accomplishments does not \ncapture the true breadth of their commitment and sacrifice to this \ncountry. Not only did they greatly contribute to the Allies' defeat of \nthe Axis Powers, but they did so within a highly segregated military. \nIt has been stated that ``These airmen fought two wars--one against a \nmilitary force overseas and the other against racism at home and \nabroad.''\n  Howard Arthur Tibbs exemplified the qualities for which the Tuskegee \nAirmen are so admired. At the age of 24, the Salem, OH native enlisted \ninto the service of his country at Fort Hayes in Columbus, OH. He \nfought bravely and served honorably under tremendously challenging \nconditions. Our State and our Nation are indebted to him and his fellow \nairmen for their sacrifice.\n  A window into the character of Howard Arthur Tibbs is provided by the \nadvice he gave his children. ``Give each day your best,'' he told them, \n``and the best is bound to come back to you.'' Howard Tibbs certainly \ngave his best to this country, and this country is right to recognize \nhis bravery and accomplishment.\n  I proudly celebrate the life and sacrifice of this great Ohioan on \nthe occasion of his posthumous award of the Congressional Gold Medal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/28/senate-section/article/S4042-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NEW MEXICO'S TUSKEGEE AIRMEN\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to New Mexico's \nTuskegee Airmen. With the awarding of the Congressional Gold Medal to \nJohn Allen, Robert Lawrence, and James Williams, we express our \ngratitude for their service, sacrifice, and leadership. Their military \nservice in World War II helped pave the way for the future \ndesegregation of our Armed Forces and country.\n  Each of these men distinguished themselves while serving our Nation. \nRobert Lawrence flew 33 separate combat missions over Italy, defending \nAmerican bombers from the Luftwaffe. John Allen spent 20 years working \nfor the Strategic Air Command following his World War II service. James \nWilliams fought against segregationist policies at his base before \nbecoming an accomplished surgeon. The Congressional Gold Medal, and \ninvitation to the Capitol, shows how far we have come; many of the \nTuskegee Airmen can recall when Black Americans were excluded from \nthese hallowed hallways. However, I know it will take more than this \naward to eradicate the remaining vestiges of racism and prejudice these \nmen have experienced. I pledge to continue working in that spirit and \nwill keep these men in mind in the process.\n  The great State of New Mexico can be proud it is home to three such \noutstanding men. I hope that each of them knows how very much we value \ntheir contributions to our society in their efforts working for \njustice, our military for what the service they performed while in \nuniform, and our nation for teaching all Americans the importance of \nequality at any cost. I again thank them for all they have done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/28/senate-section/article/S4042-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, in 1821, the Greeks began their 8-year \nbattle for independence against the Ottoman Empire after over 400 years \nof Turkish rule. The beginning of the Greek Revolution eventually led \nto Greece's recognition as an autonomous power in 1832, secured with \nthe signing of the Treaty of Constantinople.\n  The United States and Greece are very fortunate to have always had \nstrong ties. James Monroe, President during the beginning of the Greek \nRevolution, publicly expressed a ``strong hope'' for Greece, which led \nto increasing support for the Greek people. These interactions of the \npast significantly represent the current relationship between the \nUnited States and Greece.\n  Our two countries continue as allies today, sharing the common ideals \nof freedom and democracy. We fought side by side in both world wars and \ncurrently work together in the war on terrorism. Greece has been a \nstrong contributor to the NATO-led International Security Assistance \nForce and in providing security at the Kabul International Airport in \nAfghanistan. The support that Greece has offered in the war on \nterrorism has proved to be invaluable.\n  The historic friendship between Greece and United States has been one \nof mutual respect and support. A Greek proverb says ``Take an old man's \ncounsel and an experienced man's knowledge.'' The United States has \nbeen continuously influenced by the history, principles, and culture of \nGreece. I am proud to recognize March 25 as Greek Independence Day, \nincluding as an original cosponsor of a Senate resolution to so \ndesignate this day. I send all Greek-Americans in Rhode Island and \nthroughout the world my best wishes as they celebrate their \nindependence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/28/senate-section/article/S4042-4", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4042-S4043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SOMALIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in recent weeks, we have seen a level of \nchaos and brutal violence in Mogadishu, Somalia, that is tragic and \nhorrific, not to mention extremely dangerous to our national security \ninterests. According to the U.N., 40,000 people fled Mogadishu in \nFebruary, and conditions have only deteriorated this month. \nHumanitarian access is severely restricted. Ugandan troops serving in \nan African Union peacekeeping force have been attacked. Last week a \ncargo plane was shot down. The Transitional Federal Government has been \noverwhelmed by the violence, and appears unable or unwilling to work \nwith rival clans and other opponents. A mere 3 months after the \nEthiopian incursion, the TFG is isolated and a dangerous power vacuum \nis forming.\n  These are the conditions that permit terrorist organizations to \noperate in Somalia, as they have for years. Insecurity and lawlessness \nfacilitated the rise of the Islamic courts in recent years and now \ncircumstances are again conducive for extremist elements to regroup and \nreturn. In other words, without a consistent, comprehensive plan for \nfostering stability in Somalia, we could find ourselves faced with the \nsame conditions that preceded the Ethiopian incursion against the \ncourts and subsequent U.S. military operations.\n  The United States and the international community has approached \nSomalia, and continues to approach Somalia, sporadically, with policy \nmade on the fly and with few resources directed toward long-term \npolitical and economic development. When required by Congress to \nprovide a comprehensive plan for Somalia, the Administration has failed \nto do so. In February, when I asked the Assistant Secretary of State \nfor African Affairs why this legally mandated report was overdue, she \nindicated that that the Department was busy responding to ``fast-moving \nevents on the ground.'' But that is precisely the problem. Ad hoc \napproaches to Somalia have not worked; they have never worked. There \nwas no comprehensive plan last year, when the Islamic courts took \nadvantage of years of civil conflict to consolidate their power. There \nwas no plan when Ethiopian troops entered Somalia, even though the \ninternational community had no ready peacekeeping capability to follow. \nThere was no plan when the TFG was installed in Mogadishu with no \neffective international framework to ensure that it could govern. And \nthere was no broader plan when U.S.\n\n[[Page S4043]]\n\nairstrikes pursued targets in a country that, unless policies change, \nwill remain a terrorist safe haven for years to come.\n  None of what we are seeing in Somalia today should come as a \nsurprise. Last fall, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles was loudly \nproclaiming his intention to go into Somalia. In my own meeting with \nMeles in early December, he told me exactly what he intended to do. He \nwould enter Somalia, he would teach the Islamic courts a lesson, and he \nwould withdraw. Ethiopia, he told me, had neither the capability nor \nthe desire to engage in nation building. I asked him about the \ninstability that might ensue and warned him against an invasion. The \nlessons from Iraq were perhaps inevitable and we discussed them. Yet \nMeles was committed to a strike against the Islamic courts, regardless \nof what would follow. In other words, quick military action was, from \nhis perspective, in Ethiopia's national interests, even without an \nadequate international political framework or a robust peacekeeping \ncapability.\n  That does not mean, however, that this was in America's national \ninterests. I do not know if the Ethiopian incursion would have occurred \nif the United States had sought to stop it. I do know that the ruins \nleft behind by this incursion were foreseeable and there was no excuse \nfor the United States and the international community to have been \ncaught so shamefully unprepared.\n  As I warned in January, even after the incursion there was a brief \nwindow of opportunity to bring some stability to Somalia. That window \nmay have now closed. Still, we have no choice but to do what we should \nhave been doing all along. It is in our interest to increase support \nfor the peacekeepers who are currently being asked to police a state of \nchaos. It is in our interest to identify economic resources that could \nbe used for development in Somalia and as an incentive for stability \nand representative government. And it is in our interest to promote a \nbroad, international framework for stability in Somalia. It is not \nacceptable for the Transitional Federal Government to resist the tough \npolitical choices--including the inclusion of rival factions and \nclans--necessary to establish an effective national government that is \nseen as credible and legitimate by its own people as well as the \ninternational community. It is the Somalis who suffer when there is no \nrepresentative government, and it is the terrorists who benefit. And it \nis irresponsible for other countries in the region to pursue their \nseparate, conflicting agendas in Somalia rather than contribute to a \nsustainable compromise.\n  The stabilization and reconstruction of Somalia will not happen \nwithout a real commitment of attention and political capital from the \nUnited States. We must appoint a Special Envoy to work fulltime on \nSomalia and the Horn of Africa. The ambassadors in the region all have \ntheir own host countries to worry about every day. And it is not an \noption for the Secretary of State to be ``in the lead on our Somalia \npolicy,'' as the Assistant Secretary stated in February. Such unfocused \nleadership results in precisely the kind of sporadic response to events \nin Somalia that has so utterly failed us.\n  Last week, the violence in Mogadishu took a grisly and familiar turn: \nthe dragging and mutilating of bodies through the streets. It was these \nkinds of images that helped prompt the United States to turn away from \nSomalia 15 years ago. But, as we learned in Nairobi and Tanzania in \n1998, when we turn away from Somalia, we invite disaster. That does not \nmean that there was a military solution in 1993--certainly, the poorly \ndefined U.S. military mission in Somalia 14 years ago was not a \nsolution. Nor does it mean that there is a military solution now. \nAirstrikes can never, by themselves, dry up a terrorist safe haven, nor \ncan they bring to power a stable government with which we can work to \npursue our mutual interests.\n  Yet all too often, military options are all we consider, all we plan \nfor, and all we devote resources to. High-level diplomacy has been \nneglected. Economic investments have been short-changed. And, worst of \nall, those who are supposed to be leaders on this issue have already \ngotten distracted.\n  We cannot afford to let history repeat itself. If we do not act, \nconditions will continue to deteriorate. Civilians will die. Extremists \nwho offer the promise of a modicum of security will not only emerge, \nbut will be welcomed by a population desperate for some peace. \nTerrorist networks will thrive. And plots against the United States \nwill be hatched.\n  The longer we continue to neglect Somalia, the longer we potentially \nundermine our own national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/28/senate-section/article/S4043-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        A TRIBUTE TO DOUG BYRNE\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the service \nand sacrifice of Officer Doug Byrne.\n  My wife Joan and I were deeply saddened to hear of the senseless \ndeath of Officer Doug Byrne while in the line of duty March 26, in \nAurora, CO, responding to a man dying of a seizure.\n  It takes a person of great conviction and courage to become an \nofficer of the law. It takes a commitment to community, hard work, and \npatience. Officer Doug Byrne possessed these very qualities. And \nunfortunately, Officer Doug Byrne paid the ultimate price.\n  Officer Doug Byrne was the 5th Aurora police officer to be killed in \nthe line of duty. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial Fund, more than 17,500 officers have been killed nationwide \nsince 1792, including 236 in Colorado.\n  Doug Byrne was the second Aurora officer to be killed in the past 6 \nmonths. Aurora Police Detective Mike Thomas made his ultimate sacrifice \nlast September.\n  A native of Aurora at 37 years of age, Doug joined the Aurora Police \nDepartment in 2004, and was known for his dedication to his profession. \nHe served as a field training officer for recruits new to the force. \nFrom 1998-2004, Doug served the City of Glendale, CO, Police \nDepartment. There he distinguished himself by receiving the medal of \nvalor by rescuing distraught tenants in an apartment complex fire. \nOfficer Doug Byrne is someone who knows what service to country is as \nwell. Doug served his country as a U.S. Marine in the Persian Gulf War \nduring the liberation of Kuwait. Doug was a graduate of Gateway High \nSchool in Aurora.\n  The City of Aurora will forever be grateful for Officer Doug Byrne's \nservice and dedication to the safety and well-being of others, and his \ncontributions will be remembered.\n  Officer Byrne is survived by his parents. Doug had many friends and \nwill be deeply missed.\n  I extend my deepest sympathy to the family of Officer Doug Byrne. May \nhis bravery and unwavering sense of duty serve as a role model for the \nfuture generation of law officers.\n  Thank you for your service, Officer Byrne. Rest in peace, Sir.

JAMES WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak today on behalf \nof the Tuskegee Airmen; specifically, I would like to speak about Dr. \nJames Williams, a Tuskegee Airman, renowned physician, and one of my \nLas Cruces constituents. He has lived a fascinating life and I think \nthat the following story truly exemplifies why he is deserving of a \nCongressional Gold Medal.\n  As a World War II-era first lieutenant in the Army Air Corps, Dr. \nWilliams was put into a terribly difficult situation when he refused a \nsuperior White officer's order to sign a base regulation. The effect of \nthis regulation would have been to keep Black officers from entering \nthe White officers' club, tennis courts, and pool. He rightly \nrecognized that a segregated Army was not one that would be able to \nfight wars together. Because of this act of disobedience, he and 100 \nother Black officers were sent to Godman Field, KY, where they were met \nby 75 armed MPs. Held under house arrest at Godman, some there felt \nthat they were being more closely watched than the German POWs being \nhoused there.\n  Thankfully, the house arrest only lasted for 5 days before the Black \nofficers were able to show that the White officers looking to keep the \nbase facilities segregated were failing to follow Army regulations. \nThey were quickly released and returned back to Freeman Field. However, \na letter of reprimand\n\n[[Page S4044]]\n\nstayed in all of their files until 1995, when the Air Force officially \nvindicated them.\n  Though Dr. Williams's unit never saw action in the European theater, \nthey did fight against racism and for equality while serving our \nNation. His contributions to this fight did not end with his military \ncareer. As a surgeon and the president of the Cook County Physicians \nAssociation, he worked to end discrimination in Chicago area hospitals. \nHe met with President Kennedy on the issue and also served as Dr. \nMartin Luther King's physician when he was in Chicago.\n  New Mexico is lucky to have such a great man as a constituent and I \nam pleased to see that he and his comrades have finally received their \nCongressional gold medals. It is late in coming, but I believe it \ndemonstrates that our Nation recognizes his fight as our own. Using Dr. \nWilliams's selfless example, I will continue working to ensure equality \nfor all Americans and end discrimination of all kinds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/28/senate-section/article/S4044-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/28/senate-section/article/S4044-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal of a nomination which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/28/senate-section/article/S4044-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:43 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 477.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Pryor, and \n        Mr. Tester):\n  S. 1005. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to improve programs \nfor veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nbusiness and entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nHagel, the Senator from Nebraska, to introduce the Military Reservist \nand Veteran Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2007. There are \ncurrently 25 million veterans in America, including over one million \nwho have left military service since September 11, 2001. As the \nconflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan continue, the number of veterans, \nincluding service disabled veterans, will increase and reservists will \ncontinue to carry more of the burden than ever before. As veterans and \nreservists reenter civilian life, the economic benefits and \nopportunities provided by the Federal Government will become even more \ncritical, particularly in the field of entrepreneurship and business \nownership. As the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship, I am serious about addressing the problems \naffecting veterans and reservists who wish or are already engaged in \nsmall business and this bill is another step forward in doing so.\n  As veterans, Senator Hagel and I believe that the government has an \nobligation to help deployed reservists avoid economic hardship because \nof their service and to help veterans, particularly the service-\ndisabled, return to civilian life when they retire. There are more \nveterans returning each day because of the war on terror--800,000 \nveterans were discharged between 2002 and 2005--and ensuring that these \nindividuals have a secure financial future is not just a matter of \nfairness but of national security. The treatment of our troops affects \nthe Nation's ability to recruit and retain the best and brightest. \nVeterans have told me that they feel that they are being forgotten and \nthat the government is simply not living up to its past promises of \nhelping veteran entrepreneurs succeed. This bill is one step in \nensuring that the government is doing all it can to help those who have \nserved and sacrificed on our behalf.\n  The Military Reservist and Veteran Small Business Reauthorization Act \nof 2007 reauthorizes the veteran programs in the Small Business \nAdministration. Specifically, this legislation increases the funding \nauthorization for the Office of Veteran Business Development from $2 \nmillion today to $2.5 million in three years. In light of the large \nnumbers of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and increased \nresponsibilities placed on this office by Executive Order 13360, it is \nhigh time that the Office of Veteran Business Development receive the \nfunding levels that it needs.\n  In addition, this bill permanently extends the SBA Advisory Committee \non Veterans Business Affairs. The committee was created to serve as an \nindependent source of advice and policy recommendations to the SBA, the \nCongress, and the President. The veteran small business owners who \nserve on this committee provide a unique perspective which is sorely \nneeded at this challenging time. Unfortunately, continuing uncertainty \nabout the Committee's future has, at times, distracted the committee \nfrom focusing on its core function. Therefore, I have called for its \npermanent extension. It is clear to me that more needs to be done to \naddress the issues facing veterans and reservists, and the role this \ncommittee plays will continue to be important.\n  Additionally, I have taken a number of steps to better serve the \nreservists who are serving their country abroad while their businesses \nare suffering at home. Over the past decade, the Department of Defense \nhas increased its reliance on the National Guard and reserves. This has \nintensified since September 11 and increased deployments are expected \nto continue. The effect of this increase on reservists and small \nbusinesses continues to remain of concern. A 2003 GAO report indicated \nthat 41 percent of reservists lost income when mobilized. This had a \nhigher effect on self-employed reservists, 55 percent of whom lost \nincome.\n  In 1999, I created the Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster \nLoan (MREIDL) program to provide loans to small businesses that incur \neconomic injury as a result of an essential employee being called to \nactive duty. However, since 2002, fewer than 300 of these loans have \nbeen approved by the SBA, despite record numbers of reservists being \ncalled to active duty. It is clear that changes need to be made, so \nthat reservists are informed about the availability of the MREIDL \nprogram and that the program better meets their needs.\n  At a hearing of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship \non January 31st, the first hearing we held in this Congress, we heard \nsuggestions for a number of changes which would improve the Military \nReservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, and I have included \nthose changes in this bill. They include increasing the application \ndeadline for such a loan from 90 days to one year following the date of \ndischarge; creating a pre-deployment loan approval process; and \nimproved outreach and technical assistance.\n  This bill also creates a non-collaterized loan program. Reservist \nfamilies have already sacrificed enough when a family member goes away \nto serve their country and when their business is harmed as a result. \nThis loan program would allow reservist dependent businesses to access \nthe capital they need to stay afloat without having to sacrifice beyond \nthe service of the key employees. In order to give reservists time to \nrepay the loans, the non-collaterized loan created in this bill would \nnot accumulate interest or require payments for one year or until after \nthe deployment ends, whichever is longer.\n  In addition, because loans aren't the answer for every business--\nadditional debt could permanently cripple some businesses--I have also \nincluded a grant program for reservists. This program would allow up to \n$25,000 in grants for small businesses that can show economic injury \nbecause of deployment and prove that they have a viable business plan \nfor the next three years. A grant program would help small businesses \nthat cannot afford to take on a military reservist economic injury \ndisaster loan or that were denied such a loan, but still are viable \nbusinesses and need assistance.\n  While addressing the funding needs of reservists is essential, I also \nwant to make sure that reservists receive the technical and management \nassistance they need to succeed. For that reason, this bill also \nincludes the establishment of the Reservists Enterprise Transition and \nSustainability Task Force. This grant program would allow Small \nBusiness Development Centers, Women's Business Centers and veteran \ncenters to compete for grants to create programs that help small \nbusinesses prepare for and cope with the mobilization of reservist-\nemployees and owners.\n  Veterans possess great technical skills and valuable leadership \nexperience, but they require financial resources to turn that potential \ninto a viable enterprise. A recent report by the Small Business \nAdministration stated that 22 percent of veterans plan to start or are \nstarting a business when they leave the military. For service-disabled \nveterans, this number rises to 28 percent. So the legislation I \nintroduce today will create a new program, administered by the Small \nBusiness\n\n[[Page S4051]]\n\nAdministration, to provide very-low-interest loans, up to $100,000, to \nhelp veterans start new small businesses.\n  Lastly, this bill calls for two reports from the Government \nAccountability Office. One report will look at the needs of service-\ndisabled veterans who are interested in becoming entrepreneurs. As a \nresult of the war on terror and improved medicine, we are seeing more \nservice-disabled veterans than we have seen in decades. For some \nservice-disabled veterans, entrepreneurship is the best or only way of \nachieving economic independence. Therefore, it is essential that we \nunderstand and take steps to address the needs of the service-disabled \nveteran entrepreneur or small business owner.\n  I am also calling for a study to investigate allegations that the \nchanges the Department of Defense has made in regard to the use of \nreservists is harming the ability of reservists to find jobs and the \nability of small business owners to continue hiring reservists. At the \nCommittee's hearing on veteran small business issues, witnesses \ntestified about reservists being turned down or not considered for jobs \nbecause they are reservists. I have heard reservists talk about being \npressured to leave the reserves if they would like to continue to \nadvance at work. I have also heard the concerns of small business \nowners who want to support servicemembers; however, they cannot do so \nif it means the survival of their business. Understanding more about \nthis issue is important and essential to making sure that policymakers \ncan continue to support citizen soldiers and the small businesses that \nemploy them across the Nation.\n  One of the issues I am not addressing in my legislation today is \nFederal procurement. I heard clearly the concerns from veterans that \nthey are not being treated fairly when it comes to selling goods and \nservices to the Federal Government, and I am committed to making \nchanges. However, to make real changes, changes that can pass the \nSenate and the House and become law, these changes must be part of a \nbigger package. Legislation that addresses not just the concerns of \nservice-disabled veteran small business owners, but the concerns of all \nsmall business owners who want their fair share of Federal contracts.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to deny \nqualified dividend income treatment to certain foreign dividends; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill clarify which dividends are eligible for a lower rate of 15 \npercent for upper-income taxpayers or a 5 percent rate for lower-income \ntaxpayers. I am concerned that some foreign companies have a tax \nadvantage over their American competitors.\n  Since dividend rates were lowered in 2003, some banks have promoted \nhybrid debt instruments from foreign corporations that may qualify for \nthe lower rate. These hybrid arrangements are treated as debt in the \nhost foreign country and the entity takes a deduction. In the United \nStates, these instruments are classified as equity and thus treated as \ndividends eligible for the lower rate.\n  This was not the intention of Congress, and this abuse needs to stop. \nThere should not be preferences in our tax code which make it easier \nfor foreign corporations to raise capital at the expense of American \ncompanies. I believe that changes need to be made to our tax system to \nensure that U.S companies can compete fairly in a global market place.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today is the same legislation \nintroduced by Ways and Means Subcommittee on Select Revenue Chairman \nNeal. This legislation amends Section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code to \ndisallow the preferential dividends rate for payments from foreign \nentities not subject to tax in the foreign country, for payments that \nare deductible in the foreign country, or payments with respect to an \ninstrument not treated as stock in the foreign country. In addition, \nthe bill does not allow dividends from an entity not subject to or \nexempt from corporate tax in a foreign country to be eligible for the \nlower rate. If the entity is a passive foreign investment company \n(PFIC), the dividend would not be eligible for the lower rate even if \nthe entity is also classified as a controlled foreign corporation.\n  This legislation builds upon a bill that Senator Baucus and I \nintroduced last Congress, S. 1363, which prevents dividends received \nfrom corporations in a tax haven from receiving the lower rate. This \nlegislation was introduced in the 109th Congress out of concern that \nthe definition of qualifying foreign corporations is overly broad and \nincludes companies in tax haven countries with little or no tax system.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today includes the provisions \nof S. 1363 which require that only dividends from foreign companies \nwhich are located in countries with a comprehensive income tax and are \ntraded on a U.S. stock exchange may qualify for the preferential rate. \nIn total, this legislation carries out the intent of the 2003 rate \ndeduction on dividends.\n  The initial proposal to address dividends taxation was designed to \neliminate the double taxation of corporate earnings. Eventually, this \nproposal was modified to lower the tax rate on dividends. I believe \nthat it was never the original intent of Congress to provide the lower \nrates to dividends which are not subject to double taxation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these common sense changes. I ask for \nunanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1006\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of State to work with the \nGovernment of Brazil and other foreign governments to develop \npartnerships that will strengthen diplomatic relations and energy \nsecurity by accelerating the development of biofuels production, \nresearch, and infrastructure to alleviate poverty, create jobs, and \nincrease income, while improving energy security and protecting the \nenvironment; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``United States \nBrazil Energy Cooperation Pact.'' This bill would direct the Secretary \nof State to work with the Government of Brazil and other foreign \ngovernments to develop partnerships that will strengthen diplomatic \nrelations and energy security, including through accelerated \ndevelopment of biofuels production, research and infrastructure. This \nwill help to alleviate poverty, create jobs, and increase income, while \nimproving energy security and protecting the environment..\n  Earlier this month President Bush and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio \nLula da Silva agreed in Sao Paulo to cooperate to promote ethanol in \nthe Americas as an alternative to oil. The agreement aims to increase \ncooperation on biofuels technology and to develop international \nbiofuels standards. President Bush is following up by hosting President \nda Silva at Camp David this Saturday, March 31.\n  President Bush intended his trip to rebuild bridges to Latin America. \nMany Latin Americans are critical, even hostile, over what they see as \nthe administration's neglect of the region. Strained relationships \noften are repaired in small steps. The ethanol accord promises mutual \nbenefits for the United States and Brazil, Latin America, and \npotentially, the rest of the world. If executed in a spirit of \npartnership and funded generously, it could have a significant regional \nand global impact on the development of ethanol markets, climate change \nand the ability of many poor countries to endure oil price shocks.\n  Although the agreement is overall a win-win-win deal for Brazil, the \nUnited States and the region, it has been criticized. Some opponents \nare simply trying to thwart better U.S.-Brazilian cooperation. But \nothers have raised concerns about the dislocations and unintended \nconsequences of promoting biofuel crops.\n  Only by addressing such worries and quelling the doubts can the \nBrazil-U.S. pact fully meet its promise to be a launching pad for what \nI envision as a transformational Americas-wide energy program that will \nradically improve the hemisphere's strategic and economic posture. \nToday I introduce the United States-Brazil Energy Cooperation Pact to \ncapitalize on the opportunity it presents to reestablish strong U.S. \nrelations with our neighbors while also building a more secure energy \nfuture.\n  The bill calls on Brazil and the United States to help fund \nfeasibility studies to assess each Latin American country's biofuel \nneeds and biomass production potential, with special attention to food \nsecurity and the environment. By encouraging cellulosic ethanol that \ndoes not rely on grains, it should help assuage fears, shared by \nAmerican and Latin American livestock producers alike, that excessive \nreliance on corn for ethanol will further drive up animal feed costs \nand thus prices of beef, pork and chicken. For Mexico, where \nskyrocketing tortilla prices have been blamed on the diversion of corn \nfor ethanol, the bill calls for special efforts to find non-corn \nsources of biofuels.\n  The legislation envisions a special hemispheric carbon trading system \nto encourage preservation of tropical rain forests in the face of \ngrowing demand for energy crops, and it calls on the regional \ndevelopment banks, as well as U.S. foreign assistance, to support \nbiofuel infrastructure projects.\n  The bill contains special provisions to help our closest and poorest \nneighbors in the Caribbean and Central America revive their moribund \nsugar cane industries so they can produce their own ethanol. Currently \nnearly all the ethanol they sell is processed product from Brazil.\n  And while biofuels are a key element of energy security, better \nutilization of conventional resources also plays a role. The bill seeks \nways to help optimize Mexican oil output, which is lagging to the \ndetriment of both countries, and encourages South America to exploit \nfully its natural gas supplies with new pipelines and liquefied natural \ngas facilities.\n  Giving the United States easy access to foreign ethanol supplies, \neven as we increase domestic production, is an essential component to \nmeet President Bush's target of 35 billion gallons of renewable fuels \nuse by 2017, which cannot be met by U.S. corn ethanol alone. U.S. corn \nethanol production will peak around 14 billion gallons in 2010, experts \nestimate. Reducing dependence on oil imported from unstable and often \nhostile regions is a paramount foreign policy imperative.\n  The U.S. doesn't tax imported oil, but currently levies a 54-cents-\nper-gallon tariff on imported ethanol to protect U.S. producers from \ncheaper Brazilian ethanol. It is clear that this barrier to trade in \nAmericas-grown fuel is inconsistent with our political goals in the \nregion, and with our long-term energy security.\n  Altering the import tax would affect a number of industries and \ninterests. Therefore, the bill calls for a comprehensive study on the \ncurrent political and economic impacts of the tariff and the potential \ncosts and benefits of repealing it or modifying it.\n  In this way, I believe that passage of this bill would encourage \nAdministration officials to rethink old policies in order to improve \nenergy cooperation, and encourage other Governments in the region to do \nlikewise. With this legislation, Congress can demonstrate to citizens \nof the Americas that the U.S. is ready to embark on an equal \npartnership for progress.\n  In conclusion, I look forward to working with each of my colleagues \nto ensure the energy security of our country and the region.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS:\n  S. 1008. A bill to amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to improve and \nstrengthen the safety inspection process of nuclear facilities; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould provide greater assurance to the citizens of our Nation that \ntheir elected officials will do everything within their power to \nprovide the highest levels of safety at nuclear facilities. The bill \ndoes this by allowing certain State officials to request that the \nUnited States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) conduct an \nindependent safety assessment at key times in the life of a reactor. I \nask that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  Too often we have found that the NRC has been uninterested in the \nlegitimate concerns of national and State legislators who have \nrequested greater safety oversight, especially at problem-plagued \nnuclear plants. In some instances, safety violations of the highest \nlevel have been allowed to continue, undetected, for years before \ndiscovery. Citizens deserve to have some greater assurance that when a \nplant has reached what was the intended end of its useful life and has \napplied for a license extension--another few decades of operating \nlife--or when a plant seeks an ``uprate''--an increase in power output \nfrom what it was permitted previously--or when there have been \nsignificant safety problems, that a facility will get a thorough review \nto protect the public safety. Without this bill, the public will \ncontinue to worry.\n  Under the legislation I am introducing, State officials would be able \nto request that a special Independent Safety Assessment Team be \nassembled to thoroughly review the safety of plants that meet the \ncriteria listed in\n\n[[Page S4055]]\n\nthis bill. The team would be composed of individuals selected by the \nNRC and the requesting Governor or State public utilities commission to \ninsure greater balance and independence on the Team. The Team's report \nwould make recommendations on safety features that should be improved \nbefore additional licensing requests and other operational matters are \nfavorably acted upon.\n  My legislation offers a simple and fair solution to a technical \nproblem faced by citizens across the Nation and I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me to ensure greater safety at our nuclear \nfacilities.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1008\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part A of title I of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965 to improve supplemental educational \nservices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I am here to discuss a topic of great \nmeaning to American families: educating our children. We all want what \nis best for our children, and to provide them with the tools they need \nto succeed in tomorrow's workforce.\n  Today, I want to concentrate on one particular program that can play \na key role in ensuring our children are meeting their educational \ngoals.\n  I rise, along with Senator John Cornyn of Texas, to once again \nintroduce the Raising Achievement Through Improving Supplemental \nEducation Act, or the RAISE Act for short.\n  The RAISE Act seeks to improve the Supplemental Educational Services \nprogram--a tutoring program under No Child Left Behind--to help it \nbecome well-known, widely available, and easily accessible to eligible \nstudents. It seeks to broaden eligibility requirements and \nprioritization of the program to target all low-performing students \nregardless of income status. The Supplemental Educational Services \nprogram--also known as SES--was implemented as part of No Child Left \nBehind and designed to be an innovative tool to help meet the academic \nneeds of low-income students attending continuously failing schools.\n  Under the program, low-income parents can elect to have free private \nafter-school tutoring for their children. To pay the providers of this \ntutoring service, school districts would need only to use a required 20 \npercent allocation of their Federal funds.\n  By providing direct tutoring after school, the SES program can help \nthose students who are behind catch up with their peers. This, in turn, \nalso improves the overall performance of the school. But, due to the \nlack of strong implementation, there have been numerous shortfalls \nnationwide. This is a troubling development that the RAISE Act seeks to \ncorrect.\n  For example, in the 2005-2006 school year, just 20 percent of the \neligible 2\\1/2\\ million students participated in SES programs. That \ntranslates into hundreds of thousands of eligible children not being \nprovided with tutoring help. The funding has already been set aside--\nthere are children across the\n\n[[Page S4056]]\n\nNation who could benefit from this after-school tutoring program--but \nthey have to know about it to benefit from it.\n  Parents and State agencies are reporting that poor communication, \ndelayed notification, and lack of transportation have become barriers \nto their children participating in the program. Also, there were some \nconflicts with other, better established after-school programs.\n  In Florida, we have already implemented SES improvements. As a \nresult, Florida is seeing stronger guidelines, better State oversight, \nand consequently, higher SES program participation rate.\n  Many of the provisions of the RAISE Act are modeled after the \nsuccesses already occurring in my home State. And it is notable that \nStates such as Maryland and Indiana--where similar guidelines have been \nin place longer--they are seeing a remarkable 64 to 68 percent \nparticipation rate in their SES programs.\n  In our school districts where SES programs are thriving, good \ncommunication with both parents and providers has been emphasized, as \nwell as access to on-site tutoring at school facilities.\n  Another important component of the RAISE Act is eligibility for SES. \nCurrently, SES targets low-income, low-performing students. I think we \nshould be targeting all low-performing students, regardless of income \nstatus. By overlooking many middle-class families who do not have the \nmoney to put their children into private tutoring or after-school \nprograms, many of those children are falling through the cracks.\n  How can we ensure that no child is being left behind unless we \nspecifically focus programs on those students who need the most help?\n  The RAISE Act was developed in consultation with school \nadministrators, State education officials, and non-profit and research \ngroups. This is a nationwide imperative and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this innovative set of reforms.\n  The RAISE Act aims to help every child in the schoolyard have an \nequal opportunity for scholastic growth and achievement--this also \nhappens to be the fundamental purpose of No Child Left Behind.\n  Together, all of us in this Chamber can make the RAISE Act a reality, \nand improve the academic lives of countless American schoolchildren in \nneed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1011. A bill to change the name of the National Institute on Drug \nAbuse to the National Institute on Diseases of Addiction and to change \nthe name of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism to \nthe National Institute on Alcohol Disorders and Health; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, for nearly 35 years I've been working on \nthis floor to address the all too real public health and safety issues \nassociated with drug and alcohol addiction. Stiff prosecution of \ntrafficking and possession of illegal drugs is important; but just as \ncritical is an intense focus on prevention and treatment. To this end, \nif we are to be successful in this fight, we--you, me, all of us--must \nunderstand that addiction is a neurobiological disease, not a lifestyle \nchoice. The frank and constructive approach to help those struggling \nwith the disease of addiction, and to protect society from the crime \nand violence that sometimes accompany drug trafficking and use, is \nthrough treatment. We must continually work hard to resist the \ncounterproductive social stigma that too often brands addicts and \nthereby encourages them to slip into seclusion rather than seek \ntreatment. As such, we must begin to change the nature of public \ndiscourse about addiction by more appropriately naming our own research \ninstitutes to reflect this reality: Addition is a preventable and \ntreatable disease.\n  Today, I rise to introduce legislation recognizing this reality that \naddiction is a disease and not a chronic, stigmatizing life-sentence. \nThe Recognizing Addiction as a Disease Act of 2007 changes the names of \ntwo institutes at the National Institutes of Health: the National \nInstitute on Drug Abuse will become the National Institute on Diseases \nof Addiction, and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and \nAlcoholism will become the National Institute on Alcohol Disorders and \nHealth.\n  These name changes accomplish two important objectives. First, they \nremove the pejorative term ``abuse'' from the institutes' names and \nproperly help to distance that notion from the disease of addiction. \nSecond, the new names more clearly link the concepts of addiction and \ndisease, a connection that scientific study clearly supports. \nIdentifying addiction as a neurobiological disease will diminish the \nsocial stigma, discrimination, and the personal shame that is often a \nbarrier to seeking treatment, and it will further a common \nunderstanding of diseases of addiction.\n  The 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that \naddiction affects 23.2 million Americans in our country, of whom only \nabout 10 percent are receiving the treatment they need. Many are \ndeterred from seeking such treatment because of the social stigma \nassociated with admitting to a drug or alcohol dependency. This bill is \na small but important step towards remedying this problem, fighting \ndrug use, and successfully treating addiction.\n  Addiction is now understood to be a disease because scientific \nresearch has shown that alcohol and other drugs can change the brain's \nstructure and function. Advances in brain imaging science now make it \npossible to see inside an addict's brain and pinpoint the parts of the \nbrain affected by drugs or alcohol. These insights will enable the \ndevelopment of new approaches to prevention and treatment. In fact, we \nnow have data indicating that excessive alcohol use and alcohol \ndependence (alcoholism) are not separate diagnostic categories, but \nexist along a single continuum of alcohol-disorders associated with \nincreased frequency of a harmful drinking pattern.\n  Today's introduction of this legislation is timely. Two weeks ago HBO \npremiered an important new documentary movie, Addiction, which presents \nan encouraging look at addiction as a treatable disease and the film \nchronicles the major scientific advances that have helped us better \nunderstand and treat addiction. The Institutes collaborated with HBO to \ncreate this eye-opening documentary that seeks to help Americans \nunderstand addiction. HBO's Addiction Project will acquaint viewers \nwith available evidence-based medical and behavioral treatments. This \nis especially important for disorders like addiction that for many \nyears were treated outside the medical mainstream. From emergency rooms \nto living rooms to research laboratories, the documentary follows the \ntrail of an illness that affects one in four families in the United \nStates.\n  The facts surrounding addiction are self-evident. With nearly 1 in 10 \nAmericans over the age of 12 suffering from some form of substance \ndependency, addiction takes an emotional, psychological, and social \ntoll on the country. The economic costs of substance dependency and \naddiction alone are estimated to exceed a half trillion dollars \nannually in the United States due to health care expenditures, lost \nproductivity, and crime.\n  I am proud to say that my friends and very distinguished colleagues \nSenators Kennedy and Enzi, chairman and ranking member of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, respectively, are cosponsors \nof this important bill.\n  Today, the Recognizing Addiction as a Disease Act of 2007 takes a \nsmall but important stride towards helping those struggling with \ndiseases of addiction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1015. A bill to reauthorize the National Writing Project; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am joined by my distinguished \ncolleague and friend from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, in \nintroducing the National Writing Project Act of 2007. The National \nWriting Project remains the only Federal program to improve the \nteaching of writing in America's classrooms.\n  Writing is complex, challenging and it is a basic component of \nliteracy. And, literacy is essential for success in life. A Belden \nRussonello & Stewart poll announced yesterday that overwhelmingly, \nAmericans want writing taught throughout school curriculum.\n\n[[Page S4057]]\n\nResearch shows that students taught by Writing Project demonstrate more \nimprovement and higher overall writing performance than their peers.\n  Writing is not confined to thesis papers, college essays, and book \nreports. Writing skills for employment in the 21st Century require not \nonly the grammar, construction and analytical thought of traditional \nwriting, but the skills needed to communicate effectively using new \ntechnology. Effective instruction in writing requires teachers with \nhigh ability, who continuously develop their teaching skills.\n  A United States Department of Education program since 1991 and nearly \n200 nation-wide, university based sites, the National Writing Project \nannually serves over 140,000 educators through more than 7,000 \nprograms. It is based on a model of teachers teaching teachers: \nexperienced teachers who share and develop the latest and most \nsuccessful instruction techniques who in turn lead similar local \nworkshops and training sessions for their colleagues.\n  National Writing Project teachers will be here this week to tell \ntheir personal stories and provide other information about what the \nCollege Board's National Commission on Writing calls ``arguably the \nmost successful teacher network in the United States.'' I hope all \nSenators will have the opportunity to visit with teachers from their \nState and I invite all Senators to join Mr. Rockefeller and me in \nsponsoring this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1015\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Writing Project Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States is facing a continuing crisis in \n     writing in schools and in the workplace.\n       (2) The writing problem has been magnified by the rapidly \n     changing student population, the growing number of English \n     language learners, the increasing numbers of adolescents who \n     are low-achieving writers, the shortage of adequately trained \n     teachers, and the specialized knowledge required of teachers \n     to teach students with special needs who are now part of \n     mainstream classrooms.\n       (3) Nationwide reports show that nearly one-third of high \n     school graduates are not ready for college-level English \n     composition courses.\n       (4) Writing is a threshold skill for both employment and \n     promotion. Deficiencies in writing skills have resulted in \n     annual private sector costs for providing writing training \n     that are as high as $3,100,000,000.\n       (5) Writing is a central feature in State and school \n     district education standards in all disciplines.\n       (6) Since 1973, the only national program to address the \n     writing problem in the Nation's schools has been the National \n     Writing Project, a network of collaborative university-school \n     programs.\n       (7) Evaluations of the National Writing Project document \n     significant gains in student performance in writing and \n     effective classroom practices.\n       (8) The National Writing Project has become a model for \n     programs to improve teaching in such other fields as \n     mathematics, science, history, civics and government, \n     geography, reading and literature, technology, performing \n     arts, and foreign languages.\n       (9) Each year, more than 135,000 teachers directly benefit \n     from National Writing Project programs in nearly 200 sites \n     located in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin \n     Islands.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF THE NATIONAL WRITING PROJECT.\n\n       Subpart 2 of part C of title II of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6701 et seq.) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n\n                 ``Subpart 2--National Writing Project\n\n     ``SEC. 2331.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Thad Cochran, in\n\n[[Page S4058]]\n\nsponsoring the reauthorization of the National Writing Project. We have \nworked together for many years on the wonderful program that supports \nteachers and quality writing. Senator Cochran has long been one of this \nbody's strongest advocates for not only the NWP, but for education in \ngeneral. His leadership is quiet and effective, and truly inspiring.\n  The National Writing Project, NWP, provides our teachers with \nprofessional development to enhance their skills and in turn those \nteachers bring new skills and new enthusiasm to their classrooms and \ntheir students. Over 141,000 educators annually go through the NWP and \nbecome invaluable resources to millions of children nationwide. The NWP \nis at the forefront in the efforts to improve our schools for teachers \nand students.\n  The NWP is not only a great idea in theory but it has a record of \nsuccess by consistently delivering results that can be seen in our \nclassrooms. Students in NWP classrooms have shown demonstrably improved \nability to organize and develop ideas in writing. A study published in \nJanuary 2006 concluded that students whose teachers underwent NWP \ntraining uniformly demonstrated positive results.\n  Every State participates in the program. West Virginia has benefited \ntremendously from this program. The three sites in my State are Central \nWest Virginia Writing Project, Marshall University Graduate College in \nSouth Charleston, the Marshall University Writing Project in \nHuntington, and the National Writing Project at West Virginia \nUniversity in Morgantown. I am particularly proud of the leadership at \nMarshall University on its Technology Project to explore ways to better \nintegrate technology into writing and classroom education. During the \n2005-2006 school year the NWP conducted more than 140 programs serving \nover 3,000 teachers.\n  The NWP is a perfect example of how the public and the private sector \nshould work in partnership to improve our society. The NWP operating \nbudget comes not only from the Federal Government but from in kind \ncontribution from colleges and universities.\n  Programs like the NWP are an essential part strengthening our \neducation system, and it deserves our continued support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Enzi (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Conrad)):\n  S. 1017. A bill to amend the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to \nprohibit the use of certain anti-competitive forward contracts; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, Wyoming's late, great country music star \nChris LeDoux has a song Some Things Never Change. I wish that were the \ncase for Wyoming's hardworking livestock producers. As production \nagriculture has evolved and improved in the United States, producers in \nWyoming continue to be held hostage to a regulatory nightmare and bound \nby the chains of unfair and manipulative marketing contracts. It is \nthis regulatory nightmare that must be addressed. That is why I am \nreintroducing legislation today to break the chains and require \nlivestock contracts to contain a fixed base price and be traded in \nopen, public markets.\n  From Kaycee to Kansas City, captive supply is destroying the health \nof our family ranches. Many of these small businesses have operated for \ngenerations. Unfortunately, a handshake and an honest day's labor \ncannot compete with deceptive business practices. Captive supply is a \nbusiness practice not well known to those outside of the industry, but \na practice that has had a tremendous impact on the ranchers of the \nWest.\n  I go back to Wyoming almost every weekend. Because Wyoming is such a \nlarge State, my travels take me to a different section of the State on \neach trip. Throughout Wyoming I hear the same concerns from my \nconstituents. They are all clamoring for attention and relief so they \ncan continue the work that so many in their families have done for so \nmany years. These concerns are not unique to Wyoming. Captive supply is \nan industry-wide problem.\n  So what is captive supply--and how is it harming our Nation's \nranchers to such an extent? Simply put, captive supply refers to the \nownership by meat packers of cattle or the contracts they issue to \npurchase livestock. It is done to ensure that packers will always have \na consistent supply of livestock on the kill floor which keeps \nslaughterhouses in perpetual operation.\n  The original goal of captive supply makes good business sense. All \nbusinesses want to maintain a steady supply of animals to ensure a \nconstant stream of production and control costs.\n  But captive supply allows packers to go beyond good organization and \nbusiness performance--to market manipulation--and this is where the \nproblem lies.\n  The packing industry is highly concentrated. Using captive supply and \nthe market power of concentration, packers can purposefully drive down \nthe prices by refusing to buy in the open market. This deflates all \nlivestock prices and limits the market access of producers that have \nnot aligned with specific packers.\n  We made an attempt to address the problem of captive supply on the \nSenate floor during the 2002 Farm Bill debate, but the amendment to ban \npacker ownership of livestock more than 14 days before slaughter did \nnot survive the conference committee deliberation. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on the reauthorization of the Farm Bill this \nyear. I will press this issue during the drafting of the Competition \nTitle of the Farm Bill with my congressional colleagues.\n  The problems caused by captive supply are alive and well, just as \nWyoming producers have testified to me in the phone calls, letters, \nfaxes and emails I receive from them. Although I supported the packer \nban and have cosponsored it again this Congress, I do not think that \nbanning packer ownership of livestock will solve the entire captive \nsupply problem. Packers are using numerous methods beyond direct \nownership to control cattle and other livestock.\n  Currently, packers maintain captive supply through various means \nincluding direct ownership, forward contracts, and marketing \nagreements. The difference between the three is subtle, so let me take \na moment to describe how they differ. Direct ownership refers to \nlivestock owned by the packer. In forward contracts, producers agree to \nthe delivery of cattle one week or more before slaughter with the price \ndetermined before slaughter. Forward contracts are typically fixed, \nmeaning the base price is set.\n  As with forward contracts, marketing agreements also call for the \ndelivery of livestock more than one week before slaughter, but the \nprice is determined at or after slaughter. A formula pricing method is \ncommonly used for cattle sold under marketing agreements. In formula \npricing, instead of a fixed base price, an external reference price, \nsuch as the average price paid for cattle at a certain packing plant \nduring one week, is used to determine the base price of the cattle. I \nfind this very disturbing because the packer has the ability to \nmanipulate the weekly average at a packing plant by refusing to buy in \nthe open market. Unfortunately, marketing agreements and formula \npricing are much more common than forward contracts.\n\n  Livestock producers have the same questions when they lose to the \nmarket pressures applied by captive supply. Captive supply gives \npackers the ability to discriminate against some producers. And those \nproducers pay for it with their bottom line. At the same time, packers \nuse contracts and marketing agreements to give privileged access and \npremiums to other producers regardless of the quality of their product. \nThese uses of captive supply should be illegal. In fact, they are.\n  Section 202 of the Packers and Stockyards Act states in (3) (a) and \n(b):\n  ``It shall be unlawful for any packer with respect to livestock . . . \nto:\n  ``(a) Engage in or use any unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or \ndeceptive practice or device; or\n  ``(b) Make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage \nto any particular person or locality in any respect, or subject any \nparticular person or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or \ndisadvantage in any respect.''\n  Packers that practice price discrimination toward some producers and \nprovide undue preferences to other producers are clearly in violation \nof the\n\n[[Page S4059]]\n\nlaw. But this law is not being enforced. So what we are left with are \nunenforced laws or no laws at all to protect the independent producer. \nThe Packers and Stockyards Act is not being enforced and the cost of \nenforcing the law on a case-by-case basis in the courts is expensive \nand time-consuming.\n  A law is not worth the paper it is printed on if it is not enforced. \nThe posted speed limit is not a suggestion. Our law enforcement \nofficers enforce the law when motorists fail to heed the posted sign. \nThis section of the Packers and Stockyards Act is like a sign on the \nroad of commerce that no one is paying attention to because the police \nare busy doing something else. The bill I am introducing today is not \njust another sign on the road. It is a speed bump. It does not just \nwarn cars to go slower; it makes it much more difficult for them to \nspeed.\n  My bill does two things to create the speed bump. It requires that \nlivestock producers have a fixed base price in their contracts. It also \nputs these contracts up for bid in the open market where they belong.\n  Under this bill, forward contracts and marketing agreements must \ncontain a fixed base price on the day the contract is signed. This \nprevents packers from manipulating the base price after the point of \nsale. You may hear allegations that this bill ends quality-driven \nproduction, but it does not prevent adjustments to the base price after \nslaughter for quality, grade or other factors outside packer control. \nIt prevents packers from changing the base price based on factors that \nthey do control. Contracts that are based on the futures market are \nalso exempted from the bill's requirements.\n  In an open market, buyers and sellers would have the opportunity to \nbid against each other for contracts and could witness bids that are \nmade and accepted. Whether they take the opportunity to bid or not is \ntheir choice, the key here is that they have access to do so.\n  My bill also limits the size of contracts to the rough equivalent of \na load of livestock, meaning 40 cattle or 30 swine. It does not limit \nthe number of contracts that can be offered by an individual. This key \nportion prevents small and medium-sized livestock producers, like those \nfound in Wyoming, from being shut out of deals that contain thousands \nof livestock per contract.\n  Requiring a firm base price and an open and transparent market ends \nthe potential for price discrimination, price manipulation and undue \npreferences. These are not the only benefits of my bill. It also \npreserves the very useful risk management tool that contracts provide \nto livestock producers. Contracts help producers plan and prepare for \nthe future. My bill makes contracts and marketing agreements an even \nbetter risk management tool because it solidifies the base price for \nthe producer. Once the agreement is made, a producer can have \nconfidence on shipping day in his ability to feed his family during the \nnext year because he will know in advance how much he can expect to \nreceive for his livestock.\n  This bill also encourages electronic trading. An open and public \nmarket would function much like the stock market, where insider trading \nis prohibited. The stock market provides a solid example of how \nelectronic livestock trading can work to the benefit of everyone \ninvolved. For example, price discovery in an open and electronic market \nis automatic.\n  Captive supply is still weighing on the minds and hurting the \npocketbooks of ranchers in Wyoming and across the United States. \nWyoming ranchers encourage me to keep up the good fight on this issue \non every trip I make to my home state. The economic soul of Wyoming is \nbuilt on the foundation of small towns and small businesses. All \nlivestock producers, even small and medium-sized ones, should have a \nfair chance to compete that allows them to get the best price possible \nfor their product. We must do everything we can to keep our small \nproducers in business.\n  My bill removes one of the largest obstructions preventing livestock \nproducers from competing--formula-priced contracts. I ask my colleagues \nto assist me in giving their constituents and mine the chance to \nperform on a level playing field.\n  While Some Things Never Change, it is time for a sea change in the \narea of captive supply.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Hagel, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1018. A bill to address security risks posed by global climate \nchange and for other purposes; to the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, Senator Hagel and I introduced the \nbipartisan Global Climate Change Security Oversight Act. We were joined \nby Senator Feinstein. Our bill states that the consequences of global \nclimate change represent a clear and present danger to the security of \nthe United States.\n  For years, many of us have examined global warming as an \nenvironmental or economic issue. We also need to consider it as a \nsecurity concern. Our bill begins this process by requiring a National \nIntelligence Estimate to assess the strategic challenges presented by \nthe world's changing climate.\n  The National Security Strategy of 2006 stated that the United States \nnow faces new security challenges, including ``environmental \ndestruction, whether caused by human behavior or cataclysmic mega-\ndisasters such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, or tsunamis. \nProblems of this scope may overwhelm the capacity of local authorities \nto respond, and may even overtax national militaries, requiring a \nlarger international response. These challenges are not traditional \nnational security concerns, such as the conflict of arms or ideologies. \nBut if left unaddressed they can threaten national security.''\n  Global climate change represents one of the new environmental \nchallenges outlined in the National Security Strategy that poses a \nthreat to our national security. Failing to recognize and plan for the \ngeopolitical challenges of global warming would represent a serious \nmistake.\n  A National Intelligence Estimate is a comprehensive review of a \npotential security threat that combines, correlates and evaluates \nintelligence from all of the relevant U.S. intelligence agencies. \nVarious intelligence agencies--the CIA, NSA, the Pentagon, FBI, etc. \nmust pool data, share perspectives and work together to assemble an \naccurate picture of threats to U.S. security.\n  Without an NIE, the various agencies may never have an opportunity to \nexamine each other's data, and any differences or similarities between \nthe reports could provide important information for policymakers.\n  In this legislation, we ask for the intelligence community to provide \na strategic estimate of the risks posed by global climate change for \ncountries or regions that are of particular economic or military \nsignificance to the United States or that are at serious risk of \nhumanitarian suffering. This NIE will assess the political, social, \nagricultural, and economic challenges for countries and their likely \nimpact.\n  Every region will be affected differently by global warming and it is \ncritical that our intelligence and military communities are prepared to \nhandle the situations most likely to arise.\n  For example, rising sea levels will have a profound impact on low \nlying coastal areas, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. This region \nis home to 58 percent of the world's population and 57 percent of the \nworld's poorest population. More than 5 million people live in major \ncities that are in low lying coastal areas.\n  People in the Asia-Pacific region already endure coastal natural \ndisasters, such as tsunamis, and inland flooding. Between 2001 and \n2005, 62,273 people were killed annually by water related disasters in \nthis region. This number is only going to increase as the world warms.\n  Africa is a place where changes in precipitation patterns will be \nparticularly devastating. Many areas are already under enormous stress \nfrom drought and hunger. In 2005, 30 million people in 34 countries \nconfronted food shortages as a result of drought. It is estimated that \nthe droughts will become more severe and impact more people if the \ntemperature continues to rise.\n  Environmental changes caused by global warming represent a potential \nthreat multiplier for instability around the world. Scarce water, for \nexample, may exacerbate conflict along economic, ethnic, or sectarian \ndivisions.\n\n[[Page S4060]]\n\nWater shortages, food insecurity, or flooding all of which may occur as \na result of rising global temperatures could also displace people, \nforcing them to migrate. Many of the most severe effects of global \nwarming are expected in regions where fragile governments are least \ncapable of responding to them.\n  This NIE will examine these questions and more. It will also do \nsomething that we don't do often enough here in Congress: it will look \nbeyond the near horizon of the next election or the next few years and \nrequire the intelligence community to think about these issues in the \ncontext of the next 30 years.\n  The bill we introduced today will also fund additional research by \nthe Department of Defense in order to examine the impact of climate \nchange on military operations.\n  Rising temperatures are altering the international environment. We \nneed to be prepared for this new world.\n  We hope that our colleagues will join us in this bipartisan effort to \nassess the strategic implications of climate change. The scientific \ncommunity has demonstrated that the earth is growing warmer. We are \nasking the intelligence community to analyze the geopolitical \nimplications of these changes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1018\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Climate Change \n     Security Oversight Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration, in 2007 the average annual temperature in the \n     United States and around the global is approximately 1.0 \n     degree Fahrenheit warmer than at the start of the 20th \n     century, and the rate of warming has accelerated during the \n     past 30 years, increasing globally since the mid-1970s. The \n     fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on \n     Climate Change has predicted that the Earth will warm 0.72 \n     degrees Fahrenheit during the next 2 decades with current \n     emission trends.\n       (2) The annual national security strategy report submitted \n     pursuant to section 108 of the National Security Act of 1947 \n     (50 U.S.C. 404a) for 2006 states that the United States faces \n     new security challenges, including ``environmental \n     destruction, whether caused by human behavior or cataclysmic \n     mega-disasters such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, or \n     tsunamis. Problems of this scope may overwhelm the capacity \n     of local authorities to respond, and may even overtax \n     national militaries, requiring a larger international \n     response. These challenges are not traditional national \n     security concerns, such as the conflict of arms or \n     ideologies. But if left unaddressed they can threaten \n     national security.''.\n       (3) According to the fourth assessment report of the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, average \n     temperature increases of between 2 and 4 degrees Celsius over \n     preindustrial levels are projected to cause the sea level to \n     rise by between 2 and 4 meters by 2100 due to melting of the \n     Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.\n       (4) In 2007, more than 200,000,000 people live in coastal \n     floodplains around the world and 2,000,000 square kilometers \n     of land and an estimated $1,000,000,000,000 worth of assets \n     are less than a 1-meter elevation above sea level.\n       (5) An estimated 1,700,000,000 people in the world live in \n     areas where water is scarce and in 25 years that population \n     is projected to increase to 5,400,000,000. Climate change \n     will impact the hydrological cycle and change the location, \n     time of year, and intensity of water availability.\n       (6) The report of the World Health Organization entitled \n     ``The World Health Report 2002: Reducing Risks and Promoting \n     Healthy Life'' states that ``Effects of climate change on \n     human health can be expected to be mediated through complex \n     interactions of physical, ecological, and social factors. \n     These effects will undoubtedly have a greater impact on \n     societies or individuals with scarce resources, where \n     technologies are lacking, and where infrastructure and \n     institutions (such as the health sector) are least able to \n     adapt.''.\n       (7) Environmental changes relating to global climate change \n     represent a potentially significant threat multiplier for \n     instability around the world as changing precipitation \n     patterns may exacerbate competition and conflict over \n     agricultural, vegetative, and water resources and displace \n     people, thus increasing hunger and poverty and causing \n     increased pressure on fragile countries.\n       (8) The strategic, social, political, and economic \n     consequences of global climate change are likely to have a \n     greater adverse effect on less developed countries with fewer \n     resources and infrastructures that are less able to adjust to \n     new economic and social pressures, and where the margin for \n     governance and survival is thin.\n       (9) The consequences of global climate change represent a \n     clear and present danger to the security and economy of the \n     United States.\n       (10) A failure to recognize, plan for, and mitigate the \n     strategic, social, political, and economic effects of a \n     changing climate will have an adverse impact on the national \n     security interests of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President. I rise today to join Senator Durbin in \nintroducing the Global Climate Change Security Oversight Act.\n  Global climate change has implications beyond economic, environmental \nand energy policies. It has the potential to affect every aspect of our \ndaily lives. It is because of the possible broad impact on U.S. \ninterests at home and abroad that I have agreed to be the lead \nRepublican co-sponsor on the Global Climate Change Security Oversight \nAct.\n  Senator Durbin and I differ on policy initiatives designed to reduce \nthe impact of climate change. We do agree, however, on the need to \nassess potential impacts of the changing climate on U.S. national \nsecurity interests so that our Nation can develop responsible, forward-\nthinking policies that ensure the continued safety and prosperity of \nthe American people.\n  There will always be uncertainties and incomplete information in \nclimate science. This is the nature of scientific discovery; it is \nconstantly evolving, constantly gaining new insights and explanations \nof our natural world. National policy must be crafted based on what is \nknown, but also must be able to incorporate the uncertainties of what \nis yet to be learned.\n  Our bill provides a foundation for future policy options. It \ninstructs the Director of National Intelligence to conduct a National \nIntelligence Estimate to assess the potential geopolitical effects of \nglobal climate change and the implications for U.S. national security. \nIt asks for a risk assessment of a broad array of impacts based on \ncurrent scientific understanding. This bill is intended to gather \ninformation about the national security implications of projected \nclimate change, so that in the future, Congress can develop policies \nthat protect U.S. interests around the world.\n  I have said that the debate is not about whether we should take \naction, but rather what kind of action we should take. It would be \nirresponsible to attempt to develop a response to the physical effects \nof climate change without knowing what the potential consequences are. \nOur actions should always be based on a comprehensive base of \nscientific information and knowledge. Without this kind of information, \nwe cannot effectively determine what the risks to U.S. national \nsecurity will be. We cannot realistically design policies that mitigate \nthese risks without this information. General Charles F. ``Chuck'' \nWald, USAF, ret., former Deputy Commander, Headquarters U.S. European \nCommand, has stated, ``This bipartisan legislation takes on an \nimportant emerging policy issue--the impact of climate change and \nnational security. I support its call for a national intelligence \nestimate of the topic and authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \nconduct further research on the military impact of climate change.''\n  As I have said for many years, the way forward is to responsibly \naddress the issue of climate change with a national strategy that \nincorporates economic, environmental and energy priorities. These \nissues are inextricably linked and changes to one will effect the other \ntwo. These priorities are also an integral part of U.S. national \nsecurity. Risk assessment is essential to putting our national \nresources in the places where they will be most effective. This is even \nmore important when assessing risk to national security. This \nlegislation will provide information we need to continue to help make \nour country secure in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/28/senate-section/article/S4061-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 130--DESIGNATING JULY 28, 2007, AS ``NATIONAL DAY OF \n                         THE AMERICAN COWBOY''\n\n  Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Salazar, Mr. \nEnsign, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Cornyn, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Baucus, \nMr. Allard, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nCrapo, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Hatch) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, last December, the Civil Air Patrol \ncompleted its 65th year of distinguished service to our Nation. I've \ncome to the floor today to pay tribute to the brave men and women who \nhelped this important organization reach this milestone.\n  In the late 1930s, Gill Robb Wilson, General Henry ``Hap'' Arnold, \nand other American aviation leaders recognized the need for a civilian \ngroup which could complement air operations undertaken by our military. \nTheir vision led to the establishment of the Civil Air Patrol on \nDecember 1, 1941.\n  Less than a week later, Pearl Harbor was attacked and the United \nStates was drawn into World War II. The newly formed Civil Air Patrol \nplayed a vital role in keeping America safe during this dark period in \nour history. CAP members kept watch for enemy submarines, assisted the \nArmy Air Corps with training exercises, and helped transport military \npersonnel and cargo. They rescued hundreds of crash survivors and \nhelped force the Nazis to withdraw U-boat operations from our East \nCoast. In total, thousands of CAP volunteers flew more than 500,000 \nhours and 24 million miles during the war.\n  The tremendous accomplishments and potential of this organization did \nnot go unnoticed. After World War II, President Truman signed a law \ndesignating the Civil Air Patrol as a nonprofit, benevolent corporation \nand an ``instrumentality of the United States.'' Two years later, \nCongress passed legislation establishing CAP as a volunteer auxiliary \nof the United States Air Force.\n  Today, the three principal missions of the Civil Air Patrol are to \nadminister cadet training programs, provide aerospace education, and \nperform operations related to homeland security and emergency services. \nThis organization has exceeded all expectations in each of these areas.\n  Approximately 750,000 American children have learned important life \nand leadership lessons from CAP's cadet programs. More than 300,000 \nteachers--and some eight million students--have received training and \ninstructional materials through CAP's aerospace education program. CAP \nvolunteers have now flown more than one million hours of search and \nrescue operations, and thousands of lives have been saved as a result. \nAs an Alaskan, I am particularly appreciative of these efforts--since \n2004, the Civil Air Patrol has saved at least 57 lives in our State. \nAnd, I served as a Legal Officer for the Civil Air Patrol in Fairbanks, \nAK, in the 1950s.\n  Today, the Civil Air Patrol is a nationwide organization of nearly \n57,000 volunteers. CAP wings can be found in all 50 States, the \nDistrict of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The organization's members--all \nvolunteers--fly approximately 120,000 hours each year as they assist \nwith border patrol, terrorism preparedness, the War on Drugs, and \nnatural disaster responses.\n  The Civil Air Patrol also submits an annual report to Congress. In \n2005, this report was titled ``Everyday Heroes . . . The Faces of the \nCivil Air Patrol.'' In part, the word ``hero'' is defined as ``a person \nnoted for feats of courage or nobility of purpose, especially one who \nhas risked or sacrificed his or her life.''\n  Mr. President, I can think of no title more fitting for the members \nof the Civil Air Patrol. The men and women of this organization have \nvolunteered their time and resources in the service of others for the \npast 65 years. Each is truly an ``everyday hero'' and worthy of our \nNation's deepest gratitude.\n  In honor of the Civil Air Patrol's 65th anniversary, Senators Inouye, \nDomenici, Crapo, Murkowski, Wyden, Sanders, Snowe, Collins, Warner, \nInhofe, and I have introduced S. Res. XX. I encourage each Member of \nthe Senate to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/28/senate-section/article/S4062-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4062-S4063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 133--CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF BISHOP GILBERT EARL \n                               PATTERSON\n\n  Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. \nCorker) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Any such motion shall be debatable. In any case \n     in which such point of order is sustained against a \n     conference report (or Senate amendment derived from such \n     conference report by operation of this subsection), no \n     further amendment shall be in order.\n\n     SEC. 215.

DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR SCHIP LEGISLATION.\n\n       (a) Priority.--The Senate establishes the following \n     priorities and makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Senate shall make the enactment of legislation to \n     reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program \n     (SCHIP) a top priority for the remainder of fiscal year 2007, \n     during the first session of the 110th Congress.\n       (2) Extending health care coverage to the Nation's \n     vulnerable uninsured children is an urgent priority for the \n     Senate.\n       (3) SCHIP has proven itself a successful program for \n     covering previously uninsured children.\n       (4) More than 6 million children are enrolled in this \n     landmark program, which has enjoyed broad bipartisan support \n     in Congress, among our Nation's governors, and within state \n     and local governments.\n       (5) SCHIP reduces the percentage of children with unmet \n     health care needs.\n       (6) Since SCHIP was created, enormous progress has been \n     made in reducing disparities in children's coverage rates.\n       (7) Uninsured children who gain coverage through SCHIP \n     receive more preventive care and their parents report better \n     access to providers and improved communications with their \n     children's doctors.\n       (8) Congress has a responsibility to reauthorize SCHIP \n     before the expiration of its current authorization.\n       (b) Reserve Fund.--The Chairman of the Senate Committee on \n     the Budget may revise the allocations, aggregates, and other \n     appropriate levels in this resolution for a bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     provides up to $50,000,000,000 for reauthorization of the \n     State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), if such \n     legislation maintains coverage for those currently enrolled \n     in SCHIP, continues efforts to reach uninsured children who \n     are already eligible for SCHIP or Medicaid but are not \n     enrolled, and supports States in their efforts to move \n     forward in covering more children, by the amounts provided in \n     that legislation for those purposes up to $20,000,000,000 \n     over the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012, provided \n     that such legislation would not increase the deficit over the \n     total of the period of fiscal years 2007 through 2012. Among \n     the policy changes that could be considered to achieve \n     offsets to the cost of reauthorizing the State Children's \n     Health Insurance Program and expanding coverage for children \n     is an increase in the tobacco products user fee rate with all \n     revenue generated by such increase dedicated to such \n     reauthorization and expansion.\n\n     SEC. 302.
