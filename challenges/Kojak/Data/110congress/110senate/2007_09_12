There is a period of 20 minutes of debate with \nrespect to the DeMint amendment and then a rollcall vote following the \nDeMint amendment, if the participants so desire, and then there will be \n2 minutes of debate on the Coburn amendments. So Members should be \nprepared to vote around 9:25. There will be three rollcall votes--\nDeMint, Coburn, and then final passage. They will be the only votes \ntoday.\n  When Members return next week, there will be no rollcall votes on \nMonday, September 17, as I had previously announced a long time ago. \nBut on Tuesday, we may have votes in the morning. I haven't worked that \nout yet with the distinguished Republican leader. We do have some \nthings we have to try to dispose of prior to moving to the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Maybe today, if not on Monday next, we will have a consent agreement \nregarding how we are going to move forward on the Iraq amendments and \nthe Defense authorization bill. So next week will be an action-packed \nweek. We have the Jewish holiday--we have Yom Kippur--which will begin \nnext Friday, 9 days from now, at sundown. That being the case, we will \nhave no votes after 1 o'clock on Friday next.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11461-6", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide a system for better construction and maintenance \n   of America's aging bridge infrastructure by spending American tax \n               dollars more effectively and efficiently)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. NONAPPLICATION OF PROVISIONS.\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to \n     implement the provisions, or make payments subject to the \n     provisions, of subchapter IV of part A of chapter 31 of title \n     40, United States Code, with respect to a contract for the \n     construction or maintenance of any bridge which, as of the \n     date of enactment of this Act, is classified under the \n     Federal Highway Administration's bridge inspection program as \n     ``structurally deficient'' or ``functionally obsolete''.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the opportunity \nto speak on my amendment. I do have an amendment to the Transportation \nbill that I would like to talk about for a few minutes this morning.\n  I have listened to a lot of the debate this week. Obviously, \ntransportation is a key issue for this country, and it has become clear \nthat because of the tragedy in Minnesota, many of us are concerned \nabout bridges and those that are deficient. We have talked a lot about \nhow to fund those, and I am afraid, as Congress often does, we ignore a \nserious problem until it is too late, and then we decide we want to \nthrow a lot of money at it and we come riding in on white horses to fix \nthe problem.\n  I think we do need to look at the problem and what we can do at the \nFederal level, and I have an amendment that I think will make the \ndollars we spend go a lot further that I would like to present to \nMembers this morning. But, first, I think we need to review a little of \nthe situation we are in.\n  I think we have all heard in the debate that America has many bridges \nwe have deemed structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. My \namendment addresses these particular bridges. There are over 150,000 \nbridges in the country today--or over 20 percent of our total bridges--\nthat fall under the classification of structurally deficient and \nfunctionally obsolete.\n  Every day in this country, right now, people are going to work and \nfilling up their gas tanks. Over 18 cents of every gallon they put in \ntheir tanks is a Federal tax that comes to us. That tax was actually \nstarted many years ago when we wanted to build the Interstate Highway \nSystem in this country. It started at a much lower level. I think most \nof us know the Interstate Highway System is basically complete. Yet we \nhave continued to take that tax and raise it over the years. So what we \nare doing is taking money from the States and bringing it to \nWashington. The problem is that very little of that actually gets back \nfor the maintenance of bridges in our States.\n  To start off with, a lot of States, the majority of States in this \ncountry, don't get back what they send. We call them donor States. \nSouth Carolina is one of the donor States. We will send our tax to \nWashington and, for years, we have gotten back less than 90 cents on a \ndollar. This clearly hurts our State. But what does come back comes \nback with a lot of red tape and regulations that prevent the dollars \nfrom going as far as they could.\n  What has happened in South Carolina and many other States is that in \norder to get those Federal dollars back, we have had to match them with \nour State dollars. For years, we have taken money out of our \nmaintenance funds for roads and bridges and used it to match the \nFederal dollars. But the Federal dollars have to be used in particular \nways that are not necessarily for the maintenance of roads and bridges. \nEven more important are all of the earmarks we put in the \nTransportation bill, earmarks for bridges to nowhere or a Big Dig in \nBoston, and these earmarks usually have to be matched at a higher level \nto get those dollars, and they have to then be used in the way the \nearmark prescribes.\n  We have looked through a lot of past bills and found very few \nearmarks that are to maintain and improve bridges. They are for new \nprojects and things on which we can do press releases. But the bottom \nline is this: Less than 40 cents on a dollar that we send to Washington \nactually ends up helping to maintain roads and bridges. That is a \nproblem.\n  Now, there are a lot of things we can do, and I have identified one I \nwould like us to focus on today. It is the old law called the Davis-\nBacon provision. It actually started during the Depression, when many \ncompanies were hungry to get business, and so they sharpened their \npencils and gave lower bids to cities, and the larger companies didn't \nlike that. So they created the Davis-Bacon law, which actually allows \nthe Federal Government to set the wages of companies when they are \ndoing Federal work.\n  What happens in most parts of the country, such as South Carolina, \nwhen a small company--perhaps a minority-owned company--may be trying \nto compete with a large company, they will come in with a lower bid, \nbut then they have to allow the Federal Government to set the wages. We \ncall it prevailing wages, but it may not be the prevailing wage in \nSouth Carolina. The American Association of Builders and Contractors \nhas estimated that the Davis-Bacon provision raises the cost of \nconstruction from 5 percent to 38 percent. Just think of that. Think of \nthat money and how it could be multiplied if that provision was not \npart of the equation for maintaining and getting these obsolete and \nstructurally deficient bridges in better order.\n  That is what this amendment is about. It is not an unprecedented \nidea. President Bush realized during Katrina that we had to do a lot of \nwork and get a lot of firms in action--small firms. All these firms \nhave already worked out the salaries with their employees. Some may be \nrevenue sharing and not related to salary. But as long as Davis-Bacon \nis in order, those firms have to wait for the Federal Government to \ntell them what to pay their employees so they can then bid a job. It \nslows the whole process. So during Katrina, the President waived it, \nand during Hurricane Andrew, after that we waived the Davis-Bacon \nprovision so that the money could go further and the rebuilding could \ntake place quicker.\n\n  My amendment is very simple in that it focuses particularly on \nbridges that have already been designated structurally deficient or \nfunctionally obsolete. For 1 year only, we waive this Davis-Bacon \nprovision so that the States and municipalities around this country can \ntake the Federal money that is provided and make it go further to fix \nthese bridges--to build new ones in some cases--and to allow them to \nmove quicker and not wait for some Federal bureaucrat to tell them what \nto pay their employees in order to get a job from the city.\n\n[[Page S11463]]\n\n  Anyone in business, particularly in the construction-related \nbusiness, knows that it sometimes is feast or famine; you either have \ntoo much work or you don't have any. Many times, a municipal government \nor State government can get a lot lower bid and get work done much \nquicker if they are allowed to take those low bids. Unfortunately, the \nway we have it set up with Davis-Bacon, we force such a bureaucracy, we \nforce these particular salaries on these companies that may have \ndifferent arrangements with their employees, and it slows the whole \nprocess. Just think--we are talking about a 38-percent increase in \ncost, in some cases, just because of Davis-Bacon.\n  So I would encourage my colleagues to consider this amendment. We are \nnot talking about getting rid of Davis-Bacon forever, although I think \nthat is something we should perhaps consider. But this is just a 1-year \nwaiving of Davis-Bacon specifically for the repair and maintenance of \nstructurally deficient and functionally obsolete bridges. If we do \nthis, I think the public will get a lot more for their tax dollars, we \nwill get this work done a lot quicker, and it makes a whole lot more \nsense than raising the Federal gas tax. That is kind of the way \nCongress does things--we have a problem, so let's just raise taxes and \nspend more money. In this case, we have about $4 for every $10 we spend \nthat doesn't go to what we say it does. If we can do a few things, like \nwaive Davis-Bacon, the money we take from the public can go a whole lot \nfurther.\n  I encourage Members to vote for this amendment this morning. I hope \nthe majority will not table it, because we have seen in Katrina and \nother tragedies that our money goes a lot further, the work gets done \nfaster, and our goals as a Congress are met a lot sooner.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chairwoman for the time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \ngiving me an opportunity to make a response to the Senator from South \nCarolina on this issue of prevailing wage that guides the wage for \nFederal construction.\n  This idea and concept goes back to the 1930s--1931. What is the \nprevailing wage? It is effectively the local average wage. Why was this \ndecided, that we are going to have the average wage? Because it was \ndecided then, with a Republican Congress, a Republican Congress and \nRepublican President, that we do not want the Federal Government \ninterfering with what is happening in local community wages. If they \nare going to be less in South Carolina than they are in Massachusetts, \nthey ought to use the local prevailing wage.\n  Is this complicated? No, it is not complicated at all. All you have \nto do is go look on the Web and find out what the prevailing wage is in \nSouth Carolina and what it is in Boston, MA. This was the basic \nconcept.\n  What has been the result of having the prevailing wage? The \nprevailing wage gives assurances to families. The Federal highway \nsystem was such an extraordinary national system developed and proposed \nby President Eisenhower. It has meant all the difference to the \nAmerican economy. What the Davis-Bacon program is saying is we are \ngoing to pay the average wage to workers under the Davis-Bacon program, \nbut those individuals who are going in those programs, by and large, \nalmost all of them, have gone through various apprenticeship programs \nand are skilled workers. That is why the University of Utah study of \nnine southwestern and mountain States has pointed out that the cost of \nusing Davis-Bacon was actually cheaper, less costly to the taxpayer \nthan it would have been if they had not had prevailing wages. An \nanalysis of Federal Highway Administration data in 2004 reached a \nsimilar conclusion--that states paying higher wages had lower highway \nconstruction costs and higher labor productivity.\n  We want to make sure that when we have our highways and bridges, they \nare going to be safe and they are going to be secure and they are going \nto be made by those individuals who have the skills to do the job and \ndo it right and do it well and do it for the protection of American \nfamilies, whether it is the workers who drive in to work or the \nchildren who come back in the various buses from schools all over the \ncommunity. That is what we are talking about--skilled work, competent \nwork, on-time work done by people who have training and follow a very \nimportant tradition. These people are out there working night and day; \nin the cold of the winter working out there at night, and in the day in \nthe heat of the summer.\n  What is the average wage we are talking about in this whole debate? \nThe median construction wage in this country is $35,000. Does that seem \nso outrageous, for someone who has a skill, $35,000? Are we going to \ntry to say with all of the challenges and problems we have in our \ntransportation system, this $35,000 is so much we want to try to reduce \nthose wages for working men and women in this country? Is this so \noutrageous, with the challenges we have seen, in terms of what people \nare being paid in the United States of America today? Of course not.\n  This is a very dangerous industry. More men and women are killed in \nconstruction than in any other industry. Do you hear me? More men and \nwomen are killed in construction than in any other industry. Three \ntimes more men and women are killed in construction than the national \naverage for other industries, and for some of those who are building \nbridges, it's even more dangerous. The fatality rate for structural \niron and steel workers is 13 times more than the average industry. \nThese are high-risk jobs and we are talking about paying people $35,000 \na year? In terms of the important issues we are facing, it makes no \nsense.\n  We want to make sure that when the Federal taxpayer dollar is \nexpended, it is going to get quality work, it is going to get \nproductivity, it is going to get results, it is going to have \naccountability. That is what Davis-Bacon has provided over the period \nof years.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. To show what the difference is in terms of prevailing \nwages for local workers, for ironworkers in Greene, AL, the prevailing \nwage is $13.67 per hour. An ironworker in Greene, AL makes $21,872 a \nyear. For ironworkers in Denver, CO, the prevailing wage is $22.50, \nannually $36,000. In Des Moines, ironworkers make $20.60 an hour; \n$32,960 per year. The average wage in El Paso is $12.03 an hour; they \nmake $19,248, $19,248 a year. Are we trying to say in Texas, in El \nPaso, we are going to try to undermine individual workers who are \nmaking $19,000? By and large most of them are skilled workers who have \nhad apprenticeship programs. Is this the greatest challenge we are \nfacing in our transportation system? No, it is not.\n  The list goes on. This chart here shows construction is one of the \nmost dangerous industries, with over 1,100 fatalities and over 410,000 \nwork-related injuries. This is a dangerous industry and that is why it \nis so important we have programs, apprenticeship programs to teach \nthese workers their skills but also teach them safety and security.\n  Regarding the injuries, prevailing wage laws lower construction \ninjuries by 10 to 20 percent. If you have prevailing wages, if they are \nput into place, the number of individuals who are going to be involved \nin injuries, death, and serious injuries is actually reduced. Why? \nBecause these workers have skills and have better training. More \ninjuries mean higher workers' compensation costs. Without the Federal \nprevailing wage, workers would suffer up to 76,000 additional injuries \nleading to 675,000 more lost workdays.\n\n  This hasn't been an issue that has been a partisan issue. When this \nwas passed in 1931, author James Davis was a Republican Senator and \nRobert Bacon, another author, was a Republican from the House of \nRepresentatives. It was a Republican House majority that passed it. The \nRepublican Senate passed the bill, and Republican President Herbert \nHoover signed the bill into law.\n  It is very simple. This is necessary because of the importance of \nhaving high-skilled work being done on the bridges and roads of this \ncountry. The American taxpayer's dollar is a scarce dollar. We ought to \nmake sure it is not\n\n[[Page S11464]]\n\ngoing to be used by fly-by-night operations. We want to make sure those \npeople who are going to receive it are going to have the skills and \ntraining to make sure the roads and bridges are going to be safe and \nsecure. That is what Davis-Bacon does. It takes into consideration what \nthe local wages are. Prevailing wages are published on the Internet. It \nis easy for any of the construction companies to understand it. They \nall understand it. We don't get complaints that they don't understand \nit. It is just in many instances they would rather get fly-by-night \noperations.\n  If you look at the various studies that have been done, time in and \ntime out, about prevailing wages, whether it is from the University of \nUtah--not a flaming liberal kind of university--looking at the western \nStates, when they had the prevailing wage versus not having the \nprevailing wage, they show that using the prevailing wage actually \nresulted in the savings of taxpayer resources.\n  I hope this amendment will not be accepted. We have a tried and true \nsystem. We are talking about people, as I mentioned earlier, whose \nmedian income is $35,000. It is not excessive. It is difficult to make \na good living today, $35,000 today, when you look at the cost of health \ncare, the cost of tuition, the cost of the gasoline, the cost of \nheating oil--if you live in our part of the country, $35,000 doesn't go \na long way.\n  It does seem we want to make sure American taxpayers are going to get \nwhat their hard-earned taxes have been collected for and make sure they \nare going to be expended for skilled work. Davis-Bacon gives that \nassurance to working families.\n  I see the Senator from Washington. I don't know how much time I have, \nbut I yield the remaining time to her.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. One minute remains.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his \ndiscussion of the current pending DeMint amendment. It seems to me it \nis our responsibility to make sure our people who are working on these \ncritically important infrastructure improvements are paid a prevailing \nwage and given the opportunity to care for their families as they care \nfor all of us.\n  Mr. President, at this point we yield back all of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. One minute remains.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I appreciate the debate. I think it is important to have. \nDavis-Bacon does not make sites safer. It does not have anything to do \nwith skilled workers. What it does is forces particularly small \ncompanies to revamp how they bid projects, to change how they pay their \npeople. The cost of that administration as well as waiting for the \nFederal Government--you can't just go to the Internet. The Federal \nGovernment is going to have to approve what the prevailing wage is. It \nhas been deemed not functional, what is taking place. What we are \ntalking about is not a suspension of Davis-Bacon forever, but a \nrecognition in the next years we want a lot more dollars to be applied \nto bridge maintenance, and by waiving Davis-Bacon for 1 year our \ndollars will go further and the work will be done quicker.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Members were notified last night the vote \nwould begin at 9:30. We have no additional debate at this time.\n  If the Senator from North Carolina has nothing to add, we are going \nto put in a quorum call until 9:30--unless he wishes to make any \nadditional comments?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I think I needed to ask for the yeas and \nnays, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

There will now be 2 minutes of \ndebate evenly divided before a vote en bloc on amendments 2812 to 2814 \noffered by Mr. Coburn of Oklahoma.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a block of three amendments. It is \nnot a great deal of money, but it certainly will send a message to the \nAmerican people about our priorities. We can build a new visitors \ncenter in Louisiana, where 7,000 people are still displaced from \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. We can add on to a baseball stadium which \nhas already run over, and the money is to compensate for the overrun--a \npriority versus building bridges--or we can markedly expand and remodel \na peace garden on our northern border. I would put forward to the body \nthat these are not priorities right now. They are not priorities, when \nour true deficit this year is going to be about $400 billion. We are \ngoing to charge to it our kids. We have the largest deficit and out-of-\ncompliance bridges in our history. Yet we are going to make a choice to \nspend money on these rather than higher priorities. The American people \ndon't have that luxury with their own budgets. We should not be taking \nthat luxury with their money either.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is another one of those amendments \nwhere the bureaucrats know best--don't ask, don't tell. These three \nprojects are in Louisiana, Montana, and North Dakota. The International\n\n[[Page S11465]]\n\nPeace Garden, built 75 years ago, is a national treasure between the \nUnited States and Canada. The buildings are in disrepair. The \nGovernment of Canada says: We are prepared to make some investments. \nThere is a $450,000 earmark, congressionally directed spending, to make \nan investment. The Canadians say they will make investments, but we \nwant the Americans to make investments as well. We would not want to \ninvest in this national treasure; is that what we have come to? This \nmakes no sense at all. My hope is that those who believe the \nbureaucrats will know best about spending will understand this \namendment is not worthy. These three projects have great merit. I \nbelieve the Congress will want to fund these projects with modest \nfunding. That is what we have done. I hope we will soundly reject the \namendments offered by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to table the amendments and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                       section 8 housing payments\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, over the last 3 months a majority of \nproject-based section 8 housing had payment disruptions with HUD not \nmaking timely payments under its contractual obligations to the owners \nof the housing facilities. As of the end of August, 50 facilities had \nnot received payments just in my State of Iowa. The payments not \nreceived cover 2,466 apartments. Twenty-two percent of those projects \nwere designated as ``family projects,'' and 78 percent are elderly or \ndisabled projects or a combination of the two. Some of those facilities \nwere still waiting for their June and July payments when the August \npayments failed to arrive.\n  As of yesterday, I understand that about 20 projects in Iowa which \nhave reached their contract expiration date at the end of June, July, \nor August still have not seen the routine work to renew the contracts, \nand payments have not been received in Iowa. I expect that Iowa is \ntypical of the Nation in this regard.\n  The failure to make timely payments not only results in added costs \nto owners, it creates a chill on future investments in low-income \nhousing. With that chill, I fear that the number of low-income housing \nunits available to families and the elderly in need will be reduced.\n  I urge that the committee work to provide for methods and \nrequirements as well as financial resources so HUD will provide proper \ntimely payments to all project-based section 8 projects in the coming \nfiscal year. I am particularly concerned with the situation that may \noccur if the Congress passes one or more short-term continuing \nresolutions for the beginning of the fiscal year. I would like to work \nwith Chairman Murray and Senator Bond to accomplish these goals.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I agree that we have seen serious \ndisruptions in payments to project-based section 8 facilities in recent \nmonths. That has caused real difficulties for many owners. I do believe \nthat HUD needs to have processes in place that will make funding to \nproject owners in as timely manner as possible. We also need to have \nfunding in place where HUD can make its payments. I appreciate the \nSenators' interest in this area, and we will work to avoid a repeat of \nwhat we have seen over the past 3 months.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I raised this issue on the Senate floor on \nMonday. I certainly believe this is a real difficulty, and I certainly \nbelieve HUD needs to meet its contractual obligations. I also agree \nthat we need to create provisions that will assure that HUD makes its \nhousing assistance payments on time.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, earlier today I voted on a motion to \ntable an amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma to remove three \nearmarks from the Transportation Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations bill. Those projects totaled $1.35 million and were for \neconomic development efforts in North Dakota, Montana, and Louisiana.\n  This was a difficult decision for me. I believe that the earmarking \nprocess in the past decade has ballooned out of control at a cost of \nbillions of dollars to taxpayers. I don't believe that all earmarks, \nper se, are bad, but that as a general policy, we need more \ntransparency in this process, and I believe that competitive and \nformula grants are a better way to assure that taxpayer dollars are \nspent appropriately.\n  However, I am uncomfortable with cherry-picking which earmarks are \nworthy and which ones are wasteful. There were dozens and dozens of \nearmarks totaling tens of millions of dollars in this bill. Why pick on \njust three?\n  I, however, did support an amendment to take money designated for all \nof the earmarked transportation projects in this bill and transfer it \nto fund national urgent priorities such as emergency bridge repairs.\n  This will be a long process to cut down, and even eliminate, many \ncongressional earmarks and other kinds of Government waste. Frankly, \nearmarks are just the easiest and most obvious target. Billions of \ndollars are spent every year by the Federal Government on no-bid \ncontracts, for example. And we are nowhere near preventing this \nwasteful pattern of spending.\n  But progress is being made on the earmark front. Congress passed a \ncomprehensive ethics bill that provides more transparency in the \nearmark process. Due to pressure from the American public demanding \nchange, we have seen fewer earmarks in this year's appropriations bill. \nAccording to the administration's Office of Management and Budget, this \nvery Transportation-HUD bill contains half the amount of earmarks \ncompared to its last version from 2006.\n  However, there is still much work to be done, and as a fiscal \nconservative and former auditor, I will continue my efforts to fight to \nchange the way the Federal Government does business with taxpayers' \ndollars--whether it is Congress or the administration.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about two important \nissues addressed in this bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I would like to thank Senators Murray\n\n[[Page S11466]]\n\nand Bond for their leadership on this bill. This bill will make America \nsafer and stronger by improving our transportation and housing \ninfrastructure.\n  First, I would like to discuss the need for FAA modernization. My \namendment would convey the sense of the Senate on the issue of FAA \nmodernization. For too long, the FAA has been derelict in its duty on \nthis important aspect of public safety.\n  Something is wrong when the thousands of everyday Americans with GPS \ndevices in their cars are working off what appear to be more modern \nnavigation systems than the FAA.\n  My amendment makes clear that this delay in implementing a modern air \ntraffic control system threatens both the safety of our air passengers \nand the economy by delaying thousands of business and recreational \npassengers each day.\n  This amendment makes clear that the FAA must act now and fully \nimplement the modernization system using the resources allocated in \nthis bill to keep our skies safe.\n  The committee took a significant step forward in this bill by \nproviding hundreds of millions of dollars for modernization. I thank \nthem for their commitment to this issue, and now it is time for the FAA \nto step up to the plate and do their share.\n  We should urge the FAA to move as quickly as possible in implementing \nthe modernization system to finally put an end to the endless delays \nand dangerous near misses on our Nation's runways and in our skies.\n  Next, I would like to discuss the subprime crisis in the Senate about \nthe need to assist the many families facing foreclosure as their \nsubprime loans reset to unaffordable levels.\n  I have been studying this issue for some time. The mortgage industry \nhas become the Wild West, and far too many homeowners have gotten \ncaught up in the teaser-rate promises of subprime mortgages only to be \ndevastated when they reset to higher, unaffordable levels.\n  I have concluded that one of the best tools we have in helping to \navoid this upcoming wave of foreclosures is the efforts of nonprofit \norganizations specializing in foreclosure avoidance and homeowner \ncounseling.\n  So I would like to thank Senators Murray and Bond for responding to \nmy request for additional resources by allocating $100 million for \nthose nonprofits to assist homeowners who are facing foreclosures. An \nestimated 2 million mortgages are scheduled to reset to higher interest \nrates in the next 12 months. This will mean a devastatingly high number \nof foreclosures, unless major action is taken.\n  But because there are so many distressed homeowners right now, the \nnonprofits are overwhelmed. Some have already received more calls for \nhelp this year than they did all of last year, and things are likely to \nget worse before they get better. The non-profits simply do not have \nthe resources to deal with this crisis. The home mortgage market is in \na state of emergency, and these nonprofits are our best-equipped first \nresponders. We ought to lend them a hand.\n  This investment will pay for itself many times over, through the \navoidance of foreclosures and the pain and suffering they cost this \ncountry, both in economic and noneconomic terms.\n  But government alone cannot solve this problem. It will require a \nmajor commitment by others as well, particularly those banks and \nmortgage servicers which have the ability, through loan modifications \nand refinancings, to help homeowners avoid foreclosures. These lenders \nand servicers made plenty of money while the housing markets were good, \nand I believe it is time for them to pitch in to help avoid the \nconsequences of their actions, which contributed to this current \ncrisis.\n  This is why I have asked the country's major mortgage lenders and \nmortgage servicers to increase their efforts to help subprime borrowers \navoid foreclosure. I have also asked them to also provide monetary \ncommitments to the nonprofits, which everyone acknowledges are key to \nsolving this problem.\n  For the millions of Americans at risk of losing their homes, these \nnonprofits can provide shelter from the foreclosure storm.\n  This is a bipartisan solution to a bipartisan problem.\n  I am encouraged that my colleague, Senator Bond, agrees that we need \nmore resources devoted to this problem. I agree that $100 million more \ndollars is a good thing. I am concerned, however, that the conditions \nput on this money may restrict its most beneficial uses. I want to be \nsure that all the funds we dedicate are used to help keep every family \npossible in their homes, and I look forward to continuing to work with \nthe committee to ensure that the funds in this amendment can do just \nthat.\n  This subprime crisis is a danger to the housing market and the market \nas a whole, and efforts and resources at all levels of government and \nin the private sector should be devoted to alleviating this ongoing \nproblem.\n  Finally, I would like to applaud my friend and colleague, Senator \nMurray, whose leadership and determination were instrumental in getting \n$1 billion of additional funding for bridge replacement and \nrehabilitation.\n  This amendment addresses what we have known for far too long--we have \nbeen neglecting our infrastructure for far too long.\n  The disaster in Minnesota was a wake-up call to get our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure in order. For far too long, highways and \nbridges in New York and across the country have been allowed to degrade \nto the point of dangerous disrepair.\n  As I have said before after similar disasters, we must learn from \nthem and fix the problems that caused them. We can no longer afford to \nneglect our aging highways and bridges in older cities.\n  This amendment goes a long way in learning from this disaster and \nfixing serious problems in our Nation's infrastructure. I commend \nSenator Murray for her leadership.\n  I was proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment and look forward to \nworking with Senator Murray on further projects in the future.\n  I look forward to working with the committee on my amendments and to \nfinishing this bill which represents, for the first time in a long \ntime, the resources our country needs to support its infrastructure, \ntransportation and housing positions.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, this Transportation/HUD \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2008 crafted under the leadership \nof Chairman Patty Murray makes key investments in our Nation's highway \nsystems, aviation system, passenger rail, and provides housing services \nfor those in need, the elderly and our veterans.\n  This legislation allocates over $100 billion for the Department of \nTransportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, and for \nHousing and Urban Development. According to the U.S. Department of \nTransportation, for every $1 billion that is spent on transportation, \n47,500 jobs are created. In this legislation over $40 billion is \ninvested in our Nation's highway system for construction of new roads, \nrepairs and improvements. This legislation will create tens of \nthousands of new jobs, improve safety to our highways and bridges--and \nwill go a long ways to strengthen and grow our Nation's economy.\n  I am proud that my Senate colleagues voted to include $1 billion in \nFederal funding to aid in the repair and maintenance of America's \nbridges, which would include an additional $100 million for New York \nState's aging bridges. The bridge collapse in Minnesota is a sober \nreminder of the tragic results that can occur when our infrastructure \nneeds are not met. New York State has more than 17,000 highway bridges, \nwith 12 percent classified as structurally deficient, and 26 percent \nclassified as functionally obsolete and this additional funding is \nvital to my State of New York.\n  Several Republicans sought to pass an amendment that would have \nrepealed Davis-Bacon protections for construction workers involved in \nbridge reconstruction on structurally deficient bridges--an act that \nputs both our workers and our Nation at risk. I was disappointed by \nthis attempt to undermine our workers' safety, and heartened that the \nbill does not contain this amendment. The tragic collapse of a major \nhighway bridge in Minneapolis this year illustrates just\n\n[[Page S11467]]\n\nhow critical it is for our roads and bridges to be constructed with the \nsafest and highest quality workmanship.\n  Year after year the administration has attempted to bankrupt Amtrak. \nAnd again, I am proud that the Senate has rejected the President's \nproposal that would have pushed Amtrak into bankruptcy. Amtrak plays a \nvital role in our Nation's transportation system, especially for New \nYorkers and those along the Northeast corridor. In an era of record gas \nprices, congested highways, and record delays and congestion for the \nflying public, the role of Amtrak has become more important and it must \nreceive the necessary funding to continue services and improve railway \ninfrastructure.\n  This legislation also contains vital funding for the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, including much needed funding to pay for infrastructure \nneeds at airports throughout New York, as well as funding for new \ntechnology to reduce delays and congestion at our Nation's airports. \nThis summer, the flying public has seen record delays at our airports \nand it is imperative that we resolve this problem as soon as possible. \nI am proud that the Senate unanimously confirmed my bipartisan \namendment requiring the Department of Transportation to develop a plan \nhow the FAA will alleviate congestion and delays in the New York/New \nJersey/Philadelphia airspace by next summer.\n  In addition to the funding for Transportation, this legislation \nprovides desperately needed funds for more affordable housing and would \nprovide housing for our homeless veterans, the elderly, and those in \nneed. This legislation provides over $2 billion more than the \nPresident's request for programs under Housing and Urban Development. \nThe legislation rejects the Bush administration's cuts to housing for \nthe low-income elderly, as well as the administration's plan to \neliminate Hope VI, a program that revitalizes neighborhoods by \nreplacing outdated public housing in disrepair with new mixed-income \nhousing.\n  We still have work to do to improve our transportation systems. \nAirport delays in just a few years will cost our economy more than $30 \nbillion every year and nationwide, poor road conditions and traffic \ncongestion cost American drivers more than $110 billion each year in \nwasted fuel and lost time. There is a more than $1.6 trillion long-term \ninfrastructure gap to fill--as a nation--we need to invest in our \nfuture again. I urge the President to remove his veto threat and sign \nthis legislation into law as quickly as possible so that these needed \nfunds can be used to improve our Nation's aging infrastructure as \nquickly as possible.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the bill before us is a budget \nbuster. It is over $3 billion above the President's budget request and \ncontains numerous earmarked projects, worth over $2 billion. It should \nbe soundly rejected.\n  Funding for transportation infrastructure and transportation safety \nis of enormous importance and I know all of us support doing what we \ncan to improve our Nation's transportation system, from our roads and \nbridges to our air service. The tragic bridge collapse in Minnesota in \nAugust was a harsh reminder of just how critical our responsibilities \nare to balance competing transportation funding needs. But we simply \nmust do so in a fiscally responsible manner. The Senate's action Monday \nto increase the obligation limitation for the highway trust fund by $1 \nbillion is not the answer nor was it responsible. It might have been \npolitically expedient, but it is not the answer.\n  We cannot afford to simply spend more and more of taxpayers' hard-\nearned dollars without consequences. It is time for Congress to start \nmaking choices among competing priorities, just as American families do \neach month with their family budgets. In this bill, we are not \nunderfunding transportation; we are misdirecting infrastructure funding \nto earmarked projects that are questionable and certainly not urgently \nneeded.\n  According to the Reason Foundation's 16th Annual Highway Performance \nReport, 24 percent of our Nation's bridges were deficient or obsolete \nin 2005. Minnesota actually ranked 5th best in the Nation, yet we \nwatched with horror as one of the State's major thoroughfares crumbled \nfrom disrepair. The Wall Street Journal reported on August 22, 2007, \nthat a week before the bridge collapse, a Congressman from Minnesota \ninserted over $10 million in earmarks for rail transit, bike trails and \nthe ``Kids Peace Mesabi Academy,'' but not a penny for bridge or \ninfrastructure repair.\n  In addition to our aging bridges, our Interstate Highway System is \nover 50 years old and not equipped to handle today's traffic levels. So \nwhat has Congress done in response to this reality? We have increased \nearmarking of our highway program funding by a staggering level: The \n1982 highway bill included 10 demonstration projects totaling $386 \nmillion; the 1987 highway bill included 152 demonstration projects \ntotaling $1.4 billion; the 1991 highway bill included 538 location-\nspecific projects totaling $6.1 billion; the 1998 highway bill included \n1,850 earmarked projects totaling $9.3 billion; and the 2005 highway \nbill included over 5,634 earmarked projects totaling $21.6 billion.\n  So instead of allowing states the ability to allocate their highway \ndollars to their most pressing needs, like deficient bridges, we are \nfunding a significantly higher level of bike paths and highway \nbeautification projects and sidewalk improvements. When will we learn? \nWhen will we learn that this is not what the American people want or \ndeserve from their elected representatives. How many more \ninfrastructure tragedies will occur before we change our earmarking \nways?\n  Instead of raising the gas taxes, as some Members of Congress have \nsuggested, for the millions of Americans who are already paying more \nfor gas than ever before, the Federal and State governments must \nprioritize transportation spending to focus on projects with the most \nneed rather than building ``bridges to nowhere.'' If Congress fails to \nrecover from its addiction to earmarks, then crumbling bridges, \ncongested highways, and crowded airports will continue much to the \ndeterment of all Americans.\n  Congress recently passed an ethics reform bill that requires the \ndisclosure of the authorship of earmarks. Ninety-one Members of this \nbody requested transportation earmarks in this appropriations bill. For \nexample, this bill contains $4 million for a bridge in Arkansas that \ndoes not appear in the Arkansas State transportation improvement plan, \nthereby questioning its necessity. The bill also includes almost $2 \nmillion for a study on the effects of dust suppressant chemicals on \nFederal highways, $2 million above the administration's request for \nvolcano monitoring in Alaska, and $2 million to prevent the frequent U \nturns at the gates of the Los Alamos labs in New Mexico.\n  Of course, the bill includes a wide range of transportation earmarks. \nThe bill also contains $8 million for airport improvements to Cape Cod \nand Nantucket, $2.5 million for improvements at the Niagara Falls \nInternational Airport, and $1.5 million for improvements at the airport \nin Palm Springs, CA. No doubt these popular tourist destinations could \nhave helped to pay for these improvements themselves rather then \nrequiring all taxpayers to subsidize such marvelous destinations that \nmany taxpayers may never be able to afford to visit.\n  The bill also provides $3.5 million to construct an airport in \nAkutan, AK--population 767--when an alternative airport is less than 55 \nmiles away and $1 million for airport improvements at Lewis University, \nIL, for its 1,000 students. There are also earmarks for ferry service, \nsuch as $1 million for Nassau County, NY, which is the sixth richest \ncounty in the Nation. Again, taxpayers nationwide must support and \nsustain these projects despite their use by a few.\n  The underlying bill provides funding for the Department of \nTransportation's 1-year pilot program that would allow a maximum of 100 \nMexican trucks to enter and travel to a single destination in the \nUnited States this year. This pilot program is the result of planning \nand preparation over the past 14 years. NAFTA, passed by Congress in \n1993 and signed into law by President Clinton in 1994, mandated the \nopening of our southern border to Mexican trucking operations. Congress \nset forth stringent preconditions for opening the border in section 350 \nof the fiscal year 2002 transportation appropriations bill, and DOT \ncomplied with all 22 of those requirements. The Inspector General has\n\n[[Page S11468]]\n\nreported five times that the Department has substantially met those \nsafety requirements. It is now time to allow these two countries to \nmove forward with this 1-year pilot program that will have numerous \neconomic benefits for the two nations. Unfortunately, the Senate has \nvoted 74 to 24 to prevent the pilot from going forward. As such, we \ncontinue to fall short of abiding by the obligations we committed to \nwhen we approved NAFTA.\n  In addition to my concerns with the transportation title, this bill \nprovides more than $3 billion above the President's budget request for \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development. Like previous years, \nthe accompanying report contains an enormous number of earmarks in the \nEconomic Development Initiative and neighborhood initiative accounts to \nthe tune of more than 300 earmarks totaling nearly $300 million.\n  Again, I would like to express my disappointment that Senate \nleadership has brought to the floor a bill that is $3 billion over the \nadministration's request containing hundreds of earmarks. Rightly, the \nadministration has announced that the President will veto this bill \nunless its price tag is reduced. That is the correct action.\n  During my recent travels around the Nation, I hear again and again \nfrom citizens who are fed up with pork barrel spending and yet, \nCongress fails to listen. It is a shame, and I can only hope that the \nAmerican people will join me in expressing their displeasure with this \nbill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support passage of the \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2008. This bill provides critical funding for many of our \nNation's essential programs, including housing for low-income families, \ncommunity and economic development programs, and transportation needs.\n  Affordable housing is becoming less, not more, available in the \nUnited States. Research shows that the number of families facing severe \nhousing cost burdens grew by almost 2 million households between 2001 \nand 2004. Additionally, one in three families spends more than 30 \npercent of its earnings on housing costs. The National Alliance to End \nHomelessness reports that at least 500,000 Americans are homeless every \nday and 2 million to 3 million Americans are homeless for various \nlengths of time each year. Cities, towns, and rural communities across \nthe country are confronting a lack of affordable housing for their \ncitizens. This is not an issue that confronts just one region of the \nNation or one group of Americans. Decent and affordable housing is \nessential to the well-being of Americans, and the Federal Government \nmust provide adequate assistance to our citizens to ensure that all \nAmericans can afford to live in safe and affordable housing.\n  This legislation provides critical funding for the section 8 voucher \nprogram. The section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, originally \ncreated in 1974, is now the largest Federal housing program in terms of \nHUD's budget with approximately 2 million vouchers currently \nauthorized. Yet the current number of vouchers does not come close to \nmeeting the demand that exists in communities around our country. I am \npleased this Senate bill contains funding for new vouchers for homeless \nveterans and disabled families. This funding for new vouchers is a step \nin the right direction, but Congress needs to do much more to fund the \nsection 8 program in the coming months and years to help ensure that \nfunding levels for the program meet the demonstrated need for the \nprogram.\n  I am pleased that this bill rejected many of the suggested cuts in \nthe President's budget request. This bill provides $100 million for the \nHope VI program, a program dedicated to rehabilitating our Nation's \npublic housing. Many public housing authorities throughout the country, \nincluding in Milwaukee, have done great work with Hope VI dollars, and \nI am pleased the Senate rejected the President's cut to this important \nprogram.\n  This legislation also provides increased funding for the Home \nInvestment Partnerships Program, HOME, a program created in 1990 to \nassist States and local communities in producing affordable housing for \nlow-income families. HOME is a grant program that allows participating \njurisdictions the flexibility to use funds for new production, \npreservation, and rehabilitation of existing housing stock. Increased \nfunding for HOME will help local communities, including those in \nWisconsin, work to increase the availability of affordable housing \nstock in our country.\n  I was pleased the Senate included my amendment calling on HUD to \nreport on its funding needs for the section 8 project-based rental \nassistance program. In the past few months, many housing providers \nparticipating in the project-based program have not received their \nhousing assistance payments from HUD as scheduled. Both HUD and OMB \nneed to closely examine their budgeting process for the project-based \nprogram to try to ensure these late payments do not occur in the \nfuture. I have heard from housing providers who are worried about how \nthey will afford their mortgage payments and utility bills without \ntimely payments from HUD. My amendment calls on HUD to provide Congress \nwith an accurate accounting of the costs to completely fund all \nproject-based contracts. I hope HUD will provide detailed information \nto Congress so we can address the shortfall this program is facing and \nhelp ensure that housing providers receive their payments from HUD.\n  I was pleased to support the investment in our vital transportation \ninfrastructure in this legislation. After the tragic collapse of the I-\n35W bridge in Minnesota, I also supported providing the specific funds \nto rebuild this roadway and dedicating additional funds through the \nMurray amendment for the acute problem of structurally deficient \nbridges throughout the Nation.\n  While this funding directed toward deficient bridges was an \nappropriate short-term investment, I would have concerns if it became a \nlong-term policy. This concern is because shifting Federal funds toward \nthe roads and bridges that have been the least well maintained can be a \ndisincentive for States to make proper investments of their own and \ncould result in a shift of funding from States, like Wisconsin, that \nhave voluntarily made higher investments in their transportation \ninfrastructure and have fewer deficient structures to States that have \nnot made a similar level of investment. Wisconsin's rate of return on \nthe Federal fund to address deficient bridges is only 42 cents on a \ndollar paid in from Wisconsin taxpayers. I have fought for years to \nsecure a fair rate of return for Wisconsinites from the highway trust \nfund after decades of us being a donor State and would oppose a long-\nterm policy of shifting funds from States that have kept up with their \nroad and bridge maintenance to those that have not.\n  I supported the Dorgan/Specter amendment to prevent the \nimplementation of the administration's new pilot program for Mexican \ntrucks because the program raises serious safety and environmental \nconcerns and could depress U.S. wages for truckers. This program is \njust another symptom of failed trade policies like NAFTA. Our trade \npolicies should allow us to establish and enforce our own public \nsafety, health, and environmental safeguards, which benefit American \nbusinesses, workers, and consumers, instead of helping to ship millions \nof jobs overseas.\n  I am disappointed the President has issued a veto threat on this \nappropriations bill. This legislation provides necessary funding for a \nnumber of important Federal programs to improve the quality of life in \nour Nation's communities, including infrastructure and housing needs. \nMany American families are depending on the program funding included in \nthis bill. I hope the President will reconsider and remove his veto \nthreat on this important legislation.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the fiscal year \n2008 Transportation-HUD appropriations bill, which was passed by the \nSenate earlier today.\n  I would like to begin by thanking Chairwoman Murray and Ranking \nMember Bond. Crafting legislation that seeks to meet the transportation \nand housing needs of our Nation is no easy feat, and I commend the hard \nwork of the chairwoman, the ranking member, my colleagues on the \nsubcommittee, and their staffs.\n\n[[Page S11469]]\n\n  The legislation passed by the Senate provides nearly $105 billion for \nthe upcoming fiscal year. Almost $66 billion is allocated to the \nDepartment of Transportation and nearly $39 billion is allocated to the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development.\n  I would like to speak on some of the transit and housing provisions \nin this legislation that fall under the Banking Committee's \njurisdiction.\n  I note that although this bill provides an increase in transit \nfunding over fiscal year 2007, it does not fund transit at the level \nauthorized in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation \nEquity Act: A Legacy for Users, SAFETEA-LU, the surface transportation \nauthorization bill which Congress passed just 2 years ago. Safe and \nefficient transit systems provide significant benefits both to transit \nriders and to others in the community, including employers, property \nowners, and automobile drivers. In fact, the Texas Transportation \nInstitute has estimated that transit saves Americans over $18 billion a \nyear by reducing the amount of time we spend in traffic. Moreover, in \nthis era of high gasoline prices, public transportation provides an \nadditional benefit: according to economists Robert Shapiro and Kevin \nHassett, public transportation saves more than 855 million gallons of \ngasoline a year, helping to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. \nTransit ridership is at its highest level in 40 years, and strong \nsupport for transit is essential in light of this increasing demand. I \nhope that this shortfall will be addressed by the conference committee.\n  I would like to thank Senators Murray and Bond, as well as my ranking \nmember on the Banking Committee, Senator Shelby, for working with me to \ninclude an amendment related to the Federal Transit Administration's \nproposed rule implementing the New Starts program. Through the New \nStarts program, the Federal Government helps to fund major transit \ninvestments in communities around the country. The proposed rule fails \nto follow SAFETEA-LU in several material respects, and at the same \ntime, introduces new concepts that were not authorized in SAFETEA-LU. \nThis amendment makes clear that the FTA's failure to follow the law is \nunacceptable.\n  I am pleased that this bill provides additional funding, above the \nPresident's request, for many critical housing and community \ndevelopment programs. Unfortunately, the administration continues to \nrequest insufficient funds for these programs, and, in fact, each year \nhas asked Congress to cut programs that assist our Nation's most \nvulnerable--children, seniors, and those with disabilities. Each year, \nwe attempt to restore these cuts, and this year is no exception. \nChairwoman Murray, and Ranking Member Bond, strong supporters of these \nprograms, have, once again, successfully restored most of the cuts, \nhelping to ensure that low-income families will have safe, decent and \naffordable housing in strong communities.\n  The housing programs funded in this bill assist millions of families \naround our country. Without housing assistance, many families would \nlack the stability to find and retain employment, and many children \nwould be unable to adequately perform in school because of multiple \nmoves or health problems resulting from inadequate housing, including \nasthma, poor nutrition and lead poisoning.\n  The wages of working families have not kept pace with housing costs. \nOn average, a family in our country must earn $16.31 per hour at a \nfull-time job in order to afford a modest 2-bedroom apartment without \nforegoing other basic needs. This amount is three times the minimum \nwage. In my home State of Connecticut, the wage needed to afford a \nmodest 2-bedroom apartment is almost 4 times the minimum wage. This \nsignificant gap between the wages of low-income earners and housing \ncosts makes evident that housing assistance is necessary for many \nworking Americans.\n  This bill restores funding to the public housing program, which \nhouses over 1.2 million of our Nation's lowest-income families. The \npublic housing program has been targeted by this administration for \ndeep cuts each year, and has lost hundreds of millions of dollars over \nthe last 7 years. This year, the administration sought cuts to public \nhousing funding of almost $500 million. The bill before us restores \nthese cuts, increasing funding for the Public Housing Capital Fund by \n$61 million, the Operating Fund by $336 million, and restoring funding \nfor the successful Hope VI program. Even these levels of funding are \nlower than what is realistically needed by public housing agencies to \noperate all of their units, but we are pleased to see these increases.\n  The bill we passed also increases funding for the Section 8 housing \nvoucher program to ensure that all families currently in the program \ncan retain housing. In addition, the bill provides funding for vouchers \nfor veterans to make sure that American veterans have access to stable \nand affordable housing. It is a national disgrace that veterans, who \nhave defended our country, are unable to access housing assistance in \ntheir times of need, and I strongly support the efforts of Senators \nMurray and Bond to address this critical failure.\n  The Section 8 housing voucher program assists over 2 million families \nin affording rents in the private housing market. While the \nappropriators have done an exceptional job at protecting this program \nfrom budget cuts, a combination of legislative language and \nadministrative changes have altered the funding formula in the Section \n8 program numerous times over the last several years, leaving housing \nagencies without assurance that all of their units will be funded. I \napplaud Senators Murray and Bond for including language in this bill \nretaining the Section 8 formula that was put in place last year--a \nformula that allocates funding in a reasonable way, and provides \nfunding stability for housing agencies and the families they serve. I \nurge the chairwoman and ranking member to retain this formula \nthroughout the whole appropriations process.\n\n  This bill also ensures that programs to house seniors, people with \ndisabilities and people living with HIV/AIDS are fully funded. The \nPresident, astonishingly, requested a cut of $160 million to the senior \nhousing program, and a cut of $112 million to the housing program for \npeople with disabilities. I want to thank Chairwoman Murray and Ranking \nMember Bond for restoring these significant and shortsighted cuts.\n  The bill we passed also seeks to increase funding for CDBG and the \nHOME program, two flexible sources of funds that communities use to \nhouse families across the income spectrum, provide rental assistance, \nrehabilitate housing and public facilities, provide and sustain \nhomeownership opportunities, and restore and strengthen communities. In \nthis bill, CDBG funding has been increased by $288 million over last \nyear's funding level, and HOME has been increased by over $200 million, \nincluding an additional $100 million for housing counseling, \nspecifically for counseling to prevent foreclosures, an increase I \nsought and strongly support.\n  This $100 million is critical to helping build the counseling \ninfrastructure that can help tens of thousands of American families \nthreatened with default and foreclosure save their homes, preserve \ntheir home equity, and maintain their dignity. As many of my colleagues \nknow, the subprime mortgage market has been rife with abusive and \npredatory lending practices that have led to millions of Americans \nbeing trapped in adjustable rate mortgages, ARMs, with mortgage \npayments that will soon explode to unaffordable levels. During hearings \nthat I chaired in the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \nCommittee, senior executives from some of the largest subprime lenders \nacknowledged that they knew, when their companies funded these loans, \nthat many of these borrowers could not afford these payments after the \ninterest rates reset and payments increased. Yet, they made the loans \nand collected the fees. In most cases, the lenders sold these loans off \nto the secondary market. Today, these homeowners, and their \ncommunities, are paying a steep price in lost equity and falling home \nprices.\n  In fact, the Center for Responsible Lending, CRL, released a report \nlate last year predicting that 2.2 million families would lose their \nhomes at a cost of $164 billion in hard-earned home equity. When this \nreport was released, we heard howls of protest from many analysts and \nindustry officials; yet, as the weeks and months go by, and each\n\n[[Page S11470]]\n\nnew round of foreclosure statistics are released, the CRL number looks \nmore and more accurate.\n  The additional $100 million in counseling funds will help \norganizations with the experience and expertise to work with lenders \nand servicers to reach out to borrowers early--prior to loan resets, if \npossible--to try to modify loans to make them affordable for the long-\nterm. This effort is crucial--one industry study indicates that over 6 \nmillion subprime borrowers, with over $1.5 trillion in home loans, will \nface mortgage loan resets in 2007 and beyond. Given the fact that we \nare already experiencing historically high foreclosure rates, we need \nto take decisive action to keep hard-working Americans in their homes.\n  While this bill helps to ensure that low- and moderate-income \nfamilies can afford decent and safe housing, I am concerned with the \nlevel of funding provided for Section 8 project-based assistance. This \nbill provides the level of funding requested by the administration; \nhowever, HUD recently alerted us that this is well below what is needed \nto pay for all project-based assistance contracts. Without adequate \nfunding, property owners in the program will not be able to continue \nproviding affordable housing to low-income families. I have called on \nthe administration to immediately provide Congress with an estimate of \nthe amount of funds needed to fully fund these contracts for housing \nassistance, and yet we have not received this vital information. If \nthere is a shortfall in this program, we will have to address this \nproblem.\n  In closing, I would like mention a few additional initiatives funded \nunder this bill. I am pleased that Amtrak has received almost $1.4 \nbillion in this legislation--funding that will ensure the continuation \nof passenger rail service in this country. I am also pleased that \nSenators Murray and Bond agreed to an amendment I cosponsored with \nSenator Clinton regarding the redesigning of airspace over greater New \nYork. Over the past several months, I have voiced concern over the way \nthe Federal Aviation Administration has proposed redesigning airspace \nin the Northeast. While I am supportive of the idea to reduce the air \ntraffic congestion that currently plagues our country, I believe the \nFAA has an obligation to submit redesign proposals that are transparent \nand allow for full and informed public comment. The amendment adopted \nin this legislation takes a step forward in that direction. Finally, I \nam pleased that this bill contains vital resources for many important \ntransportation and economic revitalization initiatives in my home \nstate. It is my hope this funding is retained as the Senate proceeds to \na conference with the other Chamber.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Senate Transportation, \nHousing and Urban Development, and related agencies appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2008. This bill provides $105.6 billion in fiscal year \n2008 for the Department of Transportation, the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development, and a number of independent agencies. This \nlegislation will improve road and bridge safety and address past \nshortfalls in spending on our Nation's infrastructure and housing and \neconomic development needs.\n  This bill provides $41.2 billion to the Federal-aid Highways Program \nfor disbursement to States and local governments to build, maintain, \nand repair highways, roads and bridges; $1.074 billion of which would \ngo to Michigan.\n  I supported an amendment which will provide increased funding for \nbridge replacement and rehabilitation. As a result of this amendment, \nMichigan would get an additional $23,539,287 for bridge replacement, \nbridge rehabilitation, preventative maintenance, seismic retrofitting, \nbridge inspections, and activities designed to protect bridges and \nextend their life spans.\n  Mr. President, 78,000 bridges around the country have been identified \nas structurally deficient. Given the high number of bridges that are in \nneed of urgent repair, which was made all the more apparent by the \nrecent and tragic bridge collapse in Minneapolis, it is appropriate for \nthe Senate to direct more funding to address the urgency of this \nproblem.\n  The bill also provides $9.59 billion to operate America's public \ntransit systems around the country.\n  Public housing needs have been significantly underfunded over the \npast few years. I am pleased that this bill increased funding for the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, to $38.74 billion.\n  This bill increases funding to $4.2 billion for the public housing \noperating fund and to $2.5 billion for the public housing capital fund \nwhich will help provide assistance to low-income, disabled, senior \ncitizens, and families throughout the country. This bill also provides \n$735 million for the HUD section 202 program and $237 million for the \nHUD section 811 program. These programs provide grants to nonprofits \nand community organizations for the development of rental assistance \nand supportive housing for very low-income seniors and people with \ndisabilities.\n  This bill would also provide $52 million for fair housing activities \nthrough the Fair Housing Initiatives Program and the Fair Housing \nAssistance Program. Over 4 million fair housing violations occur each \nyear in the United States, and these programs play a vital role in \naddressing housing discrimination in our country.\n  Since fiscal year 2001, funding for the Community Development Block \nGrants, CDBG, has been reduced by 15 percent, and the President's \nbudget request for fiscal year 2008 would have reduced funding for this \nimportant program by another 20 percent. I am pleased that this bill \nincludes $4.1 billion for CDBG, which provides State and local \ngovernments with block grants to fund local community development \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has done its work in funding the important \ntransportation systems that keep our vehicles and people moving safely \nand efficiently and our economy humming as well as funding the housing \nand economic development programs on which so many of our citizens \nrely. This is despite the President's threat to veto this bill. I hope \nthe President will have a change of heart and support our effort to \ninvest in America's future.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are moving rapidly toward final \npassage on this critically important infrastructure bill. I thank all \nof our Senators for working with us in a very constricted timetable to \nget this very important bill to this point today. I especially thank \nSenator Bond, his staff, and my staff. I will thank them more after \npassage of the bill. But I particularly thank Senator Bond for his work \non his side of the aisle for putting together this very important bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference on the disagreeing votes, and that the \nChair be authorized to appoint conferees.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I congratulate and thank Senator Murray for \nbeing such an agile partner and such an effective leader. We finished \nthe bill in almost record time. For a bill of this complexity, I might \neven claim it is record time.\n  The legislation is very complex. You have seen that it is \ncontroversial and can even be very political, as we saw with the \nMexican trucking issue.\n  As always, Senator Murray deserves a great deal of credit and \naccolades for her ability to balance the many tough and controversial \nissues that make up the legislation, and to do so with a smile and good \nhumor despite circumstances that would have brought out a more \ndifficult response from a lesser person.\n  We also thank her crack staff, including Peter Rogoff, Bill Simpson, \nRachel Milberg, Meaghan McCarthy, and Teri Curtin. I also thank my \nstaff for a great job: Jon Kamarck, Ellen Beares, and Matt McCardle. \nEach of them brought special contributions, as well as hard work, to \nthe bill, spending many late nights and weekends to make sure the HUD \nfiscal year 2008 appropriations bill would reflect a balanced and \nbipartisan approach to the legislation that could be supported by \nMembers on both sides of the aisle. We thank the overwhelming majority \nwho voted for it. A special thanks goes to our Republican and \nDemocratic floor staff for bringing their special expertise and making \nus all look the part of respectable, hard-charging legislators and \nuntangling the knots that sometimes occur in the process.\n  As I did on Monday, I want to brag about our ability to include \nfunding increases above the budget request for HUD's housing and \ncommunity development programs. These are important programs to help \nbuild our communities and without which a number of persons--a \nsignificant number of persons--would be placed at risk of homelessness. \nThat would have been a particular hardship on many seniors and persons \nwith disabilities.\n  I also want to repeat my gratitude that we were able to include $75 \nmillion in section 8 funds for the VA Affairs Supportive Housing \nProgram. It is critical as service people continue to return from Iraq \nand face new realities\n\n[[Page S11490]]\n\nthat can include the need for housing and other services. This program \nwill become even more worthwhile as young, disabled service men and \nwomen make the difficult adjustment to civilian life.\n  As Members know, after 2 full days on this bill, with regard to FAA, \nthis bill continues to support the beginning stage of the NextGen Air \nTransportation System. This bill also contains funds above the \nadministration's request for flight inspection and certification \npersonnel.\n  These funds are needed and will ensure the continued safety of the \nNational Airspace System. I also want to note the additional funds for \nthe Airport Improvement Program, which has been and remains an \nimportant bipartisan priority for this subcommittee.\n  In addition, the bill meets the guarantees of SAFETEA for highways \nand, and for the most part, transit. We include the revenue aligned \nbudget authority, RABA, which was not included in the President's \nbudget. In addition, we have included some $1 billion in obligation \nlimitation as a starter account for the inspection of our aging bridges \nafter those tragic deaths in Minnesota when the bridge collapsed.\n  Finally, as I noted previously, there are some issues that we will \nhave to address before the bill can become law. For example, we include \nthe revenue aligned budget authority which was not included in the \nPresident's budget. The bill also contains a $2.89 billion rescission \nof highway contract authority apportionments to the states, used as a \nbudgetary offset. The bill also includes an additional $43,359,000 in \nAdmin CA and another $172,243,000 in an unused transportation \ninnovative financing infrastructure account, TIFIA, contract authority \nfor a total offset of spending of $3.495 billion. HUD also includes a \nrescission of $1.1 billion.\n  Finally, I continue to be concerned over HUD's and OMB's failure to \nprovide adequate funding for HUD's section 8 project-based housing \nprogram for fiscal year 2008. This is not an option but is a \ncontractual obligation. Most important, this is a critical and \nimportant program that serves many of our most vulnerable citizens such \nas extremely low-income families, including seniors and persons with \ndisabilities. HUD has been unable to fund fully or timely many of these \ncontracts during fiscal year 2007, and I understand that this problem \nwill only get worse in fiscal year 2008 with HUD facing a shortfall in \nits section 8 project-based account of $2 billion or more. I know this \nprogram enjoys wide support in this Congress and I would fully expect \nOMB to provide the necessary funds for the program through a budget \namendment or as part of a continuing resolution or through emergency \nsupplemental legislation.\n  And while I am pleased with much of the bill, especially needed \nspending in critical programs, I am concerned that we are on a \ncollision course with the White House on the spending levels contained \nin this bill. I fear that both sides are going to have to make \nadjustments. I just hope that any adjustments do not result in the loss \nof any of the positive investments made we have made in this bill.\n  I will conclude by again thanking my colleague, Senator Murray, her \nstaff, my staff, and the floor staff. Thanks for the help of everybody.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate insists on its amendment, requests a conference with the House, \nand the Chair appoints the following conferees.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore appointed Mrs. Murray, Mr. Byrd, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Bond, Mr. \nShelby, Mr. Specter, Mr. Bennett, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \nStevens, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allard, and Mr. Cochran \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Missouri, \nSenator Bond, who has worked hard with me, the staff, and all of us who \nhave been working to get this bill to the floor and pass it. It is an \nextremely difficult bill, covering a wide variety of programs and \nprojects throughout the country. We started this process way back in \nthe beginning of the year with the budget process. He and I spent many \nconversations on the phone working together, getting our bill through \nsubcommittee, full committee, and now to the Senate floor.\n  I could not have done it without Senator Bond's help and support, \nparticularly in the housing arena, helping to work through a lot of \ndifficult issues. I thank him in particular for his diligence and his \nability to help us get through this today.\n  Also, I thank his staff: Jon Kamarck, Ellen Beares, and Matt \nMcCardle. They have been there time and again to help us work through \nthe issues. I thank my staff: Peter Rogoff, Rachel Milberg, Bill \nSimpson, Meaghan McCarthy, and Terri Curtin. They spent innumerable \nall-night sessions trying to get us to reach deadlines and get the bill \nto the Senate floor. Without their expertise, we would not be here. I \nthank them on behalf of all of us in this country. I thank, from my \npersonal staff, Travis Lumpkin, who has been here working with us to \nget this bill through, as well as Mike Spahn, of my floor staff, who \nspent a lot of time helping us work through all the difficult parts of \nthe bill. It takes a lot of people to get a bill of this complexity to \nthe floor, and every one of them should be recognized.\n  We cannot do these bills on our own. A lot of people put a lot of \ntime and energy into getting us to this point. I thank Senators Byrd \nand Cochran, the chairman and ranking member of the full committee, who \nhave worked with all of us on appropriations to get our work done in a \ntimely fashion.\n  This bill is headed to conference. It is an extremely important bill. \nAs we have heard throughout the last days as we have debated the bill, \nevery American is touched by the impact of this legislation. If you get \nup and go to work, whether you drive or, as we heard yesterday, ride a \nbike; whether you go on an Amtrak train or if you have to fly, what we \ndecide in this bill and how we set spending priorities makes a \ndifference in your life.\n  For many Americans who are facing a housing crisis today, this bill \naddresses those concerns, as the Senator from Missouri talked about. \nThis is an extremely important piece of legislation. We received the \nPresident's budget with severe cuts in Amtrak, in housing, in FAA \nmodernization, and many more that I have talked about over the last \nseveral days. This Senate has said we have to invest in the \ninfrastructure of this country. We need to move forward in making sure \nthat average, everyday Americans who get up and go to work, enjoy time \nwith their families, who want to be able to participate in our \ncommunities, have a right to do that, and we have an obligation as a \nCongress to make sure the infrastructure is in place.\n  We are going to continue to work on this bill with our colleagues on \nthe other side of the Capitol, our House counterparts. I hope we can \nget a bill to the President and get it signed and move these programs \nforward so the money we have debated and talked about will be allocated \nand our communities across this country will benefit from it.\n  Mr. President, I again thank my colleague from Missouri.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments about H.R. \n3074, the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations \nAct of 2007, which we passed earlier today by an overwhelming \nbipartisan majority. This bill will make much-needed investments in \naging roads and bridges around the country. It will help make the skies \nsafer for travel. It will revitalize struggling communities with \neconomic development grants. And it will get a roof over the heads of \nmany of the 200,000 veterans who find themselves homeless on any given \nnight.\n  I want to thank Chairman Murray, Ranking Member Bond, Chairman Byrd, \nRanking Member Cochran, and all the members of the committee for their \nwork on a bill that makes such wise investments in our transportation, \nin our communities, and in our veterans.\n  This summer, as Americans took to the highways with their families, \ntraveling long stretches of bumpy roads across aging bridges on their \nway to their vacation destination, they were\n\n[[Page S11491]]\n\npainfully aware of our Government's neglect of our transportation \ninfrastructure over the last several years.\n  Potholes and traffic jams can take a toll on your car and your \npocketbook. A 2006 survey showed that driving on rough roads is costing \nthe average urban motorist about $383 a year in added vehicle \nmaintenance costs. With gas inching back toward $3 a gallon, that is an \nadded strain on a family's budget.\n  Beyond this economic strain, though, failing and deteriorating \ninfrastructure can lead to tragic consequences. Roadway conditions are \na significant factor in approximately one-third of traffic fatalities.\n  The August 1 collapse of I-35W in Minneapolis was among the most \ntragic examples of this danger. Thirteen people died, and around 100 \nwere injured, when the eight-lane truss bridge collapsed into the \nMississippi River.\n  The Minneapolis disaster has engineers and planners around the \ncountry taking a second look at the condition of their bridges. And \nwhat they are finding is troubling.\n  In Colorado, nearly 7 percent of our bridges are structurally \ndeficient and need immediate attention. 110 bridges that belong to the \nState need full replacement. Another 375 need rehabilitation. \nUnfortunately, the backlog of bridgework that needs to be done in our \nState is an overwhelming $758 million. In Colorado and across the \ncountry, we desperately need more resources to get this work done. I \nbelieve the Senate made a wise investment when it voted overwhelmingly \nin support of Senator Murray's amendment to add $1 billion in dedicated \nfunding for the Federal Highway Administration's bridge replacement and \nrehabilitation program.\n  We also must recommit ourselves to investing in our roads and \nhighways. They are the veins of commerce that sustain our economy. Our \nability to move goods and people quickly and safely is absolutely \nfundamental to continued growth.\n  The American people, and the people of Colorado, understand this. \nWhen I visit a town like Gunnison, maintenance and improvements to \nHighway 50, which links Pueblo and the Front Range with Gunnison and \nthe Western Slope, is at the top of the list for local elected \nofficials. When I visit Eagle County, Clear Creek County, and Summit \nCounty, I-70 investments are front and center. And when I meet with \nofficials in Lamar, Springfield, and Eads, maintenance of Highway 287, \npart of the ``Ports to Plains'' corridor, is the topic of conversation.\n  For each of these communities, good roads are essential for economic \nvitality. Across the political spectrum, across a broad range of \ninterests and professions, Coloradans understand this. Two years ago, \nwe voted to allow the state government to retain an additional $5.7 \nbillion in revenues over 5 years to help fund our schools and our \nroads. The statewide referendum passed comfortably because the Colorado \nbusiness community knows that failing infrastructure is a drag on an \neconomy. Smart investments in bridges, roads, and airports yield strong \nreturns over the long term.\n  The bill we passed earlier today makes these needed investments in \nour Nation's transportation infrastructure. It allocates $65.7 billion \nto transportation, including $40.2 billion for highway construction.\n  This will allow for us to move ahead with several vital projects in \nColorado.\n  Notably, the bill includes $5 million for continued construction of a \nnew interchange near Gate 20 at Fort Carson. The Mountain Post is \naccommodating two additional brigades and is growing by approximately \n12,000 troops over the next 2 years. Gate 20 allows soldiers and \ncontractors to enter the base from Fountain, Pueblo, and points south \nof the base. The base commander, General Mixon, sees this as a top \npriority and we help him fulfill it with this bill.\n  Additionally, the bill provides $2 million for work on the Ports to \nPlains Highway, U.S. 287, near Lamar. This builds on the over $11 \nmillion we have invested in his project over the past 3 years to build \nthe capacity of this major north-south commercial artery. I have driven \nthat road many times over the past few years, and it is improving \nsteadily. You see more trucks on that road now, and you see more goods \nmoving to market more quickly.\n  In southern Colorado, we have included funding to restore a road \nleading to one of our newest national parks, Great Sand Dunes, in my \nnative San Luis Valley. 300,000 visitors a year come to Great Sand \nDunes. It is a boon to the local economy, and the $3 million for \nresurfacing State Highway 150 to the Sand Dunes will help more \nAmericans see this treasure of the American West.\n  But the transportation portion of this bill does not simply fund new \nroads. It also includes forward-thinking investments in mass transit \nsolutions to reduce the wear and tear on our highways, to save gas, and \nto unclog traffic jams. This bill includes $70 million for the Denver \nRegional Transportation District's West Corridor Light Rail Project and \n$70 million for RTD's Southeast Corridor Multi-Modal Project. \nColoradans know it as T-Rex. It blends light rail and highway \nimprovements in one of the largest mass transit projects that is \nunderway in the United States. It is changing how people commute and \nwhere they are choosing to live. This bill keeps Denver's \ntransportation revolution on track.\n  Finally, I would also like to express my strong support for the \nfunding this legislation makes available for the community development \nblock grant program. I have heard from public officials across \nColorado, and they all tell me that the CDBG program is one of the most \neffective Federal Government programs available to cities, towns, and \nrural communities in our State, and across the Nation.\n  Last year, Colorado alone received nearly $40 million from the CDBG \nprogram, with several towns and cities receiving in excess of $1.5 \nmillion apiece. While the President's budget would have cut this \nfunding by 20 percent, the underlying legislation restores those cuts \nand provides $3.77 billion for the program. We should not be slashing \nfunding for one of our most effective and efficient tools for \nenergizing communities and improving housing infrastructure. This bill \ndoes the right thing and restores this program.\n  I am proud of the bill that we passed--it sets the right priorities \nand makes smart investments in our transportation infrastructure and in \nour communities. I want to again thank Chairman Murray, Ranking Member \nBond, the Appropriations Committee, and their staffs for their work on \nthis bill. I hope it is signed into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11491-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11491-S11492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I wish to speak for a short period of \ntime on another issue that I have been working on.\n  Yesterday, the Journal of the American Medical Association published \na study on the diabetes drug Avandia. This study concluded Avandia \nsignificantly increases the risk of heart attacks, a subject that \nSenator Baucus and I have been investigating for some months. You will \nremember that it was back in May that a study in the New England \nJournal of Medicine first alerted the public of an increased risk of \nheart attacks from Avandia.\n  When that study was published, Senator Baucus, chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, and I raised concerns that the drugmaker had sought \nto silence a critic who voiced apprehension about Avandia back in 1999. \nRemember, this is 8 years ago. At the time, SmithKline Beecham \nmanufactured Avandia. The company later merged with Glaxo Wellcome to \nform today's GlaxoSmithKline.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, GlaxoSmithKline said the \nallegations that the company silenced critics of Avandia were \n``absolutely false.''\n  Today I would like to discuss some internal company communications \nthat suggest otherwise. The person who first blew the whistle about \ncardiovascular problems with Avandia was Dr. John Buse. He was a \nprofessor at the University of North Carolina.\n  Shortly after Avandia came on the market, back in 1999, Dr. Buse \nbegan warning his colleagues at medical meetings that the drug might be \ndangerous.\n  How did this company respond when this professor brought up these \nissues? In an e-mail dated June 25, 1999, two company executives \ndiscussed ways to silence Dr. Buse. I would like to read parts of the \ne-mail. One executive wrote of a plan to ``write him a firm letter that \nwould warn him about doing this again . . . with the punishment being \nthat we will complain up his academic line and to the CME granting \nbodies that accredit his activities.''\n  CME stands for continuing medical education. I will come back to that \nin just a second.\n  In response, another company executive e-mailed back, proposing to \nsue Dr. Buse and launched a media offensive promoting Avandia.\n  Based on this e-mail exchange, it seems to me that at least two drug \ncompany officials did attempt to silence a critic. In fact, Dr. Buse \nstopped making any critical statements about Avandia shortly after this \ne-mail exchange. Scientists should be able to raise issues related to \npublic health and safety in a free and uncensored manner, not the way \nthey do things in China. And when these scientists are suppressed, we \nought to consider that a very serious problem. The reason why is \nbecause the scientific process will take care of itself. If scientist \nGrassley has a suggestion and you think it is crazy, you are a \nscientist, my work can be reviewed by you and it has to stand the test \nof peer review. So I think it is a very good process, and if we just \nlet it go on, it will show whether this scientist or that scientist is \nright or wrong.\n  The scientific process, if suppressed, I say, is a very serious \nproblem. But more important in this whole process, the American public \nloses. Instead of Avandia being more critically examined for safety, it \nwas heavily marketed and became what experts have called the best \nselling diabetes drug in America. It has been reported to me that this \nhuge volume of sales may have resulted in 60,000 to 100,000 heart \nattacks from 1999 until the year 2006--that is about 20 a day--from the \nusers of Avandia.\n  What happened to the company executives who sought to attack Dr. Buse \nfor voicing his scientific opinion? Based on the information I have \nreceived to date, nothing has happened to these corporate executives.\n  Let me return to the issue of continuing medical education. In the e-\nmail exchange I quoted, the two company officials discussed complaining \nabout Dr. Buse to the accrediting bodies of continuing medical \neducation. Every year, medical professionals must get continuing \nmedical education credits to stay current in their profession. The \ncontinuing medical education companies and the doctors who teach the \nclasses are supposed to be independent of drug companies that fund the \ncourses. But I think we now know what we have often suspected: \nContinuing medical education courses often are not independent at all. \nIn fact, the drug companies have a lot to say about what goes on in \nthese courses and who gets paid to teach them.\n  In April, the Finance Committee staff released a report on \npharmaceutical company support of continuing medical education. Drug \ncompanies pour about $1 billion every year into continuing medical \neducation, and the report noted that some educational courses have \nbecome veiled forms of advertising.\n  Of course, this also ties in to last week's introduction of the bill \nI submitted called the Physicians Payments Sunshine Act. I introduced \nthat bill with Senator Kohl, who is chairman of the Aging Committee, \nbecause Americans have a right to know how the drug companies are using \nmoney to try to shape the medical field. The bill requires drug and \ndevice companies to report payments and other gifts they give to \ndoctors, bringing a little transparency to the practice of companies \nsuch as GlaxoSmithKline. I hope to see more of my colleagues sign on to \nthis legislation. I cannot spotlight every instance where a drug \ncompany goes after an independent scientist with a stick, as they did \nwith Dr. Buse, but together we can splash some sunlight on the \nfinancial carrots drug companies use to try to shape doctors' behavior.\n  Before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent to have the e-mails \nI referred to printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     From: Tachi Yamada\n     To: William D Claypool\n     CC: David M Stout, Jean-Pierre Garnier\n     Subject: Re: Avandia Renegade\n     Date: 06/25/1999 19:15:33 (GMT-05:00)\n       Bill: I spoke to both JP and David Stout today about this \n     situation. I doubt that speaking to his chairman about him \n     will do much good--in fact if he's as bad as he seems to be, \n     his chairman probably already has doubts about him. In any \n     case, I plan to speak to Fred Sparling, his former chairman \n     (they are actively looking for his replacement) as soon as \n     possible. I think that there are two courses of action. One \n     is to sue him for knowingly defaming our product even after \n     we have set him straight as to the facts--the other is to \n     launch a well planned offensive on behalf of Avandia so that \n     the listeners begin to understand at the very least that \n     there are two sides to this story. I suspect that the latter \n     approach would be preferred--it wouldn't look good for SB to \n     be at war with a KOL.\n                                                            Tachi.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n     William D Claypool on 25-Jun-1999 12:23\n     CLINICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n     To: Tachi Yamada\n     Subject: Avandia Renegade\n       Tachi: At Avandia Day today, mention was made of John Buse \n     from UNC who apparently has repeatedly and intentionally \n     misrepresented Avandia data from the speaker' dais in various \n     fora, most recent among which was the ADA. The sentiment of \n     the SB group was to write him a firm letter that would warn \n     him about doing this again (he will be speaking next at a \n     major European congress in Stockholm in July) with the \n     punishment being that we will complain up his academic line \n     and to the CME granting bodies that accredit his activities. \n     There was brief mention of a law suit but this was reserved \n     for a later approach. The question comes up as to whether you \n     think this is a sensible strategy, whether you know any of \n     the principals at UNC (I don't), and whether we have other \n     avenues to ensure his accuracy in the future (we don't really \n     do too much work at UNC to make any threats)? I imagine that \n     Paul Wadkins is too new in post for us to ask him to exert \n     any influence on our behalf at his new institution.\n       Any thoughts?\n           Thanks.\n                                                             Bill.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Their aim is to convince us to \nspend more time, more money, and more lives in Iraq. Yet we have heard \nprecious little about the impact of this surge on the men and women who \nare actually on the battlefield fighting.\n  That is a disturbing omission that leaves me--and I am sure thousands \nof military families across the country--deeply unsettled and greatly \nconcerned for the future of our Nation's plan to take care of these \nheroes.\n  We all know going to war has a profound effect on our men and women \nin uniform, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are no exception. As \nthe Iraq war now enters its fifth year, it is clear the fighting \noverseas has taken a tremendous toll on the lives of our troops, who \nhave served this Nation so honorably, and on their families, who have \nsupported them so fully. Yet, over and over again, in their sales job, \nthis administration has either failed to make the cost of caring for \nour wounded warriors a priority or--as we found this week--blatantly \nmisled Congress and the American people about that cost.\n  Unfortunately, on Monday, just 2 days ago--the same day General \nPetraeus appeared in the House to talk about the results of the surge--\nwe learned from the VA inspector general that the Department of the VA \nrepeatedly--repeatedly--understated the wait times of our injured \nveterans seeking care.\n  How can we be expected to trust this administration about the \ncontinuation of a surge when they continue to cover up the costs of \nthis war?\n  Administration officials, including Secretary Nicholson himself, have \nrepeatedly told Congress and the American people that 96 percent of all \nveterans seeking primary care and 95 percent of veterans seeking \nspecialty care were seen within 30 days of their desired appointment \ndate.\n  Well, this week, the inspector general found that in reality only 75 \npercent of veterans have waited less than 30 days. In fiscal year 2006, \nthe VA underestimated the number of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who \nwould be seen by 45,000 people. For the current year--fiscal year \n2007--the VA has now been forced to revise its projection up by 100,000 \npeople. Now the VA is projecting it will see 263,000 Iraq and \nAfghanistan vets in 2008. Yet, I am told by some that the VA should \nactually be preparing to see more than 300,000 returning veterans.\n  Frankly, I think it is very important that we do not underestimate \nthis number. We have seen the past failures in the VA to accurately \nproject the numbers, and I think it is very important this \nadministration get those numbers right.\n  The VA's fiscal year 2008 budget also assumed a decrease in the \nnumber of inpatient mental health patients, when all signs everywhere \nwe heard and turned to pointed to an increase in need.\n  In February of this year, I had the opportunity to ask VA Secretary \nNicholson, how the President's escalation of the war would impact our \ncare for veterans. He told me it would have a ``minimal'' impact. Now, \nnot only does that statement fly in the face of reason, it boggles my \nmind.\n  I told Secretary Nicholson, when he told me that:\n\n       When the President has proposed a surge in troops to Iraq, \n     when the men and women in uniform are being deployed for \n     their second and third tours of duty, and when more and more \n     of our troops are coming home with [post-traumatic stress \n     disorder] and other mental health care needs, I don't \n     understand how the VA can assume that they will treat fewer \n     patients for inpatient mental health care.\n\n  The VA Secretary's duty is to protect our veterans, not a dishonest \nadministration. If the VA had been frank with us about waiting times \nand backlogs from the beginning, we in Congress would have been able to \ninvest in our facilities and in allocating our resources properly.\n  If we were getting accurate information, and not being served a \npolitical line, we could do our job and serve the veterans. \nUnfortunately, based on our experience with VA leadership over the past \nseveral years, I have serious doubts about the level of frankness we \ncan expect from a VA that has tried to minimize the cost, both in money \nand in lives, of this war.\n  This spring, as our military was surging in Iraq, we learned that the \nVA officials--the officials--had received bonuses, while our veterans \nfaced waiting lines and backlogs for benefits. To me, that is plain \nwrong. Senior career officials throughout the VA were getting a \ngenerous package of more than $3.8 million in payments by that \nfinancially strapped agency, at the same time as our veterans waited up \nto a year--up to a year--to see a doctor, and at the same time VA \nofficials were misleading Congress and the American people.\n\n  This week's IG report found:\n\n     . . . .that schedulers at some facilities were interpreting \n     the guidance from their managers to reduce waiting times as \n     instructions to never put patients on the electronic waiting \n     list.\n\n  Well, that obviously results in ``gaming'' of the procedure. So a \nveteran calls in, asks for an appointment, and instead of putting them \nin line, they are told to call back in a month or two, before they get \non the waiting list. That is the wrong way to treat our veterans.\n  I have to ask, were officials receiving bonuses for cooking their \nbooks on wait times? Well, in light of this week's report, it seems to \nme to be a fair question.\n  The inspector general's report on the VA's failure to provide an \naccurate account of how long our veterans are waiting for care is a \nfrustrating reminder of that agency's need for honesty and leadership. \nWhether the VA's numbers were intentionally skewed or incompetently \nreported, the result is the same: Our veterans pay the price.\n  Now, I have long said the VA provides excellent care to our \nveterans--once they get in the door. The VA has a long-term focus on \npatients, it has a great integrated delivery model, and it has a first-\nrate health IT system that provides distinct advantages over our \nprivate sector care. We have to keep it that way.\n  But too often, for our veterans, getting in the door is the problem. \nEvery one of us has heard at home from veterans who have waited months \nto see a primary care doctor. Some of those veterans have had to wait \nyears to get surgery. For too many years, under this administration, \nveterans have been last in line, and we in Congress have had to fight \nthis administration tooth and nail to meet their needs.\n  It is clear that 5 years into this war--5 years into this war--the VA \nis still not on a wartime footing to deal with this problem. It is far \npast time for the VA to put an end to the pattern of dishonesty that \nhas plagued them. From exaggerated reports of success, to failures to \npresent their real funding needs, to poor conditions at our facilities, \nthe VA is not coming clean with the American people. And every time the \nVA tries to save political face, do you know who it ends up costing? \nOur men and women who have served us honorably overseas, our veterans.\n  No matter how anyone in this country feels about the war, Americans \nsupport our veterans. Everywhere I go, people stand up and say to me \nthat they do not support the war, but they will be there with their \npocketbooks and their hearts to make sure our veterans are taken care \nof when they get home.\n  In order for us to do that--and everyone here wants to do that--we \nneed to have an honest assessment from this administration about what \nthe costs are or we cannot provide the support that Americans want us \nto provide.\n  The President of the United States has a responsibility now to send \nus a nominee to fill the soon-to-be-vacant position at the VA. We need \na new nominee, a new Secretary, who is going to be an honest advocate. \nWe need a new VA Secretary who is going to fill the needs of our \ncurrent veterans and future veterans and who will honor their sacrifice \nwith superior service.\n  I am looking forward to the President finding and sending to us \nsomeone who will fill that position that we can finally trust, who will \nbring about a culture of change, who will bring us accurate \ninformation, who we do not have to second guess, and, most importantly, \nwho will be willing to stand up\n\n[[Page S11494]]\n\nand be honest with the American people about the cost of war when it \ncomes to the men and women who are fighting for every one of us.\n  If we are just being told a happy picture all the time, and not \ngetting the reality of what is out there, we in Congress cannot do our \njob to make sure our veterans get what they need. The men and women who \nhave served in the military have borne significant burdens. They have \nassumed great risk for our country, and they have sacrificed their \nlives and their limbs to protect all of us and our freedoms. They have \ndone their job. They have done what this country has asked. They have \ndone it honorably. It is time this administration helps us keep a \npromise to them to fulfill their needs. Our Nation has a moral \nobligation to care for those who have served this country in uniform, \nand that begins by an honest assessment of the cost.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I share some of the feelings of the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington about our veterans. There is no \nquestion about it, we need to do more for them, and we will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11494-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11494-S11496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TESTIMONY OF GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we live in a cynical age where the truth is \noften discarded because it does not meet the goals of an election \ncampaign strategy or it is not what the core constituencies of certain \npolitical movements wish to hear.\n  One does not need to look any further to prove this point than the \nmedia's portrayal of General Petraeus's testimony before Congress this \nweek.\n  Lost in the coverage were the hard facts and the veracity of the \npersonal assessments of a remarkable leader. He has spent years in \nIraq, first, as the commander of the 101st Airborne Division during the \ninitial race to Baghdad and then as the officer in charge of training \nthe Iraqi Army. This was followed by his authorship of the ``Army-\nMarine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual'' that was used as the basis for \nour current strategy, and now in his role as the commander of Multi-\nNational Forces--Iraq.\n\n  This man deserves the plaudits and credit from all of us. Think about \nit. How many of us would spend years away from our wives, our families. \nThe sacrifices of our men and women over there is remarkable. This man \nis one of the most remarkable.\n  So let us lay aside the rhetoric and learn the truth outlined by this \nseasoned commander.\n  Here are General Petraeus's own words:\n\n       As a bottom line up front, the military objectives of the \n     surge are, in large measure, being met. In recent months, in \n     the face of tough enemies and the brutal summer heat of Iraq, \n     Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces have achieved progress in \n     the security arena. Though improvements have been uneven \n     across Iraq, the overall number of security incidents in Iraq \n     has declined in eight of the past 12 weeks, with the number \n     of incidents in the last two weeks at the lowest levels seen \n     since June 2006. One reason for the decline in incidents is \n     that Coalition and Iraqi forces have dealt significant blows \n     to al-Qaida-Iraq.\n\n  The general goes on to point out:\n\n       Coalition and Iraqi operations have helped reduce ethno-\n     sectarian violence, as well, bringing down the number of \n     ethno-sectarian deaths substantially in Baghdad and across \n     Iraq since the height of the sectarian violence last \n     December. The number of overall civilian deaths has also \n     declined during this period, although the numbers in each of \n     the areas are still at troubling levels. Iraqi Security \n     Forces have also continued to grow and to shoulder more of \n     the load, albeit slowly and amid continuing concerns about \n     the sectarian tendencies of some elements in their ranks. In \n     general, however, Iraqi elements have been standing and \n     fighting and sustaining tough losses, and they have taken the \n     lead in operations in many areas.\n\n  These are the words of a trusted and very capable commander who was \nunanimously confirmed by the Senate. They are insightful, and they show \nthat at long last, we are beginning to make significant progress in \nIraq.\n  I believe Churchill could have been talking about our current \nprospects in Iraq when he said:\n  This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it \nis, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\n  Yet even before General Petraeus gave us his professional military \nopinion on the status of the war, some attempted to undermine the \nveracity of his analysis and, worse, the character of the General \nhimself.\n  Of course, I am speaking of the disgraceful actions of MoveOn.org and \ntheir now infamous advertisement. Before even having the opportunity to \nhear General Petraeus's analysis, this group stated that General \nPetraeus is a ``military man constantly at war with the facts.'' It \nclaimed he was ``cooking the books.'' It asserted that his action is a \nbetrayal of the American people.\n  This is shameful.\n  There is no need to read between the lines.\n  There is no subtext here.\n  The text is clear.\n  MoveOn.org has called General Petraeus a liar.\n  That is disgusting. It is beneath the dignity of decent and honorable \npeople.\n  According to this group, General Petraeus is injuring his country and \nendangering those under his command by lying about the progress in \nIraq.\n  Now, anyone who has had the opportunity to meet the General and \nanybody who has bothered to follow his career or his academic pursuits \nknows these are disgraceful and unwarranted allegations. However, there \nmight be a silver lining to this libel. Now, all of America understands \nwhy MoveOn.org and other groups like it are called the nutroots. These \npeople are nuts. They don't care who they hurt. They don't care whom \nthey smear. They don't care whom they libel. To them, politics is more \nimportant than anything else, and the accumulation of power is most \nimportant of all. Perhaps if they rejoined the reality-based policy \ncommunity, they would have actually waited to hear the General's \nanalysis before criticizing it.\n  Here is the reality.\n  General Petraeus is a consummate professional. He is a man who has \ndedicated his life to our country.\n  And I would note that when you put on a uniform, dedicating your life \nto your country has the potential to mean a good deal more than running \nfor Congress.\n  But to Moveon.org, which has sadly become a core participant in the \nDemocratic party's policymaking, General Petraeus is a disgrace to the \nuniform.\n  Let me be clear. It is MoveOn.org that is the disgrace. And I think \nit is important that the entire Congress publicly repudiate these \nabsurd charges. I hope those in this body who are fond of listening to \nand following MoveOn.org's misguided policies see this group for what \nit is--an American embarrassment.\n  I have been very interested in watching the debates both on the \nRepublican side and on the Democratic side. I have been impressed with \nthe candidates for President. There is no question. They are decent and \nhonorable people. But they ought to decry this. They should start by \ndemanding that people within their party start acting responsibly. The \nsame applies to Republicans. If we have people who are doing \ndisgraceful, offensive things such as MoveOn.org, we ought to rise out \nof our seats and condemn them. I believe good people in both parties \nwill do that. But thus far, there has been a silence on these issues, \nespecially when it comes to General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker.\n\n  What was particularly galling about the inaccuracies of MoveOn.org's \ncomments is that many Members of Congress have been to Iraq in the \nprevious few months and have seen with their own eyes the progress that \nis being made. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to \nshare with my colleagues some of the experiences I had during a trip I \nmade to Iraq a few months ago with Senator Smith and one of the great \nCongresswomen in the House, Congresswoman Harman.\n  As part of my preparation for this trip, I read with great interest \nthe articles written by Michael Fumento and published in the Weekly \nStandard about the time he was embedded with U.S. forces in Ramadi.\n  Mr. Fumento wrote as recently as eight months ago that our forces in \nRamadi, described the time between when they went out on patrol and \nwhen they were attacked as the 45-minute rule. Under this rule, our \nforces hypothesized that it took the enemy 15 minutes to determine \nwhere an American patrol was and then 30 minutes to\n\n[[Page S11495]]\n\norganize an attack. Unfortunately, those attacks occurred with great \nfrequency and severity.\n  However, during my recent trip to Ramadi, I walked--admittedly in \nbody armor and with a reasonably sized military escort--in one of its \nmajor markets in the heart of the city downtown. There, I saw what \nwould be unimaginable a few months ago: shopkeepers selling their \ngoods, children playing, and urban life beginning to reemerge.\n  How did this happen? First, the local tribal leaders made a decision \nthat they would no longer tolerate the yoke of tyranny that had been \nplaced upon them by al-Qaida--and make no mistake, al-Qaida is whom we \nare fighting in Ramadi. These leaders saw firsthand their fellow Sunni \nMuslims murdered and tortured under al-Qaida's false exploitation of a \nnoble and peaceable religion. Not surprisingly, these sheiks began \nassisting coalition forces and, most importantly, their own Iraqi \nsecurity forces in rooting out the terrorists. For example, once the \nlocal leaders decided to support the Coalition, 1,000 citizens of \nRamadi joined the Iraqi security forces almost over night.\n  The success I witnessed was attained due to the implementation of the \nnew tactics articulated in General Petraeus's innovative \ncounterinsurgency strategy. Under this plan, large areas of Ramadi were \nencircled and then, led by Iraqi security forces, a thorough search was \nconducted in each area. Once these searches were completed and al-Qaida \nrooted out, the progress was made permanent by placing Joint Security \nStations throughout the newly cleared territory.\n  These Joint Security Stations are one of the major reasons we have \nseen such advancement in Ramadi and other locations in Iraq. Joint \nSecurity Stations are manned by Iraqi Army and police forces as well as \nAmerican forces who live in these installations in order to provide a \npermanent security presence for cleared neighborhoods.\n  Joint Security Stations accomplish three vital goals. First, much \nlike the local police officer in any city, the U.S. forces become \nintimately involved in the security of the enjoining population. \nSecond, our soldiers also learn about the environment in which they are \nliving and, therefore, can more readily adapt their operations to \nbetter achieve the goal of providing security for the local population. \nThird, our forces help to train and support the Iraqi units assigned to \nthe Joint Security Stations. Ensuring the Iraqi forces have sufficient \ncapabilities to independently provide security to their own population \nis, of course, one of the primary goals of General Petraeus's strategy.\n  The implementation of the Joint Security Stations is radically \ndifferent from previous tactics. In the past, U.S. forces would clear \nan area and then return to bases on the periphery of town and then move \non to their next assignment. The predictable result was that shortly \nafter the U.S. operation concluded, the insurgents would return to the \narea.\n  No longer.\n  Joint Security Stations provide continuous security to the local \npopulation. That is why the additional troops that were sent to Iraq as \npart of the surge are so important. It is not more for more's sake but \nto have sufficient forces to implement effective counterinsurgency \nstrategies such as the Joint Security Stations.\n  Fortunately, the success we are seeing in Al Anbar is being \nreplicated in other locations throughout Iraq. In Baghdad, I was \nbriefed by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker as to the situation \nin that city. Here, too, I found that through the implementation of new \nstrategies and tactics such as the Joint Security Stations, progress \nhas been made.\n  One of the early criticisms of the new strategy was the contention \nthat, even if you secure Baghdad, the terrorists will move to the \nprovinces such as Diyala in the north. In fact, the then-leader of al-\nQaida, Abu Zarqawi, was killed in Diyala in 2006. However, just as in \nRamadi, the Iraqi local leaders decided they did not want to live under \nthe tyranny of al-Qaida, and they joined with us in the effort to throw \nthe terrorists out of the major Diyala city of Baqubah.\n  However, what also made a lasting impression was the way in which \nGeneral Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker worked together. There are no \nbureaucratic fiefdoms here. Far from it. In fact, as one watched the \nGeneral and Ambassador finish one another's sentences, one was struck \nas to not only how integrated our new strategy is, but how each leader \nwas searching to incorporate the other's department's strengths in \norder to achieve the well-defined goal of defeating the insurgency and \ncreating an Iraq that could independently secure its own future.\n  Now, does this mean victory in Iraq is imminent? Hardly.\n  If one looks to history, counterinsurgency operations are successful \nonly after a significant period of time. We have only recently \ndeveloped and implemented our new strategy.\n  So what are the other possible strategies?\n  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle recently supported \nthe Levin-Reed amendment to the Defense Authorization bill that would \nstart the reduction of our forces in 120 days. Their legislation would \nonly permit the forces to remain in Iraq that are necessary to protect \nU.S. and Coalition personnel and infrastructure; train, equip, and \nprovide logistics support to the Iraqi security forces; and engage in \ntargeted counterterrorism operations against al-Qaida, affiliated \ngroups, and other terrorist organizations.\n  Let's consider that strategy for a moment. Would that not mean that \nU.S. forces would be confined to large operating bases in order to \nprotect Coalition infrastructure and support Iraqi forces--only \nventuring out to conduct raids against terrorists?\n  Does this strategy sound familiar? It certainly does to me.\n  The Levin-Reed plan reminds me of the failed Rumsfeld plan. Remember, \nunder Rumsfeld's plan our forces were concentrated in large bases on \nthe periphery of urban areas, only venturing into town to conduct raids \nand, as my colleague from Delaware often reminded us, conducting \npatrols where our forces would only speed through areas.\n  That was a failed policy, not because it was not well implemented; it \njust did not work.\n  Yet my colleagues on the other side are determined to repeat it. But \nthis time we would proceed with even fewer troops, which we all know, \nand many of my Democratic friends continue to point out, was one of the \nreasons our initial strategy failed in the first place.\n  Then there is the cost in human lives if the Democrats plan is \nimplemented.\n  As General Petraeus's testimony articulated, elements of the Iraqi \nsecurity forces are making progress, but they continue to require \nstrong support from Coalition forces. That training and support are, in \npart, being provided by the Joint Security Stations.\n  But, if we are to leave precipitously, how many innocent people will \nbe killed? Remember, it is al-Qaida that is a major instigator of the \nsectarian violence in Iraq. According to their adherents, their goal is \nsimple: Join us, live by our strict rules, or be slaughtered.\n  I understand the American people are discouraged by this war--but how \nwill history judge us if we permit the wholesale slaughter of innocent \ncivilians?\n  If these arguments do not sway you, then let me ask a question about \nour own self-interest.\n  What happens if Iraq becomes a failed state? Does anyone really \nbelieve al-Qaida would not use Iraq as a base of operations to conduct \nterrorist attacks against our homeland?\n  Does anyone really believe that al-Qaida would not exploit the \npetroleum wealth of Iraq to further their objectives? Remember, in \nAfghanistan--a country of few natural resources--there were reports \nafter the fall of Kabul that al-Qaida was working on chemical and \nbiological weapons.\n  I wonder what al-Qaida would buy with the billions of dollars it \nwould accumulate if it controlled even a fraction of Iraq's oil wealth.\n  Mr. President, we as Americans are known for asking ``what is the \nbottom line?''\n  Here it is:\n  We have made enormous mistakes in prosecuting the war in Iraq. So \nwhat do we do? Do we concede defeat, which is really what the Levin-\nReed amendment offers? Do we hope for the best, that al-Qaida will \nleave us in peace. Or do we follow the only sensible strategy that\n\n[[Page S11496]]\n\nis beginning to show some signs of success?\n  I believe we all know the sensible answer to that question.\n  We must not yield.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez).

Mr. President, since its inception, the Internet has \nprovided a powerful economic boost to our Nation, especially in rural \nareas. It has become an important everyday tool for millions of \nAmericans, a valuable educational resource, and a powerful mechanism \nfor communication.\n  To ensure the Internet's benefits are available to as many people as \npossible, Congress should reduce obstacles to broadband access. One way \nto accomplish this goal is to prevent taxes from being imposed on \nInternet access, because such taxes will only drive up the overall cost \nof the use of the Internet.\n  The Internet Tax Freedom Act, first passed by Congress in 1998, \nestablished a moratorium on State and local governments' ability to tax \nInternet access. Extended in 2004, that moratorium will expire on \nNovember 1--less than 2 months from today. Legislation has been \nintroduced in both the House and Senate to extend the Internet tax \nmoratorium. I have been supportive of such legislation and expressed \nsupport when the Senate Commerce Committee explored the issue at a \nhearing on May 23 of this year.\n  Our chairman, Senator Inouye, has been very supportive of the concept \nof keeping taxes off the Internet.\n  Tremendous investment, growth, and innovation in broadband deployment \nhas occurred since the moratorium was first adopted. In order for this \nprogress to continue, Congress should extend the Internet tax \nmoratorium before it expires this fall.\n  If it is not extended by November 1, more states could take the \nopportunity to quickly pass laws and impose new taxes on the Internet. \nSuch taxes would only serve to expand the digital divide between those \nwho can afford broadband access and those who cannot.\n  The Internet has allowed States such as Alaska to compete on a more \nlevel playing field. Alaskans are now able to market their goods to \ncustomers in the lower 48 and around the world, which is especially \nbeneficial for small businesses located in remote areas. Improved \nbroadband access has also eliminated distance barriers for education \nand medicine, providing rural areas with a higher quality of life.\n  Faster, cheaper Internet access also helps drive America's economic \nengine and creates new jobs. Continued broadband deployment will help \nensure America keeps this competitive edge. Without it, our Nation will \nfall behind in the global economy. If discriminatory taxes are imposed \non Internet access, our country will face a real danger, and the rest \nof the world will no longer look to the United States for Internet \ninnovations.\n  The date the Internet tax moratorium is set to expire--November 1--is \nfast approaching. It is my hope Congress will act to extend this \nimportant moratorium before that deadline arrives.\n  While the expiration of the Internet tax moratorium is the most \npressing broadband issue before Congress right now, several more issues \nshould also be addressed to encourage greater broadband deployment and \navailability in this country. First and foremost, universal service \nshould be updated so that rural America has the same broadband \nopportunities as the rest of America. This will require the work of \nboth Congress and the Federal Communications Commission.\n  Additionally, the Government should try to stay away from doing \nthings that would reverse the recent policy trends of encouraging \nbroadband deployment through free market principles.\n  I sincerely hope that the Congress will act to extend this moratorium \nin a prompt fashion.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I don't want \nto miss the opportunity to commend so many people in Somerset County in \nPennsylvania, who, on two occasions--Monday night and, of course, \nyesterday--were observing the 9/11 remembrances.\n  In the case of the Monday night event I attended at the Somerset \nAlliance Church in Somerset, PA, I wanted to commend them for so much. \nThere are several groups--I will not mention names--such as the \nNational Park Service, of course, that helped bring that event \ntogether, as well as doing so much other work at the crash site; the \nfamilies of Flight 93, the Flight 93 Advisory Commission, the Flight 93 \nMemorial Task Force, and so many others too numerous to name.\n  On Monday night, the service I attended was a night of grief, a night \nof gratitude, and I think a night of renewal. There was grief in the \nobvious sense that we still grieve for those who perished heroically on \nSeptember 11, 2001, at every site--in this case in Shanksville, \nSomerset County, PA. Certainly, it was a night to grieve.\n  It was also a night to express gratitude in two ways at least: One, \ngratitude for those who gave their lives heroically so that the plane \ncrashed in Pennsylvania instead of coming here to destroy the Capitol \nor some other part of our Government, and where more lives might have \nbeen lost, as well as, I think, to express gratitude to those brave \nAmericans on that plane, but also to express the gratitude of the \npeople who came after that tragedy in Somerset County, where the \nfamilies, in particular, wanted to use this Monday night ceremony to \nthank the people of Somerset County. So many people have provided some \nmeasure of comfort over all these 6 years to the families who loved and \nlost. So I think it was also a night for gratitude.\n  Finally, it was a night to express our shared feeling of renewal, \nrenewing not just our commitment to take care of those families and to \ndo all we can to help them, but also our collective renewal to continue \nthe fight for the ages--the fight against terrorism all across our \ncountry and across the world. So it was a night to renew our commitment \nto that basic shared promise that we make to each other that we will \nnever stop fighting against terrorism, and we will be ever vigilant \nagainst this threat to all of America and, indeed, to the world.\n  I wanted to pay tribute to those in Somerset County who came together \nthis past Monday night for a ceremony entitled ``The Spirit of \nCommunity: A Service of Remembrance for the Passengers and Crew of \nFlight 93.'' I thank, in particular, the families for paying tribute to \nthose in the community of Somerset County who have helped them.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak on a situation now \ndeveloping to which I hope my colleagues will pay some attention. If we \nget involved at an early phase, it may be something we can head off \nrather than have it develop full scale. And I will\n\n[[Page S11497]]\n\nhave some pictures. I am talking about the situation in the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo.\n  We have seen a situation there where thousands of people have been \ndying on a monthly basis. It had been stabilizing some with the U.N. \npolicing force that was in the area, the largest in the world. Now it \nis escalating again. It had stabilized. It is something we have to get \nafter right now and, if we can, it might be such that we can stop it \nfrom spreading. But we have to pay some attention to it and look at it \nnow.\n  Not even 12 months after their first free elections in 40 years, the \nfragile stability of the entire country is at stake. Senator Durbin and \nI visited there about a year and a half ago. It was starting to achieve \nsome stability. They hadn't voted yet for the election. Now we are \nseeing the present situation in eastern Congo, specifically in an area \ncalled North Kivu, gravely deteriorating. According to the U.N. relief \nagencies, we have seen nearly 40,000 people displaced this month. We \nsaw another 100,000 displaced in June, in addition to the 100,000 \ndisplaced in January, all from this year. So nearly a quarter million \npeople have been displaced in this one region.\n  These displacements come from rising tensions between the renegade \nGeneral Nkunda and those loyal to the Congolese Government. Nkunda says \nhe is protecting the Tutsi-Congolese minority from the Congolese \nGovernment and from the Hutu militias. These are militias that fled \nRwanda after committing genocide there in 1994. So this has a \nconnection to Rwanda. That is what is so deadly about it. We have seen \nit activated before, and it is deadly.\n  Neither General Nkunda nor the Hutu militias have ever been disarmed, \nraging havoc on the civilian population for years. The fighting between \nNkunda's rebels and Congolese forces has spilled into the Virunga \nMountains where the mountain gorillas reside, the sole place where this \nendangered species lives, a species so close to extinction already, yet \nnine were killed this year in fighting.\n  President Kagame of Rwanda said Monday that Nkunda has legitimate \npolitical grievances against the Congolese Government. We have to call \nhim on that. President Kagame stated Nkunda was simply protecting a \nsection of the Congolese from extermination, but there are no reported \nactions against the Tutsi-Congolese.\n  This can be kind of convoluted on names, but this is how it started \nthe first time around, a rebel general saying: I am protecting the \npeople in the minority. Then they started attacking the people. People \nfled into refugee camps, and more died. When you flee for your life in \nthese areas of the Congo, there is not always another town or village \nto go into. One area where there was fighting over the weekend took \nplace in a settlement village--a refugee camp from a conflict 10 years \nearlier. It burned the village simply because the people could not \nreturn to their previous homes. Now, due to fighting, they are homeless \nand fleeing once again.\n  I want to show a few pictures because it always seems we talk about \nnumbers when we talk about distant places. People say: Well, I am sure \nthat goes on all the time. It doesn't. It doesn't need to go on at all. \nIt helps people to see that there are real people who suffer.\n  Here is a picture of a mother who brought her child into a \ntherapeutic feeding camp because the child was dying of starvation due \nto constant movement of the family from village to village. The child \nbecame sick when they had no other place to go but the jungle to seek \nrefuge. That happens when there is no stabilized place; children die in \nparticular. Others do too.\n  Here is a 2-year-old who caught malaria due to the family hiding for \nso long in the bush after having fled their home. Malnourishment was \nquick to follow, as the family could find no food in the bush. So we \nhave a 2-year-old with malaria, malnourished, on the verge of death.\n  This room is where about 75 to 90 women and children stay when they \nare receiving medical treatment and food supplements from a village \nclinic in the village of Kitchanga in North Kivu Province of Congo. \nThis shows the crowded conditions into which people are forced.\n  Here is a 3-year-old who was diagnosed with malaria, tuberculosis, \nand malnourishment from hiding in the jungle with his family. Every \nbreath he took was preceded by a raspy cough due to the stage of \ntuberculosis. His mother wanted to get him to a health clinic earlier \nbut had to hide the family in the bush for several weeks because the \nroad into town had been blocked by a militia.\n  These are real people suffering, dying because of this situation.\n  This is a 3-year-old diagnosed with malaria. They began treatment for \nthe malaria, and his body rejected the treatment. They found that while \nhe had been eating about once a day, he was anemic due to lack of \nnutrition in the food his family had been able to find in the jungle as \nthey hid from militia groups that had burned their village and home to \nthe ground. His body began to shut down. He rejected the oral and IV \ntreatments. This 3-year-old passed away within 6 hours of rejecting the \nIV treatments, 15 minutes after this photo was taken.\n  These are real lives and real people. I have shown a few of them from \nthis raging war that goes on while we have a blind eye to it.\n  Sexual violence and rape is also on the rise in Congo. The Washington \nPost reported the intensity and frequency of the rape is worse in the \nDRC than anywhere else in the world. The U.N. emergency relief agencies \nreport that 4,500 cases of sexual violence have been reported since \nJanuary of 2007 in this one province alone. We are looking at, in less \nthan 9 months, 4,500 cases of sexual violence in one province. Women \nare brutally raped in front of crowds, families, husbands, resulting in \nserious physical and emotional trauma. I visited a hospital with \nSenator Durbin in the eastern city of Goma where women could be treated \nfor ailments due to brutal rapes. Because of their condition, many \nwomen are outcasts from their community and families, and the pain goes \non.\n  I have made a number of trips to Africa, most recently to Ethiopia in \nJanuary. We must be engaged in this continent. It is a humanitarian \ncause. It is a growing strategic cause. As China tries to integrate \nmore into Africa and militant Islamists engage more as well, we need to \nbe engaged--if not for a strategic reason, look at the faces of the \npeople who are dying--in helping them out.\n  I urge my colleagues to examine this troubling situation. Today, \nthere will be a letter circulating to Secretary Rice urging the State \nDepartment to take more action against these atrocities in a forgotten \narea of the world and find ways to be an increasing force for good in \nthis part of the world. We can help with the malnourishment situation. \nUltimately, we also have to speak to the Rwandan Government and to the \nCongolese Government and to the U.S. forces in that area to take care \nof the people and to knock it off and for us to step up our engagement.\n  Ultimately, I speak for the people of Congo because I think we should \ncare about them. It is our goodness that leads to our greatness as a \ncountry. It is something we should be interested in. We said about \nRwanda: Never again. Now we are seeing even sections of that fight \ncontinue 15 years later and infecting Congo. We said never again; we \nshould mean never again. We should be engaged. We need to become the \nkind of people who are strong to protect the weak.\n  This week, we had an excellent report from General Petraeus on \nmilitary action in a key part of the world. I am delighted that press \nwas delivered and that we can now discuss the political solution. I \ndon't think we are on an effective political track. We need to do that. \nI just came from a consumer product safety hearing on Chinese products, \nthe failure of those products. We need to address that. But we also \nshould not ignore places that are less obvious to us in the world, \nwhere there is carnage and deprivation and humanitarian need. We can be \nmore involved.\n  I urge my colleagues to sign on to this letter. I urge them to get \ninterested. Let us mean ``never again'' and do something about it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S11498]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Madam President, the Senate will soon be asked to \nconfirm a new Attorney General. For the past several months, our \nDemocratic colleagues have pleaded for this very thing. They have \nspoken at length about the importance of the Justice Department and the \nurgent need to install new leadership there as soon as possible.\n  They do not want to make the pick. All they want is someone with \n``integrity'' and ``experience,'' who ``respects the rule of law,'' and \nwho can ``hit the ground running.'' These are their words. The senior \nSenator from New York has assured us he and his colleagues will not \n``obstruct or impede'' such a nominee--again, their own words. This was \ntheir plea and their promise.\n  It now appears, however, that despite these promises, some of our \nDemocratic colleagues may indeed obstruct and impede.\n  Roll Call reported Monday that Democrats on the Judiciary Committee \nmay intentionally--intentionally--delay confirmation of the next \nnominee, whoever he or she is, in order to extract still more \nadministration documents in the U.S. attorneys matter. It cited one \nDemocratic leadership aide as saying that ``it would not be surprising \nif Democrats decide to take their time on the nomination as a way to \nforce the administration's hand.''\n  So our Democratic colleagues have repeatedly told us that the central \nconcern in all of this was the health and well-being of the Justice \nDepartment. Yet now they say they are willing to hold up the new \nAttorney General in exchange for more documents related to their \nfishing expedition--which, so far, has been long on fishermen and short \non fish.\n  Let's remember that over the last 7 months, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has held no fewer than 13 hearings on the U.S. attorneys \nmatter--13 hearings. The administration has cooperated extensively in \nthis process. It has provided more than 8,000 pages of documents, along \nwith dozens of witnesses in both public hearings and private \ninterviews.\n  None of these documents, none of these witnesses, none of these \nhearings has produced evidence of illegality on the part of the \nadministration in the U.S. attorneys matter. Despite their best \nefforts, our Democratic friends have candidly and publicly conceded \nthey have yet to find--again, in their own words--a ``smoking gun,'' \nwhich is not to say these investigations have been a complete waste of \ntime for Senate Democrats.\n  While the Senate Judiciary Committee was holding hearings, the \nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee was hard at work too. \nAccording to the Washington Post, as the Judiciary Committee hearings \nbegan, the Democrats' campaign committee began to raise money off the \nmatter.\n  Here, in fact, is a copy of one of the DSCC's fundraising \nsolicitations. It points to the U.S. attorneys matter and asks for a \ndonation. Interesting timing.\n  Well, Madam President, as the adage goes: The proof is in the \npudding. Our Democratic colleagues will help prove their concern for \nthe Justice Department was genuine and not motivated by partisan \npolitics by confirming a nominee in a timely manner.\n  Now, we know what the precedents are. Since the Carter \nadministration, it has taken, on average--let me say this again--since \nthe Carter administration, it has taken, on average, about 3 weeks from \nnomination to confirmation for a nominee for Attorney General--3 weeks, \non average, from nomination to confirmation for Attorneys General since \nthe Carter administration.\n  Some nominees have actually taken less time. Benjamin Civiletti and \nJanet Reno, the second Attorney General nominees of President Carter \nand President Clinton, were confirmed in 12 and 13 days, respectively, \nafter their nominations. Richard Thornburgh, President Reagan's third \nAttorney General, was confirmed 17 days after he was nominated.\n  Now is the chance for our Democratic colleagues to prove they meant \nwhat they said. If they were serious when they cried out for new \nleadership at the Justice Department, they will follow Senate \nprecedent. They will carefully weigh the qualifications of the nominee \nand vote in a timely fashion, as has been the case since the Carter \nadministration.\n  If, instead, our colleagues intentionally delay the nominee and hold \nhim or her hostage, they will show the American people that their \nconcern for the Department was insincere and that they simply did not \nmean it when, as the senior Senator from New York put it: ``This Nation \nneeds a new attorney general, and it can't afford to wait.''\n  In these times, it is especially important that the Senate act \npromptly. We are, after all, at war, and as the distinguished ranking \nmember of the committee has noted, apart from the Defense Department, \nno Department of the executive branch is more important to defending \nour Nation than the Department of Justice.\n  So, Madam President, we need to act.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I just note, listening to the Republican \nleader, it is a little difficult to accuse us of delaying a nomination \nthat has not yet been made. This is a new one.\n  The way it works is the President actually has to nominate somebody \nbefore we can consider the nomination. So before we rush out here and \nstart accusing our side of delaying a nomination that has not yet been \nmade, they might want to direct their attention to the White House. \nThey are the ones who have an obligation to make the nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11498-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11498-S11499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 PAY-GO\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I have come to the floor because at the \nend of last week the ranking member of the Budget Committee made a \nspeech on pay-go in which he suggested it is a meaningless exercise and \nthat it makes no contribution to fiscal responsibility. I come to the \nfloor because I beg to differ, and I think I have a responsibility, as \nchairman of the Budget Committee, to give the other side of the story.\n  The Senate pay-go rule says that any new mandatory spending or tax \ncuts must be offset or get a supermajority vote. So if you want new \nspending or new tax cuts, you can have them, but you either have to pay \nfor them or get a supermajority vote. That is the Senate rule. It is a \ngood rule, and it has been effective at contributing to fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  If we look back in history, here is what we see, as demonstrated on \nthis chart. We had a strong pay-go rule in effect from 1991 to 2000, \nand the deficit was reduced each and every year. In fact, we moved into \nsurplus--in fact, a surplus so large that for 2 years we stopped using \nthe Social Security trust fund to fund the operating expenses of the \nFederal Government. That is what happened with a strong pay-go rule.\n  Then our colleagues on the other side took control of both Chambers, \ntook control of the White House, weakened the pay-go rule, and look \nwhat happened to deficits afterward. The surplus was squandered. We \nmoved into deficits that grew year after year after year to record \nlevels.\n  Now we have restored pay-go, and we are moving back toward a balanced \nbudget. Pay-go, in fact, is working. The Senate pay-go scorecard shows \na positive balance of $450 million. So, in fact, pay-go is working. \nEvery bill coming out of conference this year has been paid for. Every \none that has come out of conference has been paid for, or more than \npaid for. Pay-go also has provided a significant deterrent, preventing \nmany costly bills from ever being offered. Let me say I know that \nbecause as the Budget Committee chairman, I am besieged by Members who \nwant to somehow get around pay-go. When we tell them: No, we are going \nto insist that things be paid for, it is quite remarkable how many of \nthese things go away or are reduced so that they can be paid for.\n\n  Now, Senator Gregg himself, in a previous incarnation, was a strong \nsupporter of pay-go. Here is what he said previously:\n\n       The second budget discipline, which is pay-go, essentially \n     says if you are going to add a\n\n[[Page S11499]]\n\n     new entitlement or you are going to cut taxes during a \n     period, especially of deficits, you must offset that event so \n     that it becomes a budget-neutral event that also lapses. If \n     we do not do this, if we do not put back in place caps and \n     pay-go mechanisms, we will have no budget discipline in this \n     Congress and, as a result, we will dramatically aggravate the \n     deficit which, of course, impacts a lot of important issues, \n     but especially impacts Social Security.\n\n  Senator Gregg was exactly right then. Why he has done a U-turn I \ndon't know. The fact is pay-go has been a useful discipline in this \nCongress, and he previously--even he has acknowledged that fact.\n  Now, the Senator from New Hampshire also criticized the use of the \nreconciliation process that was just used to extend assistance to \ncollege students. He said that was an abuse of reconciliation. I would \nremind him and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle of what \nthey did when they controlled the reconciliation process. In the bill \nwe just passed, we paid for it completely, and had over $700 million of \ndeficit reduction. That is what reconciliation is intended to do--to \nprovide for deficit reduction.\n  Here is what they did when they controlled the reconciliation \nprocess. They adopted legislation that was not paid for, tax cuts that \nwere not offset, and they added $1.7 trillion to the debt using \nreconciliation, which was designed to reduce deficits and reduce debt. \nThey stood the whole process on its head and used those special rules, \nthose fast-track procedures to explode the deficits and debt.\n  In using reconciliation, we have not only been able to increase the \nassistance that will go to college students in this country, but paid \nfor it completely. In the 2005-2006 budget reconciliation our friends \non the other side controlled, they increased the deficit by $31 \nbillion. It is true they had some spending cuts, but they had even more \ntax cuts, so once again, they added to the deficit and debt.\n  So let's be clear. In the Senate reconciliation rule we have adopted, \nwe have said reconciliation--which is a special fast-track procedure \nthat has a limited time for discussion and debate and limits \namendments--that special procedure can only be used if deficit \nreduction is the result. That is not what they did with reconciliation. \nThey used it to explode deficit and debt. But on our side, we use the \nreconciliation process for the reason intended. There is a 60-vote \npoint of order against any reconciliation bill that would increase the \ndeficit or reduce a surplus.\n  The higher education reconciliation bill that was criticized by my \ncolleague on the other side--which, by the way, passed here with an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote--but that bill increased the Pell grant to \n$5,400 by 2012; cut the student loan interest rates in half; and \nreduced the deficit by $752 million. That is in keeping with the spirit \nof reconciliation that is for deficit reduction. We compare and \ncontrast that with what the other side has done. When they had the \ncontrol of reconciliation, they used that fast-track procedure not to \nreduce deficits, which was the whole reason for reconciliation; they \ninstead used it to explode deficits and debt.\n  Our colleague on the other side also attacked the children's health \ninsurance legislation that will cover 4 million additional children and \nis paid for. Let's review what that legislation does. It provides \nhealth care coverage to 4 million additional children. It is fully paid \nfor over both 6 and 11 years, as required under pay-go. It is a 5-year \nreauthorization; Congress will reauthorize in 2012 with new policies \nand new offsets. Hopefully, by then we will have enacted reform of \nhealth care in America and we will have provided coverage, universal \ncoverage. I think there is a growing bipartisan consensus that any \nhealth care reform should provide universal coverage, because that is \nthe way we can most effectively run a health care system. It also \nprovides important coverage to kids, while spurring action on broader \nhealth care reform.\n  Let me get back to the simple fact. This bill is paid for. The \nreconciliation bill for education was paid for. It was paid for because \nwe put in place a pay-go requirement that says: If you are going to \nhave new spending, you have to offset it or get a supermajority vote. \nWe might have been able to get a supermajority vote without paying for \nthese things. We didn't choose to do that. We chose to be fiscally \nresponsible. We chose to pay for an expansion of children's health \ncare. We chose to pay for additional assistance to our young men and \nwomen going to college. That was the right thing to do.\n  I might add, if you compare and contrast what they are complaining \nabout, which is the outyear potential funding for children's health \ninsurance, I am talking about this little line out here. This is what \nthey are complaining about, this little tiny gap, and that is a \ntheoretical gap. It is fascinating, because these tax cuts they want to \nextend without paying for them creates this chasm. They make no \ncomplaint about this chasm. They direct all of their attention to this \ntheoretical gap, this tiny thing you probably can't even see on \ntelevision. There is no credibility to that complaint. They say nothing \nabout this chasm, and they focus all of their complaint on this tiny \ndifference that is wholly theoretical, because this is a 5-year bill. \nIt doesn't extend beyond 2012. They are talking about what is going to \nhappen in the sweet by and by. Nobody can tell us what is going to \nhappen past 2012. We know this bill is paid for until 2012. What \nhappens in the future will be dependent upon the actions of future \nCongresses.\n  So as I have reviewed the remarks of my colleague on the other side \ncriticizing pay-go, criticizing the higher education bill that passed \nhere overwhelmingly; criticizing the children's health care insurance \nexpansion that is fully paid for, I don't find much merit. A lot of \nrhetoric there, but not much merit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11499-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11499-S11501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, yesterday was 9/11. I think all of us \nrecall that fateful day. I certainly do. Earlier that morning, I had \nspoken to an education conference south of the Pentagon. I had driven \nby the Pentagon right before it was struck. I came and parked on the \nMall in front of the Capitol. I came up the steps to a leadership \nmeeting. Security people were coming down the steps ordering people out \nof the building, saying they were concerned about an attack on the \nCapitol itself. I left here and my military aide met me as I walked \nback to my offices--I guess, more accurately, I jogged back to my \noffices because we were being urged to leave quickly. I could hear a \nfighter plane overhead. My military aide turned to me and said: You \nknow, Senator, those are our guys. Those are the Happy Hooligans from \nFargo, ND. The first planes in the air to protect the Capitol were the \nHappy Hooligans of Fargo, ND. You may be asking yourselves: How can it \nbe that a National Guard unit from Fargo, ND, are the first planes in \nthe sky to protect the Nation's Capital? The reason is they are given \nthat responsibility and they are aircraft flown by North Dakota pilots \nwho are based at a base close by the Nation's Capital. They fly what is \ncalled the CAP over the Capitol to protect us, and they were the first \nplanes in the air to provide fighter protection to this Capitol \ncomplex. It made me proud at the time to know those were the Happy \nHooligans of Fargo, ND.\n  When I went back to my office, I was doing a national radio interview \nwith a man named Ed Schultz who has a national radio show. We were \nwatching in horror as the Twin Towers started to collapse. Security \npeople ran in again and ushered us out, telling us there was a plane 8 \nminutes out and they were afraid it was headed for the Capitol complex. \nThat is the plane that ultimately crashed in Pennsylvania. I don't \nthink anyone knows for certain where that plane was headed. Most assume \nit was either the Capitol or the White House that was the intended \ntarget of that plane. I think we will always be forever grateful for \nthe men and women who were on that plane who fought back. You think of \nthe incredible bravery of those people, to know they were hijacked, to \nhave learned through cell phone contact that the World Trade Center had \nbeen attacked, the Pentagon had been attacked, and they did not just \nsit. They got out of their chairs and fought back. By doing so, they \nmay have saved either the White House or this Capitol. That was an act \nof extraordinary heroism and courage.\n\n[[Page S11500]]\n\n  Later that day, Members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, \njoined on the Capitol steps, and I will forever remember how \nspontaneously at the end of the remarks of the leadership we sang ``God \nBless America.'' I remember that feeling at that moment: that we are \nnot Republicans, we are not Democrats; we are all Americans, and we \nstand together and will defend this Nation and we will hold those to \naccount who did this dastardly deed. I hope we all think of ourselves \nas Americans first.\n  I also think we have to remember that it has now been 2,192 days \nsince that attack. The President promised we would hold those \nresponsible to account. The President said very clearly that this act \nwould not stand. It is especially painful then to see Osama bin Laden \nand Zawahiri and the other leadership of al-Qaida go on the air, \nthreatening to attack us again.\n  This is what the President said then:\n\n       There's no question about it, this act will not stand; we \n     will find those who did it; we will smoke them out of their \n     holes; we will get them running and we'll bring them to \n     justice.\n\n  The President was right in making that statement. That is precisely \nwhat our focus should have been.\n  Then you see this Newsweek headline: ``He Is Still Out There. The \nHunt For Bin Laden.''\n  Somehow, we got confused about who attacked us. I just saw an ad \nbeing run about Iraq saying they attacked us on September 11. That is \nnot true. Iraq did not attack us on September 11; al-Qaida attacked us. \nIn fact, there wasn't a single Iraqi on any of the planes that hit the \nWorld Trade Center or the Pentagon--not one. We know from the 9/11 \nCommission that the attack was not directed by Saddam Hussein, as evil \nand dreadful a man as he was.\n  No, that attack was directed by Osama bin Laden and was carried out \nby al-Qaida, not Iraq. In fact, the 9/11 Commission tells us and our \nintelligence tells us that al-Qaida was not active in Iraq at the time. \nThey have become active. Now we have al-Qaida in Iraq, but they were \nnot there at the time.\n  It is so important that we get these facts right. Al-Qaida attacked \nus. Osama bin Laden led that attack. He is still on the loose and so is \nhis chief aide, Mr. Zawahiri. It is critically important that we get it \nright who attacked us and whom we need to hold to account. I hope we \nwill never give up our efforts to hunt down Osama bin Laden and \nZawahiri and the rest of the al-Qaida leadership cadre because they are \nplotting to attack us again.\n  I have always believed that Iraq was a fateful mistake, a diversion \nof going in the wrong place, after the wrong enemy, at the wrong time, \ninstead of pursuing the people who did attack us, who did kill \nAmericans, who are plotting to attack us again.\n  We had, yesterday, very important testimony from General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Crocker. Let me say I have high regard for General Petraeus. \nI thought the ad that was run by some the other day was unfortunate and \nwrong. General Petraeus is a patriot. General Petraeus is somebody who \ndeserves our respect. That doesn't mean you have to agree with every \nposition he takes. That is not the point. But he is somebody who is \namong our finest. We should never in this country start turning on our \nown, those who serve us bravely and well in the military. That is not \nright. Ambassador Crocker is one of our finest diplomats. I don't agree \nwith every policy prescription they propose, but they don't deserve to \nbe personally attacked. That is not right. We have to remember and we \nhave to keep perspective somehow about how we advance our national \ninterest.\n  Let me say that yesterday the Washington Post ran a series of polls \nreporting on what the Iraqi people think is going on. You know, there \nis a cultural chasm here, I am afraid, between those of us raised in \nthe Western culture and the people we are dealing with in that part of \nthe world. I went to school and graduated from a high school at Wheelus \nAir Force Base High School in Tripoli, Libya, North Africa. I lived in \nthe Arab world for 2 years. I have some sense of the enormous \ndifference in the way they see things and the way we see things. It is \ninstructive to ask what do the Iraqi people think is happening in their \ncountry. After all, it is their country, and what they think has a lot \nto say about what the outcome is going to be.\n  The Washington Post reported in depth a poll yesterday. The question \nwas:\n\n       Do you think this increase in U.S. forces in Baghdad and \n     surrounding provinces in the past six months has made \n     security better, worse, or had no effect?\n\n  In the deployment areas, the areas where we deployed the additional \ntroops, here is what the Iraqi people think. They think, by 70 percent, \nthat the surge has made things worse; 18 percent think it has made \nthings better; 11 percent think it has had no effect. In the areas \noutside the deployment, elsewhere in Iraq, 68 percent think it has made \nthings worse.\n  Now, is anybody paying any attention here? We have gone, \ntheoretically, first of all, from eliminating weapons of mass \ndestruction that didn't exist, to eliminating a nuclear program that \ndidn't exist, to deposing Saddam Hussein, who did exist and has been \ndeposed; then we are told we are supposed to be making things better \nfor the Iraqi people. But the Iraqi people overwhelmingly think we have \nmade things worse. Now a substantial majority of the people in Iraq \nthink it is OK to attack American forces. We are caught in what is \nprimarily--not solely or exclusively but primarily--a sectarian \nconflict, a civil war between the Sunni and Shia. This is a battle that \nhas been going on for over 1,300 years. Why we would want our young men \nand women to be refereeing a fight between Shia and Sunni, at enormous \ncost in lives and treasure, absolutely eludes me.\n  We have so much else to do--first of all, in terms of our own \nsecurity, going after the people who did attack us--al-Qaida and going \nafter the leadership of al-Qaida, bin Laden and Zawahiri, who are still \non the loose and still plotting to attack us. We are in Iraq being told \nthe idea is now that we are to give breathing room for the Iraqi \nGovernment to make political progress to reduce the sectarian violence. \nYet the overwhelming majority of the Iraqi people say this expanded \ndeployment has made things worse; 70 percent in the deployment areas \nsay we have made things worse, and only 18 percent say we have made \nthings better.\n  Who has a better idea of what is going on in Iraq? I think we ought \nto be paying some attention to what the Iraqi people think is going on \nthere. When a majority of the Iraqi people say it is OK to attack \nAmerican forces, and we are there, theoretically, to help them, there \nis an enormous disconnect here. There is an enormous disconnect between \nwhat we apparently think we are doing and what we are actually \naccomplishing.\n  I am one who does not favor setting a strict deadline for leaving. I \ndon't think that it is militarily wise to say to your opponents that we \nare leaving by a specific date. But we have to change course in Iraq. \nWe have now lost thousands of brave men and women, with tens of \nthousands badly wounded. We have committed over a half trillion \ndollars, and we are told the President is now going to come and ask for \nanother $195 billion. But the President is telling us we don't have the \nmoney, for example, for the Transportation bill we passed. The \nPresident says we don't have the money for that. How many more bridges \nhave to collapse in this country before we have the money to take care \nof our own citizens' safety?\n  The President says we don't have the money to maintain the COPS \nprogram, which put 100,000 police officers on the street. The President \nsaid we should cut that 90 percent at a time when crime is rising in \nAmerica. We have, apparently, $195 billion to spend in Iraq, but we \ndon't have the several hundred million dollars we need to keep those \npolice on the street in our country.\n  As I look at this, I am increasingly convinced we need to redeploy \nour forces; we need to, as a matter of our national security, refocus \nour effort on going after the people who did attack us on 9/11 and \nfully intend to attack us again, and that is al-Qaida, not Iraq.\n  I hope we will think very carefully in the coming days, as the debate \nintensifies, on what our future policy should be.\n\n[[Page S11501]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11499-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11499-S11501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, yesterday was 9/11. I think all of us \nrecall that fateful day. I certainly do. Earlier that morning, I had \nspoken to an education conference south of the Pentagon. I had driven \nby the Pentagon right before it was struck. I came and parked on the \nMall in front of the Capitol. I came up the steps to a leadership \nmeeting. Security people were coming down the steps ordering people out \nof the building, saying they were concerned about an attack on the \nCapitol itself. I left here and my military aide met me as I walked \nback to my offices--I guess, more accurately, I jogged back to my \noffices because we were being urged to leave quickly. I could hear a \nfighter plane overhead. My military aide turned to me and said: You \nknow, Senator, those are our guys. Those are the Happy Hooligans from \nFargo, ND. The first planes in the air to protect the Capitol were the \nHappy Hooligans of Fargo, ND. You may be asking yourselves: How can it \nbe that a National Guard unit from Fargo, ND, are the first planes in \nthe sky to protect the Nation's Capital? The reason is they are given \nthat responsibility and they are aircraft flown by North Dakota pilots \nwho are based at a base close by the Nation's Capital. They fly what is \ncalled the CAP over the Capitol to protect us, and they were the first \nplanes in the air to provide fighter protection to this Capitol \ncomplex. It made me proud at the time to know those were the Happy \nHooligans of Fargo, ND.\n  When I went back to my office, I was doing a national radio interview \nwith a man named Ed Schultz who has a national radio show. We were \nwatching in horror as the Twin Towers started to collapse. Security \npeople ran in again and ushered us out, telling us there was a plane 8 \nminutes out and they were afraid it was headed for the Capitol complex. \nThat is the plane that ultimately crashed in Pennsylvania. I don't \nthink anyone knows for certain where that plane was headed. Most assume \nit was either the Capitol or the White House that was the intended \ntarget of that plane.

Madam President, I rise today with great pleasure to \ncommend an exceptional group of my constituents and acknowledge \nSeptember 12, 2007, as the National Day of Encouragement. The concept \nbehind the National Day of Encouragement was developed in June 2007 as \npart of the National Leadership Forum at Harding University in Searcy, \nAR.\n  The National Leadership Forum, NLF, was composed of a group of \nenterprising high school students from around the country who were \nchallenged to think of constructive ways to help their respective \nschools. One group said that discouragement or ``the lack of \nencouragement'' was the biggest problem they faced in school as well as \nin society today. From there, the idea of an official Day of \nEncouragement as a possible solution was born.\n  According to Andrew Baker, the codirector of NLF, the students chose \nSeptember 12 as the National Day of Encouragement in hopes of \n``balancing the discouraging feelings of 9/11''. The goal was to \n``challenge people not to just think about the idea of encouragement \nbut to do something that will encourage someone else.''\n  Since the conception of the National Day of Encouragement, grassroots \nefforts have been working towards creating a real sense of \nencouragement in cities, schools, places of employment, and homes. Even \nthe smallest gesture such as a smile, a pat on the back, or a kind \nword, has the ability to communicate love and compassion that can raise \nspirits and spur motivation, especially on a day like September 12.\n  Americans have endured great hardship and heartbreak as a result of \nthe terrorist attacks, but this has not broken our faith, courage and \nan unshakable commitment to freedom, democracy and, most importantly, \neach other. Yesterday, we remembered the tragedy of September 11, and \nwe honored its victims. Today, we honor the victims again by \nremembering the sacrifices made by thousands of Americans to help the \nvictims of the attacks and their families. Their acts of kindness and \ngenerosity inspired and encouraged the entire Nation.\n  I encourage my fellow colleagues, citizens of all ages, as well as \nthose in schools, organizations, businesses, and media outlets, to \nencourage others on this day, through an act of service, a thoughtful \nletter, or words of kindness and inspiration to thereby boost the \noverall morale of all.\n  I would also like to commend the extraordinary group of high school \nstudents who participated in the National Leadership Forum this year. \nThey have shown the ability to analyze critical issues with insight and \nintellect, and it is an honor to stand here before you today and \nrecognize all of them and their accomplishments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11501-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    IN RECOGNITION OF THE 130TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN HUMANE \n                              ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, children and animals are the most \nvulnerable of our Nation's population, as they do not have a voice of \ntheir own. Organizations which aid animals or children are very \nimportant in creating and maintaining a humane, safe and just society. \nThat is why I rise today to honor and praise the American Humane \nAssociation on the occasion of its 130th anniversary.\n  The American Humane Association is unique in America in that it is \nnot only the oldest but the only national organization with the dual \nmission of protecting both animals and children. As a true American \nicon of humanity, the American Humane Association has been the voice of \nthe most vulnerable both animals and children--for each and every one \nof its 13 decades of existence.\n  American Humane was formed on October 9, 1877, with the vital mission \nof protecting both children and animals from abuse, neglect, cruelty \nand exploitation. Over those years covering much of two centuries, \nAmerican Humane has actively and successfully promoted humane values \nand education, built significant public awareness and understanding, \nand has developed programs and processes that effectively protect both \nchildren and animals. It has been a leader in advancing humanity in \nthis Nation and has been a model for the rest of the world to see and \nemulate.\n  Among numerous other initiatives, American Humane, based in Denver, \nCO, originated such programs as ``Be Kind to Animals Week,'' and ``Tag \nDay,'' to educate the public on the need to treat animals humanely and \nto adequately identify their animals. American Humane is the only \norganization to monitor and certify the making of movies to ensure ``No \nAnimals Were Harmed.'' The organization also created ``The Front Porch \nProject,'' an initiative to educate communities on how to protect \nchildren from abuse, and it was the world's first organization to \nidentify ``The Link'' between animal abuse and human violence.\n  I am grateful for American Humane's continuing good work in advancing \nhumanity on a national scale. The United States of America is greatly \nenriched by the ongoing work of American Humane Association, and I \ncongratulate the Association on this significant historical \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11501-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                  HILTON HUMANITARIAN PRIZE TO TOSTAN\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I would like to commend the \nSenegalese-based nonprofit organization Tostan, which today will \nreceive the Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize. Tostan, founded by \nformer Peace Corps volunteer Molly Melching, promotes basic education \nand helps to empower women and men to change their communities.\n  As one resident of The Gambia noted, ``With this program, people will \nmake change from within for themselves without anyone else's help.''\n  The work of Tostan has transformed the lives of residents in Senegal \nand other African countries. While I was First Lady, I had the \nopportunity to visit Dakar to meet with Molly and the women and men who \nwere working to address female genital cutting, FGC, in their \ncommunities.\n  I learned in these encounters that an extraordinary power is \nunleashed when people reach out to their neighbors and find common \nground. When men and women begin to lift themselves up, they lift up \ntheir families and their communities as well.\n  Tostan is the catalyst for change in communities across Africa, and \nit produces results: More than 160,000 individuals have attended human \nrights and democracy classes run by Tostan; more than 1,000 community \nmanagement committees--80 percent of which are headed by women--have \nbenefited from Tostan's guidance; and more than 2 million people in \nover 2,000 villages have made a public commitment to ending practices \nlike FGC or child marriage.\n  Indeed, earlier this year, women in Senegal announced that they will \nbe seeking to make that country the first in Africa to eliminate FGC \nentirely within the next 5 years--a pledge that would not have been \npossible without the work of Tostan over these many years.\n  Tostan will be using the award money from the Hilton prize to further \nits activities in countries across Africa to end female genital \ncutting, improve literacy, and promote small business and community \ndevelopment.

Madam President, today I would like to recognize \nthe Appalachian State University Mountaineers football team for pulling \noff one of the biggest upsets in college football history. To recognize \nthis achievement, Senator Burr and I have introduced Senate resolution \nnumber S. Res. 309.\n  On September 1, 2007, the Appalachian State Mountaineers of the\n\n[[Page S11502]]\n\nNCAA Football Championship Subdivision, formerly known as Division 1-\nAA, beat the University of Michigan Wolverines, ranked fifth \nnationally, of the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision, formally known as \nDivision 1-A, by a score of 34-32 in front of 109,000 spectators at \n``The Big House'' in Ann Arbor, MI. No Division 1-AA team has ever been \nvictorious over a nationally ranked Division 1-A opponent.\n  The win over the Wolverines was an extraordinary team effort. \nQuarterback Armanti Edwards threw for 227 yards and three touchdowns \nwhile rushing for 62 yards and one touchdown. The receiving corps \ncombined for 227 yards of offense with two touchdowns from Dexter \nJackson and one from Hans Batichon. In addition, the defense had an \noutstanding game and forced two critical turnovers in the second half--\none fumble recovery and one interception--to guide the Mountaineers to \nvictory.\n  During the fourth quarter the Mountaineers came up with the special \nplays needed to complete the monumental win. With Appalachian State \ntrailing 32-31, Brian Quick blocked a Michigan field goal setting-up \nwhat would become the game-winning drive. On the ensuing drive, kicker \nJulian Rauch put a 24-yard field goal through the uprights to move the \nMountaineers ahead 34-32 with 26 seconds left in the game. The \nMountaineers, however, still needed one more big play from its special \nteams. With just a few seconds remaining, Corey Lynch dramatically \nblocked a Wolverine field goal attempt to seal the victory.\n  After the final gun, head coach Jerry Moore, who put together a \nmasterful game plan, was carried off the field by his players in \nvictory. The Appalachian State Mountaineers' victory over the Michigan \nWolverines demonstrates that any achievement is possible with hard work \nand a great deal of heart.\n  I applaud the tremendous effort by the players, head coach Jerry \nMoore, and the assistant coaches and support personnel who all played \ncritical roles in this historic victory. In addition, I would like to \ncongratulate Dr. Kenneth E. Peacock, chancellor of Appalachian State \nUniversity, Charles Cobb, athletic director, and all of the students \nand fans to whom this win meant so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11502-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CARLSBAD MEDICAL CENTER\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

It has been an honor to watch \nthis facility and the progress they have made over the last 30 years. I \nlook forward to another 30 years of growth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11502-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SALUTING THE AUGUSTINE AND STRASSER FAMILIES\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, today I call to the attention of \nmy colleagues three very special families from Rose Hill, IA, and their \nextraordinary contributions to our Nation.\n  First, a little bit of background. As we all know, the National Guard \nand the Reserves have been shouldering a huge share of the combat \nburden in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are not only away from their \nfamilies, they are also away from their employers. Bear in mind that \nthese are citizen soldiers. In civilian life, they are teachers, \nfirefighters, farmers, attorneys, and members of just about every other \nprofession. And when they are deployed, their employers also have to \nmake sacrifices.\n  Every year, the Department of Defense presents its Freedom Award to a \nsmall number of employers that go above and beyond the call of duty in \nsupporting employees who are deployed with the Guard or Reserve. This \nyear, one of those employers is Augustine & Sons farm in Rose Hill, IA.\n  Augustine & Sons is not one of those big corporate conglomerate \nfarms. We are talking about a family farm owned and worked by brothers \nDan and Mike Augustine. They are the sixth generation of the Augustines \nto farm this land since it was homesteaded in 1852. They have just two \nemployees on the farm, and one of those employees is Matthew Strasser, \na first sergeant with the Iowa National Guard who is on his second \ndeployment overseas. First Sergeant Strasser previously served in \nKosovo, and he is now deployed in Afghanistan.\n  The next time we see one of those bumper stickers that says, \n``Support Our Troops,'' we should think of the Augustine families. When \nFirst Sergeant Strasser left for Afghanistan, the Augustines lost one-\nhalf of their two-man workforce. But the Augustine brothers have \ncontinued to pay his entire salary, including an annual bonus. The \nStrasser family continues to live rent-free in a house on the farm. The \nAugustine families look in on the Strassers like they are just one big \nfamily--helping with chores, taking the boys fishing, and much more.\n  It is just an extraordinary story of good, decent people going the \nextra mile--I should say, the extra 100 miles--to extend a helping hand \nand to be endlessly generous. The Augustines may have a relatively \nsmall farm, but they have very big hearts.\n  The Augustine and Strasser families are in Washington today, and the \nAugustines will be presented with a 2007 Freedom Award at a special \ndinner this evening. It was a great honor to have them at my weekly \nconstituent breakfast this morning. I had the pleasure of meeting Dan \nAugustine, his wife Teresa and son Ryan; Mike Augustine, his wife \nLeesa, and son Caitlin; and Jessica Strasser, the wife of 1SG Matthew \nStrasser, and their sons Reece and Tyler.\n  I am sure that the entire Senate joins me in saluting 1SG Matthew \nStrasser for his courageous service in Afghanistan and also for the \nsacrifices on the homefront by Jessica Strasser and their sons. We also \nare deeply grateful to the Augustine families for their generosity and \ntheir very special brand of patriotism.\n  Yesterday, Americans commemorated the anniversary of the September \n11, 2007, attacks. It has always struck me that those attacks, which \nrepresented humanity at its very worst, have led to so many acts of \ngenerosity and sacrifice that represent humanity at its very best. The \nAugustine and Strasser families make me very proud to be an American, \nand it was wonderful to meet them this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11502-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11502-S11503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING MAJOR GENERAL MICHAEL A. GORMAN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, today I pay tribute to MG \nMichael A. Gorman. September 15, 2007, will mark the end of an \nillustrious, 41 year career that began on March 7, 1966. Major General \nGorman is a home-grown South Dakotan who has served his State and \nNation with distinction.\n  Major General Gorman began his distinguished service to the Nation by \nenlisting in the South Dakota Army National Guard in 1966. In 1974, he \nwas commissioned an engineer officer upon graduating from the South \nDakota Officer Candidate School program. He has held numerous positions \nin the 109th Engineer Battalion, commanded South Dakota's 88th Troop \nCommand, served as Director of Human Resources, Deputy Chief of Staff \nfor Logistics, and Assistant Adjutant General for the South Dakota Army \nNational Guard. Major General Gorman also serves on the Governor's \ncabinet as the Secretary of Military and Veteran's Affairs. In this \ncapacity, he is the principle adviser to the Governor on military and \nveteran matters. He is concluding his meritorious career as the \nAdjutant General for the South Dakota National Guard.\n  I would like to personally thank Major General Gorman for his service \nas the Adjutant General with the South Dakota National Guard. His \nmilitary service, patriotism, and dedication to the National Guard and \nSouth Dakota's veterans have been invaluable, and I commend him for his\n\n[[Page S11503]]\n\ndedication to our country and our State during the many years he has \nserved. I have enjoyed working with him on a variety of issues and \nappreciate the compassion and understanding he has shown to the men and \nwomen under his command, especially during these very challenging times \nfor our Nation and our military.\n  His efforts to recruit, train, equip, and mobilize South Dakotans for \nservice have been critical to the Guard's mission accomplishment, as \nhas his commitment to care for our State's veterans. His outstanding \nservice on behalf of our State's service men and women is appreciated; \nhe has set an exceptional example for military personnel to follow.\n  I commend him for all he has done for the people of South Dakota. His \ndedicated service to our grateful Nation will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11503-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO WGNO-TV, NEW ORLEANS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, today I wish to speak about a \ntelevision station in my hometown of New Orleans. As all our local news \nmedia have, WGNO-TV/ABC 26 has been there through thick and through \nthin, telling Louisiana's story of recovery following Hurricane \nKatrina. But often missed as you watch the local news broadcasts and \nread the local papers is that the story of rebuilding and recovery \nthese journalists are telling is as much their own story as it is the \ncommunity's.\n  After many years broadcasting from New Orleans' World Trade Center, \nWGNO moved into a new studio facility at the New Orleans Centre, near \nthe Louisiana Superdome, just a few weeks before Katrina hit. Forced \nout of the space by the approaching storm, they broadcast their \ncoverage from ABC station WBRZ-TV in Baton Rouge, as well as various \nlocations on the road, reporting from the heart of the devastation.\n  When they moved back to New Orleans to begin telling the story of \nrebuilding, they told it from a facility all too familiar to their \nviewers--a set of trailers parked behind the Superdome. A makeshift \nstudio and control room were assembled in part with equipment procured \non the Internet. Months later, after a decision was made to not reopen \nthe New Orleans Centre, effectively evicting the station, WGNO moved \nback into the World Trade Center facility they had vacated in July \n2005.\n  Tonight, WGNO formally celebrates the opening of a brand-new \nbroadcast center in Metairie, Louisiana. Their first broadcast from \ntheir new home was on August 29--the 2-year anniversary of Katrina--and \nI was proud to be their first in-studio guest.\n  It took 2 years for the hard-working staff of WGNO to move into a \npermanent new home. For many of my constituents, it will be much \nlonger. But one guiding light will be, as it has been since the storm \nfirst struck, the dedicated reporting of our local news organizations--\nnot just WGNO, but also their colleagues at WWL-TV, WVUE-TV and WDSU-\nTV, our local radio stations, the Times Picayune and our vibrant weekly \ncommunity papers, and all the others who have stayed with us every \nminute of these difficult 2 years. Even as many of their own reporters, \nengineers and other personnel have faced their own tremendous \nchallenges, having in many cases lost homes and loved ones, they have \ncontinued to be a voice for our great city and State.\n  I congratulate WGNO as they celebrate their new home, and thank them \nand all of our local news media for their continued service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11503-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING LOOK'S GOURMET FOOD COMPANY, INC.\n\n   Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, today I celebrate the recent \ninclusion of a small business from my home State of Maine on the Inc. \n5,000 list of this Nation's fastest-growing private companies. Look's \nGourmet Food Company, Inc., of Whiting has been a dominant player in \nthe canned food industry since its inception in 1917. Notably, during \nthe past 3 years, the company has grown over 200 percent, garnering the \nattention of Inc., a magazine that reports on small business and \nentrepreneurship issues. Companies on the list were ranked based on \ntheir percentage of revenue growth between 2003 and 2006. Moreover, all \nthe firms had to be based in the United States, independent, and \nprivately held. Of particular distinction is that Look's Gourmet Food \nCompany placed 41st among 160 food and beverage companies subcategory. \nThis is truly an honor for the State of Maine--especially for downeast \nMaine.\n  When Mike Cote became the owner of the former A.M. Look Canning \nCompany in April 2003, he set out to increase sales and promote a \npositive view of canned seafood. He began by changing the seafood \nprocessor's name to Look's Gourmet Food Company and redesigning the \nlabels on the cans. Since that time, sales have tripled, and the \ncompany has acquired new equipment to keep up with growing demand. In \naddition, through the community development block grant program, Look's \nhas purchased a warehouse in the nearby former Cutler Navy base \ndedicated to packing and shipping. A business that continues to grow, \nLook's currently employs 21 full-time workers.\n  Look's Gourmet Food Company boasts a line of over 30 products \nincluding: whole Maine lobster meat, Maine cherrystone clams, clam \nchowder, lobster bisque, and clam juice. Look's also cans four \nvarieties of beans, a traditional downeast Maine dessert known as \nIndian pudding, and more recently, has added kippers, herring, and \nmackerel to its seafood repertoire. The company produces small, 60-\ngallon batches of its chowders and bisques, while refusing to use \nadditives or preservatives, rendering an unrivaled product. What makes \nLook's so unique is that it is the last remaining multiproduct food \ncannery in Maine, and one of just three food canneries in the State.\n  Forming unique partnerships, Look's teams up with other local \ncompanies to produce high-quality foods. For instance, Look's has five \ndifferent sauces that it uses when packing its herring fillets, \nincluding one made using products from Raye's Mustard which is made \nlocally in Eastport. Additionally, to bolster another small business, \nLook's gives discarded mussel shells to Artful Wares, a Maine \nenterprise that makes silverware handles from crushed shells, thereby \nreducing waste and ensuring Artful Wares a supply of shells.\n  In listing Look's Gourmet Food on its 5,000 list, Inc. noted that \nLook's is growing due to its use of all-natural ingredients, as well as \nthe sale of products in both specialty and mainstream grocery stores. \nInc. also points to Look's export business to Japan and its desire to \nsell in Europe. This proactive business model has benefitted Look's as \nwell, and the company has certainly earned the recognition it has \nreceived. I congratulate Mike Cote and everyone at Look's Gourmet Food \nfor their exceptional achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11503-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11503-4", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11503-5", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11503-S11504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \nRESPECT TO THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES OF SEPTEMBER 11, \n2001, AS RECEIVED DURING RECESS OF THE SENATE ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2007--PM \n                                   24\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a\n\n[[Page S11504]]\n\nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend the False Claims Act; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for 27 years, I have come to the Senate \nfloor to discuss legislation that will help the Government run \nefficiently and effectively. I have been an outspoken advocate for \nwhistleblowers, which whistleblowers in good faith bring forth \ninformation about waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayers' dollars. I have \nchampioned oversight efforts, and I have spent my time in the Senate \nasking the tough questions of Government bureaucrats in order to expose \nthese problems, particularly problems that have been brought to my \nattention by patriotic whistleblowers.\n  One thing I learned from oversight is that no matter how engaged \nCongress may be, there are not enough hands to find all the waste, \nfraud, and abuse in Government programs. Instead, we have to rely then, \nas I have indicated, on those courageous and patriotic individuals who \nspeak out and blow the whistle, to go to court to collect Government \nmoney that was lost to unscrupulous contractors who are selling false \nor fraudulent goods, in the case of 100 years ago, to Union troops \nbecause that is why the False Claims Act came about, and to make sure \nthat we protect whistleblowers when a program is not working and \ntaxpayers' dollars are being lost.\n  These whistleblowers, by sticking their necks out, are individuals \noften at risk. They risk everything to fix problems within our \nGovernment because they believe in doing their job the way it was \nintended to be done, and they probably do not get the attention of \nhigher-ups in the bureaucracy. That is why they become whistleblowers \nand come to Congress to bring these faults out. Somehow they end up \nbeing as welcome in the bureaucracy as a skunk is at a picnic.\n  However, pointing out fraud is one thing; getting results, fixing the \nproblem, and recouping taxpayers' money lost to fraud, waste, and abuse \nis quite another thing.\n  The key to recouping these lost funds is ensuring that we have \neffective laws on the books. One such law is the Federal False Claims \nAct. I have come to the floor today to remind people about the history \nof the False Claims Act, but also to suggest some improvements in that \nact so it can be an even more useful tool in the fight against waste, \nfraud, abuse, and the protection of whistleblowers.\n  I have referred to the False Claims Act. This is known as the Lincoln \nlaw because it has some history going back to the Civil War. The \nLincoln law was originally passed by Congress to combat war \nprofiteering by Government contractors during the Civil War. The False \nClaims Act allowed individual citizen whistleblowers to go to court to \ncollect Government money that was lost to unscrupulous contractors who \nwere selling false or fraudulent goods to Union troops.\n  This legal mechanism, known as qui tam, a Latin term, is the key \ncomponent to the False Claims Act allowing individual citizens to act \nas private attorneys general to help stop fraud and recover lost money. \nHowever, following World War II, the False Claims Act was weakened by \nan act of Congress which lowered the penalties limiting the money the \nGovernment could recover from fraud. This remained the state and the \nlanguage of the False Claims Act until 1986 when I authored amendments \nto the act which restored teeth and breathed new air and new life into \na law that was designed to protect all American taxpayers.\n  I am happy to report that in the 20 years since I introduced and \nCongress passed the 1986 amendment, the Federal Government has used the \nFalse Claims Act to recover over $20 billion from those who defraud \nGovernment. That is $20 billion that would otherwise be lost and gone \nforever.\n  More importantly, this $20 billion serves as a deterrent reminder to \nthose who wish to steal from the Government. We cannot measure the \ndeterrent value of this legislation, but I personally feel, and I have \nhad students of Government tell me, the deterrent value of the False \nClaims Act is much greater than even the $20 billion that we can \nquantify that has come back to the Federal Treasury.\n  Today, the False Claims Act faces a situation where it may not be as \neffective as intended. Recent decisions by Federal courts have limited \nthe False Claims Act in a way that was not envisioned when I authored \nthe 1986 amendments. These court decisions threaten to undermine both \nthe spirit and intent of the 1986 amendments.\n\n  The first case, U.S. Totten v. Bombardier Corporation, held that \nfalse claims presented to Government grantees, in this case employees \nat Amtrak, were not actually presented to the Federal Government. As a \nresult, the Government was precluded from recovering money lost to \nfraud and abuse perpetuated against Amtrak.\n  The second case, Rockwell International Corporation, et al, v. U.S.,\n\n[[Page S11507]]\n\nwas decided earlier this year by the U.S. Supreme Court. In this case, \nthe Court interpreted an area of the False Claims Act, known as the \npublic disclosure bar, which prohibits a false claims case from moving \nforward if the case is based upon publicly disclosed information, such \nas a government report, unless the whistleblower filing the case was \nthe ``original source'' of the information.\n  Now here, the Supreme Court held that a qui tam whistleblower was \nbarred from receiving a share of any money recovered unless that \nwhistleblower was the original source of all claims ultimately settled. \nNow, I say to my colleagues that this may not sound like a very \ntroublesome decision. However, it is, and the impact is that oftentimes \na case is brought by a whistleblower on a certain set of facts and then \nexpanded by the Department of Justice, which ultimately settles on \nother grounds. As a result, this case creates a disincentive for a \nwhistleblower to bring forth information about fraud, as they may not \nget to share in any part of the recovery.\n  You see, one of the incentives for the whistleblowers is if they \nbring a case that brings back money into the Federal Treasury, they get \npart of that settlement as an incentive to do this. Quite frankly, a \nwhistleblower sticks their neck out. By doing the right thing, they are \nprobably ruining themselves professionally. Let us say that they get \npart of the recovery. Well, the Federal Government gets billions of \ndollars that we would not have even gotten if we had not had the \ninformation from the whistleblower. That is why the whistleblower is \nvery important.\n  Now, there is another case that gives us problems. This third case \nthat challenges the intent of the False Claims Act is United States DRC \nv. Custer Battles, decided a year ago. In that case, a jury found that \na defense contractor in Iraq had defrauded the Government of $10 \nmillion. However, the judge overturned the jury verdict, finding that \nthe money lost was not U.S. taxpayer money but was instead Iraqi money \nunder the control of the U.S. Government. As a result of this case, the \nU.S. Government may not recover for any fraud committed against the \nU.S. Government if the funds are not American funds, even if the U.S. \nGovernment has been entrusted with the management of those funds.\n  These decisions, I can tell you as author of this legislation, are \ncontrary to the spirit and the intent of the 1986 amendments. Today, I \nam joined by Senator Durbin as the lead cosponsor, along with Senator \nLeahy and Senator Specter--and in those two individuals I will say that \nSenator Leahy is chairman of the Judiciary Committee which has \njurisdiction, and Senator Specter is the former chairman of the \ncommittee and now the Ranking Republican--so I feel by having Senator \nDurbin, Senator Leahy, and Senator Specter as cosponsors of this False \nClaims Act Correction Act, as powers within the Senate to bring \nattention to what the courts have done, this injustice to the False \nClaims Act and gutting of the False Claims Act, this act will bring it \nback to its original intent.\n  This legislation will correct judicial interpretations damaging the \nFalse Claims Act. This bill is narrowly tailored to ensure that the \nintent of Congress in the 1986 amendments is upheld and nothing more. \nThe False Claims Act Correction Act will correct these three judicial \ninterpretations in addition to also making technical and correcting \namendments.\n  First, the bill will address the Totten decision by removing the \nrequirement that false claims be directly presented to a government \nofficial, instead tying the liability directly to Government money and \nproperty.\n  Next, the bill will address the Rockwell decision by requiring the \nAttorney General to file a timely motion to dismiss claims that violate \nthe public disclosure bar. By allowing the Attorney General to present \nto the court information about public disclosures upfront in a case, \nthe bill would eliminate procedural uncertainties that exist now by \nallowing public disclosures to be addressed at any time in the case.\n  The False Claims Act Correction Act also clarifies that nontaxpayer \nfunds under the trust and administration of the U.S. Government subject \nto fraud are actionable under the False Claims Act. Thus, money \ndirectly under the control of the U.S. Government subject to fraud that \nare currently outside the scope of the False Claims Act would now be \ncovered. This will correct the problems that have arisen following the \ndecision in the Custer Battles case.\n  Additionally, the bill clarifies a split between the Federal Circuit \nCourts of Appeal that currently exists regarding whether a government \nemployee may file a False Claims Act case. More specifically, the bill \nprovides that a government employee would be able to bring a False \nClaims Act case based upon information learned in the course of their \nemployment, only when the employee: No. 1, discloses the fraud to their \nsupervisors; No. 2, discloses the fraud to the inspector general of \nthat agency; and, No. 3, discloses the fraud to the Attorney General \nand then waits 12 months without the Government acting. After these \nconditions are met, then, and only then, may a government employee act \nas a qui tam whistleblower.\n  Finally, the bill makes two technical corrections to the False Claims \nAct. The first is a technical-correcting amendment that clarifies the \nstatute of limitations. The second is a technical amendment to the \ncivil investigative demands that the Department of Justice is already \nauthorized to issue. These technical corrections will streamline the \nprocedures for filing as well as prosecuting False Claims Act cases by \nboth qui tam whistleblowers as well as cases instituted originally by \nthe Department of Justice.\n  The False Claims Act Correction Act is a narrowly tailored bill that \nseeks to ensure the legislative intent of the 1986 amendments is truly \nunderstood. This is not a Democratic or Republican issue. It is an \nAmerican taxpayer issue. I am proud to say this bill has strong \nbipartisan support, as I am joined by Senator Durbin as the lead \nDemocratic cosponsor, and I wish to emphasize Senator Leahy's and \nSenator Specter's cosponsorship of this legislation.\n  I am glad we have a bipartisan coalition ready to work to fix the \nFalse Claims Act with these narrowly tailored corrections, but I \nencourage my colleagues not to bow to special interest groups who have \nworked to weaken the No. 1 tool for recovering Government dollars lost \nto fraud.\n  I will say at this point that yesterday I had a private discussion \nwith a Senator who will go unnamed. He said, even as corrective as this \nlegislation is, and it is only meant to be correcting, that already we \nhave the pharmaceutical companies out working against this legislation. \nSo this may not be easy to get through, even though it is sticking with \nthe original intent. So I don't want to get into a situation such as I \ndid in 1986, when we wrote a bill that was bipartisan, and it took \nabout a year to get the various holds off that were put on this. In \nthose days, we had secret holds. Under the new rules of the Senate, we \nare not supposed to have any secret holds anymore.\n  So if people have complaints about this legislation, I wish to work \nit out, but I don't know how anybody can hold up legislation where the \nunderlying legislation has brought $20 billion that would have \notherwise been lost to fraud back to the Federal Treasury. The American \ntaxpayers deserve a law that detects, prevents, and recovers money lost \nto fraud. The False Claims Act works and has recovered this $20 \nbillion, and that law is 20 years old. But let me say this money didn't \nstart rolling in until about 6 or 7 years after that 1986 law was \npassed.\n  The False Claims Act Correction Act will provide necessary and \nnarrowly tailored corrections to ensure that the False Claims Act works \nto protect the taxpayers into the future, as I visualized it would in \n1986 in spirit as well as in letter. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n  I have had the pleasure of having the Presiding Officer ask to be a \ncosponsor of the bill, so I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWhitehouse be added as a cosponsor at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. President, I ask unaniumous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11508]]\n\n                                S. 2041\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator \nGrassley in introducing the False Claims Act Correction Act of 2007. \nThis bipartisan legislation takes important steps to modernize and \nstrengthen the Federal False Claims Act and will help protect the \nGovernment and taxpayers from waste, fraud, and abuse of Government \nfunds.\n  During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln saw the need for a \nlaw that would prevent war profiteers and other unscrupulous Government \ncontractors from defrauding the Government and the Nation's taxpayers. \nLincoln urged the passage of legislation that would allow the \nGovernment to seek damages and penalties against perpetrators of fraud, \nand that would permit whistleblowers with information about false or \nfraudulent claims to file qui tam lawsuits on the Government's behalf \nin exchange for a share of the recovered funds. In 1863, Congress \nheeded Lincoln's call and enacted the Federal False Claims Act, FCA, \nwhich became known as ``Lincoln's Law.''\n  Lincoln's Law is still in effect today and it is still much-needed. \nIn recent years, there have been alarming reports of waste, fraud, and \nabuse of Government funds in the Iraq war and reconstruction effort, in \nthe recovery from Hurricane Katrina and other disasters, in military \nand homeland security procurement contracts, and in Federal healthcare \nprograms. We need strong laws that can expose and root out such \nfraudulent practices.\n  The last major update of the FCA took place in 1986, when Senator \nGrassley and Congressman Berman sponsored amendments that revitalized \nthe FCA and its qui tam provisions in response to widespread reports of \ndefense contractor fraud. Since 1986, the Federal Government and qui \ntam relators have worked together to recover over $20 billion in moneys \nthat would otherwise have been lost to fraud, waste or abuse in \nGovernment programs. The recovery of this enormous sum is a victory for \ntaxpayers, and a demonstration of the success of the FCA and its qui \ntam model.\n  It has now been 21 years since the enactment of the 1986 FCA \namendments, and during that time changes in the interpretation of the \nact and in the nature of Government contracting have threatened to \nlimit the FCA's effectiveness. In particular, several recent court \ndecisions have weakened the intent and application of Senator \nGrassley's 1986 amendments to the FCA and have limited the FCA's \nability to reach certain types of fraud and abuse involving Government \nprograms.\n  The False Claims Act Correction Act seeks to correct these court \ndecisions and to ensure the FCA's utility as an effective tool against \nfraud. It does so in several ways.\n  First, the False Claims Act Correction Act clarifies the \n``presentment requirement'' in the FCA. In 2004, the DC Circuit Court \nof Appeals held that liability under the FCA can only be found if the \nallegedly fraudulent claim is ``presented to an officer or employee of \nthe United States Government.'' This interpretation has been used by \ncourts to dismiss a number of FCA cases where abuses of Federal \nGovernment funds were clearly evident but where the false claims were \nsubmitted to grantees or agents of the Federal Government--such as the \nIraq Coalition Provisional Authority--and not directly to Government \nemployees. Our legislation would make clear that FCA imposes liability \nif a person presents a false or fraudulent claim for Federal Government \nmoney or property, and that the claim need not be directly presented to \na Government employee.\n  Our legislation also clarifies the applicability of the FCA's \n``public disclosure bar.'' The FCA currently allows a relator's FCA \ncase to be dismissed if the case is based on information that was \npublicly available at the time of the filing, unless the relator was \nthe ``original source'' of the public information. In its 2007 decision \nin Rockwell Int'l Corp. et al. v. United States, the Supreme Court held \nthat the public disclosure bar prevents a relator from recovering money \nunless the relator was an original source for all the\n\n[[Page S11510]]\n\nclaims that are settled or upon which a verdict is rendered. The \nRockwell holding is troubling because relators often file actions based \non facts which prove to be the tip of the iceberg, and upon further \ninvestigation DOJ discovers more fraud and ends up settling or winning \nthe case on the grounds of the latter fraud.\n  The Rockwell court's interpretation of the public disclosure bar \nmight discourage whistleblowers from filing legitimate FCA cases and \nalerting DOJ to fraud. Our legislation would preclude a relator from \nrecovery under the public disclosure bar only where the relator derived \nknowledge of all essential elements of the claim from public \ndisclosure. Thus, only relators who truly contributed no new \ninformation to the case would be barred.\n  Among its other provisions, the False Claims Act Correction Act \nresolves a split among the Federal circuit courts by allowing a \nGovernment employee to act as a qui tam relator when the employee \nlearns of fraudulent conduct on the job, provided that the employee has \nfirst taken steps to report the fraud internally. Our legislation also \nstrengthens the protections in the FCA for whistleblowers, so that \nwhistleblowers who are Government contractors and agents can receive \nthe same antiretaliation protection as employees of the company \nperpetrating the alleged fraud. Our bill further simplifies the FCA \nstatute of limitations with a clear 10-year standard for all cases, and \nalso makes technical changes to enhance DOJ's usage of the civil \ninvestigative demand process in DOJ investigations of potential FCA \nviolations.\n  The changes that our legislation would make to the FCA are narrowly \ntailored, and are designed to clarify the FCA's scope in keeping with \nthe intent of the authors of the 1986 FCA amendments. I commend Senator \nGrassley, the Senate architect of the 1986 FCA amendments, for his \ndevotion to ensuring the effective functioning of the FCA, and I am \nproud to join him in introducing this legislation to better combat \nwaste, fraud, and abuse of Government programs.\n  In sum, the False Claims Act Correction Act will enhance \nwhistleblowers' ability to shine a light on fraudulent conduct \ninvolving Government funds, and to hold the perpetrators accountable \nthrough legitimate qui tam claims. The bill's reforms will ensure that \nthe FCA can continue to serve as a viable tool for recovering taxpayer \nfunds lost to fraud, waste or abuse. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday will strengthen the legacy of Lincoln's Law, and I am pleased to \nserve as its lead cosponsor. I urge my colleagues to support its \npassage.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to discuss the False \nClaims Act Correction Act of 2007. The False Claims Act was passed by \nCongress in 1863 in order to combat war profiteering during the Civil \nWar. The goal of the law was to encourage individuals to alert the \nGovernment when fraud against the Government was occurring. The statute \ndoes this by providing a portion of the Government's recovery to the \nwhistleblower. This law is as important today, as it was in 1863, \nbecause we still must combat fraud and abuse of Government programs. \nThese amendments ensure that the False Claims Act has not been eroded \nin scope or application.\n  I am cosponsoring the bill offered by the distinguished Senator from \nIowa because Congress needs to clarify its intent that there is \nliability under the False Claims Act for submitting false claims for \nGovernment funds and property--regardless of whether they are submitted \ndirectly to Government agents or are submitted to others who disburse \nGovernment money or property.\n  A defendant may not make a preemptive disclosure that operates to bar \nthe whistleblower or relator from recovering--the only claims that \nshould be barred are those that are true piggyback claims, where the \nrelator was not the original source of the information, and the \nwhistleblower's actions were not the impetus for the recovery.\n  Government employees may be qui tam relators--whistleblowers--and may \nbe awarded a portion of the Government's recovery based on false claims \nif, when the Government employee has learned of fraudulent conduct on \nthe job and has reported it up the chain of command, and then reported \nit to the Office of Inspector General, still no action has been taken \nwithin 12 months.\n  Retaliatory action based on protected activity by whistleblowers is \nprohibited.\n  Federal prosecutors who are investigating False Claim Act complaints \nfiled under seal may share information obtained by Civil Investigative \nDemands, CIDs, with relators.\n  For purposes of the running of the statute of limitations, if the \nGovernment intervenes in a False Claims Act case, the intervention \nrelates back to the date the whistleblower filed suit.\n  Taxpayer dollars must not be wasted or fraudulently paid to \nunscrupulous contractors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Warner, and Mr. \n        Whitehouse):\n  S. 2042. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to conduct activities to rapidly advance treatments for spinal \nmuscular atrophy, neuromuscular disease, and other pediatric diseases, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the SMA \nTreatment Acceleration Act. I also thank my colleagues, Senators \nIsakson, Warner, and Whitehouse, for joining me in sponsoring this \nimportant legislation.\n  In April, I met with Malorie Fox, a beautiful 4-year-old from Ada, \nMichigan, and several other Michigan families about Spinal Muscular \nAtrophy, SMA, the number one genetic killer of children under 2 years \nof age. SMA is a degenerative disease that weakens the body's muscles \nuntil they can no longer function, that includes the ability to \nbreathe.\n  Sadly, Malorie was diagnosed with SMA shortly before her first \nbirthday. Her parents were told by her doctors that most children \ndiagnosed with SMA never reach this milestone. Thankfully, Malorie \nsurvived, and with her parents Michelle and James, she continues to \nfight this disease. On her homepage, Malorie wrote: ``My mommy & daddy \nfocus on the things I CAN do, not those that I cannot.''\n  Malorie and her family are not alone. It is estimated that SMA occurs \nin about 1 in every 6,000 births. Approximately 1 in 40 individuals, \n7.5 million Americans, carry the gene that causes SMA, making it the \nsecond most common autosomal recessive genetic disorder. This incidence \nrate shows neither racial nor gender bias.\n  Presently, there is no known treatment for SMA, though there have \nbeen several exciting research breakthroughs over the past decade. In \nfact, the National Institutes of Health singled out SMA from more than \n600 neurological disorders as the disease closest to treatment based on \nscientists' advanced genetic understanding of the disease. Private \nfoundations and national nonprofit organizations dedicated to finding a \ncure for SMA have also made substantial financial contributions.\n  To support the investigators and families who are working to find a \ntreatment or cure, the SMA community, including Fight SMA, Families of \nSMA, and the SMA Foundation, has united behind this legislation. This \nbill will provide a roadmap and federal funding to better coordinate \nand facilitate SMA research and treatment. Additionally, the \nlegislation will establish a program to provide information and \neducation on SMA to health professionals and the general public related \nto advances in the diagnosis and treatment of SMA and the provision of \ncare to SMA patients.\n  Next Monday is Malorie's birthday, and I couldn't wish for anything \nmore for her birthday than a cure for SMA. This legislation will be an \nimportant step forward in fulfilling that wish. I urge my colleagues to \njoin with us in passing it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation,\n\n                                               September 12, 2007.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: We write to express our strong \n     support for the SMA Treatment Acceleration Act, your \n     bipartisan legislation to help find a treatment or cure for\n\n[[Page S11511]]\n\n     Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), the number one genetic killer \n     of children under the age of two.\n       Our organizations support cutting edge SMA research and \n     represent thousands of families across the country that have \n     been affected by SMA, an inherited disease that destroys the \n     nerves controlling muscle movement, which affects crawling, \n     walking, head and neck control, swallowing, and even \n     breathing. The gene mutation that causes SMA is carried by \n     one in every 40 people, or approximately 7.5 million \n     Americans.\n       These are hopeful times for families affected by Spinal \n     Muscular Atrophy. Researchers have discovered the gene \n     responsible for SMA, opening the door to promising new \n     treatments. SMA was selected by the National Institutes of \n     Health (NIH) as the prototype for an accelerated drug \n     discovery effort, singling out SMA as the disease closest to \n     treatment of more than 600 neurological disorders.\n       In order to build upon the substantial investment made by \n     national non-profit organizations and the progress being made \n     by researchers towards bringing treatments to children \n     affected by SMA, our organizations are united behind the SMA \n     Treatment Acceleration Act. This legislation would authorize \n     critical funding in order to upgrade and unify existing SMA \n     clinical trial sites to establish a clinical trials network \n     for SMA; enhance and provide ongoing support to the existing \n     SMA patient registry; establish an SMA coordinating committee \n     consisting of representatives from relevant government \n     agencies and the public; establish an SMA research \n     collaborative at NIH to ensure cooperation across multiple \n     Institutes; and support efforts to identify barriers to drug \n     development and recommend steps to expand existing industry \n     incentives to promote SMA drug development.\n       We thank you for your leadership in the effort to conquer \n     this terrible disease, and we look forward to working with \n     you to enact this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Cynthia Joyce,\n       SMA Foundation.\n     Kenneth Hobby,\n       Families of SMA.\n     Martha Slay,\n       FightSMA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRYOR (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2045. A bill to reform the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \nprovide greater protection for children's products, to improve the \nscreening of noncompliant consumer products, to improve the \neffectiveness of consumer product recall programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in recent months, the American public has \nbeen faced with a series of high profile recalls of consumer products. \nIn the last 2 months alone, approximately 2 million toys were recalled \nfor violating lead paint standards, and more than 5 million toys were \nrecalled for containing magnets that come loose and create an ingestion \nhazard. The recalls were not limited to toys. Candles, all-terrain \nvehicles, cribs, bunk beds, space heaters, clothes, knives, scuba \nmasks, radios, lamps, and electronic equipment were also recalled.\n  Public outcry and press reports have intensified the focus on the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC, the agency charged with \nmonitoring the safety of these products. What Americans have found is a \nCPSC restrained by the combination of a far-reaching mandate, a \nshrinking staff, and the smallest budget of any federal health and \nsafety agency.\n  This is why I rise today to cosponsor the CPSC Reform Act of 2007, \nintroduced by Senator Mark Pryor. This act is a comprehensive and \naggressive reauthorization bill designed to revitalize the Commission \nand improve consumer safety through stronger consumer protection laws, \nincreased authority, and increased authorization levels necessary for \nthe CPSC to do its job well.\n  To say a CPSC budget and staffing increase is long overdue is a gross \nunderstatement. The last time the CPSC was reauthorized was in 1990. In \norder for the CPSC to complete its mission, it needs steady funding. \nThis is why the CPSC Reform Act officially reauthorizes the Commission \nfor the next 7 years. Beginning with an authorization of $80 million \nfor fiscal year 2009, the funding levels would increase by 10 percent \nper year, culminating at approximately $141.7 million for fiscal year \n2015.\n  Furthermore, to improve CPSC's ability to test consumer products, the \nbill authorizes an additional $20 million for fiscal year 2009 and \nfiscal year 2010 for much needed repair, re-equipping, and upgrading of \nthe CPSC's research, development, and testing facility.\n  The CPSC Reform Act also directs the Commission to increase its \nnumber of full-time employees to at least 500 within the first 5 years, \nreturning the CPSC to staffing levels comparable to those maintained by \nthe Clinton administration. When the CPSC was established in 1973, it \nhad 786 full-time employees responsible for the safety of 10,000 \nconsumer products. Today, the CPSC is responsible for more than 15,000 \nconsumer products--many of which are manufactured overseas. Yet today, \nthe CPSC functions with only 420 full-time employees. This bill takes \ngreat strides in restoring these staffing levels.\n  Additionally, although the CPSC is authorized to have five \nCommissioners, the agency has been operating with only two \nCommissioners since July 2006. The CPSC Reform Act eliminates a 1992 \nlimitation on the use of funds for more than three Commissioners and \nurges the President to appoint a full complement of five Commissioners.\n  Adequate funding and staffing are only the beginning. The CPSC Reform \nAct also strengthens consumer products safety laws.\n  First, the Act increases the maximum per violation civil penalty from \n$8000 to $250,000 and the maximum civil penalty for a related series of \nviolations from $1.825 million to $100 million.\n  Second, the Act strikes the requirement that violators of the \nConsumer Product Safety Act, CPSA, may only be criminally prosecuted \nafter repeated warnings. It also makes a knowing violation of the CPSA \npunishable by up to a 1-year imprisonment and a knowing and willful \nviolation punishable by up to a 5-year imprisonment.\n  The act also goes to the heart of the recent consumer product \nrecalls. It bans the use of lead in children's products and establishes \na maximum level trace amount of lead allowed in such products. It \ndirects manufacturers to label children's products with marks that can \nbe used to identify the source, production date, and other information \nuseful to facilitate a recall.\n  Additionally, the act directs the CPSC to establish a protocol for \nmanufacturers and importers to have independent third party compliance \ncertification for children's consumer products under CPSC jurisdiction. \nFurther, the measure authorizes the CPSC to refer importers found to \nhave committed multiple violations of the CPSA to U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection with the recommendation that the importer's license \nbe revoked.\n  The CPSC is tasked with keeping unsafe and harmful products off our \nstore shelves and out of our homes and the hands of our children. This \nline of defense has grown thin because of a lack of resources, \nstaffing, and authorities. Although the dedicated career staff has \ncontinued to work diligently under trying circumstances and limited \nresources, Congress must act quickly to give them the tools to do their \njob better, so that consumer confidence can be restored.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this comprehensive \nCPSC reauthorization legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 2047. A bill to require enhanced disclosures to consumers \npurchasing flood insurance and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Flood \nInsurance Disclosure Act of 2007. I thank my Minnesota colleague, \nSenator Klobuchar, for her cosponsorship of this bill.\n  Last month, the southeastern part of my State of Minnesota was the \nscene of devastating, historic flooding that claimed seven lives, \ncaused widespread damage to the area's homes, businesses and \ninfrastructure and disrupted the day-to-day lives of countless \nMinnesotans.\n  As I traveled in the flood ravaged areas, I was troubled to hear and \nlearn that only a few residents had flood insurance. Even more \ntroubling were reports that some residents had been told they could not \nget flood insurance.\n  One telling statistic is that in the seven Federally declared \ndisaster counties, which include Olmsted and Winona counties, less than \n1 percent of all households had flood insurance. Certainly we can do \nbetter and must do better.\n\n[[Page S11512]]\n\n  In an effort to increase the number of residents with flood insurance \nand to make sure residents get the information they need about flood \ninsurance, today I am introducing legislation to amend the National \nFlood Insurance Act of 1968 to require insurance companies to disclose \nnoncoverage of flood insurance in homeowner's and renter's policies, as \nwell as the resident's eligibility for flood insurance.\n  The Federal Government long ago recognized the importance of flood \ninsurance and that is why we have the National Flood Insurance Program \nwhich makes available, in partnership with insurance companies, flood \ninsurance to households. At the end of day, flood insurance can serve \nas a financial life saver in flood disasters, while federal disaster \nassistance is, at best, a lifeline.\n  At the end of the day flood insurance is really about an ounce of \nprevention being worth a pound of cure. It is my hope that through this \nlegislation more Minnesotans and Americans will obtain flood insurance \nin order to protect their financial well-being in the event of a flood \ndisaster.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2047\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Flood Insurance Disclosure \n     Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF INSURERS.\n\n       Part A of Chapter II of the National Flood Insurance Act of \n     1968 (42 U.S.C. 4051 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 1337.

A bill for the relief of Jose Buendia Balderas, Alicia \nAranda De Buendia, and Ana Laura Beundia Arandia; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am offering legislation to \nprovide lawful permanent residence status to Jose Buendia Balderas, his \nwife, Alicia Aranda De Buendia, and their daughter, Ana Laura Buendia \nAranda, Mexican nationals who have been living and working in the \nFresno area of California for over 20 years.\n  Jose Buendia is a remarkable individual who epitomizes the American \ndream. His father worked as an agricultural laborer in the Bracero \nprogram over 25 years ago. In 1981, Jose followed his father to the \nU.S., where he worked in the shadows to help provide for his family in \nMexico.\n  Since then, Jose has moved from working as a landscaper to \nconstruction, where he is now a valued employee of Bone Construction in \nReedley, CA. He has been employed by this cement company for the past 8 \nyears. Although he knew nothing about construction when he began \nworking in the field, he was disciplined and persistent in his training \nand is now a lead foreman. His employer, Timothy Bone, says Mr. Buendia \nis a ``reliable, hardworking and conscientious'' employee. In fact, it \nwas Mr. Bone who contacted my office to seek relief for Mr. Buendia.\n  Alicia Buendia, Jose Buendia's wife, has been working as a seasonal \nfruit packer for several years. The family has consistently paid all of \ntheir taxes. Recently, they paid off their mortgage and today, they are \ndebt free. They have health insurance, savings and retirement accounts, \nparticipate in the company profit-sharing company, and support their \nfamily here and in Mexico. In short, they are living the American \ndream.\n  Their daughter, Ana Laura, is an outstanding student. She earned a \n4.0 GPA at Reedley High School and was awarded an academic scholarship \nto the University of California--Berkeley. Unfortunately, because of \nher immigration status, she was unable to accept the scholarship and \nher parents now pay full out-of-State tuition for her to attend the \nUniversity of California--Irvine.\n  Their son, Jose, is a U.S. citizen, and attends Reedley High School. \nFor both Jose and Ana Laura, the U.S. is the only country they know.\n  What makes the story of the Buendias so tragic is that they would \nhave been eligible to correct their illegal status but for the \nunscrupulous practices of their former immigration attorney.\n  Because Mr. Buendia has been in this country for so long, he \nqualified for legalization pursuant to the Immigration and Reform \nControl Act of 1986. Unfortunately, his legalization application was \nnever acted upon because his attorney, Jose Velez, was convicted of \nfraudulently submitting legalization and Special Agricultural Worker \napplications.\n  This criminal conduct tainted all of Mr. Velez's clients. Although \nMr. Buendia's application was found not to contain any fraudulent \ndocumentation associated, it was submitted while his lawyer was under \ninvestigation. The result was that Mr. Buendia was unable to be \ninterviewed and obtain legal status.\n  To complicate matters, it took the Immigration and Naturalization \nService nearly 7 years to determine that Mr. Buendia's application \ncontained no fraudulent information. In the meantime, the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service reinterpreted the law and determined that he \nwas no longer eligible for relief because he had left the U.S. briefly \nwhen he married his wife.\n  Despite these setbacks, the Buendia family has continued to seek \nlegal status. They believed they were successful when an immigration \njudge granted the family relief based on the hardship their U.S. \ncitizen son would face if his family was deported to Mexico. \nUnfortunately, the Government appealed the judge's decision and had it \noverturned by the Board of Immigration Appeals.\n  Despite the problems with adjusting their legal status, this family \nhas forged ahead and continued to play a meaningful role in their \ncommunity. They have worked hard. They have invested in their \nneighborhood. They are active in the PTA and their local church.\n  I believe the Buendia family should be allowed to continue to live in \nthis country that has become their own. If this legislation is \napproved, the Buendias will be able to continue to contribute \nsignificantly to the U.S. It is my hope that Congress passes this \nprivate legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2048\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, when we passed the Children's Health \nInsurance Program a decade ago, we made a promise to working families \nto do more to help them obtain decent health insurance for their \nchildren.

The Senate has passed a \nbipartisan CHIP reauthorization to strengthen the program, bring health \ncare to at least four million more children, and strengthen the \noutreach and funding for the program.\n  CHIP has been a great success for children who obtain its coverage. \nOver the last decade, the percentage of uninsured children has dropped \nfrom 22 percent in 1997 to 13 percent today. And that's in spite of the \nfact that more and more parents have been losing insurance coverage \nthrough their jobs, because employers decide to reduce it or drop it \nentirely. But 9 million children in the United States still lack health \ninsurance because they are not aware of their eligibility for coverage, \nor because eligibility is too restrictive. The CHIP reauthorization \nbill will make a real difference in closing this unacceptable gap so \nthat no parents are faced with the decision of whether they can afford \nto take their sick child to a doctor.\n  The Bush administration, however, is bent on blocking this progress. \nThe Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has issued a new guidance \nthat will make it virtually impossible for States to expand coverage to \nchildren in with household incomes above 250 percent of the Federal \npoverty level. The guidance will be especially disruptive and unfair to \nCHIP coverage in 18 states, including Massachusetts, which now allows \nfor children in families with income levels over 250 percent of \npoverty.\n  No State should be forced to cut health insurance coverage for \nchildren. Once again, the Administration has shown itself to be out of \ntouch and out of step with the priorities of working Americans. The \nAdministration's action denies the promise of good health care to \ncountless children in communities across America.\n  That is why today, along with Senators Smith, Rockefeller and Snowe, \nI am introducing legislation to nullify the new rule from the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services and allow each State to cover \nchildren at the income level that is most appropriate for their State. \nSimply, children in all States should be able to obtain the quality \nhealth care they need in order to grow and thrive. The administration \nshould be ashamed of its cruel attempt to revoke this needed coverage, \nand Congress should not allow the new rule to stand.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, The \nBetter Health for America's Children Act,'' with my esteemed colleague \nSenator Edward Kennedy that will serve to block implementation of the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, guidance issued on \nAugust 17, 2007, which negatively impacts the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, SCHIP. I also am pleased to be joined by fellow \nFinance Committee members Senator Rockefeller and Senator Snowe as we \nintroduce this important bill.\n  If allowed to go forward, this new policy will have a devastating \nimpact on our Nation's children's access to affordable health care \ncoverage. The guidance, as set out in the August 17 letter to State \nHealth Officials, sets unrealistic standards that will serve only to \nprevent States from covering children with incomes above 250 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level, FPL, under SCHIP. While the agency has \nstated that it simply is trying to preserve coverage for low-income \nchildren, this policy will impede a State's ability to expand health \ninsurance to children whose family income is above $42,925 for a family \nof three. With health care costs increasingly being priced out of \nworking families' reach, this income limit is unrealistic. In July \n2007, the U.S. Senate recognized this when it passed a bipartisan bill \nthat would allow States to cover children with family incomes up to 300 \npercent FPL under SCHIP.\n  As the recently released census data shows, the number of uninsured \nchildren grew to 9 million in 2006. The administration should be \nworking with the U.S. Senate to reauthorize SCHIP and deliver to States \nthe tools they need to enroll the 6 million children who are eligible \nfor SCHIP but not enrolled. It shouldn't be wasting resources on \nputting up roadblocks intended to prevent coverage.\n  I hope that the Senate can work together to advance this bipartisan \nproposal to ensure that the SCHIP program remains strong and low-income \nchildren have access the health care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN:\n  S. 2050. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \neliminate the five-month waiting period in the disability insurance \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Social Security \nAct Improvements for the Terminally Ill Act. This is a critical and \nlong overdue piece of legislation and I urge my colleagues to give it \ndue consideration and, ultimately, support.\n  In the Senate, we are accustomed to making tough decisions on \npressing issues that have a direct impact on the lives of Americans. \nBut few issues are both as urgent and as uncomplicated as the one now \npresent to the Chamber.\n  This bill would waive the 5-month waiting period in the Social \nSecurity disability program for terminally ill patients--thus allowing \nthose with just months to live to receive the Federal benefits they \ndeserve. None of our fellow citizens should have to spend their last \ndays haggling with the Federal Government for benefits that can help \nease the financial burden associated with palliative care, death, and \nburial. Specifically, this bill would authorize disability benefits for \nany eligible individual whose disability is expected to or does result \nin the patient's death before the end of the current 5-month waiting \nperiod.\n  This commonsense reform would grant justice to those, like Ohioan Mr. \nArthur Woolweaver, Jr., who are being effectively ``waited out'' by the \nGovernment. Even though Mr. Woolweaver had worked and contributed to \nSocial Security all his life and even though his disability due to \ncancer was easily verified by the Social Security Administration, he \nwas still forced to wait . . . and wait . . . and wait. Unfortunately, \nit is now too late for Mr. Woolweaver, who passed away on June 12 of \nthis year. Ultimately, Mr. Woolweaver was still waiting for his \nbenefits, which would have totaled $1,800 per month, when he died this \nsummer. This money could have helped Mr. Woolweaver's wife keep their \nhouse in Cuyahoga Falls, OH.\n  Like it or not, the Federal Government is often viewed as a faceless \nand heartless bureaucracy. This bill offers a chance to take a small \nstep to change that image and restore faith in the system. I think I \nspeak for most Americans when I say that I want my Government to be \nresponsive, logical, and\n\n[[Page S11514]]\n\ncompassionate. This bill seeks to achieve that ideal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11514-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 318--SUPPORTING THE WE DON'T SERVE TEENS CAMPAIGN\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Pryor) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

One \n     such collaboration is occurring in Augusta, Georgia, between \n     the Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center at Fort Gordon, \n     the Augusta Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, \n     the Medical College of Georgia, and local health care \n     providers under the TRICARE program.\n       (2) Medical staff from the Dwight D. Eisenhower Army \n     Medical Center and the Augusta Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Medical Center have been meeting weekly to discuss future \n     patient cases for the Active Duty Rehabilitation Unit (ADRU) \n     within the Uptown Department of Veterans Affairs facility. \n     The Active Duty Rehabilitation Unit, along with the \n     Polytrauma Centers of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     provide rehabilitation for members of the Armed Forces on \n     active duty.\n       (3) Since 2004, 1,037 soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \n     marines have received rehabilitation services at the Active \n     Duty Rehabilitation Unit, 32 percent of whom served in \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom.\n       (4) The Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center and the \n     Augusta Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center have \n     combined their neurosurgery programs and have coordinated on \n     critical brain injury and psychiatric care.\n       (5) The Department of Defense, the Army, and the Army \n     Medical Command have recognized the need for expanded \n     behavioral health care services for members of the Armed \n     Forces returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation \n     Enduring Freedom. These services are currently being provided \n     by the Dwight D.

Res. 318\n\n       Whereas the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health \n     estimates there are 11,000,000 underage alcoholic beverage \n     drinkers in the United States;\n       Whereas research shows that young people who start drinking \n     alcoholic beverages before the age of 15 are 4 times more \n     likely to develop an alcohol-related disorder later in life;\n       Whereas surveys show that 17 percent of 8th graders, 33 \n     percent of high school sophomores, and 47 percent of high \n     school seniors report recent drinking;\n       Whereas, in a 2003 survey of drinkers ages 10 to 18, 65 \n     percent said they got the alcohol from family members or \n     friends--some took alcohol from their own home or a friend's \n     home without permission, and in other cases adults, siblings, \n     or friends provided the alcohol;\n       Whereas the Surgeon General issued a national Call to \n     Action against underage drinking in March 2007, asking \n     Americans to do more to stop current underage drinkers from \n     using alcohol and to keep other young people from starting;\n       Whereas the Leadership to Keep Children Alcohol Free \n     initiative is a coalition of Governors' spouses, Federal \n     agencies, and public and private organizations which \n     specifically targets prevention of drinking in the 9- to 15- \n     year-old age group;\n       Whereas the National Alliance to Prevent Underage Drinking \n     is a coalition of public health, law enforcement, religious, \n     treatment and prevention, and other organizations with the \n     goal of supporting and promoting implementation of a \n     comprehensive strategy to reduce underage drinking;\n       Whereas the best protections against underage drinking are \n     comprehensive prevention and enforcement strategies that \n     include educating parents and members of the community;\n       Whereas beverage alcohol is a unique product and is \n     regulated in such a way as to encourage social \n     responsibility;\n       Whereas parents should be encouraged to talk to their \n     children about the dangers of underage drinking;\n       Whereas the goal of the We Don't Serve Teens campaign is to \n     educate parents and community leaders about effective ways of \n     reducing underage drinking;\n       Whereas the We Don't Serve Teens campaign seeks to unite \n     State officials, business leaders, parents, and community \n     leaders in fighting underage drinking;\n\n[[Page S11518]]\n\n       Whereas the Federal Trade Commission has partnered with \n     other Government entities, members of the beverage alcohol \n     industry, and members of the advocacy community to educate \n     the public on the dangers of underage drinking;\n       Whereas the Federal Trade Commission has created an \n     Internet website, www.dontserveteens.gov, as a resource for \n     parents, educators, and community leaders concerned with \n     underage drinking;\n       Whereas Congress has demonstrated its commitment to the \n     prevention of underage drinking by enacting the Sober Truth \n     on Preventing Underage Drinking Act (STOP), which recognizes \n     that the 3-tier system of manufacturer, wholesaler, and \n     retailer and continued State regulation of the sale and \n     distribution of alcohol are critical to preventing access to \n     alcohol by persons under 21 years of age; and\n       Whereas the We Don't Serve Teens campaign recognizes that \n     all 3 tiers of the beverage alcohol industry play a key role \n     in the prevention of underage drinking, and unites all of \n     those participants in a concerted effort to protect America's \n     youth: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of campaigns working to \n     prevent underage drinking, including the We Don't Serve Teens \n     campaign;\n       (2) recognizes September 10-15, 2007, as ``National We \n     Don't Serve Teens Week'';\n       (3) encourages people across the Nation to take advantage \n     of the wealth of information that can be used to combat \n     underage drinking; and\n       (4) commends the leadership and continuing efforts of all \n     groups working to reduce underage drinking, including State \n     and local officials, the Federal Trade Commission, community \n     groups, public health organizations, law enforcement, and the \n     beverage alcohol industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/12/senate-section/article/S11518-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 14 AND MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.
