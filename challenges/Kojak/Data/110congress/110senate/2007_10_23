Mr. President, normally the majority leader would \nproceed first. Since he is not on the floor at the moment, I wish to \nmake a few remarks on leader time here as we get started.\n  I rise today in honor of the 241 U.S. marines, sailors, and soldiers \nwho were killed in a despicable suicide bombing attack on the U.S. \nMarine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon. That attack occurred 24 years ago \ntoday on October 23, 1983.\n  President Ronald Reagan had dispatched U.S. forces in 1982 to \nmaintain the peace in Lebanon. On the morning of October 23, one \nLebanese terrorist drove a truck packed with explosives through three \nguard posts and a barbed-wire fence, straight into the lobby of the \nU.S. Marine Corps' headquarters. The bomb exploded with the force of \n18,000 pounds of dynamite. It transformed the four-story cinder block \nbuilding into rubble.\n  It was so powerful, the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia later described it as ``the largest non- nuclear explosion \nthat had ever been detonated on the face of the Earth.''\n  Some of the men and women lost that day were murdered in their sleep. \nOthers who saw the truck come crashing in may have seen the face of the \nenemy as their last sight on Earth. Either way, 241 Americans wearing \ntheir country's uniform were killed in a brutal attack that shocked \nAmerica and the world.\n  Five Kentuckians were among the 241 who died in that attack. They \nwere: PFC Sidney James Decker, U.S. Marine Corps, of Clarkson, KY; LCpl \nVirgil D. Hamilton, U.S. Marine Corps, of McDowell, KY; Hospital \nCorpsman 3rd Class Robert S. Holland, U.S. Navy, of Gilbertsville, KY; \nSGT Thomas C. Keown, U.S. Marine Corps, of Louisville, KY; and SGT \nDaniel S. Kluck, U.S. Army, of Owensboro, KY.\n  Terrorists and their favorite tactic--the suicide attack--are still \nwith us today. Thankfully for America, so are the U.S. Marines.\n  Founded in 1775, the U.S. Marine Corps has been ``at the tip of the \nspear'' in every one of this Nation's wars, and they will never be \nstopped by a terrorist's suicide attack. This November, the country \nwill celebrate the Corps' 232nd birthday, and thank them for defending \nour freedoms.\n  By taking the fight to the terrorists wherever they hide, the Marines \nhave put terrorists on the defensive, making it less likely they will \nhit us again here at home. By their courage on the battlefield and \nconstant risk of danger, today's Marines honor every one of their \nforebears who died defending our country.\n\n[[Page S13206]]\n\n  America still remembers her brave men and women lost in the Marine \nbarracks bombing of 1983. We honor them and their families for their \nsacrifice. We continue to fight terror today with a steady hand, even \nif it is at times paired with a heavy heart. And we are proud of the \nbrave men and women who fight for their country against the would-be \nterrorists of today and tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/23/senate-section/article/S13206-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I will repeat it for the benefit of Senators.\n  Senators should be aware that we will now start a series of debates \nand we will stack the votes.

At the end of all of that time, the Senate will \nproceed to vote on and in relation to those amendments.\n  We are ready for the amendment of the Senator from Wyoming as soon as \nhe arrives, and he is here.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3437 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3437.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3437.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3437\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to modify certain HIV/AIDS \n                           funding formulas)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     funds shall be made available under this Act to modify the \n     HIV/AIDS funding formulas under title XXVI of the Public \n     Health Service Act.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, at the present time, the last numbers that I \nsaw, Congress's approval rating was 12 percent. There is a reason for \nthat. We have been nibbling around the edges on a lot of things, and we \nhave been doing earmarks. I have an amendment that deals with one of \nthe most egregious earmarks I have seen.\n  Less than a year ago we passed a bill in this body unanimously, that \nthe House then passed unanimously, that addressed the Ryan White AIDS \nprogram, and it included transparency, it included accountability, and \nit included a change in the formula. The change in the formula gave \nsome protection to those who have had a declining population, but it \nallowed the money to follow the people who had the problem.\n  Today, in this bill, there is an earmark that provides for money now \nto go to people who may no longer even exist--people who are dead. It \nis a way that they are trying to change the authorization process we \nwent through so meticulously, so unanimously, in such a way that it \nundoes it in an appropriations bill. We shouldn't be changing law in an \nappropriations bill. We especially shouldn't be changing law for a \nspecific area of the country in an appropriations bill. That is why I \nbring this amendment.\n  I want to discuss the Ryan White program and the need to ensure that \nthis Labor-HHS bill does not undo our recent work. Last December, after \nmonths of negotiations, the House and the Senate passed a new 3-year \nRyan White reauthorization. Most importantly, we ensured that those new \nformulas focused on the lifesaving treatment by including individuals \nwith HIV, not just AIDS.\n  One of the key items that delayed this reauthorization for months was \nthe careful negotiations surrounding the funding formulas. In that \nbipartisan, bicameral agreement, we were very clear about the \nimplications of those new formula changes. We provided GAO data runs \nthat were nearly identical to how the funding has been distributed. I \nhope everybody takes a look at those GAO data runs.\n  Those funding formulas also included hold-harmless provisions to \nensure the formula funding would not decrease by more than 5 percent \nfrom the previous year. While I would have preferred no hold-harmless \nprovisions or ones that allowed for more dramatic fluctuations so the \nmoney could follow the HIV-infected person, that was what we agreed \nupon a few short months ago.\n  We didn't pull the wool over anyone's eyes; we provided clear \ninformation about the implications about those funding formulas. Now, \nwith one simple pen stroke, the House majority would like to undo all \nof those carefully crafted, bipartisan, bicameral compromises and \ninsert a new hold-harmless provision with little thought to how this \nchange will affect others. I am pleased to note that the Senate did not \ninclude this egregious provision, and I hope today the Senate will go \non record for opposing doing so.\n  What is even more ridiculous is that this provision primarily \nbenefits San Francisco, a city that continues to receive funding to \ncare for dead people. San Francisco received two-thirds of the $9 \nmillion available, racking up $6 million of new dollars. All the while, \nnearly every other city would have reduced funding just so San \nFrancisco can receive more riches. That additional $6 million is not \nbased on the number of people they are treating or on how many new \ncases they have. As a hold-harmless provision, it is related to what \nthat city has received before.\n\n[[Page S13207]]\n\n  As GAO noted in the report last month, even within their current \nfunding, they are receiving money for people who have died. Let me \nrepeat that. GAO, the Government Accountability Office, confirmed that \nSan Francisco currently receives funding under Ryan White for dead \npeople. That is without this additional $6 million earmark. Now, I \ndon't know about my colleagues, but I find this a little reprehensible. \nWhere I come from, that is called cheating. This is patently unfair to \nthose cities and States that are striving to come up with the moneys \nfor basic HIV/AIDS treatment.\n  House Democrats reneged on a bipartisan, bicameral solution and are \ntrying to slide this authorizing legislation into an appropriations \nbill, hoping no one will notice. Well, I noticed. I object to this \nprovision and the implications of it. Rather than providing nearly $10 \nmillion to help those cities that don't need it, why aren't we \nproviding funds to those cities with large numbers of people with HIV?\n  So I offer my amendment to Labor-HHS, Enzi amendment No. 3437. This \namendment is quite simple. It states that the Labor-HHS bill cannot be \nused to undo all of the work we did on Ryan White. We should not be \ndiverting key funds from cities with rising HIV cases to go to San \nFrancisco--a city that is still receiving funds for treating people who \nhave already died from AIDS. If you support keeping people alive, I \nbelieve you should also support my amendment. We did last December. We \nshould again. We need to keep it on track to take care of the problem.\n  I yield some time to my fellow Senator from Oklahoma, such time as he \nwould like.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments about what \nis in the bill and what is going to happen if we don't accept Senator \nEnzi's amendment.\n  When we crafted the Ryan White Act, the goal was to make sure the \ndollars followed the disease and to make sure people who were infected \nwith HIV who had no other means of seeking treatment and having a life \nthat is not the scourge of this disease with the modern medicines that \nhave come about, to create a platform where we could have fair \navailability for medicines and treatment and care to where the disease \nis growing.\n  What has come out of the House, with Speaker Pelosi's direction, is \nto actually take money from African-American women and the medicines \nthey need to stay alive, or medicines to treat their newborn infants, \nand send it to San Francisco, which in the last few years has not even \nspent the entire amount of money that has gone to it.\n  Senator Enzi is right in the fact that this violates the very \nagreement we made over a long period of time to get Ryan White funds to \nstart following the disease. By taking an extra $6.2 million and \nsending it to San Francisco, it violates, No. 1, the agreement on that \nbill, but most importantly, it takes away the opportunity for health \nfor minority women, which is where the disease is growing the greatest \namount. We have all these women throughout the country who have been on \nwaiting lists for drugs for treatment. They are getting some, but they \nare not getting what is going to save their lives. And we are going to \nsteal that opportunity for minority women to be adequately and fairly \ntreated under this bill.\n  The Ryan White bill we passed last year was a good compromise, \nknowing that we needed to shift money to where the disease is. What \nhappened in the House bill is we have actually reneged on that \ncommitment. What we are actually saying is that the establishment age \ngroups in northern California deserve more money than a single African-\nAmerican woman who was infected with HIV and cannot get the medicines \nto treat her disease. That is the choice.\n  For the first time, the Ryan White Act changed the direction of where \nthe money went. The Ryan White Act, as we passed it, had the money \nfollowing the disease, going to those who need treatment rather than to \nestablished organizations that are used to a certain budget. So the \ntragedy will be that if we don't pass the Enzi amendment, we are taking \na step backward from the very principle--a public health principle, by \nthe way--that you put the money where the epidemic is. What is in the \nHouse bill negates that.\n  What we are doing is playing politics with the lives of African-\nAmerican women, who are the fastest growing numbers of people who have \nHIV in this country. We are taking $6.2 million away from them and we \nare putting it in facilities that, quite frankly, have done quite well \nunder the Ryan White Act. The availability, the access, and the \nprograms are at the greatest level in San Francisco as compared to any \nother place in this country. Yet we choose, if we do not accept the \nEnzi amendment, to say that is a higher priority than a poor African-\nAmerican woman in the South. That is the choice.\n  I support this amendment. I think the Senate, in good conscience, \nought to live up to its agreement on the Ryan White Act.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Enzi \namendment. I congratulate the chairman and the ranking member for the \nwork they have done on this bill. But this amendment significantly \ndisadvantages at least nine jurisdictions facing HIV/AIDS crises \nthroughout the country because it essentially would prevent any stop-\nloss provision enacted by the House from going into effect.\n  Senator Enzi, Senator Kennedy, and the rest of the HELP Committee \nworked tirelessly for most of last year to reauthorize the Ryan White \nCARE Act. I voted for this reauthorization, and I recognized at the \ntime that the method of counting HIV/AIDS victims had to change to more \nclearly reflect living victims. However, this then mandated huge cuts \nto vital programs, despite the fact that States and eligible \nmetropolitan areas were assured that no jurisdiction would face \ndestabilizing losses.\n  The HELP Committee staff provided GAO data during the debate \nprojecting that San Francisco would receive approximately $17.1 million \nin fiscal year 2007. But San Francisco did not receive that amount. \nTheir formula award totaled $14.6 million, which is $2.5 million less \nthan estimated.\n  A compromise was to offset losses by clearly making available \nsupplemental award funding so that the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration could consider the funding losses when awarding this \nsupplemental funding. This amendment seeks to do away with all of this.\n  Despite these estimates and built-in protection, several areas of the \ncountry received significant funding cuts when the 2007 awards were \nannounced earlier this year.\n  The San Francisco eligible metropolitan areas, which also include \nMarin and San Mateo Counties, lost approximately $8.5 million. That is \njust those three counties--an $8.5 million loss. This accounts for 30 \npercent of the Ryan White funding--a loss too great for any \njurisdiction to absorb in 1 year.\n  It didn't surprise me when San Francisco lost money in 2007. The city \nknew it would likely face losses. But the protections put in place \nclearly were not adequate. The loss of one-third of total funding is \nclearly destabilizing. To be very candid with you, I find it highly \nobjectionable.\n  This isn't only unique for San Francisco. Five other cities also lost \n20 percent or more of their funding: Hartford, CT, 32.1 percent; New \nHaven, CT, 23.7 percent; Nassau-Suffolk County, NY, 21.7 percent; \nPonce, Puerto Rico, 28.9 percent; Caguas, Puerto Rico, 34.3 percent.\n  No jurisdiction can absorb cuts of this magnitude in 1 year without \nsignificant harm to those they serve. To address this, the House of \nRepresentatives included a stop-loss provision to cap the losses faced \nby these jurisdictions in their version of the fiscal year 2008 Labor-\nHHS appropriations bill. This provision limits the fiscal year 2007 \nlosses for eligible metropolitan areas, or EMAs, to 8.4 percent--not 30 \npercent but 8.4 percent--which is a manageable amount. Transitional \ngrant areas will have their losses capped at 13.4 percent.\n  So there is a willingness to respond to the mandate; that is, change \nyour method of counting and, secondly, absorb reasonable cuts. I don't \nthink that\n\n[[Page S13208]]\n\nis too much to ask. I think this is overkill.\n  I was the mayor who first found AIDS, and I can take you back to 1981 \nand I can tell you what it was like. You won't like it. What I tried to \ndo in the task force of the Conference of Mayors was to bring mayors \ninto the modern day. San Francisco essentially led the Nation in the \nfight against AIDS. I think to have to take a 30-percent cut, when we \nare seeing some regeneration of AIDS, is a terrible mistake.\n  Senator Enzi's amendment could nullify the House's solution. Let me \nbe clear. Under the House language, San Francisco would still lose \n$2.3 million. All of the cities will still face significant cuts. This \nprovision is designed not to stop all reductions but to limit them to a \nlevel that can be absorbed in 1 year. The House provided funding for \nthe stop-loss on top of a $23 million increase for part A of the Ryan \nWhite CARE Act. So virtually every area across the country sees an \nincrease in funding. But these areas take a dramatic 30-percent cut in \nfunding. I don't think that is right, and I don't believe we should \naccept it.\n\n  The Government Accountability Office examined the impact this stop-\nloss provision would have on jurisdictions in 2008. In addition to \nbenefiting the 11 jurisdictions whose cuts are reduced, the House bill \nresults in increased funding for 42 of the remaining 45 jurisdictions. \nThe very minor cuts projected in the remaining three jurisdictions are \nless than one-tenth of 1 percent. A reduction of 30-percent is simply \nnot manageable.\n  The provision makes no changes to the underlying reauthorization. It \ndoesn't prevent it from moving forward at all. It caps the total losses \nfaced by any jurisdiction in fiscal year 2007 with a one-time solution. \nIt doesn't reopen the reauthorization so carefully crafted by Senators \nKennedy and Enzi and their committee.\n  The epidemic, as I mentioned, is far from over in San Francisco. AIDS \ncontinues to be the second leading cause of premature death in the city \nand counting. Nearly 23,000 people are currently living with HIV/AIDS \nin San Francisco, which is more than at any point in the epidemic. \nListen to that--nearly 23,000 people in San Francisco are living with \nHIV now, and that is more than at any point during the epidemic. In \naddition, the population of San Francisco living with HIV/AIDS is \nincreasingly impoverished, homeless, and struggling. Many have serious \nmedical needs.\n  About 2 weeks ago, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that San \nFrancisco doctors diagnosed 15 HIV patients with Kaposi sarcoma. That \nis a form of cancer commonly found in patients early in the epidemic \nbut had become rare.\n  I will never forget, in a staff meeting I had with department heads \nback in 1981, when the director of public health said: Madam Mayor, \nsomething is happening. We are finding patients with large purple \nlesions all over their bodies, and we don't know what it is.\n  His name is Merv Silverman. I said: Merv, find out what it is and \ncome back and tell me.\n  Three weeks later, they came back, and it was the discovery for the \nfirst time of AIDS in this country. So I feel very sensitive about it. \nI started the first AIDS program in the Nation. We funded it with \nproperty tax dollars. That is how we became a leader in the area.\n  To take a 30-percent cut when we have the largest number of HIV/AIDS \nvictims in our history in the city, to me, is discriminatory, \nwrongheaded, and it need not happen. So I very much hope this body will \nrespond.\n  I understand Senator Enzi wants to protect the reauthorization and \nthe funding formula he authored, but I think we have to admit that the \nimpact on some areas of the country was not anticipated. Fixing these \nunintended consequences does not require reopening the legislation. It \ncan be addressed with a one-time solution that will still leave some \ncities with a decline in funds; that means the House solution of stop-\nloss.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the Enzi amendment, which \nwould strike a dastardly blow to a city that has seen too much \nsuffering, as well as others.\n  I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of points.\n  I know this is a large step down for San Francisco EMA and a smaller \nstep down for some of the others. But the thing that needs to be kept \nin mind is the amount of dollars spent per HIV patient in those areas \nis 2\\1/2\\ times what the average is around the rest of the country--\n2\\1/2\\ times. We spend 2\\1/2\\ times more per HIV case in those areas \nthan we do in North Carolina or Florida or Mississippi or Michigan or \nKansas or Texas or Arizona. So what we are talking about is \nproportionality; giving the same opportunities to everybody who has \nHIV, not more opportunities.\n  So with the 30-percent cut, you are still going to be spending 1\\1/2\\ \nto 1\\3/4\\ times more per HIV case in San Francisco as you are in the \nrest of the country. So I appreciate the work of the Senator in the HIV \narea, which is exemplary, and I understand she would want to protect \nthis, but it is not fair to the rest of the country. It is not fair to \ntell somebody that you are going to spend 2\\1/2\\ times as much on \nsomebody with HIV in San Francisco as you are in Dallas, TX, or Miami, \nFL. That is what this amendment is about--keeping the fairness that was \nin the Ryan White Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I don't think it is fair to take a 30-\npercent cut in 1 year when you have the largest number of HIV/AIDS \nvictims in the history of the epidemic in a city that has suffered such \nas no other city in America. I am not saying there shouldn't be cuts. I \nvoted for the reauthorization knowing there would be cuts. What I am \ntalking about is the level of cuts and the way these cuts fall because \nthey decimate programs in an area that was ground zero on AIDS in the \nUnited States.\n  If you are going to take cuts, take those cuts so the communities \ninvolved in fighting HIV with prevention, with education, with care, \nwith treatment, with drugs, with all of it, can essentially meet the \nmandate, which is to prevent the suffering of AIDS in HIV patients and \nalso to prevent the disease from spreading. That is not easy to do, I \ncan tell you that firsthand.\n  You take a 30-percent cut in 1 year and you decimate these programs. \nThat is why the House put the stop-loss in. Take a moderate cut, and we \nwill stand up like men and women and we will take that cut. Take a \nthird cut and it is much more difficult and you affect services to \npeople. That is all I am saying.\n  So I would very much hope the Senate would understand the need and \nthe compassion to defeat this amendment and, once again, I would urge a \n``no'' vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, before we passed the legislation, there were \nwaiting lines in many of the States in this country, lines of people \nwaiting to get treatment and care for AIDS. I am pleased to let you \nknow there are no waiting lines today. No waiting lines anywhere--not \nin San Francisco, not in Connecticut, not in New Jersey or in New York.\n  There has been a cut. The cut is guaranteed to be no more than 5 \npercent under the formula. Now, there has always been supplemental \nmoney besides the formula. We did not guarantee the supplemental money. \nThe supplemental money was never guaranteed. And if there are larger \ncuts, it comes out of the supplemental money, not the formula. So I \ncertainly hope we don't change the formula under the appropriations \nbill instead of through the proper process, which is authorization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the Department of Health and Human Services in North \nCarolina with some very pertinent quotes.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         North Carolina Department\n\n\n                                 of Health and Human Services,\n\n                                                 October 15, 2007.\n     Hon. Michael Enzi,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: Thanks to your leadership on the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), \n     Congress took an important step last year and\n\n[[Page S13209]]\n\n     modernized the Ryan White CARE Act (RWCA). You and many of \n     your congressional colleagues--both Democrats and \n     Republicans--took a principled stance in order to ensure that \n     patients in need, no matter where they live, can access basic \n     medical services to treat and prevent HIV.\n       The new Ryan White program funding is having a profound \n     impact in North Carolina. The increase in North Carolina's \n     AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) eligibility from 125% to \n     250% over the past two years is the direct result of your \n     legislative initiative, resources provided by the new Ryan \n     White funding and new state investments. The increased \n     eligibility levels will result in approximately 600-750 new \n     North Carolinians having access to ADAP services. The reforms \n     you championed are making a crucial difference in the lives \n     of people living with HIV.\n       Unfortunately, an effort is underway in the Congress to \n     modify the original intent of the reauthorization--that \n     funding would be based on demonstrated need. As you are \n     aware, according to a Health Resources Services Agency \n     document and the newly-released GAO report that you and your \n     colleagues requested, the impact of the House-passed version \n     of the FY2008 Labor-HHS Appropriations bill that would cap \n     losses for certain EMAs would result in decreased funding for \n     states that would have otherwise received new funding based \n     on higher incidence of HIV.\n       As a direct result of your efforts last year, North \n     Carolina and other parts of the country that have been hit \n     hardest by new HIV cases now have a fighting chance to \n     effectively increase HIV screening, link infected individuals \n     to care and reduce the number of HIV infections reported from \n     year-to-year. If this attempt to undermine the basic premise \n     of the landmark Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization \n     Act of 2006 is successful, CARE Act funding will be diverted \n     from regions of the country that are most in need of federal \n     assistance. Unless the harmful provision in the \n     appropriations legislation is eliminated, I am gravely \n     concerned for patients who are in desperate need of \n     lifesaving medical care, individuals who will be newly \n     infected because their partners did not have access to CARE \n     Act services and ultimately, the future prospects of \n     addressing the HIV epidemic in North Carolina and throughout \n     the country.\n       Thank you for your leadership on the Health Subcommittee, \n     and thank you for your attention to this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Evelyn Foust,\n                                              State AIDS Director.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I reserve my \nremaining time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in listening to this debate and having \nreceived a letter from the Speaker, the concerns I have are whether \nthere was a disproportionate share going to some localities in \nCalifornia.\n  If I could direct a question to the Senator from California: What is \nyour response to the concerns raised by the Senator from Wyoming that \nthe formula was settled last year and that this, in effect, reopens the \nformula and is going to direct funds to areas in your State where those \nfunds could be directed to the same serious problem which Pennsylvania \nhas in our big cities--Pittsburgh and Philadelphia?\n  If you could first respond on the issue as to whether the formula was \nresolved last year.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Through the Chair, Mr. President, if I may, to the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, first of all, it is my \nknowledge that the cut to San Francisco and to 11 other jurisdictions \nis very large. With respect to the reauthorization of Ryan White, we do \nnot agree that it applies only to the fiscal year 2007 cuts. It takes \nresources, actually, from other jurisdictions. The Pelosi fix in the \nHouse ensures a significant increase for title I that would both reduce \ncuts to a manageable level for 11 jurisdictions and still increase for \nother jurisdictions. So this isn't taking money away from other \njurisdictions, as I understand it. The provisions in the House bill \nincreases funding for 42 of the remaining 45 jurisdictions under title \nI.\n  Now, I don't know the particulars, to be candid with you, of how \nthese cuts fell, but I do know the cut received in the Bay Area was \nsubstantial. I suspect it was from the way they counted AIDS cases, and \nthey knew they had to change the methodology. But basically the point \nis the cut is substantially large and means you have to cut 30 percent \nacross the board of AIDS programs at a time when San Francisco has the \nlargest number of HIV/AIDS cases in its history--23,000.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time to the Senator? The \ntime is controlled by the Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from \nCalifornia. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I ask how much additional time I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. A minute 10.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. A minute 10. I am not sure I should yield it to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is up to the Senator. I am not decided on how I am \ngoing to vote, so you have to decide that question and I will decide--\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I beg your pardon? Whose side did you say?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am considering it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Oh. Then I will yield. If the mind is open, I am \nhappy to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I know it is unsenatorial to say that, but I haven't \nmade up my mind.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I was listening to the Senator from Wyoming and the \nSenator from California and trying to figure it out. I don't want to be \ntoo unsenatorial, to think about it, but that is where I am.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be happy to yield my remaining minute to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The problem is one of enormous seriousness, and it is \nvery difficult to find the funding with what we have allocated on our \ndiscretionary spending. In a context where some $36 million is being \nadded in the House bill and some $6 million has been allocated to San \nFrancisco in the House bill--and I am very sympathetic to San \nFrancisco's problem and I understand the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia was mayor of San Francisco and it is within the district of \nthe Speaker of the House, so I understand their interest there--what I \nam trying to evaluate is whether there is undue funding going because \nof the prominence of the advocates of the position by the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  I think I understand it now and I will weigh and consider it. I thank \nthe Senator from California for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Time is yielded back.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement \nentered into last night, I believe the Senator from South Carolina \nwould be recognized next for amendment No. 3387, with 20 minutes of \ndebate equally divided.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nthe consideration of the Roberts amendment first, and then we would, \nafter the disposal of the Roberts amendment, then proceed to the DeMint \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? The chair hears \nnone, and it is so ordered.\n  The Roberts amendment has been proposed and is now pending. The \nSenator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3365\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Roberts \namendment, No. 3365, to fund a small business childcare grant program. \nThe program was authorized earlier this year as part of the \nsupplemental spending bill. It does have wide bipartisan support at \nthis time, as well as last Congress when it was unanimously approved by \nthe HELP Committee as part of the Child Care Community Development \nBlock Grant.\n  This program is different from other childcare initiatives because it \nspecifically targets small businesses and because it encourages them to \nwork together. These small businesses are the lifeblood of many urban \nand rural communities. These grants will allow the local convenience \nstore or the beauty shop, the auto shop, the implement dealer, the \nbank, to cooperatively work together to offer their employees quality \nchildcare while they work. Right now, these daycare facilities are \nsimply not available.\n  My program is also different from other grants because it encourages \nsustainability and ownership over these childcare facilities. With an \nannual increasing match requirement and a 2012 sunset provision, my \nprogram offers a fiscally responsible approach to plugging the lack of \nchildcare for many hard-working American families.\n  I wish to thank Senators Specter, Harkin, Kennedy, Dodd, and Salazar\n\n[[Page S13210]]\n\nfor their support of this program in the supplemental spending bill. I \nam proud this was a bipartisan effort from the get-go, and I want that \nto continue. If you support hard-working American families, if you \nsupport small business and community development, if you support fiscal \nresponsibility, then simply support this amendment.\n  Let me say I recognize and appreciate the concern of my good friends \nand colleagues, Senators Coburn and DeMint. They feel this program \ncould be duplicative. I do not think it is because the program targets \nsmall businesses and encourages them to cooperate with other entities \nto develop sustainable childcare facilities. Because of the matching \nand sunset requirements--50 percent the first year here, 67 percent the \nsecond year, and the third year, 75 percent, and then it sunsets--I \nthink we are much more fiscally responsible.\n  There was a suggestion to use TANF funds. These are being held by \nStates in emergency contingency accounts in case of a sudden economic \ndownturn. This would be another allowable use of these funds. That is \nnot the case. This is apples and oranges. This is a fiscally \nresponsible plan on the part of the States and we should encourage \nthat.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself about 3 minutes.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Roberts is a good amendment. This \nwas authorized in the emergency supplemental bill for fiscal year 2007. \nThe grants are for small businesses that want to partner with each \nother or other organizations to establish employer-owned childcare \nprograms. Funds can be used for startup costs, technical assistance, \nand training and special services for sick kids or children with \ndisabilities.\n  The program is authorized at $50 million in fiscal year 2008. As the \nSenator said, funding was not included. I think it is time we do fund \nit. I have long been a supporter of expanding the role of small \nbusinesses in providing the kind of childcare that their employees \nneed.\n  I think the amendment of the Senator will further that goal, and I \noffer my support to the Senator's amendment and I hope the Senate will \nadopt it.\n  I yield back whatever time we may have.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time is yielded back.\n  Without objection, that amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3365) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3387 to amendment no. 3325\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside and amendment No. 3387 be called up for \nimmediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3387.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To replace non-competitive earmarks for the AFL-CIO with \n                          competitive grants)\n\n       Beginning on page 4, strike line 22 and all that follows \n     through line 7 on page 5, and insert the following: \n     ``workers: Provided further, That $3,700,000 shall be for \n     competitive grants, which shall be awarded not later than 30 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act''.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I do want to make sure we have called up \namendment No. 3387. I appreciate the chairman agreeing to this slight \nchange in the purpose statement, not the legislative language.\n  This amendment is part of an effort to clear up what a lot of us have \ncalled the culture of corruption over the last several years. A lot of \nthis has come from Americans connecting the dots between the earmarks \nthat we give to our favorite causes back home and many of the campaign \ncontributions and political support that we get back here in Congress. \nWhile motivations are generally good, at best the appearance of what is \ngoing on here has alarmed the American people.\n  My earmark amendment today addresses two specific earmarks in the \nappropriations bill that is in front of us. One of the earmarks \nprovides $1.5 million for the AFL-CIO Working for America Institute and \n$2.2 million for the AFL-CIO Appalachian Council. These funds come in \nthe form of what are referred to as noncompetitive grants, according to \nthe text of the bill and the committee report--which means no one else \ncan compete to deliver the services that are intended by the bill, that \nthese are a specific earmark to divisions of the AFL-CIO.\n  These earmarks are problematic because they fund two organizations \nthat are not competitive. They provide funds that could be better spent \nto achieve the mission of the Department of Labor set out by Congress \nin the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. Rather than continuing to give \nthese groups handouts without any competition, we should force them to \ncompete with other organizations so Americans get the most value for \ntheir tax dollars. That is exactly what my amendment will do. It \nreplaces these two earmarks that total $3.7 million with competitive \ngrants.\n  Let me be clear. I am not taking the money out of the bill. The money \nis still there for the purposes for which it is intended, but it allows \norganizations to compete to deliver these services so that the \ntaxpayers get the most for their money.\n  Let me say a few things about the performance of the AFL-CIO \norganization so my colleagues understand why there is such concern. The \nAFL-CIO Working for America Institute originally received grants under \nthe Workforce Investment Act. The grants were given to national \norganizations for the purpose of providing technical assistance in \nsetting up systems of local and State workforce investment boards for \nthe purpose of helping unemployed workers get the training and the jobs \nthey need.\n  After 3 years, these capacity-building services were no longer \nneeded, and the grants were terminated. However, the Working for \nAmerica Institute failed to complete its mission in 3 years, so the \nDepartment gave it a fourth year of funding. After the fourth year, the \nDepartment terminated its contract with the Working for America \nInstitute and explained:\n\n       It is difficult to make the case that the AFL-CIO should \n     receive yet a fifth year of funding for organizational \n     purposes when the other national organizations were able to \n     achieve their goals in 3 years. Additionally, given that \n     there are so many workers seeking training or retraining \n     opportunities, we believe the Department of Labor's emphasis \n     is rightly placed on promoting employment and reemployment \n     projects having measurable outcomes.\n\n  The Department believes the technical assistance given by the \ninstitute is duplicative and less effective than a similar program \nalready funded in their Employment and Training Administration. It \nsaid:\n\n       We should focus limited financial resources on programs \n     that deliver actual training services to workers, rather than \n     pour additional funds into organizational infrastructure. \n     After 4 years, the AFL-CIO should have developed sufficient \n     ability to participate effectively in the Workforce \n     Investment Act system.\n\n  Despite these failures, Congress overrode the Department and \nearmarked funds for $1.5 million in fiscal year 2005 in the \nappropriations bill in that year, and it continued the project through \nJune of this year. Now this appropriations bill is trying to do the \nsame thing again. This is a clear example of Congress interfering with \nagency decisions because of parochial or political interests. Congress \nshould not fund a program that is duplicative and not a critical \npriority for an agency. It should have to compete for funds like every \nother organization.\n  Let me address the second earmark in this bill. The AFL-CIO \nAppalachian Council had a longstanding sole-source\n\n[[Page S13211]]\n\ncontract with the Department of Labor that spanned several decades. The \npurpose of the contract was to provide career technical training and \ncareer transition services at job placement centers in Pittsburgh, PA, \nCharleston, WV, and Batesville, MS. It is important to note that the \ncouncil does not manage or run these three centers. It simply provides \nthe training, placement, and transition services.\n  The Department of Labor reviewed the council's performance in 2004 in \nlight of the new requirements of the Workforce Investment Act. The \nreview resulted in the Department terminating the council's sole-source \ncontract because it was no longer the only and unique provider of \ncareer transition services and because it experienced a steady decline \nin program performance over a 5-year period.\n  Despite these failures, Congress stepped in and earmarked $2.2 \nmillion for the council in fiscal year 2005, forcing the Department to \ncontinue the contract. Following this, the Department canceled the \ncontract again, but Congress reversed the agency's decision a second \ntime with another $2.2 million earmark in 2006.\n  After the second year came to a close, the Department reviewed the \nperformance outcomes of the council. In 2006, the council placed 265 \ngraduates in apprenticeship programs and 71 graduates in jobs matching \ntheir vocational training. With the earmark funded at $2.2 million, the \ncost of each of these graduates was $6,547. Each of the council's 21 \nstaff members placed less than 2 students per month in a registered \napprenticeship program. Despite being given a second chance by \nCongress, the Department terminated the contract again this year.\n  Unfortunately, the appropriations bill we are considering gives \nanother earmark to the council to continue the services and designates \nit a noncompeting earmark, which means no one else can compete to do \nthe service right. Here we have two examples of earmarks that \ncircumvent the normal competitive process and abuse the American \ntaxpayer.\n  The AFL-CIO has plenty of funds to continue these programs. In 2006, \nthe AFL-CIO reported $96 million in assets and $157.2 million in \nreceipts. Their top five executive officers made from $179,000 to \n$291,000 a year, with 204 employees making more than $75,000 a year. Of \ntheir disbursements, about $30 million, or nearly 40 percent of their \ntotal receipts, went for political activities and lobbying.\n\n  The AFL-CIO should either fund the program itself or help the \ninstitute develop a competitive grant proposal, but these organizations \nshould not get a handout. My amendment, as I said before, does not \neliminate the funds, but it does require the AFL-CIO to compete based \non real criteria and accountability to deliver the services for the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to turn these \nnoncompetitive grants into competitive grants so we accomplish the \npurpose in an accountable way. I ask my colleagues to vote for my \namendment later on this morning. I appreciate their support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time do we have, Mr. President?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 10 minutes in opposition. \nThe Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the two programs which have been \ncommented on by the Senator from South Carolina are very good programs, \ncontrary to his assertions. The AFL-CIO Appalachian Council is a \nnationally recognized provider of educational training service. It was \nfounded in 1964 and the council has represented Alabama, Georgia, \nKentucky, Maryland, DC, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, \nPennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. I \nbelieve if the Senator from South Carolina looked closely at what has \nhappened in his own State, which has been a beneficiary, he would find \nit has been a good program. The council operates major employment and \ntraining programs through the Department of Labor and Job Corps, as \nwell as employee assistance programs, and provides funding for \nrecruitment/replacement of some 1,000 Job Corps students in long-term \njobs.\n  When you talk about the Job Corps, you are talking about a group of \nyoung people who might well be at risk. With the rising rates of \nviolence in major American cities--two of them in my State, Pittsburgh \nand Philadelphia; Philadelphia had 406 homicides last year--taking some \nof these at-risk students off the streets, young people off the \nstreets, and providing job training is very important.\n  The Working for America Institute, which is a program very near and \ndear to the heart of the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, \nhas an important retraining component of our manufacturing base, where \nwe have seen too many high-paying jobs shipped overseas. During the \ncurrent administration, more than 3 million American manufacturing jobs \nhave been lost. We are dealing with an area of some of the Rust Belt \nStates where job training and job development is very important and the \nAppalachian Council runs through those States and provides a very \nimportant service.\n  When the Senator from South Carolina talks about a political factor, \nthat depends upon the eye of the beholder. These programs have worked \nvery well. They are a very modest allocation with a total of $3.7 \nmillion tackling an issue of job training in an area which has been \nbeset by unfair foreign competition. They have been very carefully \nconsidered by the subcommittee, very carefully considered by the full \ncommittee, and they have been a part of the budget for a considerable \nperiod of time. They have established their bona fides and their \nworthwhile nature.\n  I believe they are worth the money. I urge my colleagues to reject \nthe DeMint amendment.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague from Iowa.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wish to join with Senator Specter in opposing the \nDeMint amendment, which would strike two congressionally directed \nfundings in the bill--one for the Appalachian Council, and the other \none would be for the Working for America Institute.\n  This institute was created, first of all, in 1989 and then in 1998 \nwas spun off and made into a totally separate nonprofit organization \nwith a functioning board of directors and everything else. They have \nover 30 years of experience in the field of job training, workforce \ndevelopment. They work with businesses, the private sector, they work \nwith unions, and they work with communities. The institute has \nbasically been a showcase of how to pull people together and get people \ntogether for workforce development. It is doing great work, and it \nbenefits communities throughout the United States. In fact, I had the \nlist of some here. Just last year alone, the institute provided \nassistance to Portland, OR, the Ohio State Workforce Board, the \nNational Governors Association, and the National Alliance of Workforce \nBoards. So you can see they do things all over the country.\n  I point out that this institute received funding through the \nDepartment of Labor for over 30 years, through Republican and \nDemocratic administrations. I can go back to Nixon and Ford and Carter, \nall through the Reagan years, the first Bush administration, the \nClinton administration, and actually the first part of this Bush \nadministration until just a couple of years ago when the Department of \nLabor decided to cut all funding for it. So we had to come in here a \ncouple of years ago and put directed funding in there for the \ninstitute. It was widely supported.\n  So when the Senator from South Carolina says that: Well, we will just \nmake it competitive. Well, the Department will not do it anyway. They \nare not interested in it. They will not put it out for competitive \ngrant. So this is another instance where I think congressionally \ndirected funding has validity because we have looked at these programs \nfrom a bipartisan standpoint, and we agree they should be funded, even \nthough the Department of Labor does not want the funding.\n  Now, the second issue I wanted to address is--I do not know whether I \ncaught the Senator from South Carolina correctly, but I heard something \nabout lobbying and political activity. I just wanted to make it very \nclear that section 503 of the bill reads--and I will read it in its \nentirety:\n\n       No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall be \n     used, other than for normal\n\n[[Page S13212]]\n\n     and recognized executive-legislative relationships, for \n     publicity or propaganda purposes, for the preparation, \n     distribution or use of any kit, pamphlet, booklet, \n     publication, radio, television or video presentation, \n     designed to support or defeat legislation pending before the \n     Congress or any State legislature, except in presentation to \n     the Congress or any State legislature itself.\n       B. No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall \n     be used to pay the salary or expenses of any grant or \n     contract recipient or agent acting for such recipient related \n     to any activity designed to influence legislation or \n     appropriations pending before the Congress or any State \n     legislature.\n\n  So the recipients cannot do it, and they cannot hire lobbyists, \neither, to lobby for them for any legislation pending before the \nCongress. So I wanted to make it clear that none of this money can be \nused for lobbying or for any kind of partisan activities, nor can it \neven be used for them to hire a lobbyist or a lobbying firm for that \nactivity. So I wanted to make that clear.\n  I support the Senator from Pennsylvania. The Appalachian Council has \ndone a great job. They are doing great work in a number of States. The \nWorking for America Institute, again, is one that has proven its worth. \nIt has been widely supported throughout America, through business \nconcerns, and State workforce investment boards all over this country.\n  Now is not the time to pull the rug out from underneath them. So I \nwould join with Senator Specter in opposing the DeMint amendment.\n  I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, just a supplemental comment or two. The \nJob Corps program, which is part of this overall operation, funds young \npeople ages 16 through 24. In Philadelphia, there is a program which \nplaces graduates with 61 major health care employers in higher skill \njobs which are in great demand in Philadelphia. That attacks an area of \ngreat importance, considering the homicide rate in Philadelphia, much \nof which is caused by young people, so many at-risk youth. This goes \nright to the heart of a very serious problem, to support the funding.\n  I want to supplement that, too, with the hearing which we held on \nJuly 22, 2004, where we had extensive testimony taken on the subject to \nestablish the value of the program.\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Just under 1 minute 50 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We reserve the remainder of that time awaiting the \nargument of the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina. \nThe Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I agree with all the purposes the Senator \nstated, all of the ideas of getting teenagers to work in Philadelphia. \nAll of those things are good. I am not taking argument with any of \nthem. If the AFL-CIO is the best source to deliver these services, \nthere should not be any problem with this at all. All we are asking is \nto make this a competitive grant so that we can have criteria and \naccountability in a system so that what we want to accomplish will \nactually get accomplished. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. When you talk about accountability, it is present. It is \nan open book. The Job Corps is administered by the Department of Labor. \nIt is not unusual to have a sole-source contract. When you have \nsomebody like the AFL-CIO, which has so much knowledge, and so many of \ntheir experts are at work on this program, it makes very good sense to \ngive the opportunity to carry out the program. It is all subject to the \nreview by the Department of Labor. I think the quality of this program \nspeaks for itself. There is agreement on it. It has an important \npurpose. I believe the record shows that these funds have been wisely \nspent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I move to table the DeMint amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are ordered. Under \nthe previous order, that vote will occur after debate on the Coburn \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3358\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, now we are going to go to the Coburn \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote sequence be changed and that \nthe vote in relation to the Coburn amendment be second in the sequence; \nthat the remaining provisions remain in effect.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, amendment No. 3358 is a pending amendment \nwe discussed this last Friday. I believe under the unanimous consent \nagreement I have 10 minutes, and those in opposition do also. I am \ngoing to speak a few moments, if I may.\n  What the country is looking for us to do is to choose priorities, to \nmake good choices about the priorities of what we do with their money. \nQuite frankly, there has not been a top-down review on all the \nGovernment programs, ever. We have had very limited oversight hearings, \nwhich should be the No. 1 part of our job. And we have in front of us a \nbill that has $400 million in directed earmarks, which we think, \nthrough what the appropriations process has brought to us, is an \nimportant priority.\n  What this amendment says is that we are going to give the Members of \nthe Senate an opportunity to vote on whether those are the most \nimportant priorities or whether we ought to have children's health care \nbecause what this amendment does is redirects this money in abeyance \nuntil we say we have the kids in this country covered.\n  There is a large debate over the SCHIP bill that the President \nrecently vetoed. There are a lot of things wrong with it. It is not \nwrong to help poor kids get health care. Nobody in the Senate opposed \nthat. What they did oppose is changing, under the guise of a debate for \nchildren, a debate of having the Government start running all of the \nhealth care for kids. What it did do is spend $4,000 to buy $2,300 \nworth of care, and a lot of other things.\n  So what this amendment is about is asking the Senate to choose--\nchoose your directed earmarks for back home or make a statement that \nsays: We really believe kids health care is important, and we are not \ngoing to spend the money on directed earmarks until we have solved that \nproblem.\n  I know this makes some of my colleagues bristle, that we would \nchallenge the direction. This is not saying specific earmarks are not \ngood ideas. A lot of the earmarks in this bill are good ideas. What it \ndoes say is: Should they be a priority before we take care of one of \nthe greatest problems this country is facing, which is health care? Are \nwe going to go after and really change health care to where we get \nvalue, we get controllable costs, we get freedom of choice, or are we \ngoing to continue to do the same thing of putting earmarks into bills \nand ignoring the big problems that are in front of us?\n  So what this amendment says is that until the Secretary of HHS, \nwhoever they may be, certifies that we have the kids under 18 in this \ncountry covered, we should not be spending money on directed political \nbenefits for ourselves and our careers; instead, we should be spending \nour time solving the health care needs of the kids in our country.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time in opposition? The \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I assume it comes as no surprise that I \noppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I appreciate that the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma raises \nagain the issue of children's health care. I think that debate should \ngo on since the plight of poor children in this country needs as much \nattention as we can give it. But I do not think this amendment is \nserious about addressing the health of children. The amendment does not \nput any money into it at all; it just says that we will not have any \ncongressionally directed funding until every child in America has \nhealth care coverage. I believe that is the way it is worded. So it \nreally does not fund it. It does not do anything at all. I think it is \nthe kind of thing that kind of gives Congress a bad name in that we say \nwe\n\n[[Page S13213]]\n\nwant to do these things, but we do not provide any funding for them.\n  We really already know how to increase the number of children insured \nin this country--by providing an increase in the SCHIP bill program. \nThe Senate recently voted 68 to 31 to do that--68 to 31, pretty \noverwhelming. That bill would have provided insurance to millions of \nchildren who do not have any. Well, maybe the Senator from Oklahoma did \nnot agree with how that was done but, nonetheless, 68 Senators did \nagree on both sides of the aisle on that approach.\n  So, again, if the Senator was really concerned about the plight of \nthese children, I would suggest that rather then voting against the \nSCHIP bill, which obviously provides some guidance and direction, that \nthere is another way of doing it. Again, I point out that the Senate \nvoted overwhelmingly to do that.\n  That vote on SCHIP was a key one on children's health insurance, not \na completely unrelated vote dealing with congressionally directed \nspending, which is what this is.\n  I say to my friend from Oklahoma, if he wants more kids to have \nhealth insurance, then vote for a bill that would provide more health \ninsurance to kids. If it is not the SCHIP bill, then what is it? It has \nbeen suggested that maybe a vote for the Coburn amendment might be a \nnice cover vote for those who oppose the SCHIP bill. I don't think so. \nPerhaps more and more people are finding out that a vote against the \nSCHIP bill was not a very popular one, as we hear from communities and \nStates. But an amendment such as this doesn't change the facts about \nthe SCHIP bill, one way or the other.\n  I also disagree with the Senator's implication, if I might say, that \ncongressionally directed projects in the bill are unworthy of Federal \nspending. I am proud of the projects I included in this bill. I will be \nglad to defend every one of them. Again, with the transparency we have \nthat came with the new ethics reform bill, all of these have been \nspread upon the record. We know who asked for them and we know how much \nmoney is involved. I am happy to defend every one of the ones I put in \nthere. I should add that many of the projects the Senator wants to \neliminate are, in fact, directed to children's health. Let me cite a \nfew examples.\n  There is congressionally directed funding for St. Francis Hospital in \nDelaware to expand prenatal maternity and pediatric services to \nindigents. There is funding for the Youth Crisis Center in \nJacksonville, FL to address the serious health consequences facing \nrunaway and homeless youth. There is funding for St. Luke's Regional \nMedical Center in Boise, ID to expand pediatric services. There is \nfunding for the St. Louis Children's Hospital in St. Louis for neonatal \nintensive care unit expansion. There is funding for the Mississippi \nGulf Coast Children's Health Project which uses mobile units to provide \nprimary care to indigent children along the gulf coast. There is \nfunding for Child Sight in New Mexico, a vision screening and eyeglass \nprogram especially for Native Americans on reservations. There is \nfunding for St. Anthony's Hospital in Oklahoma City for construction of \na newborn nursery. All of these would be cut out if the amendment were \nadopted. They are good provisions, and they will go a long way toward \nhelping children's health in all of these instances.\n  Again, I don't see this as a serious means of doing anything to help \nchildren's health. It is an attack on congressionally directed funding \nto which the Senator is opposed. As I said, I support congressionally \ndirected funding. I always have. I especially support it now with the \nnew provisions on transparency and accountability as a result of the \nethics bill we recently passed.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The opposition has 4 minutes 50 \nseconds. The proponents have 6 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to the Senator whatever time he requires.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa, chairman of the subcommittee, \nhas already advanced the substantive argument about our efforts to deal \nwith health care for children. I have supported it with a very solid \nvote. We will take care of that issue. The President has vetoed the \nbill, and I and others have signified our willingness to vote to \noverride. It was not overridden in the House. The President has \nsignified his willingness to negotiate. There are some who do not want \nto negotiate on the congressional side. I believe that is a mistake. If \nthey want to attach political blame to the President if the program \nshould lapse, ultimately, we will have a negotiation because the \nAmerican people would see through the facade and understand that those \nwho refuse to negotiate are the ones responsible if the program lapses \nand is terminated. We will take care of congressional and Federal \naction for children's health.\n  What the amendment seeks to do is to eliminate earmarks. Earmarks \nhave a specific congressional designation budget-wise and are vitally \nimportant projects, such as the dredging of the Delaware in \nPhiladelphia to provide a 45-foot channel which traditionally has been \nthe responsibility of the Federal Government under constitutional \nprovisions on waterways and related matters. It would eliminate flood \ncontrol, which is vital. It would eliminate many items where there is \ncongressional expertise and understanding.\n  Take the budget that is on the floor now. It is $152 billion. We have \nallocated $400 million, which is about one-quarter of 1 percent. So \n99\\3/4\\ percent goes to the bureaucrats in the Department of Education, \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of \nLabor. I suggest that is an imbalance. People in the House of \nRepresentatives know their districts much better than people sitting \ndowntown in big bureaus in Washington. Senators know their States \nbetter than the bureaucrats. I dare say the astute Senator from \nOklahoma, the proponent of this amendment, knows what is going on in \nOklahoma better than the bureaucrats and would be in a better position \nto identify projects which are worthwhile. But to limit congressional \ncontrol to one-quarter of 1 percent is certainly not appropriate, \ncertainly not overbearing. I wouldn't call it de minimis because no \ndollar amount is de minimis. We understand it is not the Government's \nmoney; it is the taxpayers' money.\n  The Senator from Iowa has made a very fundamental point. In fact, he \nmade a couple of fundamental points; in fact, he has made several \nfundamental points. One is the transparency. It is all out in the open. \nWe are prepared to debate any move to strike any of the so-called \nearmarks. Earmarks has become a dirty word. But when you reach a real \nneed somewhere and have an application for Federal funds that a Member \nof the House or the Senate understands, and in the broader context of \none-quarter of 1 percent, I don't think that goes too far to having \nMembers who know their States and know their districts make those \nallocations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, may I inquire as to the remaining time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 6 minutes 50 \nseconds, and the opposition has 23 seconds.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair.\n  I stand somewhat amused that we are so powerless that the bureaucracy \nis going to decide where everything goes. Earmarks are not the only way \nto decide how the budget is put out, and the fact that we use the \nexcuse that we don't have any control, it is called oversight. Last \nyear in the last Congress more oversight hearings were held by myself \nand Tom Carper, true oversight hearings, than all the rest of the \nSenate. The fact is, we don't want to do the hard work of oversight \nbecause it is easy to earmark something. But in fact, in dredging, you \ncan hold the Corps of Engineers to a priority list. You can bring them \nbefore Congress and say: Why aren't you dredging this? How is this a \npriority against something else? We don't do the hard work of \noversight. That is our problem. Instead, we want to do it the easy way.\n  I don't deny these are good projects. They are. I am not saying they \nare not. What I am saying is, what about the long term? What about the \nfact that a\n\n[[Page S13214]]\n\nchild born today is inheriting $400,000 in unfunded liabilities and \nthat earmarks happen to be the tool that allows us to spend more than \nwe should, not directly through the earmarks but by voting for bills \nthat should not be voted on? But because we have an earmark in the \nbill, we vote for the bill.\n  We have an unfunded liability right now on Medicare of $34 billion. \nWe are never going to be trusted to fix that problem when we can't be \ntrusted to have an arm's-length separate allocation and look at what \nthe problems are in front of us in terms of labor, health, and human \nservices.\n  I don't deny what people want to do in this bill could be \nprioritized. But the number of requests were 36,000 this year. The fact \nis, can we get what are priorities for this country if we continue the \nprocess of using earmarks?\n  How about children's health? Yes, we passed a bill. We passed a bill \nthat truly wasn't paid for unless we want 22 million Americans to start \nsmoking. We passed a bill that said: We are going to pay $4,000 to buy \n$2,300 worth of care. We are great stewards when it comes to the \nAmerican taxpayers' money on this new SCHIP bill. There is no question \nwe are going to get an SCHIP bill. That SCHIP bill is going to truly \nreflect the needs of the poor people who are not eligible for Medicaid. \nWe are going to put the money there we need to accomplish that. But to \nconfuse that bill with a process which has got us $9.5 trillion in debt \nand hung every one of our kids out to dry, that is what this amendment \nis about. It is the process I am attacking.\n  I am not attacking individual Senators. I am saying if we are going \nto get control of the spending, at some point in the future we have to \nlook at the process and how it works. For us to say it is easier for us \nto earmark than to hold the bureaucracy accountable means we are not \ndoing our job. We can hold the bureaucracies accountable. All we have \nto do is have an oversight hearing three times a week and make them \ncome up here and explain how they are spending their money. They will \nstart spending on priorities Americans want. We don't have our hands \ntied behind us just because we don't do earmarks.\n  The real question America is asking is, are we going to change our \nways about real priorities, the real future for our country, or are we \ngoing to continue the same old process that has brought us all the \ncorruption we have seen come through the House in the past that leads \nto conflicts of interest?\n  We talk about transparency. We gutted the transparency rules as far \nas appropriations are concerned in this bill and in our ethics bill, \nbecause no longer do you say who is getting it or what it is for. You \nonly say where it is going. The very things that are in the House bill \nin terms of transparency are not available to us in the Senate, so we \ncan't claim transparency. We are going to get transparency in September \nof next year when the transparency bill comes about.\n  Senator Harkin mentioned that we didn't offer an option. Senator Burr \nand I both did, the Every American Kid Insured Act. We talked about it \non this floor during the debate on the SCHIP bill. There are other ways \nto do this. Give them all a tax credit. Let them buy the insurance. We \nhave 9 million kids out there uninsured, 3 million more within 1 year. \nThere are ways for us to solve that. But this is not a farce amendment. \nThis is an amendment about a very real problem. Will we have the right \npriorities when it comes to this country or are we going to send $42 \nmillion to international labor organizations with no accountability \nwhatsoever from the United Nations? That is what we are doing. That is \nwhat this bill does. We have another $400 million worth of earmarks \nthat are not competitively bid and will never be overseen, and you will \nnever see where the money goes. So the question on the amendment is, \nwill we change the process.\n  It is a serious amendment. We should not be earmarking things until \nwe do our business of taking care of kids' insurance.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 23 seconds remaining for \nthe opposition.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I point out that the Coburn amendment \ndoesn't put 1 cent into helping children's health, not 1 penny. Yet in \nthe bill itself, as I pointed out, there are a number of programs that \nactually go to help children's health all over this country. The Coburn \namendment would eradicate those.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I do want to give the yeas and nays to the \nSenator. I was just going to move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second on the \namendment itself?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There appears to be a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: As to the unanimous \nconsent request that we agreed to, was it not agreed to that we were \ngoing to have votes on these amendments up or down?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No.\n  Mr. COBURN. That was not part of the unanimous consent agreement? \nFine.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Oklahoma, it was \non or in relation to. So, yes, ask that again.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The yeas and nays have been ordered \non the amendment itself.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on the matter of management, after these \nvotes we will move ahead to take up any other amendments that any \nSenators wish to offer. We had an understanding to conclude this bill \nby 12:30 today, and we are anxious to come as close to that time as we \ncan. If Senators want to pursue any other amendments, they ought to \nconsult with the managers immediately or we intend to go to third \nreading to complete this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, I \nthink we are getting close. With these three votes coming up now, \nhopefully we are just a few amendments away from completing the bill, \nand hopefully we will have it done early this afternoon. I had hoped we \nwould have it done by 12:30, but that does not look possible. But we \nare getting close. I hope when Senators come over to the Chamber we can \nwork out some other amendments that are pending at this time, and \nperhaps we can get a consent to limit the number of amendments and \nbring closure to this bill sometime early this afternoon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3437\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nquestion recurs on the Enzi amendment. There is 2 minutes evenly \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, again, I would ask that Senators support my \namendment to strike what we are talking about, which is an earmark of \n$6.2 million for San Francisco and another $3 million for a few other \ntowns.\n  We are changing law that we passed less than a year ago under an \nauthorization process. It is much harder to pass an authorization bill \nthan it is an appropriations bill. We should not be changing formulas \nunder an appropriations bill.\n  The GAO numbers that we said would happen are approximately what has \nhappened. Of the $9 million, San Francisco gets $6.2 million. They \nalready get twice as much per HIV/AIDS case as any of the rest of the \ntowns. We put in a hold harmless provision so nobody would lose more \nthan 5 percent of their money. We have been staying by that. We did not \nguarantee supplemental money. That was done less than a year ago. This \nis an earmark.\n  There were waiting lines for people who needed HIV treatment and \ncare. There are no waiting lines today. What we did last year worked. \nWe should not change it under appropriations now.\n  I ask that you vote for my amendment.\n\n[[Page S13215]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator's 1 minute has \nexpired.\n  There is 1 minute in opposition to the amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, since no one wants to be recognized in \nopposition, I yield back the time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3437.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, first, I make a point of order that the \nSenate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we now proceed to 2 minutes on the Coburn \namendment. After that, then we will have 2 minutes on the DeMint \namendment and vote. These will be 10-minute votes as per the prior \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a straightforward amendment. It is \nan amendment about where our priorities lie. Do they lie in our \ndirected spending or do they lie with the children of this country who \naren't covered?\n  It is a very simple amendment. I know there are things in the bill \nfor children, but the fact is out of the 9.5 million who are uncovered, \nwe have 3.6 million who have not been covered for a year.\n  So this amendment simply states we are not going to spend any money \non the directed spending until the HHS Secretary certifies that we have \ndone our job in terms of taking care of the kids. Whether that is the \nSCHIP bill, negotiations with the administration or whatever it is, we \nare not going to spend the money.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senate please be called to \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  The senior Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the issue of providing health care for \nchildren will be taken care of on the SCHIP bill, which ultimately will \nbe subject to negotiations between the President and the Congress. The \nallocations on earmarks amount to approximately one-quarter of 1 \npercent. Ninety-nine and three-quarters percent will go to the \nbureaucrats in the departments.\n  Members of the Senate and House have more knowledge about what is \ngoing on in their districts and their States, and this is a very modest \napplication for very worthwhile programs. The Senator from Oklahoma \nconceded in the argument earlier that he is not challenging the \nworthwhileness of any of these programs. Any of them are subject to \nattack to be stricken, and they are all defensible.\n  I ask that the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma be rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I move to table the Coburn amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand there will now be 2 minutes \nprior to the vote on the DeMint amendment, which we already have moved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues' attention. I \nwould first like to ask unanimous consent to add Senator Enzi as a \ncosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I want to make clear to my colleagues that \nmy amendment does not remove any money from this bill for its intended \npurpose. In fact, the amendment addresses the Workforce Investment Act, \nmoney that goes to training and job\n\n[[Page S13216]]\n\nplacement in several places in the country. My amendment only changes \nthe language from a sole-source noncompetitive grant, which we would \nrefer to as a direct earmark, to a competitive grant.\n  We have all seen that the competitive grant system is a better way to \ndeliver Federal money to specific causes that we support as a Senate \nbecause there are criteria, there are standards, and there is \naccountability. So we are not excluding the AFL-CIO as a provider of \nthe services that we intend, but it opens it for competitive bids. And \nit is important to realize that the Department of Labor, after judging \nthe performance of the AFL-CIO, has found the performance lacking and \nhas discontinued the contracts.\n  So please open this for competitive bidding. Please vote no on the \nmotion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this program has been in operation for \ndecades and has proven to be very effective. A hearing held by the \nsubcommittee back on July 22, 2004, went into some of the detail. The \nprogram addresses job training and Job Corps. One program, \nillustratively, in Philadelphia seeks to give training to young people \nwho are at risk, come from broken families--no father and a working \nmother. It is directed toward training across the Appalachian Council, \nStates in the Rust Belt, which have been hit very hard by unfair \nforeign competition, to have training and to have workmanship skills \ndeveloped.\n  It has been a successful program, and it ought to be retained. Vote \naye to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to table. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

To enable the National Institute for Occupational \n     Safety and Health to carry out the Fire Fighter Fatality \n     Investigation and Prevention Program, $5,000,000, which shall \n     include any other amounts made available under this Act for \n     such Program. Amounts made available under this Act for \n     travel expenses for the Department of Labor, the Department \n     of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education \n     shall be reduced on a pro rata basis by the percentage \n     necessary to decrease the overall amount of such spending by \n     $2,500,000.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in February of this year, I sent a letter \nto the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human \nServices regarding a report from the Centers for Disease Control that \nactually blocked an investigation into the death of six firefighters \nwhose personal safety equipment had failed them between 1998 and the \nyear 2000. In the response to me, the inspector general reported that \nfunding of the current funds that exist in the Firefighter Fatality \nInvestigation and Prevention Fund within the National Institutes of \nOccupational Health and Safety is flat. Their resources are such that \nthey have had to\n\n[[Page S13218]]\n\npick and choose where they can conduct those kinds of investigations.\n  Every year, about 100 firefighters die in the line of duty in America \nand about 87,000 are injured. This fund is an investigative fund that \nhelps find ways in which we can protect firefighter lives--whether \nthere is a certain kind of equipment that might have made a difference \nor a certain procedure that might have made a difference. Obviously, \nfor those fire stations, fire houses with the losses or those that face \na future risk, to know we are selectively choosing where we investigate \nand where we do not does not do the job. We need to investigate all of \nthose fatalities, and we need to do everything possible to provide our \nfirefighters the procedures and equipment necessary to save lives.\n  This funding will add an additional $2.5 million to that \ninvestigative fund and allow us to complete our responsibility to those \ncourageous firefighters across the country.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter from the International Association \nof Fire Fighters and the International Association of Fire Chiefs be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 18, 2007.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry\n     304 Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: On behalf of the International \n     Association of Fire Chiefs, representing nearly 13,000 chief \n     fire and emergency officers, and the International \n     Association of Fire Fighters, representing more than 280,000 \n     professional fire fighters and emergency medical personnel, \n     we are writing to express our strong support for your \n     amendment to the FY 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, \n     Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act providing \n     $5 million for the Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and \n     Prevention Program (FFFIPP) of the National Institute for \n     Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).\n       Of the 1.1 million fire fighters who selflessly serve their \n     communities and their country, approximately 100 die on the \n     job each year. Additionally, the National Fire Protection \n     Association estimates that 80,100 fire fighter injuries \n     occurred in the line of duty in 2005 alone. The FFFIPP is \n     instrumental in discovering the primary factors contributing \n     to fire fighter deaths and recommending ways to prevent \n     future deaths and injuries.\n       Since its inception in 1998, the FFFIPP--in cooperation \n     with fire departments and fire fighters around the country--\n     has conducted over 300 fatality investigations. The findings \n     and recommendations of these investigations have led to \n     increased awareness of fire fighter safety and health \n     hazards, and led to numerous cooperative efforts among and \n     between the fire service and NIOSH to improve fire fighter \n     safety and health.\n       Despite such successes, fatality investigations are not as \n     common nor as comprehensive as they should be. According to a \n     recent report by the inspector general of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, such shortcomings are caused, in \n     part, by a lack of resources.\n       Congress clearly intended for NIOSH to thoroughly \n     investigate every fire fighter line-of-duty death. By \n     doubling the funding allocated for the FFFIPP in FY 2007, \n     your amendment will allow NIOSH to better fulfill its \n     Congressional mandate and help prevent fire fighter injuries \n     and deaths.\n       Thank you for your leadership in protecting the health and \n     safety of our Nation's first responders. We look forward to \n     continue working with you to prevent future deaths and \n     injuries among fire fighters.\n           Sincerely,\n                                  Chief Steven P. Westermann, CFO,\n                            President, International Association  \n                                                   of Fire Chiefs.\n\n                                       Harold A. Schaitberger,\n\n                                  General President, International\n     Association of Fire Fighters.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

The \namendment by the Senator from Massachusetts is accepted on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3398) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                          CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes to do \nwhat Senator Boxer did yesterday, which is essentially to update the \nSenate on the catastrophic fires in California. I offer these words on \nbehalf of Senator Boxer and myself.\n  Today there are 14 fires, big fires, burning in California. The bulk \nof them are uncontained and out of control. The containment factor is \nvery small. More than half a million people have been told to evacuate \ntheir homes. More than 309,000 acres have been destroyed by fire, over \n400 miles, from north of Los Angeles to San Diego and now across the \nMexican border, and more, we fear, will be destroyed.\n  The deaths, fortunately, today are limited to one, with 34 injured \nthroughout southern California, some of them firefighters. High wind \nand high temperatures persist. A red flag warning is in effect for the \nCalifornia coast from Monterey to the Mexican border. More than 1,000 \nhomes have been destroyed; 11,500 are now threatened. Today more than \n100 commercial buildings have been destroyed, and 2,000 are threatened; \n52 outbuildings have been destroyed and 550 are threatened.\n  Health warnings have been issued because of smoke and particulate \nmatter. As you know, these fires are driven by hurricane and gale-force \nSanta Ana winds, which are hot and contrary to the prevailing westerly \nflow, east to west. They are fueled by bone-dry brush from years of \ndrought and virtually no humidity. Humidity is below 10 percent.\n  Fires are raging still in Malibu, at Lake Arrowhead in Irvine and \nSanta Clarita. The Arrowhead area is particularly dangerous because \nthere are half a million acres of pine-beetle infested dead trees \nwaiting to go up.\n  Of course, they are raging in San Diego County, which is bearing the \nbrunt of two major fires which well could join. Already, the 300,000 \npeople in San Diego County alone have been told to evacuate. More than \n10,000 of them are now taking refuge in Qualcomm Stadium, home to the \nSan Diego Chargers. These people will be there for 48 to 72 more hours \nand possibly more.\n  Sanitary supplies are going to become a problem. It is going to be a \nreal effort to get food and water to these evacuees and the hundreds of \nthousands of people displaced around southern California.\n  Both Senator Boxer and I spoke to the Governor, and he has declared a \nseven-county disaster area. Yesterday the President declared southern \nCalifornia a disaster area to be able to speed the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency's relief, which is critical.\n  This is going to be a real test of FEMA. We are going to learn \nwhether FEMA actually learned from the hurricane in New Orleans, a test \nof whether FEMA has gotten its act together post-Katrina.\n  FEMA must act quickly and urgently to get help to California. The \nState is going to need cots; it is going to need blankets; it is going \nto need water, food, and, most importantly, those sanitary facilities \nthat are needed for the people who are camping out today, sleeping in \ncars, located in schools, or in Qualcomm Stadium.\n\n[[Page S13219]]\n\n  Most importantly, this help has to be spread throughout the 14 \ndifferent fire areas. It is not going to be enough to simply put it in \none place.\n  Last night, the Secretary of the Interior informed me that the fires \nhave crossed the line and are entering into Baja California, Mexico, \nand urged Mexican authorities to begin to speak out.\n  These fires are fast moving. You see them at a distance on a hill, \nand you do not believe you will be affected because the winds are \ncontrary to what you expect. Then, suddenly, within a short period of \ntime, 2 hours, the fire is upon you.\n  So people must be alert, and they must evacuate these fire areas. The \nmilitary is pitching in. Fifteen hundred National Guard personnel are \nactively engaged or directly supporting firefighting efforts. We have \n550 Active-Duty marines, 17,000 California National Guard personnel are \navailable. I believe we have more than 5,300 State of California \nfirefighters on the line, and hundreds more from local jurisdictions. \nToday, a combination of National Guard, Navy and Marine Corps aircraft, \nare either supporting firefighter efforts or are prepared to pitch in.\n  The problem is, with the wind and dense smoke, it is difficult for a \nplane or helicopter to know where they are going. Simply put, this is a \ndisaster of huge proportions. It is catastrophic in terms of property \nloss and environmental damage.\n  Hopefully, it is not going to be a huge catastrophe in terms of loss \nof life. I do not think there is anything other than a catastrophic \nhealth incident that is more serious to a person or family than losing \ntheir home by flood or fire.\n  I know Californians will respond in their traditional stalwart and \ngenerous manner to help their neighbors. Both Senator Boxer's and my \nheart go out to all Californians today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the specific statistical roundup of \nthese larger fires be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Here is a roundup of the larger fires:\n       San Diego: Witch Fire (NE S.D. County, near Santa Ysabel, \n     burning toward Ramona and Julian)--Acres burned: 145,000; \n     containment: 0%; residents evacuated: 100,000+; structures \n     destroyed: 500 homes, 100 commercial properties; structures \n     threatened: 2,000 homes, 400 commercial properties; \n     firefighters: 625; injuries: none reported.\n       San Diego: Harris Fire (SE S.D. County, 75 miles east of \n     downtown San Diego near the Mexican border)--Acres burned: \n     22,000; containment: 5%; residents evacuated: 1,000+; \n     firefighters: 400; deaths--injuries: 1 man killed, 5 \n     firefighters and 20 civilians injured.\n       Malibu: Canyon Fire (Burning toward Pepperdine University \n     and Pacific Ocean)--Acres burned: 3,800; containment: 10%; \n     residents evacuated: 1,500; structures destroyed: 6 homes, 1 \n     church; structures threatened: 600; firefighters: 1,500; \n     injuries: none.\n       Agua Dulce--Santa Clarita: Buckweed Fire (Mint Canyon area, \n     burning toward Magic Mountain)--Acres burned: 35,550; \n     containment: 20%; residents evacuated: 15,000; structures \n     destroyed: 15 homes, 17 outbuildings; structures threatened: \n     3,800; firefighters: 1,200; injuries: 1 firefighter and 3 \n     residents.\n       Orange County: Santiago Fire (Silverado Canyon, burning \n     toward Portola Springs and Northwood village of Irvine)--\n     Acres burned: 15,000 acres; containment: 30%; structures \n     destroyed: 1 outbuilding; structures threatened: 2,000; \n     residents evacuated: unk.; firefighters: 492.\n       Lake Arrowhead: Slide and Grass Valley Fires (Green Valley \n     Lake and Lake Gregory)--Acres burned: 1,800; containment: 0%; \n     structures lost: at least 450 homes; structures threatened: \n     1,900; firefighters: 82 engines, 7 hand crews.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. For the benefit of Senators, I understand a number of \nRepublicans are at the White House for a White House meeting until \n3:30, so there will not be any votes between now and 3:30. However, we \nwant to get amendments up and debated. Hopefully at around 3:30 or \nshortly thereafter we can start a series of votes. Right now we have \nfour amendments pending and three more amendments that are not pending \nbut will be called up shortly. One of those will be offered by the \nSenator from New Mexico. That is the lay of the land. It looks as if we \nare down to about seven votes, possibly, starting at or around 3:30 or \nshortly thereafter.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I understand there is still some \nchecking to see if there is any objection to setting aside the pending \namendment so I may offer an amendment. While we are waiting, I wish to \ndescribe the substance of the amendment I intend to offer.\n  This amendment is intended to reduce the Social Security backlog. \nMost of us who go back to our home States on weekends and during \nrecesses know about the Social Security backlog. We hear from \nindividuals in our States about how long they have to wait to find out \nwhether their Social Security disability claims have been approved. We \nhear about elderly people waiting in long lines for service at Social \nSecurity offices. We hear about busy signals when they call the 1-800 \nnumber that is provided for people trying to find out the status of \ntheir Social Security claim. But I am not sure most of us understand \nthe extent of the backlog, the consequences of it, or the reasons.\n  For more than 70 years Social Security has provided millions of \nAmerican workers and their families with a basic level of protection \nagainst poverty when a worker can no longer work due to old age. Of \ncourse, we are all aware of disability now being covered by Social \nSecurity. Social Security benefits are the only means of survival for \nmillions of individuals with severe disabilities. These individuals \nrely on the Social Security Administration to promptly and fairly \nadjudicate their applications for disability benefits. Unfortunately, \nwe are witnessing a trend where this is simply not happening.\n  According to the Social Security Administration, there are currently \nover 756,000 cases waiting for hearing. That is not waiting for a final \ndetermination, waiting for a hearing. The average time to get a hearing \nis 523 days. That is the longest it has been in the history of the \nSocial Security Administration. The average processing time for a \nhearing is projected to increase next year, based on the numbers we \nhave in the appropriations bill before us. This is a problem for \nindividuals with disabilities in my State of New Mexico.\n  Currently the average processing time per case in the Albuquerque \nhearing office is 528 days. Keep in mind, this is only the time it \ntakes to get a hearing. This does not include the time it takes for an \ninitial determination or for a final determination. This past May the \nFinance Committee, on which I am privileged to serve, received \ntestimony indicating there are thousands of individuals with \ndisabilities who currently have cases pending with the Social Security \nAdministration and have had those cases pending for 3 years or more. \nThe Finance Committee received testimony regarding the extreme \nhardships individuals with severe disabilities must endure while \nawaiting a final decision on their disability claims. We heard instance \nafter instance where individuals with severe disabilities were unable \nto work and were forced to declare bankruptcy. They lost their homes, \nsuffered deterioration in their medical conditions, and some even died \nwhile their claims lingered in Social Security Administration offices.\n  According to the Social Security Administration, staffing levels are \nat their lowest since 1972. Thirty years ago, the Social Security \nAdministration had more than 82,000 employees. In 2005 the Social \nSecurity Administration had 66,000 employees. In a few months, the \nexpected employment at the Social Security Administration will drop \nbelow 60,000.\n  Thousands of employees are leaving the Social Security \nAdministration's field and hearing offices without being replaced. As \nmany of us know, the field offices around the country are reducing \ntheir hours.\n  In Carlsbad, NM--which I visited 2 weeks ago--due to a reduction in \nhours of service, seniors and people with disabilities are forced to \nline up around\n\n[[Page S13220]]\n\nthe building, often waiting hours to get served. Even worse, some field \noffices are shutting their doors permanently.\n  Meanwhile, since 1990, the number of disabled workers drawing \ndisability benefits has more than doubled. That number has gone from 3 \nmillion in 1990 to 6.8 million today. Field offices are averaging over \n850,000 visitors a week during this current year.\n  As we know from the press, the first baby boomer officially filed for \nSocial Security last week. So the demands on Social Security are only \ngoing to increase. In addition, Congress has significantly increased \nthe Social Security Administration's responsibilities as part of the \nMedicare Part D legislation.\n  So the Social Security Administration finds itself in a very dire \ncircumstance. The Social Security Administration has over 1,400 field \nand hearing offices in cities and towns across the country. Mandatory \ncosts, such as program integrity, rent, guards, postage, employees' \nsalaries, and benefits are continuing to rise. Unfortunately, Congress \nappropriated on average each year for the last 7 years about $150 \nmillion less than the administration requested. The current budget \nsituation has simply been compounded by years of sustained underfunding \nby the Congress.\n  According to the Social Security Administration, the present cost of \nprocessing the hearing backlog would be $794 million. The difference \nbetween the amount of funding requested for administrative expenses and \nthe amount appropriated for fiscal years 2001 through 2007 is $962 \nmillion--more than enough to address the backlog. So if we had actually \nappropriated what the administration asked for during fiscal years 2001 \nthrough 2007, we would largely have this backlog problem solved. \nUnfortunately, we did not do that.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member of this subcommittee on \nthe Appropriations Committee for their significant efforts to address \nthe backlog. As you know, the chairman of the subcommittee has been a \ntireless leader on issues affecting individuals with disabilities. For \ndecades, he has led the way in the Senate on reducing barriers for \nindividuals with disabilities and ensuring full community \nparticipation.\n  Fortunately, the chairman and the ranking member recognized the \ncurrent challenges individuals with disabilities are facing in \naccessing disability benefits, and they have worked hard to increase \nadministrative funds for the Social Security Administration by $125 \nmillion over the amount that was requested by the President. I believe \nwe all recognize how important that infusion of funds will be.\n  In the committee report accompanying the bill that we are \nconsidering, the chairman requested the Commissioner of Social Security \nto set forth a plan to reduce the backlog. As submitted, the \nCommissioner's plan would include: accelerating review of cases that \nare likely or certain to be approved; improving hearing procedures; \nincreasing adjudicatory capacity; and increasing efficiency through \nautomation and improved business processes.\n  Unfortunately, the amount of funding in the bill does not go far \nenough, in my view, to substantially reduce the backlog. According to \nthe Commissioner, this amount of funding will merely ``stem the tide.'' \nIt will not address the backlog in a significant way.\n  The fiscal year 2008 budget resolution--which we all considered on \nthe floor, and many of us voted for--recommends an increase of $430 \nmillion above the President's request for the Social Security \nAdministration's administrative budget in order to reduce this backlog. \nThe amendment I am intending to offer later today would get us to half \nthat amount by increasing the Social Security Administration's \nadministrative budget by an additional $160 million. The amendment \nwould give the Social Security Administration the resources it needs to \nreduce the backlog to help get rid of these long lines.\n  The amendment is paid for. The amendment would shift excess Medicare \nfunds to pay for this critical increase in funding to the Social \nSecurity Administration in this 1 year. These offsetting funds have \nbeen identified in close collaboration with Finance Committee staff \nand, of course, Senator Baucus is a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  Importantly, these funds would be immediately replaced at the \nbeginning of fiscal year 2009 with generally available funding that was \npassed as part of the Transitional Medical Assistance extenders \npackage.\n  Finally, the amendment would also permit the U.S. Treasury Department \nto invest its excess operating capital. So this represents responsible \noversight by the Treasury Department. This policy has been recommended \nby the Government Accountability Office and others. It is estimated \nthis policy will generate tens of millions of dollars for the Federal \nGovernment over the next 10 years.\n  The bottom line is millions of American workers and their families--\npeople whom we represent--rely on Social Security to protect them \nagainst poverty in the event they are no longer able to work. This \nincredible insurance program is breaking down because of our failure to \nfund the administration of the program.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. It is being offered \non behalf of myself, Senator Snowe from Maine, and Senator Baucus from \nMontana.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe we have yet gotten to a point \nprocedurally where I am able to offer the amendment, so I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the floor.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Webb are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Casey are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let me take this opportunity to thank \nSenator Harkin and his staff for their very hard work on the Labor-HHS \nlegislation and commend the ranking member, Senator Specter, and his \nstaff as well. The reality is that the needs facing the people of our \ncountry who are impacted by this bill are enormous. There is, \nunfortunately, not enough funding available to accommodate those needs, \nand within that context, Senator Harkin and Senator Specter have done \ntheir very best.\n  I wish to say a few words about one particular program which is \nimportant to me, which is important to the people of Vermont, and which \nis vitally important to this whole country as we try to deal with the \nhealth care crisis our country is now facing, a crisis in which 47 \nmillion Americans have no health insurance, even more are underinsured, \nand the cost of health care is soaring every day. What this legislation \ndeals with and I think deals with quite well is understanding that it \nis important for us to grow the number of community health centers in \nthis country.\n  The community health center program is a wonderful success story, and \nit is widely recognized as one of the most cost-effective programs in \nthe entire Federal Government. Community health centers are community-\nrun. They are run by the people in the community themselves. They are \nrun on a nonprofit basis. They provide not only affordable health care \nto their people but affordable dental care, which is a growing crisis \nall over rural America and in the State of Vermont. They provide mental \nhealth counseling--another serious issue. They provide low-\n\n[[Page S13221]]\n\ncost prescription drugs--in fact, the lowest cost prescription drugs \navailable in America.\n  These federally qualified health centers serve people from all walks \nof life and all incomes. Whether you have private insurance, whether \nyou have Medicare, whether you have Medicaid, or whether you have no \nhealth insurance, you are welcome into these community health centers. \nFor those with no health insurance, payment is based on a sliding \nscale. If you don't have a whole lot of money, you don't have to pay a \nlot for your health or dental care.\n  Today, over 16 million Americans--16 million--benefit from the \nservices health centers provide in every State and in almost every \ncongressional district in our country. For an average Federal grant \nexpenditure of only $124 per patient per year, these centers offer \ncomprehensive health care, regardless of ability to pay. At a time when \nmore and more Americans are losing their health insurance, when they \nare finding it hard to secure primary health care, these centers play \nan extraordinary role, and they deserve to be adequately funded.\n  This legislation provides $2.24 billion for the community health \ncenter program--a $250 million increase above the fiscal year 2007 \nlevel. I thank Senators Harkin and Specter very much for their support \nfor this program. It is estimated that this increase will allow us to \nexpand or create some 500 new community health centers all over this \ncountry, serving an additional 2 million Americans. That is a big deal \nat a time when millions and millions of people are unable to find \nprimary health care or just don't have the funds to pay for it. Given \nthe fact that we have 47 million uninsured, it is clear this is not \nenough, but it is a significant step forward.\n  In Vermont in recent years, we have expanded the number of federally \nqualified health centers from two to six, and my hope is that we can \nadd an additional three or four more centers in the next 3 years. These \ncenters now serve over 86,000 Vermonters and provide quality health \ncare, quality dental care, low-cost prescription drugs, and mental \nhealth counseling in some 23 different locations around the State of \nVermont. The centers are the medical home for 24 percent of Vermont's \nMedicaid beneficiaries and serve 19 percent of our uninsured.\n  Nationally, health centers are not only providing quality, efficient \ncare in underserved communities, they are filling a major gap in our \nNation's health care system where primary care is becoming a lost \nprofession. It is no secret that in many parts of America, especially \nrural America, it is very, very hard for people to locate a primary \nhealth care physician. It is also imperative that these centers play a \nrole, which allow people to go to them rather than flooding emergency \nrooms in hospitals, which are much more expensive.\n  In addition to this appropriations bill, we are also in the process \nof reauthorizing the community health center program in the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee on which I serve, and I thank \nour chairman and our ranking member for putting forth this important \nlegislation that has the support of 68 Members from both sides of the \naisle.\n  So I think this issue of community health centers is very much an \nissue and an area supported by people from different political \nperspectives. It is doing an enormous job in providing health care to \nmillions of Americans. I am glad we are going to take a step forward \nwhen we pass this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Methamphetamine Control\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, in September, the Finance Committee held \na hearing on the efficacy, over the past year, of the Combat \nMethamphetamine Epidemic Act, or the Combat Meth Act, for short. The \nCombat Meth Act implemented restrictions on drugs that go into the \nproduction of methamphetamines. Methamphetamine abuse has devastated \nlives, families, and communities across our Nation and across the \nworld. The testimony given at this hearing by the U.S. Department of \nHomeland Security, the U.S. Department of State, and State agencies \nindicated that while the Combat Meth Act helped reduce the home \nproduction of methamphetamine across the U.S., it is now flowing at \nhistoric levels across our borders from countries where production \ncontrols are much less rigid.\n  A 2006 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration \nreport found that my home State of Idaho had one of the highest rates \nof methamphetamine use in the preceding 12 months of those aged 12 and \nolder. In rural Idaho, especially, the issue of methamphetamine abuse \nhas almost become commonplace: I visit with local officials and \ncommunity leaders to hear about problems affecting their community when \nI am home in Idaho. When I ask if it is still a problem, the response \nis almost always ``of course,'' as if the very question was a little \nnaive. This troubles me greatly.\n  Thomas Siebel, chairman and founder of the highly successful Montana \nMeth Project, also testified at the September Finance Committee hearing \non the Combat Meth Act. The Montana Meth Project was established in \n2005 as a nonprofit organization created to reduce first-time \nmethamphetamine use through public-service messaging, public policy and \ncommunity outreach. In the 2 years since the project has been active in \nMontana, the State has gone from being fifth in the Nation for per \ncapita meth use to 39th today--a staggering change. Adult meth use is \ndown in Montana by as much as 70 percent. The Montana Meth Project is \nan example of a highly effective private sector education and \nprevention effort. This success is also good news for Arizona, Illinois \nand my State of Idaho, all three of which have started their own ``Meth \nProjects.'' While this is very encouraging, we have a long way to go.\n  Montana and Idaho are just two States that have been overwhelmingly \naffected by meth production, use and addiction. Rural communities \nnationwide have been hit particularly hard by the demand and presence \nof this lethal drug, creating major challenges for law enforcement, \nhealth and welfare and environmental protection agencies, not to \nmention our families and school systems.\n  I have been approached by police officers, community leaders, health \nadvocates, school administrators, and criminal justice leaders about \nthe severe toll that this drug takes on our citizens, particularly \nteens and young adults. They have witnessed destroyed relationships and \nfamilies torn apart, all suffering from this drug that invades \nneighborhoods, friends, and families. According to Idaho's Department \nof Health and Welfare, the number of children in foster care increased \nby 40 percent between 2002 and 2006. Approximately 3,000 children enter \nfoster care in Idaho every year; the majority of them are children of \nmeth-addicted single mothers. Our children are the unwitting and \nhelpless victims of this menacing drug epidemic.\n  There is some encouraging news but, as is the case with drug \ntrafficking, it is tempered with alarming trends. In 1999, Idaho \nimplemented an initiative to fight meth production, coordinating \nregional and State level law enforcement efforts. These efforts have \nproven highly successful. In 2000, 186 meth labs were seized. In 2004, \nthe number had dropped to 38 thanks to this enhanced coordination \nstrategy. According to Idaho law enforcement agencies, meth lab \nseizures are now at an all-time low, which has resulted in less danger \nto neighborhoods and communities, as well as to environmental \nprotection workers who are responsible for doing clean up of these \nsites after they are seized.\n  At the Finance Committee hearing last month, Gary Kendall, director, \nState of Iowa Governor's Office of Drug Control Policy, testified that \nIowa had also seen success with ``State and local prevention efforts'' \nand ``multijurisdictional task forces.''\n  At the national and international level, according to the State \nDepartment Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, \nsince the passage last year of the Combat Meth Act, methamphetamine \nabuse has been trending slightly downward in the United States; \nunfortunately, worldwide consumption is growing. This is due in large \npart to the fact that, compared to organic illegal drugs such as\n\n[[Page S13222]]\n\nopiates and cocaine, methamphetamine is relatively easy to manufacture, \ncan be produced just about anywhere and has a very substantial profit \nmargin. It is the State Department's assessment that international \nmitigation and control of this disturbing worldwide trend can only be \nmaintained by strong U.S. leadership. We have seen some success in \nrecent months and years. During the first 6 months of this year, \nOperation Crystal Flow, a joint operation between the U.S. Government \nand governments in North and South America and West Asia, saw the \nhalting, suspension or seizure of 53 tons of chemicals that go into \nmeth production--so-called precursor drugs.\n  This operation was the joint effort of the International Narcotics \nControl Board through its Project Prism Task Force which includes the \nU.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and authorities in 126 other nations. This \nis just one of a number of international efforts in which the U.S. \nGovernment is participating.\n  With the crackdown here at home on methamphetamine production, the \nsupply source has changed. Today, Mexico is the principal foreign \nsupplier of methamphetamine to the United States. According to the \nState Department, 80 percent of drug addicts in Mexicali and Tijuana \nare using meth. Mexico itself has a very serious methamphetamine \naddiction problem among its population and, because of the success of \nthe Combat Meth Act and activities undertaken by individual States, \nU.S. demand for the drug has gone south, so to speak. Meth from so-\ncalled ``superlabs'' in Mexico is reaching beyond the already-\nestablished demand of my State and surrounding western and southwestern \nStates to other areas in the United States: we're seeing it in the \nGreat Lakes, the Northeast, and Southeast.\n  Again, the lure of an enormous profit margin, coupled with the highly \naddictive nature of meth is a proven recipe for even greater disaster. \nThe Mexican Government has been working over the past few years to \nexert more sweeping control of the movement of large amounts of \nmethamphetamine precursor drugs. Our Government is working with the \nMexican Government in ongoing border security and drug trafficking \ninitiatives, but as supply lines are squelched in one area, they \nrestart in other areas and other countries where controls and law \nenforcement are lacking. As I stated earlier, this is an international \nproblem and efforts, led by the United States, must be global in scope.\n  According to the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, methamphetamine seizures have steadily increased. \nAlthough Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has increased its \nbilateral and multilateral drug interdiction efforts in recent years, \nand drug seizures are up, the supply is also increasing as it becomes \nthe drug of choice for 15 to 16 million people worldwide.\n  Our work to combat meth is a multipronged process and, as I said \nearlier, rural areas and States have been hit particularly hard by this \ntrend. Small towns in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and other States remain \nunder siege by the meth epidemic. These are not communities with \nsubstantial numbers of law enforcement personnel and resources, massive \nrevenue bases, or specialized departments and offices to fight back.\n  Recently, an Idahoan with over 20 years' experience working with \ndrug-endangered children shared an idea with me on how to best fight \nthe meth problem in rural communities. His recommendation was that the \nFederal Government should assist local communities in forming multi-\norganization, school, parent, and agency task forces to educate \nchildren and adults about the perils of meth addiction. He reminded me \nthat these task forces exert community and peer pressure to report the \npresence of labs and those selling and using meth in the community. In \nIdaho, this approach has proven to be the most effective way to combat \nmeth problems in our rural communities. Educating people before they \ntry meth like the Montana Meth Project has done, enabling and \nenergizing local collaborative task forces to spread the word that \ntheir communities say ``no'' to meth, and maintaining a zero tolerance \npolicy that includes severe penalties for breaking the law, will help \nreduce demand and dry up supply.\n  Integral to fighting methamphetamine in our communities is educating \nour children. To that end in Idaho, I have partnered with the Idaho \nState Department of Education Safe and Drug Free Schools program and \nissued a call for high schools across my State to create public service \nannouncements that seek to educate other students about the dangers of \nmethamphetamine abuse, on the model of the highly successful Montana \nMeth Project. Getting our youth involved directly in this outreach and \neducation effort will reduce the potential for methamphetamine use.\n  Considering the growing international methamphetamine epidemic, it is \nin our Nation's interest to remain very active in cooperative endeavors \nsuch as those in which the State Department, the U.S. Drug Enforcement \nAgency, and the Department of Homeland Security are currently involved. \nThese successful programs deserve continued funding in order to stop \nthe supply of meth coming into our neighborhoods.\n  It is time for our Nation to mobilize to fight this deadly drug. It \nis time to let foreign drug traffickers know that the United States is \nclosed to meth business. We have witnessed enough children with ruined \nbodies, minds, and lives. We have seen enough adults abandon their \nparental and societal responsibilities for the lie that is a meth high. \nWe have seen the tragedy of newborn babies taken away from mothers \nunable to care for them, and the infants themselves suffering the same \nterrible addiction.\n  Meth continues to ravage America's communities, large and small. This \nwill require an increased effort from the Federal Government to bring \nan end to meth use and production in these places. It is especially \nimportant to focus Federal dollars where they are truly needed--in \nrural communities nationwide that don't have the manpower or other \nresources to fight this battle alone. I call on my colleagues to \nsupport critical effective efforts in their respective States to work \ntoward meth-free communities, and to continue to support U.S. \nleadership and involvement in international drug trafficking \ninterdiction and suppression efforts.\n  There are many things we can do from the Federal level to the State \nlevel to the local community and, frankly, the family and individual \nlevels to fight meth in this country.\n  One of the most important findings is simply educating people about \nthe risks involved in the use of methamphetamines. It is critical to \nour ability to reduce the demand and to be able to get a handle on \nfighting the supply.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I want to talk about two amendments I have offered that \nhopefully will be voted on very shortly. Is there any kind of unanimous \nconsent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Just to alert the managers of the bill, I probably will \nnot talk for more than about 10 minutes total.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3342\n\n  The first amendment I want to talk about is the amendment that deals \nwith the totalization agreement between the United States and Mexico, \nthe latest attempt to drain the Social Security trust fund.\n  In 2004, the Commissioner of Social Security signed a totalization \nagreement with the Director General of the Mexican Social Security \nInstitute. While the President has not yet submitted the United States-\nMexico totalization agreement to Congress, I am concerned that the \nagreement can severely impact the Social Security trust fund and \nthreaten the retirement benefits of hard-working Americans.\n\n[[Page S13223]]\n\n  The proposed totalization agreement with Mexico does not contain \nprotections against fraud, and there are too many unanswered questions \nabout its cost to American taxpayers. The Government Accountability \nOffice has already warned us that the proposed totalization agreement \nwith Mexico will likely increase the number of unauthorized workers and \nmake their family members eligible for Social Security benefits.\n  Mexican workers, who ordinarily would not receive benefits because \nthey lack the required 10 years of legally documented employment in the \nUnited States, could qualify for partial Social Security benefits with \nas little as 1\\1/2\\ years of work history.\n  More family members living in Mexico would also qualify for United \nStates Social Security benefits, because the proposed agreement waives \nrules that prevent payments to noncitizens such as children and spouses \nliving outside the United States.\n  Because the Mexican Government does not keep sufficient records of \nbirths, deaths, and marriages, it would be nearly impossible to \ndetermine whether someone died so that the Social Security \nAdministration could discontinue sending benefits. The Social Security \nAdministration estimates that 50,000 additional Mexican workers would \nqualify for these benefits in the first 5 years, for a total estimated \ncost of over $500 million. During that same time period, the agreement \nwould save U.S. workers a little over $100 million. If you do the math, \nit appears the cost of the agreement could be almost four times the \nsavings.\n  Before we send scarce Social Security dollars to a foreign country, \nCongress must first determine whether a totalization agreement is in \nthe best interests of our country.\n  To protect Social Security benefits to U.S. citizens, and to preserve \nthe program for future generations, I am offering this amendment today. \nMy amendment would bar funding for the administration of benefit \npayments under a totalization agreement with Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3352\n\n  I am also offering a second amendment. There have been many media \nreports recently about those who are here illegally stealing American \nSocial Security numbers. Every year employers are advised that nearly \n800,000 employees do not have valid matching Social Security numbers. \nIn too many of those cases, the numbers that are used belong to someone \nelse in America.\n  Today, I am going take a few moments to share with my colleagues a \nfew of the stories of victims of identity theft. I have shared some of \nthese stories in the past. Last year I spoke about Audra, who had been \na stay-at-home mom since 2000. Her Social Security number was being \nused by at least 218 different illegal immigrants, mostly in Texas, to \nobtain jobs. The IRS accused her of owing back taxes of over $1 million \non other people's illegal work.\n  There was also Caleb, who lives in Nevada with his wife and two young \nchildren. In December of 2003 Caleb was unable to work and he applied \nfor unemployment benefits. He was denied benefits that were rightfully \nhis and was told that it was because he was already working as a \nlandscaper in Las Vegas. Las Vegas and Reno are about 500 miles apart. \nIt would have been very difficult for this unemployed worker in Nevada.\n  Stories such as this are all too common. States have experienced a \ncrime spree involving illegal immigrants using the stolen identities of \nchildren. In one case in Utah, a child apparently owns a cleaning \ncompany and works as a prep cook at two restaurants in Salt Lake City. \nThat is a lot of responsibility, especially for a little 8-year-old \nboy.\n  A little boy in Salt Lake City supposedly works for an express air \nfreight company; quite an important job for an 11-year-old.\n  These stories are quite shocking. Americans are being denied \nunemployment benefits and are being unfairly targeted for failure to \npay taxes on money they did not earn. My amendment prohibits the Social \nSecurity Administration from using funds to process claims for work \nperformed under a stolen or fraudulent Social Security number.\n  We should not reward individuals who have knowingly engaged in \nillegal behavior. My amendment will ensure that the 218 illegal \nimmigrants who stole Audra's Social Security number will not receive \nbenefits from the Social Security trust fund. The landscaper who stole \nCaleb's Social Security number will not get credit for his work using \none of my constituent's numbers, and the prep cook who stole an 8-year-\nold's Social Security number will not get credit for victimizing a \nchild either.\n  We should value hard work and reward those who play by the rules. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to support both of these important \namendments.\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              GOLDEN GAVEL\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the hour of 5 o'clock has arrived, and the \noccupant of the chair has now presided over the Senate for 100 hours. \nThat is commendable. The Senator is the fourth to have done it this \nyear. I am proud and appreciative of that. It is not easy to preside \nfor 100 hours. Sometimes it is difficult. Frankly, having presided over \nthe Senate many hours myself--never 100 in a year, as the Senator has \ndone--I know it is a very grueling process. You not only see the debate \ngoing on here on the floor but all things going on, as it has happened \ntoday, outside of the microphones. So with the Senator's experience as \na Government worker, we are so glad to have her in the Senate. The \npeople of Missouri sent us a real dandy when they sent the Senator \nhere. Congratulations.\n  What I didn't say is that when someone serves for 100 hours, they get \na golden gavel, which is a nice award. It has a nice case, and it is \nsomething the Senator will always have to remember her first year in \nthe Senate.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is never really easy. We have a lot of \nprocedural stuff. I have tried to be as patient as I can be. I have \nacknowledged publicly that the two managers have done everything within \ntheir power to move this bill; 12:30 has passed but the good faith is \nstill here. We are going to work through and finish this bill. We have \nlost a few hours, but I think with this agreement we will accomplish \neverything we need to do, even if we had completed this bill earlier \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the following be the only \namendments or motions remaining in order to the bill; that there be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to each vote, equally divided and controlled in \nthe usual form, and that there be 20 minutes of debate equally divided \nand controlled prior to a vote on the motion to commit; that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order other than as specified in this \nagreement; that upon disposition of all amendments and motions, if the \nmotion to commit is defeated, then the substitute amendment, as \namended, be agreed to, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate \nproceed to vote on passage of the bill with the vote sequence as listed \nbelow.\n  I will talk specifically about the listing of the amendments and the \norder in which they will be voted upon because this has been negotiated \nfor the last several hours. After the first vote, the time for each \nvote be 10 minutes each. They will be voted on in the following order: \nNo. 1, Cardin, No. 3400; No. 2, Ensign, No. 3342; No. 3, Ensign, No. \n3352; No. 4, Vitter, No. 3328, and that it be in order for the \namendment to be modified if agreed upon by the managers or Senator \nVitter; the Dorgan pending amendment, No. 3345, will be withdrawn--that \nwill be done by either Senator Dorgan or the chairman, Senator\n\n[[Page S13224]]\n\nHarkin--No. 5, Bingaman, No. 3440, with 2 minutes each, Bingaman and \nKyl; No. 6, Kennedy, No. 3433, as modified; No. 7, Grassley-Sanders, \nNo. 3396, and that the amendment be modified with the changes at the \ndesk, and it is my understanding there will be a voice vote on that; \nNo. 8, Schumer, No. 3404, as amended by the Durbin amendment, No. \n3449--voice vote; No. 9, DeMint amendment on first-class air travel to \nbe offered and agreed to; No. 10, Chambliss amendment No. 3391, as \nmodified; No. 11, Republican motion to commit.\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent that upon the passage of H.R. 3043 \nthe Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House \non the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized \nto appoint conferees, and that the Senate then proceed to executive \nsession to consider the nomination of Leslie Southwick to be U.S. \nCircuit judge; that a cloture motion on the nomination be filed at that \ntime; that there be 4 hours for debate on the motion with the time to \nbe divided between Senators Leahy and Specter or their designees, and \nthat 2 hours of that time be used today with the remaining time to be \nused tomorrow; following the Senate's convening at 9 a.m., that the \nSenate vote on cloture on the nomination to occur at 11 a.m. tomorrow; \nthat if cloture is invoked, the Senate then vote immediately on \nconfirmation of the nomination; if cloture is not invoked, the \nnomination be returned to the calendar and the Senate return to \nlegislative session; if the nomination is confirmed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table, the President be immediately notified \nof the Senate's action, and the Senate return to legislative session; \nthat regardless of the outcome, once the Senate returns to legislative \nsession there be 20 minutes equally divided for debate between the two \nleaders or their designees prior to the cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed to S. 2205, the DREAM Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Regretfully reserving the right to object, after the \nmajority leader began to read this agreement, I have one potential snag \nover here, and I think it will be cleared shortly. I would like to \nsuggest we have a quorum call briefly and let me check out one more \nthing. We should be able to go forward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding there is a unanimous consent \npending; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is correct. Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3345 Withdrawn\n\n  Under the previous order, the Dorgan amendment No. 3345 is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 3443, as Modified, to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, before we start, I send a modification to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration on amendment No. 3443 \nfor Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for Mr. Hatch, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3443, as modified.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the amendment has been agreed to on both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the \nprevious vote on amendment No. 3430, the Feingold amendment. I now send \nto the desk a modification of that amendment and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment \n3430, as modified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3430), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                    AMENDMENT NO. 3430, as modified\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n       Sec. __.

Mr. President, under the previous unanimous consent \nagreement, I call up Kennedy amendment No. 3433, and I send a \nmodification to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for Mr. Kennedy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3433, as modified.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3433) as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                    AMENDMENT NO. 3433, as modified\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  Prior to January 1, 2008, the Secretary of \n     Education may not terminate any voluntary flexible agreement \n     under section 428A of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 1078-1) that exists on the date of enactment of this \n     Act. With respect to an entity with which the Secretary of \n     Education has a voluntary flexible agreement under section \n     428A of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1078-1) \n     on the date of enactment of this Act that is not cost \n     neutral, if the Secretary terminates such agreement after \n     January 1, 2008, the Secretary of Education shall, not later \n     than December 31, 2008--\n       (1) negotiate to enter, and enter, into a new voluntary \n     flexible agreement with such entity so that the agreement is \n     cost neutral, unless such entity does not want to enter into \n     such agreement.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3400\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Parliamentary inquiry: What is the \namendment now before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Cardin amendment No. 3400.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment. It is offered by Senator Smith and myself. Refugees who come \nto this country are entitled to loans to help them defray the cost of \ntransportation and to resettlement assistance once they arrive. I am \nfor that.\n  This amendment provides similar benefits to those who qualify for \nSpecial Immigration Visas. These are Iraqi and Afghan translators who \nhave helped us, and now, in risk of their lives, are allowed to come to \na safe haven, the United States.\n  This amendment extends a helping hand to those who have helped us \nunder very difficult and dangerous circumstances. As I indicated, \nrefugees are entitled to this benefit for up to 7 years. This provides \nbenefits for only up to 6 months for the SIV holders.\n  It is carefully crafted. It has been scored at not adding additional \ncosts to the budget. I think this is a matter of basic fairness. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Cardin-Smith amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, since no one is here to speak in \nopposition, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from North Dakota \n(Mr. Conrad), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) would vote ``aye.''\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez).

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3342\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on Ensign amendment No. 3342.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr President, I am going to vote for the amendment offered \nby Senator Ensign with respect to the U.S.-Mexico Totalization \nAgreement, and I wanted to take a few minutes to explain my thinking on \nthis issue.\n  The United States has negotiated totalization agreements with more \nthan 20 countries. These agreements establish mechanisms for \ncoordinating our respective Social Security systems so that U.S. \ncitizens working abroad are treated fairly. For example, the agreements \nhelp prevent Americans from being subject to unfair double taxation. \nThey also help ensure that work in each country can be combined for \npurposes of qualifying for benefits, so that those who split their \ncareers between countries are not left uncovered. Of course, while \ntheir purpose is to protect American interests, the agreements also \nprovide reciprocal benefits to citizens of the other countries.\n  Totalization agreements can be win-win arrangements that benefit both \nsides, provided they are crafted carefully to ensure that their \nbenefits and their burdens are reasonably balanced. No agreement, no \nmatter how carefully drafted, is likely to impose identical costs on \nboth countries. More likely, there will be some difference in the \nburdens borne and benefits received by each nation. And if the United \nStates ends up paying far more in benefits to citizens of another \ncountry than American citizens receive, our national interests could \ndictate that we reject or renegotiate that agreement.\n  The need to carefully scrutinize a proposed totalization agreement is \nespecially great because its costs could directly affect the Social \nSecurity benefits of virtually all Americans in the future. This type \nof agreement has the potential of imposing significant burdens on the \nSocial Security trust fund. Although the Congressional Budget Office \nprojects that the trust fund will be solvent through 2046, we should be \ncareful before approving any measure that would worsen the program's \nlong-term challenges. Otherwise, the end result could be unnecessarily \ndeep cuts in benefits or excessive increases in taxes for Americans.\n\n[[Page S13226]]\n\n  Given this, I believe it is important that President Bush not be \ngiven unilateral power to negotiate and implement agreements without \nsignificant congressional involvement. Current law allows Congress to \nreject an agreement, but this mechanism probably is unconstitutional \nunder the Supreme Court's Chadha decision, which invalidated so-called \nlegislative vetoes. We need to develop a new mechanism, and I am \npleased that Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley have been working in a \nbipartisan manner to develop one.\n  While those efforts are ongoing, I believe it is appropriate to take \ninterim steps to ensure that the Bush administration is not allowed to \nimplement a totalization agreement unilaterally. That is what the \nEnsign amendment does. While not making a final determination about \nwhether an agreement should be approved, the amendment effectively \nwould ensure that, for the next fiscal year, an agreement with Mexico \nwill not be implemented without congressional approval. I think that \nmakes sense.\n  In my view, the Ensign amendment would have been stronger had it \napplied to all totalization agreements, not just the agreement with \nMexico. Not only would that have helped ensure that all agreements \nserve our national interests, but it would have eliminated any \nperception that we are unfairly singling out Mexico for special \ntreatment. Having said that, I do understand the view of the General \nAccounting Office that the Mexican agreement is, ``both qualitatively \nand quantitatively different than any other agreement signed to date,'' \nlargely because of the potential impact of the many workers who have \ncome from Mexico into the United States. The extent of that impact is \nunclear. In any case, surely this complex issue deserves to be \nconsidered seriously here in the Congress before any agreement is \nimplemented.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in consultation with Senator Ensign, he \ndoes not wish to use his time. So, therefore, we yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, the next amendment up would be Senator \nVitter's amendment No. 3328. I have a modification I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3328), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 79, after line 4, insert:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds appropriated in this Act may be \n     used to prevent an individual not in the business of \n     importing a prescription drug (within the meaning of section \n     801(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n     381(g)) from importing a prescription drug from Canada that \n     complies with sections 501, 502, and 505 of the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 351, 352, and 355) and is \n     not--\n       (1) a controlled substance, as defined in section 102 of \n     the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802); or\n       (2) a biological product, as defined in section 351 of the \n     Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262).\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my amendment, \nAmendment No. 3328, which is currently pending to the Labor-HHS-\nEducation Appropriations bill before the Senate. My original amendment \nis simple. It would stop officials at HHS from\n\n[[Page S13227]]\n\npreventing individuals from bringing back a prescribed medication for \nthemselves from Canada. I have agreed to make two modifications to my \namendment. My amendment, as modified, would add explicit restrictions \non controlled substances and biological products from my amendment.\n  Therefore, as modified, my amendment prohibits funds from preventing \nindividuals, not wholesalers, from importing prescriptions for \nthemselves, and that because there is no restriction in my language as \nto how they may import these prescriptions, it is understood that mail \norder and Internet importation is not prohibited along with carrying on \nthe person over the border. All controlled substances and biological \nproducts are prohibited.\n  It is my understanding that my amendment will be accepted by voice \nvote today on the agreement that the chairman and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Harkin and Senator Specter, will work hard for \nits inclusion in the final conference report for the final legislative \nvehicle for this bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the sentiments by the Senator \nfrom Louisiana and accept this proposal on this modified amendment and \nwill ask that it be adopted by unanimous consent. I agree to work hard \nfor inclusion of this amendment in the conference report of the final \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I concur with my colleague and confirm \nthis agreement with my colleague from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are ready to vote on the Vitter \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3328), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is to be recognized.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 3440, as Modified, to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment to add $150 million \nto the Social Security Administration account so that they can deal \nwith the enormous backlog of cases that are pending there in people \napplying for disability benefits. The average wait is 523 days now. If \na person filed today for a hearing in Social Security, they would \nexpect to get that hearing in June of 2009. That is unacceptable. We \nneed to do better. This amendment will help us do that.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest that this is absolutely \nimperative. For citizens who are on disability to have to wait 2 years \non an appeal, as the Senator said, is unacceptable. The money this is \nproviding will take care of that. He asked the administrator, and that \nis what is needed, and we ought to do it. We have Social Security and \ndisability, and then they make them wait 2 years, and all of the \noffices are being cut back because they don't have enough operating \nmoney. We should pass this amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3440, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3440, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n         At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                           General Provisions\n\n       Sec. 401. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, the amount appropriated under the heading ``limitation \n     on administrative expenses'' under the heading ``Social \n     Security Administration'' shall be increased by $150,000,000.\n       (b) Section 1848(l)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395w-4(l)(2)(A)), as amended by section 6 of the TMA, \n     Abstinence Education, and QI Programs Extension Act of 2007 \n     (Public Law 110-90), is amended by striking \n     ``$1,350,000,000'' and inserting ``$1,200,000,000, but in no \n     case shall expenditures from the Fund in fiscal year 2008 \n     exceed $650,000,000'' in the first sentence.\n       (c) Section 323 of title 31, United States Code, is amended \n     to read as follows:\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, do we have an opportunity to address it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes on each side.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the goals of this \namendment. I want to speak about process so that nobody gets the \nunderstanding that the Committee on Finance has given up jurisdiction \nover this area. We also want to explain that the offset is coming from \nthe Medicare physician assistance and quality initiative fund, which we \nhave set aside to make sure doctors don't get a 10-percent cut this \nyear in their formula. That is something which is going to come out of \nthe Finance Committee in the next few weeks.\n  The reason we are going along with this offset is we have found \nanother offset that will fill the void in this fund I just referred to, \nso that we will be able to keep this whole. I advise people that just \nbecause we are allowing this fund to be tapped, we are not going to tap \nthis fund again because we are going to save this to make sure we can \nhelp doctors not get cut in their reimbursement on Medicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield back the remaining time and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the \nSenator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) would vote ``aye.''\n  Mr. LOTT.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I will say a few words about this \namendment.\n  I thank Senator Grassley for working with me on this amendment. We \nmodified the original amendment. This amendment is substantially \nsimilar to the amendment Senator Grassley and I offered last May on the \nimmigration reform bill which passed the Senate with a bipartisan vote \nof 59 to 35.\n  This amendment is motivated by one major concern. We want to make \ncertain that young Americans receive the educational opportunities they \nneed in order to obtain the professional, good-paying jobs that are \ncoming about in this country. To do that, we need to make sure they \nhave the college education they need in math, science, engineering, \nhealth care, and other professional fields.\n  This amendment also expands the Jacob Javits Gifted and Talented \nEducational Program, long supported by Senator Grassley.\n  This amendment will accomplish these goals by adding a $3,500 \nsurcharge on companies that utilize the H-1B program, the same \nsurcharge that 59 Senators supported last May.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak to what this bill does \nor does not do for our most promising students.\n  In his best selling book, ``The World Is Flat,'' Thomas Friedman \ndiscusses the challenges of globalism using the metaphor of the world \ngetting flatter.\n  What he means is that international barriers to the movement of \ngoods, services, people, and ideas are breaking down. That means that \nAmerican businesses are facing competition from different sources, and \nthe competition will only get fiercer.\n  If Americans want us to remain an economic leader and keep high \npaying jobs, we will need to stay one step ahead of others around the \nworld in coming up with new ideas and innovative products and services.\n  Thomas Friedman likens this moment in American history to the height \nof the Cold War when the Soviet Union leaped ahead of America in the \nspace race by putting up the Sputnik satellite.\n  In response to Sputnik, Congress passed the National Defense \nEducation Act, which really started the Federal involvement in \neducation.\n  According to Thomas Friedman, to meet the challenges of what he calls \n``flatism'' will require, ``as comprehensive, energetic, and focused a \nresponse as did meeting the challenge of communism.''\n  We have heard a lot of talk in Congress about the need to do \nsomething about American competitiveness.\n  In fact, earlier this year we passed the America COMPETES bill, \nauthorizing a series of new programs designed to stimulate advanced \nlearning by young Americans. But are we serious about that?\n  The bill before us today is a $5.35 billion increase over the \nprevious year. That is not small potatoes. That is enough to give a \nboost to a lot of programs.\n  But one program that is not seeing a boost is the only source of \nFederal\n\n[[Page S13229]]\n\nfunds currently focused on helping meet the unique learning needs of \ngifted and talented students.\n  The Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act has suffered a \nseries of cuts in recent years due to across-the-board rescissions.\n  For the current fiscal year, Congress passed an unusual type of \nmodified continuing resolution.\n  While the continuing resolution contained no specific language \nfurther cutting funding for gifted education, the program mysteriously \nsuffered a significant 21 percent cut.\n  In total, gifted and talented education has taken a 33 percent cut \nsince 2002, and that is not adjusted for inflation. The current bill \nretains that cut.\n  If we are serious about maintaining America's competitive edge \ninternationally, our most promising students must be challenged and \nsupported to reach their full potential.\n  We need these talented young people to go on to pursue advanced \ndegrees and make the technological innovations that drive our economy.\n  Make no mistake, that will not happen by itself.\n  Gifted students learn faster and to a greater depth than other \nstudents and often look at the world differently than other students. \nAs a result, it takes a great deal more to keep them challenged and \nstimulated.\n  If gifted students are not sufficiently stimulated, they often learn \nto get by with minimum effort and adopt poor learning habits that can \nprevent them from achieving their potential.\n  In fact, many gifted and talented students underachieve or even drop \nout of school.\n  The book ``Genius Denied,'' by Jan and Bob Davidson from the majority \nleader's home, the State of Nevada, chronicles how we are letting \ngifted students throughout the Nation fall through the cracks, wasting \ntheir potential.\n  The Belin-Blank Center in my home State of Iowa produced a report \ntitled, ``A Nation Deceived: How Schools Hold Back America's Brightest \nStudents.''\n  We must do a better job of developing American talent if America is \nto remain competitive in the global economy.\n  Twice now, on the competitiveness bill and the immigration bill, I \nhave proposed an amendment to provide an appropriate funding source for \ngifted and talented education.\n  My proposal would increase the fee employers pay for H-1B visas for \nhighly skilled foreign workers to come to the United States and use \nthat additional funding for the Jacob Javits Gifted and Talented \nStudents Education Act.\n  H-1B visas are temporary visas.\n  Highly skilled foreign workers come to the United States, often \nworking for less than Americans, and garner useful experience with \nAmerican companies.\n  Then, by the nature of the H-1B program, they go home to use their \ntalent in their native country.\n  That is hardly a permanent solution to our need for talented workers.\n  Doesn't it make sense to charge a fee to those investing in temporary \ntalent from abroad and use it to invest in permanent talent for the \nfuture here at home?\n  The modified amendment at the desk is a compromise that I worked out \nwith the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders.\n  The modification includes language that was agreed to during the \nimmigration debate.\n  In fact, a similar amendment passed the Senate with a 59-vote \nmajority.\n  It would increase the fee for H-1B visas and use the revenue to \nsupport gifted and talented education as well as an American \nCompetitiveness Scholarship Program that the Senator from Vermont has \nauthored.\n  I support his goal of creating a scholarship program for students \npursuing a degree in math, engineering, health care, or computer \nscience.\n  I appreciate Senator Sanders's willingness to help me and to provide \nneeded funding for gifted and talented students.\n  We cannot continue to shortchange our best and brightest students and \nstill expect excellence from them.\n  Gifted students are the innovators of tomorrow that will keep our \neconomic pump primed.\n  For their sake and ours, we cannot afford to squander this vital \nnational resource.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If there is no one else to speak, I yield back the \nremaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nWithout objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3396), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3404 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand the next amendment is the \nSchumer amendment No. 3404.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As amended by the Durbin amendment No. 3449.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for Mr. Schumer, for \n     himself and Mrs. Hutchison, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3404 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To increase the domestic supply of nurses and physical \n                  therapists, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 126, between lines 7 and 8, add the following:\n       Sec. 521.  Section 106(d) of the American Competitiveness \n     in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-313; \n     8 U.S.C. 1153 note) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)--\n       (A) by inserting ``1996, 1997,'' after ``available in \n     fiscal year''; and\n       (B) by inserting ``group I,'' after ``schedule A,'';\n       (2) in paragraph (2)(A), by inserting ``1996, 1997, and'' \n     after ``available in fiscal years''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) Petitions.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall \n     provide a process for reviewing and acting upon petitions \n     with respect to immigrants described in schedule A not later \n     than 30 days after the date on which a completed petition has \n     been filed.''.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3449 to Amendment No. 3404\n\n(Purpose: To increase the number of nursing faculty and students in the \n  United States, to encourage global health care cooperation, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I call up the Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for Mr. Durbin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3449 to amendment No. 3404.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my second degree amendment reflects my \nbelief that we cannot continue to import nurses from other countries \nwithout also taking steps to step up capacity for training nurses here \nin the U.S. We all know that the United States faces a serious shortage \nof qualified nurses. Projections show that by the year 2020, our \ncountry will fall short of the nurses we need by one million nurses.\n  Why do we have this looming shortage? Certainly it is due in part to \nour growing and aging population. But there are also structural \nproblems with the domestic nursing system that limit the number of \nnurses we educate and train in this country. The main structural \nproblems are an insufficient number of nurse educators and a shortage \nof clinical space for training. An American Association of Colleges of \nNursing survey showed that nursing colleges denied admission to nearly \n43,000 qualified applicants in 2006 academic year. The top reasons \nthese applications were not accepted were insufficient faculty and not \nenough admissions slots. This is a bottleneck that is stifling the \nsupply of nurses in this country. And we need to fix it.\n  We need to devote resources to training and hiring new nursing \nfaculty and expanding clinical space for nursing schools so they can \naccept more qualified students. These investments will exponentially \nincrease the number of trained American nurses. The Schumer-Hutchison \namendment's approach to fixing our nursing shortage is to allow up to \n61,000 foreign nurses to enter the country as green card holders. \nImporting these thousands of foreign nurses is only a band-aid solution \nto our projected nursing shortage of 1\n\n[[Page S13230]]\n\nmillion. But it is also a step that deflates any momentum towards \nfinding real solutions for our domestic nursing crisis. We have done \nthese nursing visa recaptures before. In fact, 2 years ago in 2005, the \nPresident signed into law a recapture of 50,000 nursing visas as part \nof that year's Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act. Did this 2005 \nvisa recapture stop the nursing shortage? Of course not. It was a band-\naid solution. But it did undermine momentum for efforts to undertake \nthe real reform that we know we need. And so here we are again, 2 years \nlater, with hospitals desperate for more nurses.\n  My second degree amendment is a reasonable compromise that will help \nboth the hospitals in the short term and the domestic nursing supply in \nthe long term. My amendment would require employers who successfully \npetition for a recaptured nursing green card to pay a $1,500 fee.\n  This fee would be used to fund a grant program that would provide \ngrants to U.S. nursing schools for hiring nurse faculty, expanding \ntraining capacity, and recruiting more students. $1,500 is not a large \nfee--hospitals often spend many times that amount for the services of \nforeign nurse recruiting companies. However, under my amendment, \nhospitals that are in dire financial straits, like Health Professional \nShortage Area facilities and Louisiana hospitals still recovering from \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita, would receive a waiver from paying this \nfee. Neither does my amendment also impose the fee on the dependents of \nany nurses who receive a recaptured green card.\n  Again, the Durbin 2nd degree amendment is a reasonable compromise \nthat will help both the hospitals in the short term and the domestic \nnursing supply in the long term. It will allow for the additional \nnursing green cards to address immediate needs, but it will also take \nsteps that will put the American nursing profession on a path to \nsustainability. My amendment also contains two measured steps to \nenhance global healthcare cooperation and to safeguard against a \ncrippling brain drain of foreign healthcare workers from countries \nwhere they are critically needed. The first provision would allow a \nhealthcare worker who is a legal permanent resident in the U.S. to \ntemporarily provide healthcare services in a country that is \nunderdeveloped or that has suffered a disaster or public health \nemergency--like the 2004 tsunami--without jeopardizing his or her \nimmigration status in the U.S. The second provision would require a \nforeigner who is petitioning to work in the U.S. as a health care \nworker to attest that he or she has satisfied any outstanding \ncommitment to his or her home country under which the foreigner \nreceived money for medical training in return for a commitment to work \nin that country for a period of years. The goal of this second \nprovision is to ensure that foreign countries do not invest money in \nhealthcare workers who then renege on commitments to work in their \ncountry without satisfying their commitment in some way, such as by a \nnew voluntary agreement. There is a waiver available in case of \ncoercion by the home country government. My amendment is strongly \nsupported by the American Nurses Association and the American \nAssociation of Nursing Colleges.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the domestic nursing profession and \nsupport global healthcare cooperation. I urge passage of my amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. All time is yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, without objection \nthe second-degree amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3449) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment, No. 3404, as \namended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3404), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3450 to Amendment No. 3325\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Mr. DeMint, is recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment for Mr. DeMint, which \nI send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for Mr. DeMint, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3450 to amendment No. 3325.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prevent Federal employees from purchasing unnecessary \nfirst class or premium class airline tickets at taxpayers' expense, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available under this Act \n     may be used to purchase first class or premium airline travel \n     that would not be consistent with sections 301-10.123 and \n     301-10.124 of title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the amendment has been agreed to on both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. Without objection, \nthe amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3450) was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3391 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am informed that amendment No. 3391 by \nSenator Chambliss can be withdrawn, so I ask unanimous consent that \namendment No. 3391 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  The Republican leader.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are now in the fourth week of the \nnew fiscal year, and Congress still hasn't sent a single 1 of the 12 \nappropriations bills to the President. Those who made a lot of noise \nabout Republican spending habits before last year's elections are now \nmaking the same mistakes themselves.\n  There is a difference. This year, our Democratic friends are delaying \nthe most essential business of Congress on a political gambit. They \nhave stuffed this bill with so much extra spending it is guaranteed to \ndraw a veto. Once again, they are setting up the kind of media circus \nthat has become so common this year. Instead of having a debate about \nthe issues, about spending, we will have a nondebate played out in \nfront of cameras, complete with props and outrage. A story in Monday's \n``Roll Call'' laid out the strategy. It said our Democratic friends \nthink a Presidential veto of the Labor-HHS bill will allow them to \npaint the administration and Capitol Hill Republicans as ``out of \ntouch'' with average Americans, just like the effort that is underway \non SCHIP.\n  Well, it is time to stop painting and to start legislating. The fact \nis, the Labor-HHS bill is simply too expensive. It is $9 billion over \nthe President's request, and we all know what that means. Next year, \nDemocrats will use that figure as their baseline, and on and on in \nperpetuity. They expect taxpayers to forget how much they increase \nspending this year so they can say it isn't that much when they do it \nagain next year.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle like to downplay the \nspending hikes, but let's stop for a second and look at what some of \ntheir proposed increases this year would actually look like down the \nline. The spending hike they are asking for in this bill, if allowed to \ncontinue at the same rate, will cost the American taxpayer $120 billion \nover the next 10 years. Let me say that again. This spending increase \nover what the President has requested, if allowed to stand year after \nyear, which is the way this always works, will cost the American \ntaxpayers $120 billion over the next 10 years. That is equivalent to \nthe entire budget of the State of New York just in discretionary \nincreases, just on this one appropriations bill. So this increase on \nthis bill, compounded out, $120 billion over the next 10 years, is the \nequivalent of the entire budget of the State of New York.\n  So what we are telling taxpayers is this proposed $23 billion \nincrease over the President's request for this year's appropriations \nbills isn't all that\n\n[[Page S13231]]\n\nmuch. How many times have we heard that: this isn't all that much \nmoney? But let's look at the 10-year totals. The $23 billion this year, \nat the same rate of growth, will end up costing taxpayers $252 billion \nover 10 years.\n  What can we do with $252 billion? We could fund this year's \ndiscretionary appropriations for the Department of Transportation, the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Justice, \nthe Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, the \nDepartments of Homeland Security, Interior, Energy, and still have more \nleft over than the entire 2005 Massachusetts State budget.\n  So our friends are saying that is not a lot of money. Only in \nWashington, DC, could this kind of spending be not much. We need to get \nserious about how we spend other people's money, and if we don't start \non this bill, which represents the largest increase among all the \nappropriations bills, we won't cut anywhere.\n  Senator Lott and I propose to send this bill back to committee and \ninstruct them to prioritize spending in a way that is responsible and \nwhich will secure a Presidential signature. We cannot continue to use \nthe Government charge card knowing our children and their children will \nhave to pay the bill.\n  On behalf of Senator Lott and myself, I move to commit H.R. 3043 to \nthe Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report back with \ntotal amounts not to exceed $140.92 billion, and I urge my colleagues \nto vote with us to get us out of the business of political theater and \nback to the business of governing in a responsible way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, first, I commend Senator Harkin for his \nskillful management of this bill. The Labor, HHS, and Education bill \nrequires tough--did you hear me say that word, tough?--tradeoffs \nbetween critical programs that serve our Nation well. I thank Senator \nSpecter for his many contributions to this legislation, which is \nbipartisan, and I urge Senators to vote no on the motion to commit the \nbill to the committee for the purpose of reducing the bill to the \nPresident's request.\n  Hear me now. Hear me now. Listen. I am going to pose a question. You \nwill have an opportunity to answer it. If such a motion to commit were \napproved, the bill would need to be reduced by $9 billion. To any \nSenator who intends to vote for the motion to commit so as to reduce \nthe bill by $9 billion, I ask: What programs would you cut? What \nprograms would you cut?\n  The President proposes to cut National Institutes of Health funding \nby $279 million for studying cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Under \nthe President's budget, the National Institutes of Health would have to \neliminate 717 research grants that could lead to cures or treatments \nfor cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and other diseases. Should we reduce \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health? How about it? Do I hear \na response? Ask yourself before you vote: Where would you cut? Where \nwould you cut?\n  The President proposes over $3 billion in cuts for education \nprograms, including special education, safe and drug-free schools, and \nimproving teacher quality. Should we reduce funding for educating our \nchildren? Should we? Which educational programs shall we cut? Step up \nto the plate.\n  The President proposes cuts of nearly $1 billion in health programs \nsuch as rural health, preventive health, nurse training, and mental \nhealth grants. Should we reduce funding for programs that improve the \nhealth of our Nation? Should we? Ask yourself, which program--which \nprogram--should be cut?\n\n  Silence. The record will note silence in answer to the question.\n  The President proposes to cut low-income home energy assistance by \n$379 million. Winter is coming on. It gets pretty cold in those West \nVirginia hills. As winter approaches and home heating oil prices rise, \nshould we reduce funding for home energy assistance? No Senator will be \ncold this winter at home. I won't be cold at home. I am a Senator, \nproud to be a Senator. By how much should we slash low-income home \nenergy assistance? By how much? Those who want to cut, now is the time \nto answer the question. By how much should we slash low-income home \nenergy assistance?\n  Mr. President, it is easy to demand cuts until one has to say just \nwhat will be cut. Whose ox--whose ox, yours or mine--whose ox will be \ngored? Who will be left out in the cold?\n  To all Senators listening, I urge a ``no'' vote on the motion to \ncommit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 3 minutes 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield--how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 3 minutes 15 \nseconds; the Republican leader has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will split it, 1\\1/2\\ minutes to Senator Specter, and I \nwill take the last 1\\1/4\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I oppose the motion to commit because the \nPresident's budget is $3.5 billion under the current expenditures, and \nfiguring an inflation rate it would be $8.5 billion less.\n  If we accept the President's figure, then we are abdicating our \nconstitutional responsibility of the appropriations process. The \nConstitution gives to the Congress the appropriations power. If we \nautomatically defer to the President on the total figure, all we do is \nfill in the blanks, and that would be an abdication of our \nconstitutional responsibility. In fact, I think it would be \nunconstitutional for us to delegate that authority to the President. \nThere is case law to the effect that Congress may not delegate its \nconstitutional authority.\n  I discussed an alternative motion to commit, and that is to arrive at \na figure which would be acceptable to the President. On SCHIP the \nPresident has stated his willingness to negotiate. The Senate has its \nfigure; the President has his figure. I would be prepared to commit \nthis bill to committee to arrive at a compromise but certainly not to \nabdicate our constitutional authority and responsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first I thank Senator Specter for his help \nthrough all this debate and developing this bill. I thank Senator Byrd \nfor his usual eloquence tonight. I think he encapsulated what this is \nall about.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. It passed the committee by a vote of 26 to \n3. Frankly, I think at least two, maybe all three of those were opposed \nto the stem cell portion we had in there, which is no longer in the \nbill. Nonetheless, this passed 26 to 3.\n  To echo a little bit what Senator Byrd said, if you vote to commit, \nyou are voting to cut community services block grants, to zero it out, \nand your social services block grants that go to your States will be \ncut by 30 percent. You would cut NIH, as Senator Byrd said, by $279 \nmillion. How about special education? That would be cut by $748 \nmillion. How about community health centers? That would be cut by $250 \nmillion.\n  A ``yea'' vote means you agree with the President that we do not need \nany more community health centers, you agree with the President we \ndon't need any more money to go to the States for special education, \nyou agree with the President that we can cut funding for NIH, you agree \nwith the President we can zero out the community services block grants \nand cut the social services block grants to the States by 30 percent. \nThat is what a ``yea'' vote means.\n  Frankly, I hope we have an overwhelming vote to reject this motion to \ncommit and keep this a strong bipartisan bill with which we can go to \nconference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The distinguished ranking member, Senator Specter, and I \nwish to engage in a colloquy about an important public health matter.\n  Folic acid is an essential ``B vitamin'' that plays a critical role \nin the body's natural processes for making new cells throughout the \nbody. As the Labor/HHS appropriations committee has indicated in its \ncommittee report, folic acid fortification can play a critical role in \nreducing the incidences of serious birth defects, such as spina bifida. \nIn that regard, according to research conducted by the Centers for \nDisease Control, since the implementation of the FDA's policies \ngoverning folic acid fortification in enriched cereal grain products, \nthe prevalence of spina bifida and other neural tube defects has \ndeclined approximately 20 to 30 percent.\n  While this represents significant progress in the prevention of birth \ndefects, the decline falls short of the national policy objective to \nachieve a 50 percent reduction by 2010. It also falls short of the 50 \npercent to 70 percent reduction in birth defects that the Public Health \nService has estimated would result if all U.S. women of childbearing \nage consumed the recommended amount of folic acid daily.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Senator Salazar, I commend you for bringing this critical \nissue to my attention and to my Colleagues' attention. I agree with you \nthat we must do all that we can to reduce serious birth defects.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Thank you, Senator Harkin. Of great concern to me is \nthat the scientific evidence indicates that the progress that has been \nmade since the current fortification policy was adopted is distributed \nunevenly, and public health efforts have not been successful in \nreaching some of the population groups that are at highest risk of \nhaving a child affected by NTD birth defects. For example, research \nanalyzing the government's 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition \nExamination Survey data found that approximately 60 percent of non-\nHispanic white women, and nearly 80 percent of Hispanic women and \nnearly 80 percent African American women consumed less than the \nrecommended amount of folic acid daily.\n  CDC research suggests that current fortification policy is a barrier \nto fortifying the types of food consumed by diverse groups and may help \nexplain the disparate results that have been achieved in diverse U.S. \npopulations. In view of the inadequacy of folic acid intake that \npersists among U.S. women who are most at risk of having a child \naffected by NTD birth defects, there is a need for further study to \nevaluate whether greater improvements in the nutritional status of \nwomen and the prevention of NTDs can be achieved through the expansion \nof food and beverage fortification with folic acid.\n  Senator Specter, the statistics show that our current fortification \npolicy is not reaching all populations. Do you agree that we need the \nCDC to study this issue further, so that we can take appropriate action \nbased on those results?\n  Mr. SPECTER. As a longstanding advocate of prevention and education \nprograms, Senator Salazar, I believe that the CDC should conduct \ncritical public health research regarding our current folic acid \nfortification policies, so that we have a chance to meet our public \nhealth objectives of significantly reducing the occurrences of spina \nbifida and other birth defects.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I am familiar with the distinguished Senator's long \nhistory of supporting public health prevention and education programs, \nand I ask that you work with me when we get to conference to add report \nlanguage to the Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations bill that would \ndirect the CDC to conduct a study of the additional disease prevention \nbenefits to the U.S. population that would be gained from expanded \nfolic acid fortification of the food and beverage supply consumed by \npopulations currently at risk for inadequate folic acid intake. It is \nalso my opinion that CDC should use public-private partnerships to \nfacilitate that study.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Senator Salazar, I will work with you to expand folic \nacid fortification of foods and beverages.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Thank you, Senator Harkin and Specter. I appreciate your \ninterest in and dedication to addressing this critical public health \nmatter.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I commend my colleague for working on this important \nissue and concur with Chairman Harkin.\n\n\n                    Community-Based Doula Initiative\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the \nSenator from Iowa, chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, \nEducation and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Harkin. \nI am pleased that the subcommittee has designated funding for a \ncommunity-based doula initiative within the Maternal and Child Health \nBureau. In particular, I am eager to see that this funding be used in \npart to support technical assistance and evaluation activities.\n  Poor and low-income adolescents make up 38 percent of all women ages \n15 to 19, yet they account for 73 percent of all pregnancies in that \nage group. Teenage mothers are much less likely than older women to \nreceive timely prenatal care and are more likely to smoke during \npregnancy. Because of these and other factors, babies born to teenagers \nare more likely to arrive too early and at a lower birth weight, which \nputs them at greater risk for serious and long-term illness and \ndevelopmental delays.\n  In Chicago, we have seen how the community-doula model can improve \nthe odds for those young moms and their babies. The Chicago Health \nConnection pioneered this model. The group trained mentors from the \ncommunity to work with at-risk moms, many of whom had few ideas of \nwhere else to turn. These mentors spend time in the neighborhood, \nfinding and befriending pregnant women who need help. With the guidance \nof the doula, the Chicago Health Connection found that more young \nmothers were going to their prenatal care appointments, making better \nlifestyle choices, and not surprisingly delivering healthier babies. \nThe doulas stay with the moms through the early months, encouraging \nbreastfeeding, cuddling, interactive play, and other critically \nimportant developmental activities. The key to success in this model is \nthe doula, who comes from the same communities they serve. The doula \nprovides culturally sensitive pregnancy and childbirth education and \nhelps ensure that\n\n[[Page S13233]]\n\n pregnant women know how to access prenatal care and social services.\n  My request to the subcommittee to transform this model into a \nnational priority was supported by Senators Obama, Bingaman, Brown and \nCasey. In a time of budget constraints, I know that not many new \nprograms were begun and I thank the chairman for making this program a \nreality. I also commend the chairman for his foresight in expanding it \nto include community-based breastfeeding programs in rural areas.\n  I am eager to see the Chicago Health Connection model successfully \nreplicated and to make that happen, it is important that new programs \nhave guidance and help to not reinvent the wheel. I would hope that the \nnational program would include funding for a national leader with \nexpertise in the replication of the community-based doula model as well \nas expertise in breastfeeding promotion to provide training, technical \nassistance and evaluation services.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Illinois for his leadership on \nthis issue. I have worked hard in this bill to make prevention a \npriority. Doula programs provide the help and support that families \nneed to create a safe environment for new infants, particularly when \nmothers have nutritional challenges. Everything we learn from the \nNational Institutes of Health reminds us that this early stage of \ndevelopment is so key to our health and well-being.\n  And I want to applaud my friend Senator Durbin for bringing this \nproven model to me last year. We worked hard to include funding and I \nagree with him that expert technical assistance will be an important \ncomponent to this initiative. I look forward to working with Senator \nDurbin and Senator Specter to monitor the implementation of this \nprogram and the outcomes it provides.\n\n\n                             public access\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, and the chairman and \nranking member of the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, Senators \nHarkin and Specter.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about a provision in the fiscal year \n2008 LHHS appropriations bill that would change the National Institutes \nof Health, NIH, public access policy to a mandate requiring that \nprivate sector commercial and nonprofit journal articles be made freely \navailable for worldwide access on an online NIH Web site.\n  As ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, HELP, \nCommittee, I am concerned that this matter has not been reviewed by our \ncommittee, the committee of primary jurisdiction over the NIH. This \nissue has been handled through the appropriations process, and I \nbelieve that the HELP Committee should study the issue and determine \nthe best and most appropriate manner to implement and improve the \ncurrent voluntary policy. In the Statement of Administration Policy, \nSAP, issued last week, the administration echoed this sentiment and \ncalled on Congress to review the policy and balance the need for public \naccess against the impact it could have on scientific publishing, peer \nreview and intellectual property. The private sector invests hundreds \nof millions of dollars in the peer review process which vets scientific \nresearch, and I believe that a change in the NIH public access policy \ncould undermine that investment.\n  I would respectfully ask when this bill is conferenced that the \nsection of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill mandating the NIH public \naccess policy be modified so it may receive further study by the \ncommittees of jurisdiction to ensure that it achieves its goals without \nunintended negative consequences.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would like to add my voice to Senator Enzi's concern \nregarding the NIH public access mandate that would force private sector \npublishers to make their articles freely available on an NIH Web site. \nI am concerned that this proposal will harm the journal businesses, \nhurt scientific communication, and impose a severe regulatory taking on \ncommercial and nonprofit publishers. I also believe that this change in \npolicy could have a negative impact on the intellectual property \nprotections for scientific journal articles. I believe this issue is \ndifferent from making underlying scientific data available. I believe \nthat federally funded scientific raw data should be available for other \nresearchers to review. I would also ask that Senators Harkin and \nSpecter agree to work with me to revise this NIH provision when this \nbill is conferenced.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I remain committed to retaining the provision in \nconference as it is written in the Senate and House Labor-HHS \nappropriations bills. I will be happy to work with the Senators from \nWyoming and Oklahoma to ensure that the policy is implemented as \nsmoothly as possible for the NIH, researchers, and scientific \npublishers.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senators from Wyoming and Oklahoma for their \nconcerns about the NIH public access policy, which I share. I will work \nwith the chairman to closely monitor the policy's implementation.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of \nthe subcommittee.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I also thank the distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember of the subcommittee for their willingness to work with Senator \nEnzi and me on this important issue.\n\n\n             Mentoring Children of Prisoners Grant Program\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, about 2 percent of all children under the \nage of 18 have at least one parent incarcerated in a State or Federal \nprison. According to the Bureau of Justice.\n\n       In 1999 an estimated 721,500 State and Federal prisoners \n     were parents to 1,498,800 children under age 18. 22 percent \n     of all minor children with a parent in prison were under 5 \n     years old. Prior to admission, less than half of the parents \n     in State prison reported living with their children 44 \n     percent of fathers, 64 percent of mothers.\n\n  As a group, children of prisoners are less likely than their peers to \nsucceed in school and more likely to become engaged in delinquent \nbehavior. So, it is important that we support organizations that \nprovide positive adult mentors to address the needs of these at-risk \nchildren--organizations like the Seedling Foundation in Austin, TX; and \nnational organizations like Big Brothers and Big Sisters, and Amachi, \nboth of which have chapters in most States.\n  Many of these organizations depend on grants from the Mentoring \nChildren of Prisoners Program, authorized in 2001 under section 439 of \nthe Social Security Act and administered by the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services. This program was designed to keep children \nconnected to a parent in prison in order to increase the chances that \nthe family will come together successfully when the parent is released. \nUnfortunately, this program has been level-funded for the past few \nyears.\n  The current allocation for the Mentoring Children of Prisoners \nProgram is $507,000 below the President's request and is at the fiscal \nyear 2007 level. I would have preferred that the Senate adopt an \namendment to a modest increase in fiscal year 2008 funding and restore \nthis amount to the Senate bill. At the very least, I would encourage \nthe conferees to retain the existing funding for this program.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with my colleague and will work during the \nconference process to ensure that funding for this program is not \nreduced.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I share my colleague's strong and enthusiastic support \nfor this important program. I will continue to support the existing \nfunding levels for the Mentoring Children of Prisoners Program when we \nconference this bill.\n\n\n                           Deafblind Programs\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, and Education, Mr. Harkin, \nin a colloquy concerning funding for deafblind services and programs at \nthe Department of Education. Would the chairman and manager of the bill \nentertain a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would be happy to.\n  Mr. KERRY. As the Senator knows, tremendous progress has been made in \naddressing the needs of deafblind children and their families over the \npast two decades. Despite a doubling of the population of children who \nare deafblind over that same time period, the 46 State and regional \nproject centers that support the deafblind community have not had a \nbudget increase in over 20 years.\n  In fiscal year 2007, the national technical assistance and \ndissemination program at the Department of Education\n\n[[Page S13234]]\n\nreceived $48.9 million for all disability technical assistance, of \nwhich $12.8 million is designated for deafblind programs and services. \nAt a time when remarkable advances in medicine and technology are \nenabling many more of these infants and children to survive and live \nlonger, it is important for Congress to recognize the need for \nincreased support.\n  While the President's budget proposed baseline funding for this \nprogram, the House included a modest $2 million increase for deafblind \nprograms for fiscal year 2008 in their Department of Education \nappropriations bill. The equivalent allocation in the Senate was, of \ncourse, lower than in the House.\n  I know the chairman recognizes the urgent help our States need to \nimprove their services for families, to support the activities of the \nnational technical assistance and dissemination center on \ndeafblindness, and to strengthen personnel preparation programs.\n  Mr. President, I would ask the chairman if he would be willing to \ncontinue to work during the conference process to include a $2 million \nbudget increase for deafblind funding?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from \nMassachusetts that I agree with his description of the challenges \nfacing the funding for deafblind services and that it is my hope that \nwe can find agreement with our House colleagues to retain the modest \nfunding increase that appears in their bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his help on this \nissue.\n\n\n                        Family Literacy program\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I wish to speak on a program that is not \njust important to me and to many of my constituents in New York but to \nthousands of children and parents across the country. The William F. \nGoodling Even Start Family Literacy Program is a highly valuable \nprogram that gives economically and educationally disadvantaged parents \nthe tools necessary to support early literacy and language development \nfor their young children. Even Start not only coordinates with early \nchildhood education programs and home visitation programs like HIPPYUSA \nto provide literacy and language development services, but also \nincorporates parental involvement. The program assists parents to \nfulfill their role as their child's first teacher by providing them \nwith adult and parenting education, English as a second language \ninstruction, and structured parent-child joint literacy activities that \nwe all know are necessary for children to arrive at school ready to \nlearn.\n  The Even Start Program is the only early literacy program that works \nwith parents to serve children during the infant and toddler years, a \ndevelopmental period that research shows is critical for building later \nreading proficiency. Moreover, Even Start has been shown to be highly \neffective in helping low-income parents support their children's \neducation and breaking the cycle of illiteracy and poverty.\n  During recent years, Even Start has been plagued by a pervasive \nmisconception that the program is ineffective. This has resulted in \ndrastic funding cuts. To date, many Even Start Programs have closed \ndown and thousands of vulnerable families have lost services. In 2005, \nEven Start Programs in New York were serving 3,064 families. Today, due \nto the Bush administration's budget cuts, Even Start is serving only \n722 families. We can all agree these are dramatic cuts for a program \nthat serves such vulnerable families. For New York, cuts to the Even \nStart Program have affected 2,342 families.\n  In order to keep the program alive, it is imperative the Senate \nensure the Even Start Program receives the fiscal year 2007 level of \n$99 million. I am proud to be joined by my colleagues, Senators Harkin \nand Specter, and most of all by Senator Snowe who has spent the last 3 \nyears championing this program with me.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I support the William F. Goodling Even \nStart Family Literacy Program. I am proud to join my colleague, Senator \nClinton, on this important issue. Senator Clinton and I have been \nfighting for this program for the last 3 years, and we are committed to \ncontinuing to fight until this program is fully restored.\n  The majority of Maine's neediest families have also had services \ntaken away from them due to cuts over the past 2 years. In 2005, Even \nStart Programs in Maine served 168 families through 9 programs. Today, \nEven Start is only serving 57 families through 3 programs. This means \nthat 66 percent of Maine families being served have lost Even Start \nservices over the past 3 years.\n  These families depend on Even Start for help in learning English, \npursuing educational opportunities, and obtaining job skills. In a \nTexas A University Study, 2004-05, parents participating in Even \nStart were more often and better employed. The study found that \nemployment jumped from 17 percent before enrollment to 51 percent after \nprogram completion, and wages increased by more than 25 percent.\n  This program helps parents acquire important skills to be their \nchild's first and most important teacher. In fact, Even Start \ncomplements other early childhood education programs such as Head Start \nand Reading First by providing the comprehensive family services that \nhelp children in these critical years. Even Start is also consistent \nwith the parent involvement goals of the No Child Left Behind Act. The \nprogram supports parents to be effective advocates for their children.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, Even Start Programs are essential to \nbreaking down the barriers that poverty and illiteracy create by \nintegrating early childhood education, adult literacy, or basic \neducation, and parenting education into a unified family literacy \nprogram. That is why 35 national organizations, including the Center \nfor Law and Social Policy, the Children's Defense Fund, the National \nCouncil of La Raza, Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool \nYoungsters USA, and Pre-K Now. We have an obligation to our most \nvulnerable families to support services that they need the most.\n  The criticisms of Even Start have been largely based on the findings \nfrom the U.S. Department of Education's national evaluation released in \nMay 2003. However, this study contained serious methodological flaws \nthat call into question the accuracy of the findings. For example, the \nstudy's sample was not representative of the Even Start population. \nThus, findings cannot be generalized to all of Even Start, particularly \nEven Start participants in rural communities or special populations, \nsuch as migrant and Native American families. Experts in assessment of \nlimited English-proficient, LEP, individuals caution that the findings \nfor LEP individuals, who represent 75 percent of those assessed in the \nstudy, are flawed due to inappropriate assessment protocols and \nmeasures. Of the 118 Even Start projects eligible to participate in the \nstudy in 2003, only 18 programs self-selected, meaning that researchers \nincluded programs largely based on who volunteered rather than using \nrandom selection, and such a small pool of programs overall does not \nallow for the study's findings to be generalized to all of Even Start.\n  However, the California Department of Education Even Start evaluation \nfound that the percentage of parents who reported reading to their \nchild on a more regular basis and involvement in activities such as \nparent-teacher conferences increased each year that they were served by \nthe program.\n  Even Start families are the most in need. Eighty-four percent of Even \nStart's families are at or below Federal poverty levels. Eighty-four \npercent of Even Start adults do not have a high school diploma or GED, \nand 44 percent of the parents have not gone beyond the ninth grade. \nNearly one-third of children and parents served by Even Start are \nlimited English proficient.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Clinton and \nSenator Snowe, for bringing this critical issue to the floor of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  The Even Start Family Literacy Program is a valuable program, and I \nagree with my colleagues that Congress must do all that it can to \nensure that the Even Start Program receives an adequate funding level \nto keep the program alive.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I also want to thank Senators Clinton and \nSnowe for their hard work on this critical program, and I look forward \nto working with the chairman in providing the needed resources for the \nEven Start Family Literacy Program.\n\n\n              SENIOR COMMUNITY SERVICE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I first want to thank Chairman Harkin and\n\n[[Page S13235]]\n\nRanking Member Specter for their terrific work on the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill. I appreciate how well the chairman and the ranking \nmember were able to address so many of the important issues in this \nbill despite the overwhelming needs of so many worthy programs that \nhave been terribly underfunded during the Bush administration. With \nthis in mind, I want to enter into a colloquy to clarify a key issue \nconcerning this measure.\n  As a member of the HELP Committee and its Retirement and Aging \nSubcommittee, I am a strong supporter of the Senior Community Service \nEmployment Program, SCSEP, which provides part-time community service \nopportunities at minimum wage for unemployed low-income seniors over \nthe age of 55 with poor employment prospects. This year, approximately \n100,000 seniors nationally will have access to assistance from the \nSCSEP program. Last year, approximately 94,000 were served and 40 \nmillion hours of community services were provided at local community-\nbased organizations, and 33 percent of participants obtained employment \nas a result of participating in this program\n  Through SCSEP, low-income older people benefit from training, \ncounseling, and community service assignments at nonprofit \norganizations and public agencies before transitioning into the \nworkforce. Participants' community service assignments benefit schools, \nhealth facilities, homeless shelters and food banks, disaster relief \nagencies, and aging services. The wages participants earn makes the \ndifference in their ability to care for basic necessities of life such \nas food and medicine. Many participants overcome homelessness and other \nobstacles such as disabilities, literacy deficiency, language, or lack \nof self-esteem through their participation, and are able to compete for \njobs in their local communities. Each year thousands of participants \ntransition to employment, allowing additional older workers to benefit \nfrom the SCSEP.\n  The SCSEP program was reauthorized last year as part of the Older \nAmericans Act with strong bipartisan support as a result of the \ntremendous difference the program makes in the lives of our Nation's \nlow-income seniors and our communities. As our population continues to \ngrow grayer, the need for SCSEP services is anticipated to grow \naccordingly.\n  SCSEP rewards work and the important contribution our Nation's \nseniors can make to our society. However, program costs will rise this \ncoming year as the increase in the minimum wage results in higher costs \nfor the SCSEP program due to the minimum wage payments made to program \nparticipants. In order to continue current participant service levels, \nthe House bill provided $531 million for SCSEP, which provides adequate \nfunds to cover the 2008 minimum wage increase.\n  I know that Senator Harkin and Ranking Member Specter are supporters \nof the program but had a funding allocation $2 billion lower than their \ncounterparts in the House.\n  Can the chairman provide his commitment of his intent to fund SCSEP \nat the House-passed level when he moves to conference with the House?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his support of this \nimportant program and share his commitment to our Nation's low income \nseniors. I want to assure him that I am committed to funding the \nprogram at the highest level possible and will work with the House to \ndo so within our existing budgetary constraints. I thank the Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree with the chairman.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \nwork on this critical issue.\n\n\n                     National Health Service Corps\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I commend the chairman and ranking member \nfor rejecting the President's proposal to slash funding for rural \nhealth programs by more than 90 percent. The President proposed \neliminating practically every rural health program except for the \nFederal and State offices of rural health. If enacted, these cuts would \nhave a devastating effect on communities in North Dakota and all across \nrural America. Although one-fifth of the Nation's population lives in \nrural areas, 70 percent of all underserved areas in the country are \nrural. I thank the chairman and ranking member for restoring funding \nfor the rural health programs in this bill.\n  One of the big problems in rural areas is recruiting and retaining \nhealth professionals. More than 80 percent of North Dakota's counties \nare designated as Federal health professional shortage areas. Although \nrecruiting and retaining health professionals is a major challenge in \nrural communities, it is also a problem in some urban settings. In \nfact, more than one of every four counties in the United States is \ndesignated as a health professional shortage area. Residents who live \nin these areas frequently have to drive long distances or wait to \naccess the care they need. One of the ways Congress has sought to \nreduce the number of shortage areas is by supporting a program called \nthe National Health Service Corps, which provides full-cost \nscholarships or sizable loan repayment to clinicians who agree to serve \nin a shortage area. I was disappointed that the President proposed \ncutting funding for the National Health Service Corps by $9 million in \nfiscal year 2008. I appreciate that the chairman and ranking member \nwere able to restore funding to the fiscal year 2007 level. However, I \nbelieve that we must ramp up our investment in this program as well as \nconsider other initiatives to reduce the number of health professional \nshortage areas.\n  When this funding bill gets to conference, I encourage the chairman \nand ranking member to support the funding level proposed by the House \nfor the National Health Service Corps. The House bill would provide a \n$5.8 million increase for the National Health Service Corps for fiscal \nyear 2008.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I would like to congratulate the chairman and ranking \nmember for their ongoing championing of critical programs that support \nhealth care access, including making substantial investments in the \nNation's community health centers. The expansion of the National Health \nService Corps is essential if health centers are to continue to meet \nthe health care needs of their growing disadvantaged populations, and \nif we are to address the impending crisis in the supply of primary care \ndoctors and dentists. Increasing the program's funding over the next \nseveral years is an important goal. The program is strongly supported \nby the Association of American Medical Colleges, which has called for \nan increase of 1,500 Corps awards per year to help meet the need for \nphysicians caring for underserved populations and to help address \nrising medical student indebtedness.\n  In fiscal year 2007, the National Health Service Corps was funded at \n$126 million and the current level approved by the Appropriations \nCommittee for fiscal year 2008 would level-fund the program. I thank \nthe committee members for rejecting the administration's proposal which \nwould have actually reduced funding by $10 million for this vital \nresource in the face of a dwindling supply of primary care doctors and \ndentists. While I recognize the many competing needs of important \nprograms within the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nappropriations bill, at the very least, I would like to see the \nNational Health Service Corps program funding increased by the $5.8 \nmillion approved by the House of Representatives.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee for providing one of the largest increases \nin funding for community health centers which include migrant health \ncenters, health centers for the homeless, and public housing health \nservices. Community health centers particularly impact medically \nunderserved communities which can be in urban settings like New York \nCity or in the most frontier of all States, my home State of Alaska.\n  I am pleased that the bill before us today recognizes the importance \nof community health centers and provides $2.26 billion in funding for \nthe program. But what about staffing these facilities? While it is \nimportant that we provide money for building these centers, we simply \ncannot ignore the fact that many community health centers throughout \nAmerica are not fully staffed. According to a Washington Post article \nfrom June of this year, many of these centers rely heavily on the \nNational Health Service Corps. Still, this is not enough to fill the \ngap,\n\n[[Page S13236]]\n\naccording to the National Association of Community Health Centers. For \nlack of funding, the Health Service Corps had to turn away about 50 \npercent of the 1,800 doctors who applied last year.\n  Whether in a large urban city like New York, or a frontier community \nlike Bethel, AK, the National Health Service Corps should be properly \nfunded so that millions of underinsured and uninsured Americans have \naccess to health care. I believe that with an increase to the \nappropriations for the National Health Services Corps we will be able \nto achieve that and encourage my colleagues to match the House-passed \nfunding levels.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I also would like to commend Chairman \nHarkin and Ranking Member Specter for putting together a funding bill \nfor the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nthat reflects of our Nation's priorities and will do much to help the \nAmerican people. Of particular importance to me and my State is the \nfunding for the National Health Service Corps. I appreciate that the \nchairman and ranking member were able to restore funding to the fiscal \nyear 2007 level for this program, but believe that we need to do more \nto combat the serious issue of physician shortage in the underserved \nareas of our States. In my State, hospitals and health centers are \nsearching for physicians who will fill the numerous vacancies that \nphysician retirement and retention problems have \ncreated. We need more specialists, surgeons, and general practitioners, \ndentists, nurse practitioners, and nurse-midwives. We need to do more \nto recruit and retain these essential providers--and that is exactly \nwhat the National Health Service Corps does. Robust funding of this \nprogram, in addition to pursuing other strategies to assist areas \nexperiencing health professions shortages, will make a significant \ndifference to patients and the providers and facilities that care for \nthem. I thank the chair and ranking member and hope that the National \nHealth Service Corps program funding is increased by the $5.8 million \nthat was approved by the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I share my colleagues' support for the National Health \nService Corps and agree that we must do more to reduce the number of \nhealth professional shortage areas. In my State, 14 of our counties are \ndesignated as shortage areas, so I know this issue firsthand. When this \nbill gets to conference, I will support as much funding as possible for \nthis important program, and I look forward to continuing to work with \nmy colleagues to ensure an expansion of the National Health Service \nCorps.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will work with Senator Harkin to provide as much \nfunding as possible for this program when we get to conference with the \nHouse.\n\n\n                  lifespan respite care appropriations\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I speak in regard to Senate amendment No. \n3394, an amendment sponsored by Senator Clinton and I, which provides \n$10 million in funding--fully offset--for the Lifespan Respite Care \nAct. Currently, the House of Representatives fiscal year 2008 Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, Education appropriations bill contains $10 \nmillion for this important program. However, the Senate's version \ncontains no such funding.\n  As you know, the Lifespan Respite Care Act passed unanimously in the \nSenate last year and was signed into law by the President on December \n21, 2006. This important program authorizes competitive grants to Aging \nand Disability Resource Centers in collaboration with a public or \nprivate nonprofit State respite coalition to make quality respite \navailable and accessible to family caregivers, regardless of age or \ndisability.\n  I know that my good friends Senator Harkin, the chairman of the \nLabor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations \nSubcommittee, and Senator Specter, the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, recognize that funding this program will be a win-win-win \nfor everybody involved. Patients will be able to receive care in the \nhome from loving, caring family members rather than in a nursing home. \nFamily members will be even further encouraged to serve as a family \ncaregiver knowing that services will be available to assist them. And, \nfinally, the Federal Government and our health care system will \nrecognize fiscal savings as more care will be given in the home by a \nfamily member rather than in the more costly nursing home setting. As \nwe all know, given the aging baby boomer generation, the cost of \nMedicaid nursing home care is expected to be a primary reason of \nincreased health care costs in the years to come. Funding the Lifespan \nRespite Care bill is one step in the right direction towards \ncontrolling these costs.\n  I encourage the chairman and ranking member to try to achieve $10 \nmillion in funding for the Lifespan Respite Care Act.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I rise today with my colleagues, Senators Harkin, \nWarner, and Specter to talk about the importance of providing adequate \nfunding for the Lifespan Respite Care Act. Across our country quality \nrespite care remains hard to find. Where community respite care \nservices do exist, there are often long waiting lists. And until the \nLifespan Respite Care Act, no Federal plan focused on respite care to \ncoordinate among disparate and fragmented services.\n  This legislation, enacted almost 1 year ago, is designed to expand \nand enhance access to respite care services to provide support and \nrelief to families providing care; to help ailing loved ones stay in \ntheir homes longer; and to control health care costs as respite care \nallows families to postpone or prevent expensive hospitalization and \nnursing care.\n  Family caregivers provide 80 percent of all long-term care in the \nU.S.--work that is virtually always unpaid but valued at more than $300 \nbillion annually. That is more than the entire amount we spent on \nMedicare in 2004.\n  Because of their responsibilities at home, studies have shown us that \nit is much more difficult for caregivers to find and maintain jobs. \nMany caregiving families are struggling to stay afloat. The cost to \nbusinesses is estimated in the tens of billions of dollars, including \nthe cost for employees who leave jobs due to overwhelming \nresponsibilities at home.\n  This labor of love often results in substantial physical and \npsychological hardship. Research suggests that caregivers often put \ntheir own health and well being at risk while assisting loved ones. \nMany caregivers are exhausted and are more prone to illness themselves. \nOne study found that caregivers are 51 percent more likely to \nexperience sleeplessness and 61 percent more likely to experience \ndepression.\n  Often, this incredible struggle--with little support despite the \nheroic efforts of the organizations advocating for and providing \nrespite care--leads to more costly out-of-home placements as a family's \nonly alternative.\n  Like Senator Warner, I also ask the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee to try \nto provide $10 million in funding for the Lifespan Respite Care Act.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Lifespan Respite Care Act is a worthwhile piece of \nlegislation that will impact almost all American families. I will work \nwith the chairman to provide funding for these activities.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Respite care programs recognize the vitally important \nwork that families do when a loved one is struck with illness or \ndisability. I have long been a supporter of home and community-based \nservices to keep people with disabilities in their homes and respite \ncare is an important part of that effort. For that reason, I will work \nwith my colleague, Senator Specter, to obtain funding for the Lifespan \nRespite Care Act in conference.\n\n\n           Health Information Technology Network Development\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Health \nInformation Technology Development program will see a substantial \nincrease in this appropriations bill, and I applaud the chairman and \nranking member's commitment to this program by recognizing the need to \ndevelop systems that will help disseminate vital information to help in \nthe detection, prevention, and treatment of some of the most \ndevastating diseases.\n  In particular, this program is important to improve access to quality \ncare for Georgians living with cancer. Cancer unfortunately acutely \naffects Georgia, as it is the second leading cause of\n\n[[Page S13237]]\n\ndeath within the State, yet there is a shortage of options available \nfor those afflicted with cancer. The Georgia Cancer Coalition, in \npartnership with and as the parent organization of the Georgia Center \nfor Oncology Research and Education, GA-CORE, is an independent, \nnonprofit organization working to improve cancer care and strengthen \nclinical research throughout Georgia by encouraging collaboration, \nsharing of information, and improving the clinical trials process. To \nthat end, the Georgia Cancer Coalition has created a model that \nharnesses the combined talents of cancer researchers, physicians, and \nacademia throughout the State to work to eradicate this destructive \ndisease. The State of Georgia has already recognized the importance of \nthis initiative by allocating funds from the State's budget.\n  As I mentioned before, the Health Information Technology Development \nprogram will see a substantial increase in Federal dollars in fiscal \nyear 2008, and I really believe that some of it should go to Georgia.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, like my colleague from Georgia, I am \nsupportive of the Health Information Technology Development program, \nand I was happy to support the chairman's effort to increase funding \nfor it. I believe that the goals of the Department of Health and Human \nServices through its Office of the National Coordinator of Health \nInformation Technology may be well-served by the sort of program that \nSenator Isakson described a moment ago.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the comments by the Senator from Georgia, as \nwell as the ranking member. I agree with them that the Health \nInformation Technology Development program is a step towards better \ndissemination of health information and better health care, and I will \nwork with my colleagues during conference with the House to provide as \nmuch funding as possible.\n  (At the request of Mr. Harkin, the following colloquy was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n\n                           HIV/AIDS Programs\n\n Mr. DODD. First, I would like to thank and congratulate the \ndistinguished chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee on putting together this vitally \nimportant appropriations bill that will restore and grow funding for so \nmany of our Nation's domestic health, education and labor programs. In \nparticular, he should be commended for his leadership in support of \nfunding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs.\n  As a senior member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions--\nHELP--Committee, I am deeply troubled by the impact Public Law 109-415, \nthe Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006, has had on \nthe State of Connecticut. Is the distinguished chairman aware that the \nState of Connecticut lost a total of $3.3 million in Federal funding in \nthe current fiscal year as a result of improper implementation of the \nreauthorization by the Bush administration?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am aware of the cuts the State of Connecticut has \nsustained and am aware that these cuts directly impact individuals \nliving with HIV/AIDS in your State.\n  Mr. DODD. I am particularly concerned because these funding cuts so \ndeeply impacted Connecticut's two transitional grant areas, formerly \neligible metropolitan areas, Hartford, which lost nearly $1.5 million, \nand New Haven, which lost nearly $1.6 million. Urban areas in my State, \nlike many urban areas throughout the U.S. with a long history of the \npresence of this disease, have systems of medical care and treatment \nthat have been disrupted by the Ryan White CARE Act reauthorization \nbill. When I put my support behind the final reauthorization bill, it \nwas with the understanding that this bill would do no harm to my State. \nIn fact, an analysis of the reauthorization bill provided by the \nGovernment Accountability Office and others prior to its passage showed \nthat the State of Connecticut and the cities of Hartford and New Haven \nwould gain over $2 million as a result of its passage. However, this \nhas not been the case.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Section 102 of Public Law 109-415 lists States by name \nthat have sufficiently reliable and accurate names-based reporting of \nliving non-AIDS cases of HIV. The State of Connecticut is not listed \namong those States. However, it is my understanding that the Health \nResources and Services Administration, HRSA, has administered the \nprogram as if Connecticut were on that list. Is that true?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, it is. Connecticut is not listed among the States with \nsufficiently reliable and accurate names-based reporting of living non-\nAIDS cases of HIV. During negotiations on the reauthorization bill, I \nwas told by officials in the Bush administration that Connecticut's \nnames-based reporting system could not yet be considered sufficiently \nreliable and accurate because it had not reported HIV cases by name for \nfour consecutive years. Connecticut would not be in that position until \n2009, at the earliest. The result has been that my State lost $3.3 \nmillion in Federal funding.\n  I am also deeply troubled by reports of how HRSA may be measuring \nurban areas' demonstrated need for supplemental funding. Under Public \nLaw 109-415, HRSA can consider the impact a decline in formula funding \nunder title I would have on individuals living with HIV/AIDS for \npurposes of supplemental grant funding. It is my understanding that \nthis language targets urban areas whose decline in formula funding has \nmeant a decline or disruption of services for people living with HIV/\nAIDS by giving them priority in the supplemental funding process.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I see.\n  Mr. DODD. It is my hope that the impact of a decline in formula \nfunding under title I will be measured based on the urban areas' prior \nyear formula award. This is because applicants for supplemental funding \ndo not know their current years' formula award at the time they apply \nfor supplemental funding and therefore neither the applicant nor HRSA \ncan measure the current years' decline or disruption of services for \nindividuals living with HIV/AIDS. It is my hope that I can work with \nthe distinguished chairman in conference to provide some clarification \nand guidance to HRSA on this critically important issue.\n  It has been stated that the Ryan White reauthorization bill better \ntargeted funding so that infected persons would have better access to \nhigh quality health care. Residents in the State of Connecticut do not \nhave better access to high quality health care as a result of the Ryan \nWhite reauthorization bill. However, there is funding in the House-\npassed Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations \nbill that is targeted to cities losing funding under title I. I \nstrongly support this targeted funding and urge that it be maintained \nin the final conference report.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate knowing of the Senator's support for this \nprovision. I will certainly keep it in mind as we move into conference \nnegotiations.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator for his consideration.\n  (At the request of Mr. McConnell, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, here we go again, pushing through a \nbloated appropriations bill chocked full of earmarks and far exceeding \nthe President's budget request. This is the seventh annual \nappropriations measure that has been considered by the Senate and it is \nby far the biggest budget buster of those considered. The first six \nbills exceeded the President's request by over $8 billion, while this \nbill alone exceeds the President's budget request by almost $9 billion. \nAt what point will Congress come to grips with the fact that we are \nmortgaging our children's and our grandchildren's futures by approving \nbills like this?\n  The Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, \nand Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008 provides \nover $605 billion, including $149.2 billion in total discretionary \nspending and, as I mentioned, exceeds the President's budget by $8.95 \nbillion. The Statement of Administration Policy begins with the \nfollowing;\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes S. 1710 because, in \n     combination with the other FY 2008 appropriations bills, it \n     includes an irresponsible and excessive level of spending and \n     includes other objectionable provisions. The statement goes \n     on to say, The Administration has asked that Congress \n     demonstrate a path to live within the President's topline and \n     cover the excess spending in this bill\n\n[[Page S13238]]\n\n     through reductions elsewhere, while ensuring the Department \n     of Defense has the resources necessary to accomplish its \n     mission. Because Congress has failed to demonstrate such a \n     path, if S. 1710 were presented to the President, he would \n     veto the bill.\n\n  Well, it looks like he will have the opportunity to do just that.\n  There are over 1,000 earmarks in this bill. Examples include: $1 \nmillion for the Bethel Performing Arts Center in Liberty, NY, for the \nWoodstock Museum (which the Senate did strike by a vote 52:42); \n$500,000 for the New York Botanical Garden, Bronx, NY, for the virtual \nHerbarium; $200,000 for Dallas, TX, for the Women's Museum; $200,000 \nfor the Italian American Cultural Center of Iowa in Des Moines; \n$250,000 for the James K. Polk Association in Columbia, TN, for exhibit \npreparation; $100,000 for the Los Angeles Craft and Folk Art Museum; \n$500,000 for the Southwest Museum of the American Indian in Los \nAngeles, CA; $100,000 for the Warner Robbins Museum of Aviation in \nGeorgia; $200,000 for the Texas Historical Commission; $600,000 for the \nVermont Department of Labor for Job Training of Female Inmates in \nVermont; $2.4 million for Maui Community College for the Remote Rural \nHawaii Job Training Project; $1.8 million for Maui Community College \nfor training and educational opportunities; $750,000 for Minot State \nUniversity to provide training and masters degrees to job corp center \nsenior management personnel; $250,000 for the United Auto Workers \nRegion 9 Training Initiative in New York; $900,000 for the Lyndon \nBaines Johnson Foundation in Austin, TX, for the Presidential Timeline \nProject; $1.1 million for the Billings Clinic, Billings, MT--\ninterestingly, the Billings clinic only has 272 beds in its hospital, \nand received recently an endowment of over $1 million for its cancer \ncenter; $5.9 million for Marshall University, WV, including $1,575,000 \nfor the Virtual Colonoscopy Outreach Program; $3,600,000 for Mountain \nState University, Beckley, WV, for the construction of the Allied \nHealth Technology Tower; $3,150,000 for West Virginia University, for \nthe construction and equipping of medical simulation research and \ntraining centers; $4,050,000 for West Virginia University, for the \nconstruction of a Multiple Sclerosis Center; $1,000,000 for Wetzel \nCounty Hospital, WV, for the expansion and remolding of the Emergency \nDepartment; $2,000,000 for the Iowa Department of Public Health to \ncontinue the Harkin Wellness Grant program; and $100,000 for Iowa \nGames, Ames, IA, to continue the Lighten Up Iowa program.\n  I could go on and on calling out earmarks in this bill and its \naccompanying report. We are doing a disservice to the American \ntaxpayers and ourselves by approving such wasteful spending. It doesn't \nhave to be this way. In fact, for the past 2 fiscal years, the programs \nfunded through the Labor-HHS bill were virtually pork-free. A fortunate \ndisagreement resulted in almost no earmarks in the fiscal year 2006 \nbill, which had about 3,000 earmarks the prior year. And last year, we \nfunded the programs with a continuing resolution that, for the \ntaxpayers, turned out to have been about the most fiscally responsible \nroute that we could have taken.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the excessive spending in the \nbill.\n  (At the Request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nsupport and gratitude for the $55 million included in this legislation \nto support our continued efforts to address the health impacts of \n9/11. I would in particular like to thank Senator Harkin, Senator Byrd, \nSenator Specter, and their colleagues on the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee for their efforts to help the many responders, recovery \nworkers, residents and others who have been suffering from persistent \nadverse health effects resulting from exposure to the toxins released \nduring the attacks on the World Trade Center.\n  When the towers collapsed, thousands of tons of coarse and fine \nparticulate matter were released into the air--including cement dust, \nglass fibers, asbestos, lead, hydrochloric acid, and other toxic \npollutants. The combustion of jet fuel after the attacks created a \ndense plume of black smoke, filled with other toxic substances like \nbenzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Fires at Ground Zero \ncontinued to burn underground for several months after the attacks.\n  Thousands worked and lived by this Ground Zero site, amidst the dust, \nsmog, and toxic mix of debris. People also worked at Fresh Kills, the \nlandfill in Staten Island, where workers sifted through the debris in \nan attempt to discover evidence and recover human remains. And in the \nfirst few months following the attacks, we began to hear reports of \npersistent coughing among rescue workers. These reports were among the \nfirst indications of the multiple physical and mental health impacts we \nhave identified among workers, responders, and residents following 9/\n11--chronic respiratory illness, anxiety and depression, and \nmusculoskeletal injuries, among others. I believe we have a moral \nobligation to take care of those suffering from 9/11 related illnesses, \nand I would like to commend the Appropriations Committee for helping to \nmeet that obligation.\n  I have been working with my colleagues on the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee to develop a long-term solution to address \nthese health care needs, and I am pleased to note the bipartisan \nsupport from my colleagues there. As we continue our efforts to develop \nthis solution, the cooperation of the appropriators in maintaining \nfunding for existing programs is greatly appreciated.\n  In the wake of the attacks, I have been proud to work again and again \nwith Senators Harkin, Byrd, Specter, and others to secure funding to \nestablish necessary screening, monitoring and treatment programs to \naddress the health care needs of those impacted by 9/11. Through our \njoint efforts, we have allocated funding to establish Centers of \nExcellence at the Fire Department of New York and Mt. Sinai Medical \nCenter, as well as its affiliated institutions. These institutions have \nbeen working on these issues as the early reports of illness appeared, \nand providing care and medical guidance to the responders and recovery \nworkers who were at Ground Zero and Fresh Kills.\n  In partnership with the National Institute for Occupational Safety \nand Health, these Centers of Excellence have engaged in efforts to \ntreat those suffering these attacks, as well as research and monitoring \nto allow us to understand more about the ways in which these exposures \ndo result in disease. And in addition to these efforts, I also want to \nhighlight the work of the City of New York, which has established \nanother Center of Excellence at Bellevue Hospital with city funds to \nmeet the needs of residents, office workers and others who were exposed \nto these toxins.\n  The $55 million included in this legislation will go towards \ncontinuing these programs to carry out the screening, monitoring and \ntreatment activities administered by NIOSH. It also includes language \nrequiring the Department of Health and Human Services, again working \nthrough NIOSH, to expand its efforts to address the needs of residents, \noffice and commercial workers, students, and other individuals who were \nexposed.\n  With this funding, we will ensure that those who responded in our \nhour of need are helped in their hour of need. We will continue to \nexpand our understanding of the ways in which exposure to environmental \nhazards adversely impact human health. We will be helping the \npreviously healthy detectives, firefighters and construction workers--\npeople in good physical shape before the attacks who now have \ndifficulty breathing and who experience mental health concerns. For \nthese individuals, their illnesses are a constant reminder of that \nterrible day, and evidence of the sacrifices made to assist our country \nafter a terrorist attack.\n  Again, I would like to thank Senator Harkin, Senator Byrd, Senator \nSpecter, and others on the Appropriations Committee for helping to \nsupport these programs.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 3043, the \nfiscal year 2008 Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Some call this \nlegislation the most significant appropriations bill we will consider \nas it touches the lives of every single American. Each American citizen \nhas the right to basic education, adequate healthcare, and access to \nemployment opportunities. In providing funding across three major\n\n[[Page S13239]]\n\nagencies, we are ensuring that our citizens have every opportunity to \nreach their maximum potential. I appreciate the opportunity to \nhighlight a few of the bill's major provisions.\n  American workers deserve every opportunity to provide for their \nfamilies. Investment in training, education, and employment services \nleads to good jobs that provide self-sustainability for workers and \ntheir families. This was the purpose of the Workforce Investment Act \nand is what the funding provided for in this bill accomplishes through \nvarious job training programs. This bill acknowledges the value of \ntraining and employment services by continuing to fund adult employment \nand training, youth training and dislocated worker assistance programs.\n  This bill also provides critical funding for the National Institutes \nof Health, or NIH. NIH funds significant health research at over 3,000 \ninstitutions throughout the U.S. and around the world. While increased \nfunding provided in this bill is a good start, we can, and must, do \nmore. NIH funding supports research to develop and find cures for a \nmyriad of health issues, including cancer, diabetes, stroke, and mental \nillness. These are significant health concerns facing Americans today.\n  As you are aware, NIH is headquartered in Bethesda, MD, where more \nthan 18,000 are employed. So it is especially important to me, a \nSenator from Maryland, that we give all of these individuals the \nresources they need to improve and save lives through health research. \nI commend the Appropriations Committee for supporting this agency with \na 3.3 percent increase to the overall NIH budget. However, if we expect \nAmerica to remain a leader in medical advancements and technologies, we \nmust be committed to providing researchers the resources they need to \nmove forward. I am committed to that goal and urge my colleagues to \nremain vigilant, as well.\n  This bill provides a $125 million increase above the administration's \nbudget request for the Social Security Administration's, SSA, \nadministrative expenses and for that I am grateful. However, that \nincrease does not adequately address SSA's serious backlog issue. It is \nno secret that the Social Security Administration's resources are \nstretched thin. Disability claims are arising at an alarming rate. \nCurrently, over three-quarters of a million individuals are waiting for \na hearing decision as pending hearings have increased to a record \n752,103. Further, the time that an applicant must wait for a hearing \ncontinues to rise, currently averaging 523 days. Compounding the \ncrisis, Medicare reform legislation passed by Congress has increased \nSSA's responsibilities. Field offices average over 850,000 visitors a \nweek. Meanwhile, SSA continues to downsize its labor force. Further, we \nhear a lot of talk about fraud, waste, and abuses within the SSA.\n\n  I submit that we will never get a handle on the problem unless we \nprovide adequate resources to address it. We in Maryland are fortunate \nto have the Social Security Administration Headquarters in Baltimore. \nBy not adequately addressing the SSA backlogs, not only are we doing \nharm to the hundreds of thousands of individuals that, due to health \ncircumstances beyond their control, can no longer support themselves, \nwe are also tying the hands of the hard-working individuals assisting \nthem. Again, I commend the Appropriations Committee for providing \nadditional funding SSA administrative expenses but note that the agency \nneeds additional funding to avoid further staff reductions and an \nincreasing disability backlog.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues for \ntheir support of my amendment establishing the sense of the Senate that \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services should maintain ``deemed \nstatus'' coverage under the Medicare Program for clinical trials that \nare federally funded or reviewed. Under current policy, trials that are \nfederally funded or reviewed by institutions such as the National \nInstitutes of Health, received ``deemed status'' and were not subjected \nto additional review to be eligible for reimbursement. This policy has \nworked well for 7 years.\n  Prior to 2000, too few seniors participated in clinical trials. One \nreason for this disparity was Medicare's reimbursement policy. Because \nMedicare was modeled on the indemnity health insurance policies, it did \nnot pay for treatment considered ``experimental'' in nature, and so \noften denied reimbursement for the routine patient care costs \nassociated with clinical trials. Many seniors could not afford to pay \nthese costs themselves, and so they were by and large excluded from \nthese trials. CMS has recently considered changing this policy, \nrequiring trial sponsors to undergo a process certifying that they have \nmet 13 separate criteria to qualify for Medicare coverage. This new \npolicy has the potential to reverse the progress that has been made \nover the past 7 years by making it much more difficult for trials to \nqualify.\n  Seniors' participation in clinical trials serves two vital functions. \nFirst it affords many seniors with serious illnesses their only hope \nfor lifesaving treatment. Second, it is key to researchers' efforts to \ndetermine the effectiveness of therapies for seniors. Since this issue \nhas come to light, I have heard from hundreds of patients and providers \nacross the country who agree that we must continue to remove access \nbarriers to innovative healthcare treatments for our seniors. Again, I \nthank my colleagues for their support on this important matter.\n  The Appropriations Committee is committed to funding significant \nprograms that address real issues that touch the heart and home of \nAmericans. This includes some innovative programs in my home State of \nMaryland, such as: funding provided through this bill will allow the \nChesapeake Bay Foundation, CBF, in collaboration with Living Classrooms \nFoundation, LCF, to continue providing students with rich, meaningful \nfield and classroom programs focusing on the natural and cultural \nhistory of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Funding will allow CBF and LCF \nto reach approximately 700 teachers, and 87,000 underserved students.\n\n  The bill funds KIPP Ujima Village Academy in Baltimore through its \nparent organization. KIPP Ujima opened its doors in the summer of 2002 \nwith its first class of fifth graders, and now serves 300 fifth through \neighth grades. Over 99 percent of its students are African American, \nand 87 percent qualify for Federal free or reduced-price meals program. \nKIPP Ujima is the highest performing public school serving middle \ngrades in Baltimore City, as measured by the 2006 Maryland State \nAssessment. On that exam, 100 percent of seventh and eighth graders \nscored proficient or advanced in mathematics, achieving the highest \nmath scores in the State of Maryland.\n  Carroll County Youth Service Bureau, CCYSB, provides a continuum of \ncommunity-based mental health services for children, adults, and \nfamilies throughout Carroll County. CCYSB uses a multidisciplinary \napproach to deliver prevention, intervention and treatment services in \nthe least restrictive and most cost-effective manner. Funding provided \nin the bill will allow CCYSB to reach more underserved patients in need \nof mental health services.\n  The bill also provides funding for equipment and technology in a \nnumber of Maryland healthcare facilities, including St. Agnes Hospital, \nMercy Medical Center, Northwest Hospital, Kennedy-Krieger, Lifebridge, \nand Holy Cross. The technology and equipment provided will allow these \nfacilities to better detect, diagnose, and treat patients who suffer \ntraumatic illnesses and injuries.\n  I thank Senator Harkin, Senator Specter, and their staffs for all of \ntheir hard work to develop a bill that addresses many other basic \nrights that all Americans deserve: education, employment, and health \ncare.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today the Senate will be voting on the \nfiscal year 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nappropriations act. I am pleased to support this bill, which provides \nhealthier funding levels for our labor, health, and education programs \nfor the first time in many years. At a time of rising poverty levels, \nrising health care and heating costs, and classrooms in desperate need \nof funding, this bill helps promote programs that offer solutions to \nthese problems.\n  I am pleased that the Senate adopted four amendments I worked on. One \nwas an amendment I cosponsored that Senator Collins offered to provide \nmuch\n\n[[Page S13240]]\n\nneeded additional funding to improve access to dental health in rural \nand underserved areas. Our amendment successfully doubled the funding \nfor the Dental Health Improvement Act, bringing funding from $2 million \nto $4 million. The Collins-Feingold Dental Health Improvement Act \nauthorized a new State grant program that is designed to improve access \nto oral health services in rural and underserved areas. States can use \nthese grants to fund or create programs tailored to State needs. For \nexample, they can use the funds for loan forgiveness and repayment \nprograms for dentists practicing in underserved areas. They can also \nuse the grant funds to establish or expand community or school-based \ndental facilities or to set up mobile or portable dental clinics. In \nWisconsin, funds were used to provide children with better access to \nsealants. This helps prevent further and more expensive dental work \nlater in life.\n  The Collins-Feingold amendment to increase funding for this important \nprogram will help fund additional State programs so that more people in \nour country will have access to essential oral health care. I thank \nSenator Collins for her work on this, and also thank Chairman Harkin \nand Senator Specter for their assistance in passing this.\n  Another adopted amendment will increase public access to automatic \nexternal defibrillators, or AEDs, in schools. In my home State of \nWisconsin, as in many other States, heart disease is the No. 1 killer. \nCardiac arrest can strike anyone. Cardiac victims are in a race against \ntime, and unfortunately, for too many of them, emergency medical \nservices are unable to reach people in need, and time runs out for \nvictims of cardiac arrest.\n  Fortunately, AEDs are inexpensive and simple to operate. Because of \nadvancements in AED technology, it is practical to train and equip \npolice officers, teachers, and members of other community organizations \non how to use these devices.\n  Over the past 6 years, I have worked with Senator Susan Collins on a \nnumber of initiatives to empower communities to improve cardiac arrest \nsurvival rates. We have pushed Congress to support first responders--\nlocal police and fire and rescue services--in their efforts to provide \nearly defibrillation. Congress heard our call, and responded by \nenacting two of our bills, the Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act \nand the ADAM Act.\n  The Rural Access to Emergency Devices program allows community \npartnerships across the country to receive a grant enabling them to \npurchase defibrillators, and receive the training needed to use these \ndevices. Approximately 95 percent of sudden cardiac arrest victims die \nbefore reaching the hospital. With every minute that passes before a \ncardiac arrest victim is defibrillated, the chance of survival falls by \nas much as 10 percent. After only 8 minutes, the victim's survival rate \ndrops by 60 percent. This is why early intervention is essential--a \ncombination of CPR and use of AEDs can save lives.\n  If we give people in rural communities a chance, they may be able to \nreverse a cardiac arrest before it takes another life. Unfortunately, \nthe President zeroed out the funding for the Rural AED program after \nthe program was cut by 83 percent in fiscal year 2006 and kept at that \nlevel in fiscal year 2007. I am very disappointed that the program was \neliminated in the President's budget. Our rural communities deserve \nbetter, and I am pleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee \nrecognized this by providing $3 million in funding for the program this \nyear. That is double last year's funding level and, while it is still \nmuch lower than I would like, I hope the final version of this bill \nincludes at least that much in funding.\n  Heart disease is not only a problem among adults. A few years ago I \nlearned the story of Adam Lemel, a 17-year-old high school student and \na star basketball and tennis player in Wisconsin. Tragically, during a \ntimeout while playing basketball at a neighboring Milwaukee high \nschool, Adam suffered sudden cardiac arrest, and died before the \nparamedics arrived.\n  This story is incredibly tragic. Adam had his whole life ahead of \nhim, and could quite possibly have been saved with appropriate early \nintervention. This story helps to underscore some important issues. \nFirst, although cardiac arrest is most common among adults, it can \noccur at any age--even in apparently healthy children and adolescents. \nSecond, early intervention is essential--a combination of CPR and the \nuse of AEDs can save lives.\n  After Adam Lemel suffered his cardiac arrest, his friend David Ellis \njoined forces with Children's Hospital of Wisconsin to initiate Project \nADAM to bring CPR training and public access defibrillation into \nschools, educate communities about preventing sudden cardiac deaths and \nsave lives.\n  The ADAM Act was passed into law in 2003, but has yet to be funded. \nThe ADAM Act is one way we can honor the life of children like Adam \nLemel, and give tomorrow's pediatric cardiac arrest victims a chance at \nlife.\n  The Feingold-Collins amendment provides modest funding for this act \njust $200,000. This funding, while not much in the grand scheme of the \nFederal budget, will help jump start this valuable program. This \namendment as drafted would be funded through the Rural AED line; \nhowever, I am pleased that the managers share my goal of not taking \naway any of the already limited Rural AED funding and are looking for \nadditional ways to fund the ADAM Act. I am pleased that our amendment \npassed the Senate by unanimous consent and I urge the conferees to \nmaintain this small but important program.\n  My third amendment that passed requires GAO to conduct an assessment \nof current State health care reforms and comment on the potential role \nthat Congress could take in assisting States with their efforts. I \noffered this amendment along with Senators Graham, Bingaman, and \nVoinovich. There is momentum in many States to reform the broken health \ncare system. This study would provide an overview of what is working in \nthe States and the effect of Federal laws on State health care \ninitiatives. In addition, the study would provide recommendations on \nhow the Federal Government could better work with States to further \nefforts.\n  While Congress may not be able to reach consensus on how to ensure \nall Americans access to health services, a State-based model allows \nconsideration of politically diverse solutions that could eventually be \nwidely applied. Gathering data on what works at the State level will \nassist Congress in looking at broader reforms, which is why Senator \nGraham and I have introduced legislation, with the backing of the \nBrookings Institute and the Heritage Foundation, to encourage and \nexpand State efforts to extend health care coverage.\n  My fourth amendment directs GAO to examine the different techniques \nschools are using to prepare students to achieve on State standardized \nexams as well as meet State academic standards. Schools in Wisconsin \nand around the country are facing their sixth year under No Child Left \nBehind, NCLB, the centerpiece of President Bush's domestic agenda, and \nI continue to hear grave concerns throughout Wisconsin about the \nFederal testing mandates contained in NCLB and the ongoing \nimplementation problems with the law.\n  Wisconsin teachers and parents are concerned about many of the \nunintended consequences of NCLB, including the narrowing of the \ncurriculum to focus on the subjects that are tested under NCLB--reading \nand math. As a consequence of more narrowed curriculums, some students \nare experiencing reduced class time on other important subjects \nincluding social studies, civics, geography, science, art, music, and \nphysical education. I have also heard numerous concerns that students \nare being drilled in reading and math in order to boost performance on \nthese standardized tests, which may not be the best measure of \nstudents' higher order thinking skills. Many Wisconsinites are \nconcerned that rote drill exercises in reading and math take the joy \nout of learning for students and have called for a reexamination of \nNCLB policies to ensure that a diverse and high-quality curriculum is \ntaught in all of our Nation's schools.\n  I voted against NCLB in large part because of its Federal testing \nmandate and the potential ramifications of the primary focus on test \nscores in order to determine adequate yearly progress in our schools. I \nalso remain deeply concerned that NCLB's testing and sanctions approach \nhas forced some\n\n[[Page S13241]]\n\nschools, particularly those in our inner cities and rural areas, to \nbecome places where students are not taught, but are drilled with \nworkbooks and test taking strategies, while in wealthy suburban \nschools, these tests do not greatly impact school curriculums rich in \nsocial studies, civics, arts, music, and other important subjects.\n  I do not necessarily oppose the use of standardized testing in our \nNation's schools. I agree that some tests are needed to ensure that our \nchildren are keeping pace and that schools, districts, and States are \nheld accountable for closing the persistent achievement gap that \ncontinues to exist among different groups of students, including among \nstudents in Wisconsin. But the Federal one-size-fits-all testing and \npunishment approach that NCLB takes is not providing an equal education \nfor all, eradicating the achievement gap that exists in our country or \nensuring that each student reaches his or her full potential.\n  My amendment calls on GAO to examine how the use of different \npreparation techniques varies based on the demographic characteristics \nof schools, including the concentration of poverty at schools, whether \nschools are located in a rural, suburban, or urban environment, and \nwhether schools have been identified for improvement under NCLB. It is \nmy hope that Congress will receive concrete data on how the student \npreparation varies among different types of schools so that we can get \na better sense of how NCLB is impacting our Nation's schools. The \ndisaggregation element of this GAO study should better help us \ndetermine whether various preparation techniques, including commercial \ntest preparation programs and narrowing of the curriculum, are \ncorrelated with certain school demographics.\n  I was also pleased to cosponsor an amendment from my colleague, \nSenator Brown of Ohio, to prohibit the Department of Education from \ncontinuing its problematic evaluation of the Upward Bound program until \nCongress has a chance to examine this policy as part of the Higher \nEducation Act, HEA, reauthorization. I have been a strong supporter of \nthe TRIO Upward Bound program for many years and continuously hear \nabout the benefits it provides to Wisconsin students entering college, \nparticularly first-generation college students.\n  Because of my strong support for Upward Bound, I continue to be \nconcerned about the Department of Education's evaluation of Upward \nBound, including the mandate that colleges had to recruit more students \nthan they can serve under the Upward Bound program. I agree that Upward \nBound, like other Federal programs, needs to be evaluated to ensure \nFederal dollars are being spent wisely and effectively. But the Federal \nGovernment has a duty to design responsible evaluations of Federal \nprograms, and I do not think the Department fulfilled that obligation \nwith the design of this Upward Bound evaluation. I am pleased the \nSenate recognized that the ongoing evaluation is troublesome and agreed \nto prohibit funding for it until Congress can reexamine the Upward \nBound evaluation as part of the ongoing HEA reauthorization.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues supported all of my amendments and \naccepted them. I thank Chairman Harkin and Senator Specter for their \nassistance and support with these amendments.\n  I would also like to comment briefly on an amendment that the Senator \nfrom Colorado, Mr. Wayne Allard, brought to a vote. This amendment \nwould have redirected funds from programs deemed ineffective by the \nProgram Assessment Rating Tool, or PART. This program was enacted into \nlaw as part of the Government Performance Results Act and is intended \nto better target Government dollars to the most efficient programs. \nSenator Allard's amendment would have cut the programs considered \nineffective by PART by 10 percent, and then sent these dollars to the \nFederal deficit.\n  I share Senator Allard's goals of efficient Government spending and \nreducing the deficit; however, I have some concerns about the standards \nfor evaluating Government programs in PART. There are several programs \nthat are making a big, positive difference in communities, that score \npoorly on the assessment. Some of these programs I have supported for \nyears, such as rural health programs, and various higher education \nprograms. I think it is important to examine this tool more closely and \nsee if there is a way to improve the assessment before cutting these \nprograms. For this reason, I opposed this amendment, which would have \nhad far-reaching implications.\n  I was pleased to support final passage of this bill which provides \nessential funding for education, health care, and job training \nprograms. Many of these programs have seen drastic cuts over the past 6 \nyears and I am happy that we have been able to more adequately fund \nthese programs in this bill. I am disappointed that the President \ncontinues to say that he will veto this bill and I hope that he will \nreconsider in the coming days. Too many Americans are depending on the \nemployment, health care, and education services provided in this \nlegislation and they are the ones who will be negatively impacted if \nthe President follows through on his veto threat. Much more remains to \nbe done to correct the inadequate funding for these programs in recent \nyears, but this bill is a step in the right direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the substitute, as \namended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3325), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we have had a very productive 5 days of \ndebate on the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for Labor, Health \nand Human Services, Education, and related agencies. I would like to \nagain thank the ranking member, Senator Arlen Specter, for his \nleadership and partnership in helping to shape this bipartisanship \nbill.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the subcommittee \nstaff for the long hours and hard work they put into it. On the \nDemocratic side, I thank Ellen Murray, Lisa Bernhardt, Teri Curtin, \nErik Tatemi, Adrienne Hallet, and Mark Laisch. On the Republican side, \nI thank Bettilou Taylor, Sudip Parikh, and Jeff Kratz. These staff \nmembers set a very high standard of professionalism, excellence, and \nintegrity, and we are very fortunate to have people of this caliber in \npublic service.\n  Mr. President, we are just minutes away from the vote on final \npassage of the bill. I want to emphasize that this is an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan bill that meets the priorities of members on both sides of \nthe aisle. Senator Arlen Specter and I produced a bill that passed in \ncommittee with the support of 14 of 15 Democrats and 12 of 14 \nRepublicans. This bill funds the most essential, life-supporting and \nlifesaving services for millions of people in this country. It reflects \nthe values and priorities of the American people.\n  As I have said before, it is regrettable that, even before we brought \nthis bill to the floor last week, President Bush threatened to veto it \nbecause it included a provision to expand embryonic stem cell research, \nand because it includes $11 billion in funding above what he requested.\n  We have done our very best to accommodate the President, and to \nproduce a bill that he can sign. To that end, we removed the stem cell \nprovision from the bill before bringing it to the floor. This is a core \npriority for me, for Senator Specter, and for many other Senators. But \nwe took it out of the bill in order to meet the President halfway. I \nremain hopeful that, in turn, he will meet us halfway, and join us in \nthis spirit of bipartisan compromise.\n  I am an optimist, and I hold out hope that, if the President examines \nthe substance of this bill, he will see that the additional funding \nabove his budget request goes to essential programs and services that \nhave been shortchanged in recent years.\n  President Kennedy said that ``to govern is to choose.'' The President \nhas made his choices. But, under the Constitution, Congress also gets \nto choose. And, in this bill, we have made the right choices. Let me \ncite just a few examples:\n  The President is requesting that we cut the National Institutes of \nHealth--research into cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's and other \ndiseases--by $279\n\n[[Page S13242]]\n\nmillion. In this bill, we increase funding for NIH by $1 billion.\n\n  The President requests that we reduce the Head Start program by $100 \nmillion, which would cut tens of thousands of children from the Head \nStart roles. This bill increases funding for Head Start by a modest \n$200 million.\n  Despite predictions of record energy prices this winter, Mr. Bush \nrequests that we cut the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program for \npoor people by $379 million. In this bill, we maintain LIHEAP funding \nat last year's level.\n  Mr. Bush requests that we eliminate the community services block \ngrant, the safety net that includes job training, housing, and \nemergency food assistance. In this bill, we increase the community \nservice block grant by a modest $40 million.\n  In each of these program areas, the bill includes modest, reasonable \nincreases in order to keep pace with inflation or to prevent \nsignificant cuts in essential services. This remains a bare-bones, no-\nfrills bill that conforms to a very conservative budget allocation.\n  For 5 years, Congress has appropriated countless billions of U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars for schools, job programs, hospitals, and human \nservices in Iraq. Democrats and Republicans on the committee agree that \nit's time to look after those same needs in this country. And that is \nexactly what we do in this bill.\n  As I said, we tried hard to accommodate the President's concerns. \nThere has been so much division and partisanship in Washington in \nrecent months. This bill offers a great opportunity for Congress and \nthe President to show the American people that we can resolve our \ndifferences with compromise and bipartisan goodwill. We have met the \nPresident halfway--in my opinion, more than halfway. Now it is time for \nhim to respond in kind, and to rescind his veto threat.\n  It is important that we send a strong, bipartisan message to the \nAmerican people that, at a time when we are spending enormous sums on \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we will not neglect or shortchange \nessential, lifesaving, and life-supporting programs and services here \nat home. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this important bill. And I \nurge the President to join us in supporting this bipartisan bill.\n  I know Senators are eager to vote and go home. I just want to thank \nall of the Senators for their many kindnesses and their courtesies in \nbringing this bill to a close. It was 5 days, but it was 5 days of good \ndebate and good amendments. We have a strong bipartisan bill. I hope we \nwill pass it with a strong bipartisan vote, go to conference, and get \nit to the President's desk as soon as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestions is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, the Senate considers the \ncontroversial nomination of Leslie Southwick to the United States \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Unlike so many of \nPresident Clinton's nominees, Mr. Southwick was accorded a hearing on \nhis nomination.\n  I refused to ambush Leslie Southwick the way Republicans ambushed \nRonnie White in 1999. Thus, despite my opposition to this nomination, I \nmade sure that Mr. Southwick was treated fairly and that his nomination \nwas debated and voted upon by the Judiciary Committee. The process has \nbeen open and fair and the rights of every Senator Democratic or \nRepublican have been respected.\n\n[[Page S13243]]\n\n  During the Clinton administration, several outstanding nominees to \nthe Fifth Circuit were pocket filibustered successfully by the \nRepublicans. They included Judge Jorge Rangel of Texas, Enrique Moreno \nof Texas, and Alston Johnson of Louisiana. They were pocket \nfilibustered without a hearing or committee consideration.\n  This is a seat on the Fifth Circuit that would have been filled long \nago but for a series of troubling nominations. In the last Congress, \nPresident Bush nominated Michael Wallace to this seat, the first \ncircuit court nomination since 1982 to receive a unanimous rating of \n``not qualified'' from the American Bar Association.\n  This is the seat to which President Bush had previously used a recess \nappointment to put Charles Pickering on the bench, after his nomination \nwas voted down by the Judiciary Committee in 2002. President Bush \nannounced that appointment, as I recall, on the Martin Luther King Jr. \nholiday weekend in 2004, despite the significant concerns and open \ndebate about that controversial nomination.\n  Those concerns included Judge Pickering's intervention with the \nDepartment of Justice in an attempt to get the sentence of a convicted \ncross burner reduced.\n  The nomination we consider today has engendered significant \nopposition. Those opposing this nomination include: the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, the Human Rights Campaign, the Mississippi \nState Conference of the NAACP, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Lambda \nLegal, the National Employment Lawyers Association, the Magnolia Bar \nAssociation, the National Organization of Women, the National Urban \nLeague, the AFL-CIO, the Congressional Black Caucus, and many more.\n  A number of members of the Judiciary Committee spoke eloquently about \ntheir concerns and doubts during committee consideration on August 2.\n  I have given careful consideration to Mr. Southwick's record. Many \nshare with me my concern about Judge Southwick's deciding vote in \nRichmond v. Mississippi Department of Human Services, 1998. This \ndecision reinstated a white state social worker who had been fired for \nusing a racial epithet what has come to be known colloquially as ``the \nn word'' in referring to an African-American coworker during a meeting \nwith high-level company officials.\n  That epithet was called by one Fifth Circuit opinion ``a universally \nrecognized opprobrium, stigmatizing African-Americans because of their \nrace.'' Yet the hearing officer at her appeal before the State Employee \nAppeals Board suggested that the use of the racial slur ``was in effect \ncalling the individual a 'teacher's pet.''' I am not sure any African \nAmerican would consider it being called a ``teacher's pet.''\n  Judge Southwick provided the deciding vote to uphold the hearing \nofficer's conclusion, the opinion he joined finding that the racial \nslur was ``not motivated out of racial hatred or animosity directed at \nher co-worker or toward blacks in general, but was, rather, intended to \nbe a shorthand description of her perception of the relationship \nexisting between the [co-]worker and [a] DHS supervisor.''\n  In dissent, two judges criticized this opinion for presenting a \n``sanitized version'' of the facts and for suggesting that ``absent \nevidence of a near race riot, the remark is too inconsequential to \nserve as a basis of dismissal.'' The dissent found that this racial \nepithet is ``inherently offensive, and [its] use establishes the intent \nto offend.'' The dissent was right.\n  In my view, the Mississippi Supreme Court did the right thing in \nreversing that decision and I commend them. There is no place for ``the \nn word'' in the workplace or in use by a supervisor to and about an \nemployee. None. Just as there is no place for it in this body or \nanywhere else. I am not naive enough not to know the word is used in \nparts of America, but it should be condemned by all wherever it is \nused, and it certainly is by me.\n  If, as Mr. Southwick now says, his view of the Richmond case was the \nnarrow, technical, legalistic one that he now says justifies his \nproviding the deciding vote to the majority opinion, he could have said \nso back then, in a separate opinion.\n  He could have noted that he felt such use of ``the n word'' was \ninexcusable, but that he felt constrained by his limited role on appeal \nto apply a standard of review that compelled him to reverse Judge \nGraves of the Circuit Court and reaffirm the Employee Appeals Board's \nreinstatement of the offending supervisor with back pay. That is not \nwhat he did, however.\n  In the face of a cogent dissent, he provided the deciding vote to \nuphold the decision excusing that remark.\n  Likewise I am troubled by Judge Southwick's actions in S.B. v. L.W, \nin which he voted to uphold a decision taking an 8-year-old child away \nfrom her biological mother due to her mother's sexual orientation and \nthe fact that she was living with a female partner.\n  My concern is not just that Judge Southwick joined the majority \nopinion but that he went out of his way to sign on to a concurring \nopinion that suggested that sexual orientation is an individual \n``choice'' and an individual must accept that losing the right of \ncustody over one's child is one of the ``consequences flowing from the \nfree exercise of such choice.''\n  I also have concerns about his approach in some cases involving \nallegations of race discrimination in jury selection, such as his \nopinion in a 1997 case, Brock v. Mississippi upholding a criminal \nconviction where the prosecution struck an African-American juror, \npurportedly because he lived in a high crime area.\n  The dissenting judge criticized Judge Southwick's opinion for \naccepting a strike which ``on its face appears geared toward a racially \nidentifiable group.'' In another case involving jury discrimination, \nBumphis v. State, 1996, three judges criticized Judge Southwick's \nmajority opinion for ``establishing one level of obligation for the \nstate, and a higher one for defendants on an identical issue.''\n  His legal writing also points to a narrow view of the role of the \nFederal courts in upholding protections against race discrimination. In \none article, he found ``compelling'' a statement of a Mississippi \nSupreme Court Justice that ``the judiciary is not the avenue to \neffectuate the removal of the Confederate battle flag from public \nproperty.''\n  I have questions whether he would be balanced in protecting the \nrights of employees given the overwhelming number of cases 160 out of \n180 written decisions--in which he has offered a narrow interpretation \nof the law to favor protecting business and corporate interests at the \nexpense of the rights of workers and consumers.\n  In one 1999 case, Dubard v. Biloxi, H.M.A., Judge Southwick authored \na dissent expressing the virtues of a legal doctrine that would allow \nemployers to fire employees for any reason, even though such an \nanalysis was not relevant in the case before him.\n  My concerns about his bias are heightened by a law review article he \nwrote characterizing litigation against tobacco companies led by former \nMississippi Attorney General Michael Moore as destabilizing and posing \nseparation of powers concerns.\n  As I said in opposing this nomination in committee, this is not a \ndecision I come to lightly. I take seriously the strong support of \nSenator Cochran and Senator Lott whom I respect, and I have expressed \nmy concerns directly to them as well as to the White House.\n  I also take seriously Mr. Southwick's answers to my questions and to \nthose of others in connection with his hearing. I was glad to see that \nhe now acknowledged the offensiveness of the racial epithet used in the \nRichmond case and also that human rights law has evolved since 2001 \nwhen he joined the decision in the child custody case.\n  Still, I share the deep disappointment of members of the African-\nAmerican and civil rights communities that this administration \ncontinues to renege on a reported commitment to appoint an African \nAmerican to the Mississippi Federal bench.\n  In more than 6 years, President Bush has failed to do so. He has \nappointed only 20 African-American judges to the Federal bench, \ncompared to 52 African-American judges appointed by President Clinton \nin his first 6 years in office.\n  With an ever-growing number of outstanding African-American lawyers \nin Mississippi, the State with the highest percentage of African \nAmericans in the country, it is not as if there is a dearth\n\n[[Page S13244]]\n\nof qualified candidates. Nonetheless, President Bush has now submitted \n10 nominees to the Federal bench in Mississippi, seven at the district \nlevel and three to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit, and none of these nominees has been African American.\n  Our Nation's diversity is one of its greatest strengths, and I am \ndisappointed that the President has missed yet another opportunity to \nreflect this great strength in our Federal courts. Many of us believe \nthat diversity makes America what it is. It is the diversity in our \nStates, our courts, this body, and our families that makes us stronger.\n  When viewed against his record on the bench, the importance of this \nseat on the Fifth Circuit, and the troubling lack of diversity on that \ncourt, I am not convinced that he is the right nominee for this vacancy \nat this time. I shall vote no on cloture and, if it is invoked, no on \nthis nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of opposition and others be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Langrock Sperry & Wool, LLP,\n\n                                     Middlebury, VT, June 5, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pat: I understand the nomination of Leslie Southwick \n     to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is coming up for a vote \n     this Thursday. The little I know about Judge Southwick \n     absolutely frightens me. His attitude towards lesbian parents \n     is just totally inconsistent with Vermont philosophy and with \n     respect for human dignity. I also understand he has been \n     involved in some cases which would indicate insensitivity to \n     African Americans. I would certainly hope that your Committee \n     does not approve him.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Peter F. Langrock.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Leadership Conference\n\n\n                                              on Civil Rights,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Leadership Conference on \n     Civil Rights (LCCR), the nation's oldest, largest, and most \n     diverse civil and human rights coalition, we write to express \n     our opposition to the confirmation of Leslie H. Southwick, a \n     former Mississippi Court of Appeals judge, to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. His record \n     raises too many questions about his commitment to civil and \n     human rights for him to be entrusted with a lifetime \n     appointment to the federal judiciary. We urge you to vote no \n     on cloture on the Southwick nomination.\n       The federal courts of appeal are the courts of last resort \n     in most federal cases. Moreover, the Fifth Circuit has the \n     highest percentage of minority residents of all the federal \n     circuits, making Judge Southwick's record on matters of civil \n     rights particularly important. Unfortunately, Judge \n     Southwick's decisions as a state court judge, along with his \n     hearing testimony, indicate that he favors the interests of \n     the powerful over the interests of minorities, working \n     people, and others who depend on judges to stand up for them. \n     This record warrants the rejection of Judge Southwick's \n     nomination to the Fifth Circuit.\n       In Richmond v. Mississippi Dep't of Human Services, Judge \n     Southwick joined a 5-4 ruling upholding the full \n     reinstatement order of the state's Employee Appeals Board \n     (EAB) of a white state social worker who had been fired for \n     calling an African-American co-worker ``a good ole nigger.'' \n     The ruling he joined had declared that, taken in context, \n     this slur was an insufficient ground to terminate the white \n     plaintiffs employment in part because it ``was not motivated \n     out of racial hatred or racial animosity directed toward a \n     particular co-worker or toward blacks in general.'' Moreover, \n     the EAB decision upheld by the Court of Appeals decision \n     trivialized the use of the words ``good ole nigger'' by \n     comparing them to the expression ``teacher's pet.'' The Court \n     of Appeals did nothing to distance itself from this aspect of \n     the EAB decision.\n       The reasoning offered by Judge Southwick and his colleagues \n     in the majority is nothing short of baffling. As two \n     dissenters in the 5-4 decision rightfully pointed out: ``The \n     word 'nigger' is, and has always been, offensive. Search high \n     and low, you will not find any nonoffensive definition for \n     this term. There are some words, which by their nature and \n     definition are so inherently offensive, that their use \n     establishes the intent to offend.''\n       Fortunately the Supreme Court of Mississippi reversed the \n     decision, stating that the EAB should not simply be upheld, \n     but rather that the matter should be remanded to the EAB for \n     consideration of whether full reinstatement was truly \n     justified under the circumstances or whether some other \n     penalty short of discharge might be appropriate.\n       In another case, S.B. v. L.W., Judge Southwick joined an \n     opinion that upheld the removal of an eight-year-old girl \n     from the custody of her bisexual mother. In addition to \n     joining the majority opinion, he was the lone judge to join a \n     colleague's gratuitously anti-gay concurring opinion. The \n     concurrence argued the ``choice'' to engage in homosexuality \n     comes with consequences, up to and including the \n     consideration of ``the homosexual lifestyle'' as a \n     determining factor in child custody cases. The views \n     expressed in the concurring opinion raise doubts about Judge \n     Southwick's interest in ruling fairly in cases that involve \n     the civil rights of gays and lesbians.\n       In Dubard v. Biloxi, H.M.A., Judge Southwick wrote a \n     dissenting opinion in which he extolled the virtues of \n     employment-at-will, a doctrine that provides that employers \n     should be able to fire employees for virtually any reason, \n     even though his analysis was not relevant to reaching a \n     decision in the case. He wrote that ``I find that employment \n     at will, for whatever flaws a specific application may cause, \n     is not only the law of Mississippi but it provides the best \n     balance of the competing interests in the normal employment \n     situation. It has often been said about democracy, that it \n     does not provide a perfect system of government, but just a \n     better one than everything else that has ever been suggested. \n     An equivalent view might be seen as the justification for \n     employment at will.'' His gratuitous comments raise questions \n     about his ability to separate his own views from his duty to \n     follow the law in labor and employment cases.\n       Judge Southwick also has a poor record in cases involving \n     race discrimination in jury selection. He has routinely \n     rejected defense claims that prosecutors struck African-\n     American jurors based on race. At the same time, however, he \n     has usually upheld allegations by prosecutors that defendants \n     tried to strike white jurors on the basis of race. One of \n     Judge Southwick's own colleagues, in response, accused him of \n     ``establishing one level of obligation for the State, and a \n     higher one for defendants on an identical issue.''\n       His record also shows a troubling tendency, in state \n     employment law and tort cases, to favor business and \n     insurance interests over injured parties. He did so in 160 \n     out of 180 such published cases in . which at least one judge \n     dissented, giving him an 89 percent pro-business voting \n     record.\n       When asked by Senator Durbin (D- IL) during live \n     questioning at his hearing if he could think of one example \n     of an unpopular decision he made in favor of the powerless, \n     the poor, minorities, or the dispossessed, Judge Southwick \n     responded that he could not. In response to a follow-up \n     written question posed by Senator Durbin, Judge Southwick \n     indicated that he could not find a single nonunanimous case, \n     of the more than 7000 opinions that he wrote or joined, in \n     which he voted in favor of a civil rights plaintiff or wrote \n     a dissent on behalf of a plaintiff.\n       Given the tremendous impact that federal judges have on \n     civil rights and liberties, and because of the lifetime \n     nature of federal judgeships, no judge should be confirmed \n     unless he or she demonstrates a solid commitment to \n     protecting the rights of all Americans. Because Judge \n     Southwick has failed to meet this burden, we urge senators to \n     vote no on cloture on the nomination.\n       Thank you for your consideration.

As a Mississippi Judge, Southwick \n     demonstrated a serious lack of understanding of gay people \n     and families. His statements during his hearing before this \n     Committee and his written responses to your questions do not \n     satisfy us that his positions have evolved nor that he would \n     fairly judge cases involving the rights of gay, lesbian, \n     bisexual, and transgender (``GLBT'') Americans.\n       During his tenure on the Mississippi Court of Appeals, \n     Judge Southwick (now in private practice) participated in a \n     custody case involving a lesbian mother. The majority \n     decision, which Southwick joined, took an eight-year-old \n     child from the mother, citing in part that the mother had a \n     ``lesbian home.'' The opinion further denigrates what it \n     calls the ``homosexual lifestyle'' and the ``lesbian \n     lifestyle.''\n       More disturbingly, Judge Southwick joined a concurrence \n     written by Judge Payne--completely unnecessary to effectuate \n     the result--that emphasized Mississippi's public policy \n     against lesbian and gay parents (using only the term \n     ``homosexuals''). Judge Southwick was the only judge in the \n     majority to join Judge Payne's concurrence, which is rife \n     with misconceptions and biases.\n       The concurrence does not even refer to gay individuals, but \n     rather focuses on ``the practice of homosexuality.'' It then \n     cites Mississippi's law prohibiting same-sex couples from \n     adopting children--even though this was not an adoption case, \n     but rather a case regarding a biological mother's right to \n     retain custody of her child. The opinion even goes so far as \n     to cite the state's sodomy law (subsequently invalidated by \n     the Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas).\n\n[[Page S13245]]\n\n       Perhaps most troublingly, the concurrence states that even \n     if the mother's sexual acts are her choice, she must accept \n     the fact that losing her child is a possible consequence of \n     that ``choice.'' This statement underscores Judge Southwick's \n     disregard for commonly accepted psychiatric and social \n     science conclusions. The American Psychological Association \n     (APA) has made clear that sexual orientation is not a choice. \n     The APA, along with every other credible psychological and \n     child welfare group, has also concluded that lesbian and gay \n     people are equally successful parents as their heterosexual \n     counterparts. This disregard for widely accepted social \n     science conclusions has ramifications not only for cases \n     involving gay and lesbian people, but also in any case where \n     respect for science comes into play--whether this involves \n     reproductive choice, people with disabilities, environmental \n     studies, to name a few.\n       No parent should face the loss of a child simply because of \n     who they are. If he believes that losing a child is an \n     acceptable ``consequence'' of being gay, Judge Southwick \n     cannot be given the responsibility to protect the basic \n     rights of gay and lesbian Americans.\n       When questioned before this Committee about why he joined \n     this offensive concurrence, Southwick gave the unsatisfactory \n     response that he did not write it. He further stated that the \n     concurrence reflected Mississippi's public policy, but did \n     not indicate why he joined the concurrence that his \n     colleagues deemed unnecessary. He did not distance himself \n     from the concurrence or the language that it contains.\n       In his written responses to questions about this case and \n     about the rights of gay and lesbian Americans, Southwick did \n     not provide adequate reassurance that his position has \n     changed or that his understanding has evolved. Although he \n     repeatedly indicated that Lawrence v. Texas is now \n     controlling precedent, having overruled Bowers v. Hardwick, \n     this is an insufficient answer. Although we are hopeful that \n     Lawrence will bring about greater equality for GLBT \n     Americans, Southwick's promise to adhere to that precedent \n     does not address the question of whether he believes that gay \n     people should have the same parenting rights as others.\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \n     has historically paved the way for civil rights advances. We \n     believe that Judge Southwick's nomination is inconsistent \n     with this important legacy, and would turn back the tide of \n     progress by denying equal protections to GLBT Americans.\n       We therefore oppose his nomination and request that you \n     vote against his confirmation. Only a judge who has \n     demonstrated that he can be a fair and impartial judge for \n     all Americans, regardless of their sexual orientation, is \n     entitled to confirmation on this important court.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: The \n     Mississippi State Conference of the NAACP is strongly opposed \n     to the nomination of Leslie Southwick to the Fifth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n       As you are well aware, previous nominations to this \n     particular seat on the Fifth Circuit have raised serious \n     civil rights problems. In reviewing this history, we cannot \n     help but conclude that this Administration is determined to \n     place a person hostile to civil rights in the Mississippi \n     seat on the Fifth Circuit. Judge Charles Pickering was \n     nominated in 2001. The Senate refused to confirm him, largely \n     based on his civil rights record. President Bush then \n     nominated Michael Wallace to the same seat. The American Bar \n     Association found Mr. Wallace to be ``unqualified,'' due to \n     his judicial temperament regarding civil rights issues. \n     Wallace withdrew his nomination at the end of 2006. Now, \n     President Bush has named yet a third nominee with a troubling \n     civil rights record.\n       We note that the Southwick nomination does nothing to \n     ameliorate the egregious problem with the lack of diversity \n     on Mississippi's federal bench. Mississippi has the highest \n     African-American population of any state (36%). Yet there has \n     never been an African American appointed to represent \n     Mississippi on the Fifth Circuit. African-American \n     representation on the federal district court in Mississippi \n     has been limited to one judge, Judge Henry Wingate, appointed \n     over twenty years ago. In his two terms, President Bush has \n     made ten nominations to the federal bench in Mississippi--\n     district and appellate. None were African American. This is \n     extremely disturbing to many Mississippians, who believe the \n     State should be fairly represented on the federal bench.\n       The civil rights record of Judge Southwick on the \n     Mississippi Court of Appeals gives us great pause. We are \n     deeply troubled by his rulings on race discrimination in the \n     areas of employment and jury selection.\n       Judge Southwick participated in a truly stunning decision, \n     Richmond v. Mississippi Dep't of Human Services. He joined a \n     ruling that a Mississippi state agency could not terminate an \n     employee for using the word ``nigger'' toward an African-\n     American coworker. At a business conference, the white \n     employee had called the black employee ``a good ole nigger,'' \n     and then used the same term toward the employee the next day \n     at the office. The state agency fired the white employee. But \n     a hearing officer reinstated the employee, finding that \n     calling the employee ``a good ole nigger'' was equivalent to \n     calling her ``teacher's pet.'' Southwick upheld the \n     reinstatement.\n       The opinion endorsed by Southwick makes outrageous \n     conclusions about the use of the term ``nigger'' in the \n     workplace. The opinion states: ``[The white employee] \n     presented proof that her remark, though undoubtedly ill-\n     advised and indicative of a rather remarkable insensitivity \n     on her part, was not motivated out of racial hatred or racial \n     animosity directed toward a particular co-worker or toward \n     blacks in general.'' Astonishingly, the court credited the \n     white employee's testimony that her remark was intended to be \n     ``a shorthand description'' of the relationship between an \n     employee and a supervisor.\n       Two of Southwick's colleagues strongly dissented. They \n     stated that it ``strains credulity'' to compare calling the \n     employee ``a good ole nigger'' with ``teacher's pet.'' The \n     dissent wrote: ``The word `nigger' is, and has always been \n     offensive. . . . There are some words, which by their nature \n     and definition are so inherently offensive, that their use \n     establishes the intent to offend. . . . The character of \n     these terms is so inherently offensive that it is not altered \n     by the use of modifiers such as `good ole.' . . . [The \n     rulings] seem to suggest that absent evidence of a near race \n     riot, the remark is too inconsequential to serve as a basis \n     for dismissal. Such a view requires a level of myopia \n     inconsistent with the facts and reason.'' Indeed, the \n     Mississippi Supreme Court unanimously reserved the ruling \n     joined by Southwick to uphold the reinstatement of the white \n     employee.\n       Additionally, we are disturbed by Judge Southwick's rulings \n     on race discrimination in jury selection. Dozens of such \n     cases reveal a pattern by which Southwick rejects claims that \n     the prosecution was racially motivated in striking African-\n     American jurors while upholding claims that the defense \n     struck white jurors on the basis of their race. In Bumphis v. \n     State, an appellate colleague accused Southwick of \n     ``establishing one level of obligation for the State, and a \n     higher one for defendants on an identical issue.''\n       Finally, on issues affecting workers, consumers and \n     personal injury victims, Judge Southwick rules overwhelmingly \n     in favor of employers and corporations. We question his \n     ability to be a fair and impartial decision-maker in these \n     cases as well. Mississippians need to be confident that they \n     will receive equal justice before the federal courts.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                  Derrick Johnson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Congressional Black Caucus,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leahy and Mr. Specter: We write to be clear \n     concerning the strong opposition of the Congressional Black \n     Caucus to moving Leslie Southwick, formerly of the \n     Mississippi Court of Appeals, through committee for the Fifth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. We are enclosing the press release \n     that the Caucus issued just before Memorial Day recess asking \n     that Leslie Southwick not be listed for a vote in committee. \n     We understand that, nevertheless, Mr. Southwick may have a \n     vote in committee on Thursday, June 7, 2007. We are \n     astonished that the committee would seriously consider this \n     nominee on a circuit that hears cases affecting more Blacks \n     and Hispanics than any circuit in the country. Mr. \n     Southwick's long record, revealing inexcusably insensitive \n     and hostile views on race and on other issues that have \n     directly harmed people of color, should spell the end of his \n     consideration for the Fifth Circuit.\n       The enclosed release mentions the most obvious and overt \n     racial example, involving Mr. Southwick's concurrence in \n     Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human Services, 1998 \n     Miss. App. LEXIS 637 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998), allowing the use \n     of a racial slur that was unanimously overruled, but \n     importantly refers to many other areas of equally deep \n     concern to us because they involved average Mississippi \n     residents who typify the Black, Hispanic, and white residents \n     of the Circuit.\n       Mr. Southwick's record provides nothing less than a case \n     study of a judge with a closed mind and fixed far-right \n     views. In no area of law have we been able to find decisions \n     that did not seem to be entirely predicted by an ideological \n     predisposition. We believe that the committee should be \n     impressed by the frequency with which Southwick's opinions \n     and concurrences have been overruled. Our investigation of 10 \n     years of Southwick decisions reveals a one-sided animus \n     against workers and consumers, in particular, with rulings \n     almost always favoring business and insurance interests and \n     almost never for working people and consumers.\n\n[[Page S13246]]\n\n       Our Caucus is most concerned about Mr. Southwick's ability \n     to afford equal justice under law in the Circuit where racial \n     discrimination has always been most pronounced. The Southwick \n     decisions show a remarkable predisposition to rule for whites \n     alleging improper use of peremptory challenges and against \n     Blacks who make similar allegations regarding peremptory \n     challenges. Nothing could be more disturbing today, \n     considering that Congress has allowed racially unfair \n     mandatory minimums and sentencing guidelines to remain in \n     tact, virtually destroying a generation of African American \n     men. Rep. Bennie Thompson's Mississippi constituents were \n     profoundly and negatively injured during Southwick's tenure \n     in virtually every area of state law. We ask that you avoid \n     elevating Leslie Southwick to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the Fifth Circuit, where he is likely to do the same harm to \n     residents of three states--Texas, Louisiana, as well as \n     Mississippi.\n       We want to be clear that the Congressional Black Caucus \n     could not be more troubled by the transformation of the Fifth \n     Circuit by judges that make it difficult to believe in the \n     fairness, balance and openness of the judiciary. Five members \n     of the CBC represent constituents in this circuit, the \n     largest number members in anyone circuit. The Fifth Circuit \n     presides over the largest percentage of minority residents \n     (44%) of any circuit and Mississippi has the highest African-\n     American population (36%) of any state in the country. We \n     therefore would take very seriously the reach to place yet \n     another farright judge with offensive racial views on the \n     Fifth Circuit so late in President Bush's last term. We ask \n     that you reject Leslie Southwick.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carolyn C. Kilpatrick,\n       Chairperson, Congressional Black Caucus.\n     Bennie Thompson,\n       CBC Member--Mississippi.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote to cut off \ndebate--that is, to invoke cloture--on the pending nomination of Judge \nLeslie H. Southwick for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \nand then to vote to confirm him.\n  Judge Southwick comes to this nomination with an outstanding record. \nHe received his bachelor's degree cum laude from Rice University and a \nJ.D. from the University of Texas law school in 1975.\n  He was a law clerk for Judge John Onion, Jr., of the Texas Court of \nCriminal Appeals. He was a law clerk for Judge Charles Clark of the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals. He practiced law from 1977 through \n1989. He was a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, Civil Division, from 1989 to 1993. He has been a \njudge on the Mississippi Court of Appeals, which is an intermediate \ncourt, for some 12 years.\n  Judge Southwick has participated in about 6,000 cases and has \npersonally authored some 985 opinions.\n  In a very remarkable move, when Judge Southwick was 53 years old--he \nhad been in the Army Reserve since he was 42, when he obtained an age \nwaiver in order to join the Army Reserve--and in the year 2003, when he \nwas 53 years old, he volunteered to transfer to a line combat unit. He \nwas deployed to Iraq, serving as a staff judge advocate in forward \noperating bases near Najaf.\n  Major General Harold Cross, Judge Southwick's commanding officer, \nsaid:\n\n       This was a courageous move; as it was widely known at the \n     time that the 155th was nearly certain to mobilize for \n     overseas duty in the near future.\n\n  Judge Southwick was voted out of the Judiciary Committee on August 2 \nof this year on a bipartisan basis with a favorable recommendation.\n  Judge Southwick's critics have pointed to only two cases--where he \nwas in a concurrence and did not write the opinions. One case involved \nthe issue of the punishment for someone in Civil Service who used a \nvery derogatory racial term. When that case was reviewed, it was \ndecided that since the individual had made only an isolated remark, and \nimmediately apologized, that it would be excessive to fire that person \nbut that the penalty should be something less. That case was reviewed \nby the Mississippi Court of Appeals on a very constricted standard as \nto whether the finding was arbitrary and capricious--which is a very \nhigh standard--and that applicable standard determined that firing was \nexcessive.\n  The case then went to the Supreme Court of Mississippi, and it agreed \nwith the appellate court's conclusion that the dismissal was \nunwarranted. In this case they said:\n\n       [w]e find that the harsh penalty of dismissal . . . from \n     her employment is not warranted under the circumstances.\n\n  Now, I emphasize that in both of these cases, Judge Southwick did not \nwrite the opinions but only concurred in the result. While some might \nsay it would have been preferable to take a different position, in the \ncontext of deciding some 6,000 cases and having written some 985 \nopinions, that is very little to pick at.\n  The second case was a matter where the issue of custody came up. \nAfter an extensive hearing, the trial judge awarded custody to the \nfather, and there was a reference to the fact that the mother was a \nlesbian. Here again, the references in the opinion--again, not written \nby Judge Southwick--might have been somewhat more sensitive. In the \noverall context, it is hardly the basis for denying confirmation to \nJudge Southwick.\n  I met with Judge Southwick at length, had a long talk with him about \nhis approach to the judiciary, about his legal background. He is a very \nmild-mannered, very temperate man, who on the credentials, in black and \nwhite, has an outstanding record and in person was very impressive.\n  It is worth noting that a number of former African-American clerks \nhave spoken out in solid support of Judge Southwick.\n  La'Verne Edney, a distinguished African-American woman who is a \npartner at a prominent Jackson, MS, law firm and a member of the \nMagnolia Bar Association, the Mississippi Women Lawyers' Association, \nand a member of the Mississippi Task Force for Gender Fairness, stated \nthis:\n\n       When I finished law school . . . I believed that my chances \n     for landing a clerkship were slim because there was only one \n     African-American Court of Appeals judge on the bench at the \n     time and there were very few Caucasian judges during the \n     history of the Mississippi Supreme Court or the Court of \n     Appeals . . . who had ever hired African-American law clerks. \n     . . .While Judge Southwick had many applicants to choose \n     from, he saw that I was qualified for the position and \n     granted me the opportunity.\n\n  As a clerk, Ms. Edney observed:\n\n       It did not matter the parties' affiliation, color or \n     stature--what mattered was what the law said and Judge \n     Southwick worked very hard to apply it fairly.\n\n  Patrick Beasley, a practicing attorney in Jackson, MS, who also is \nAfrican American, endorsed Judge Southwick for his quality of being \nfair to minorities. Mr. Beasley wrote:\n\n       I speak from personal experience that Leslie Southwick is a \n     good man who has been kind to me for no ulterior reason. I am \n     not from an affluent family and have no political ties. While \n     I graduated in the top third of my law school class, there \n     were many individuals in my class with higher grade point \n     averages and with family ``pedigrees'' to match. Yet, despite \n     all of the typical requirements for the clerkship that I \n     lacked, Judge Southwick gave me an opportunity. Despite \n     [those who criticize him], Judge Southwick is a fair man and \n     this is one of the qualities that makes him an excellent \n     choice for the Fifth Circuit. . . .\n\n  Judge Southwick has ruled numerous times in favor of workers, the so-\ncalled little guy.\n  For example, in Sherwin Williams v. Brown, Judge Southwick held that \na 45-year-old carpet layer was permanently and totally industrially \ndisabled due to an onsite injury and that the carpet layer made \nreasonable efforts to obtain other employment.\n  In United Methodist Senior Services v. Ice, Judge Southwick affirmed \nthe award of workers' compensation benefits to a woman who hurt her \nback while working as a certified nursing assistant, despite her first \nemployer's claim that she exacerbated the injury during her subsequent \nemployment.\n  In Kitchens v. Jerry Vowell Logging, Judge Southwick reversed the \nWorkers' Compensation Commission's decision that a truck driver from a \nlogging company did not suffer a permanent loss of wage earning \ncapacity and remanded the case for further consideration.\n  In McCarty Farms, Inc. v. Caprice Banks, Judge Southwick concurred \nwith an opinion affirming the Workers' Compensation Commission's award \nof permanent partial disability benefits for a woman who experienced a \n70-percent industrial disability to her right arm and a 30-percent loss \nto her left.\n  Indeed, contrary to some suggestions, Judge Southwick has spoken out \nin dissent in favor of workers' rights.\n\n[[Page S13247]]\n\n  In Total Transportation Inc. v. Shores, Judge Southwick joined with \nthree other dissenters in a 6-to-4 decision, which would have upheld an \naward of workers' compensation benefits for a truck driver's widow, \nwhile the majority ruled in favor of the employer.\n  In Burleson v. Hancock County Sheriff's Department--a 6-to-3 \ndecision--Judge Southwick wrote a dissent in which he argued that a \npublic employee was improperly terminated without sufficient due \nprocess under the U.S. Constitution, while the majority ruled in favor \nof the employer.\n  Judge Southwick has ruled in favor of tort victims and against \nbusinesses in many cases. Illustrative are Ducksworth v. Wal-Mart \nStores, Breland v. Gulfside Casino Partnership, Martin v. BP \nExploration & Oil, and Wilkins v. Bloodsaw.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a description of these \ncases be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       In Ducksworth v. Wal-Mart Stores, Judge Southwick joined \n     his colleagues in reversing the trial court's directed \n     verdict against a customer who had slipped on an unknown \n     substance at a Wal-Mart.\n       In Breland v. Gulfside Casino Partnership, Judge Southwick \n     joined an opinion for the court that reversed summary \n     judgment for a casino in a slip and fall action brought by a \n     patron who had suffered multiple injuries falling down the \n     casino's staircase.\n       In Martin v. BP Exploration & Oil, Judge Southwick joined \n     his colleagues in reversing summary judgment against a \n     plaintiff who injured her ankle upon exiting a gas station's \n     restroom on an allegedly poorly constructed access ramp.\n       In Wilkins v. Bloodsaw, Judge Southwick joined an opinion \n     for the court that reversed a grant of summary judgment in \n     favor of a Pizza Hut, which was sued by a mother who was \n     injured when her disabled son fell as she tried to help him \n     exit the restaurant.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Judge Southwick has voted in favor of criminal \ndefendants on numerous occasions, often in dissent. I cite a series of \ncases: Jones v. State, Parker v. State, Mills v. State, and Harris v. \nState, and ask unanimous consent that a description of these cases be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       In Jones v. State (a 5-5 decision), Judge Southwick \n     dissented, arguing for reversing a conviction because the \n     indictment did not provide the defendant with sufficient \n     clarity and specificity to know with certainty what crime was \n     being charged.\n       In Parker v. State (a 6-4 decision), Judge Southwick \n     dissented (in an opinion joined by some of his Democratic \n     brethren), arguing that a murder conviction should be \n     reversed because the trial judge failed to give a proper jury \n     instruction.\n       In Mills v. State (a 6-3 decision), Judge Southwick \n     dissented from the majority opinion affirming a drug \n     conviction on the grounds that the court should not have \n     admitted a statement by the defendant's four-year-old son, \n     and the state failed to disclose a piece of evidence against \n     the defendant that it had in its possession.\n       In Harris v. State (a 5-4 decision), Judge Southwick \n     dissented from the majority opinion affirming a DUI \n     conviction on the grounds that the trial court erroneously \n     allowed the state to avoid proving all the elements charged \n     in the indictment.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Further, Judge Southwick has voted in favor of the so-\ncalled underdogs. The suggestion that he is biased against women and \nhomosexuals is contradicted by a number of cases: Curtis v. Curtis, \nKmart Corp. v. Lee, Hughey v. State of Mississippi. Again, I ask \nunanimous consent that a description of these cases be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       In Curtis v. Curtis, Judge Southwick wrote for a divided \n     court and upheld the trial court's grant of divorce in favor \n     of the wife on the grounds of adultery. The dissent would \n     have reversed and remanded.\n       In Kmart Corp. v. Lee, Judge Southwick wrote an opinion \n     upholding the lower court's decision to award $500,000 to a \n     woman who slipped on antifreeze in a Kmart. Judge Southwick \n     sympathized with the woman, stating: ``Before the fall, Lee \n     was a hard working, independent woman who was able to take \n     care of many problems at the apartment complex she managed \n     herself. . . . now she is unable to work a full day . . .''\n       In Hughey v. State of Mississippi, Judge Southwick affirmed \n     the trial court's decision to disallow cross-examination as \n     to the victim's sexual preference. He recognized that whether \n     the victim was homosexual was not relevant to the defense and \n     that such a line of inquiry would produce undue prejudice.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is a very short statement of the qualifications of \nJudge Southwick. I believe if Judge Southwick were under consideration \nfor any circuit court of appeals except for the Fifth Circuit--which \nhas had a history of difficulties in obtaining confirmation and has had \nan overtone of concern about civil rights--if he were up for any other \ncircuit, there would be no hesitancy.\n  This man ought to be judged on the basis of his own record and his \nown qualifications. But he has demonstrated fairness and an \nappreciation for the rule of law and for equality regardless of race, \ncolor, creed and regardless of standing and has been willing to stand \nup for plaintiffs in tort cases and defendants in criminal cases and, \nas stated earlier, women and those of a different choice of sexual \norientation, so that on the record he is deserving of confirmation.\n  It is my hope he will be judged as an individual. That is the \nAmerican way. By that standard, he certainly would be confirmed.\n  Mr. President, how much time did I consume in my speech?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 14 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  I now yield 20 minutes to the distinguished Senator from California \nand then 10 minutes to the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott. And if \nSenator--\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, there are still some requests on our side \nfor time. I would hope we would have a chance--\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask Senator Cardin, how much time would \nthe Senator like?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I will be speaking for about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, 10 minutes to Senator Cardin. And if \nSenator Cochran desires time: unlimited time, if he so desires.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Five minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Cochran asks for 5 minutes.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I was under the \nimpression that time was divided between the proponents and opponents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may I inquire if Senator Cardin is \nspeaking in opposition?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I will be speaking in opposition to the \nnomination.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think Senator Cardin needs his time \nfrom Senator Leahy, but I am sure there would be no difficulty in \nhaving 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I understand that. I wonder if we would follow the normal \npractice of allowing those in opposition to be able to speak in regular \norder rather than having to wait for the time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask the Senator, do you want to speak now?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Yes, I would prefer to have an opportunity to speak.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think that would be acceptable, if it is OK with the \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is fine.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask consent that Senator Cardin be \nrecognized now and then Senator Feinstein be recognized next, and if \nothers appear, it is appropriate, as Senator Cardin suggested, that we \nalternate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank Senator Specter for the courtesy. I notice \nSenator Leahy is not on the floor, and I appreciate my colleague from \nPennsylvania organizing the debate on the floor.\n  I appreciate that.\n  This is a unique body, the Senate of the United States. One of our \nmost important responsibilities is the advice and consent on \nPresidential appointments on the confirmation of Federal judges. The \nConstitution envisions that we will use independent judgment in order \nto make these decisions. Article III, section 2, clause 2 of the \nConstitution gives us the power to confirm Federal judges.\n  I know all of my colleagues know these are lifetime appointments, so \nthis is our one chance in order to evaluate those who will serve as \nFederal judges. We are talking about the U.S. Court of Appeals. For \nmost Federal cases, this will be the final decision on a case that is \nbrought in the\n\n[[Page S13248]]\n\nFederal court. Very few in percentages of the cases reach the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. So the Court of Appeals is responsible for \nmuch of our laws in this country as far as the final judicial \ndetermination.\n  When I sought to become a Member of this body, I went over with the \npeople of Maryland the standards I would use in trying to decide \nwhether to vote to confirm a judge. I talked about judicial temperament \nand experience, but I also talked about a standard that I think is very \nimportant, which is a judge's or potential judge's passion for the \nConstitution of this country in order to protect every individual. I \nthink it is important that we take a look at that, particularly when we \ntalk about an individual who will serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  I have sat in the confirmation hearings. I am a member of the \nJudiciary Committee. I had a chance to listen to Judge Southwick. I had \na chance to listen to the questions that were posed back and forth. I \nmust tell my colleagues I cannot support this confirmation. I will vote \nagainst it, and I would like to give the reasons why.\n  Senator Specter talked about some of the opinions that Judge \nSouthwick participated in or some of his rulings, and I think that is \nwhat we should be looking at. For Judge Southwick, we do have an idea \nabout his passion for the Constitution and what his priorities will be \nby looking at the type of cases he ruled on, the opinions he joined, \nand the opinions he wrote. So let me talk about the two opinions \nSenator Specter raises, because I think they are important opinions in \norder to get some insight as to this judge's passion for the \nConstitution.\n  The 1998 case of Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human Services \nwas an important case. It was very offensive to not just the minority \ncommunity but the entire community. The racial term that was used \nshould never be used, as Senator Leahy said, in the workplace or \nanyplace else. The dissent of that opinion, of that decision, got it \nright, where it said that the racial epithet is inherently offensive \nand its use establishes the intent to offend. Unfortunately, that was \nthe minority opinion in that court. On appeal it was overturned, but \nJudge Southwick joined the majority. The rationale in the majority \nopinion I think is important, because it speaks to what Judge Southwick \nused to reach his conclusions. In that opinion he said the absence of \nevidence of a near race riot, the remark is too inconsequential to \nserve as a basis of dismissal.\n  I find that very offensive. I think we do have to be held accountable \nto where we allow our name to be added. Fortunately, as I said, that \nwas corrected, but it took an appellate court to do that.\n  In 2001, we have S.B. v. L.W. where a 12-year-old child is taken away \nfrom her mother. It was done because she was a lesbian. The language in \nthe opinion is very offensive. It talks about a homosexual lifestyle, \nwords that I think we all know bring out bigotry in our society. But \nJudge Southwick went further in that case. He joined a concurring \nopinion that said your sexual orientation is a matter of choice and any \nadult may choose any activity in which to engage. That person is not \nthereby relieved of the consequences of his or her choice.\n  No wonder Judge Southwick is being challenged by many respected \nnational groups. Upon questioning within our committee on confirmation, \nI didn't get a sense that there was a retraction by Judge Southwick of \nthese decisions. He stuck by the decisions.\n  At the confirmation hearing, Senator Durbin asked him a pretty simple \nquestion. He asked him a question about whether during his life or \ncareer, he ever took an unpopular point of view on behalf of those who \nwere powerless or vulnerable and needed someone to stand up for their \nrights when it was not a popular position. That, to me, is a softball \nquestion: When did you stand up for someone else's rights? Judge \nSouthwick couldn't think of a single example throughout his entire \ncareer.\n  So there is no wonder that there is concern about whether this \npotential judge on the court of appeals will protect all of our rights \nas the cases come before him and why there is so much concern about his \nconfirmation.\n  But I want to go on to another issue that Senator Leahy raised, and \nthat is the issue of diversity. Diversity is very important. We expect \nall of our citizens will live according to the rule of law and will \nhave confidence that the laws we make and the Court's rulings on those \nlaws will be fair to all communities, so they have a right to expect \nthat there will be equal access to participation in all branches of \nGovernment. Looking at the record in the Fifth Circuit, there is reason \nfor concern. The Fifth Circuit is Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas--\nthe highest percentage of minority population in the country of any \ncircuit outside of the District of Columbia--44 percent minority. Of \nthe 10 nominees President Bush has submitted to the Federal bench from \nMississippi and the Fifth Circuit--10--none have been African American. \nMississippi has the largest percentage of African Americans of any \nState in the Nation: 36 percent. Of the 19 Federal judges on the Fifth \nCircuit, only one is African American. These are important issues to \nthe people of that circuit and to the people of this country.\n  So there are many organizations that are opposing Judge Southwick's \nnomination. I ask unanimous consent that the letters of opposition and \nconcern from the J. Franklin Bourne Bar Association and the National \nOrganization for Women, the Legal Momentum, and the Jewish Alliance for \nLaw and Social Action be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                J. Franklyn Bourne\n\n\n                                        Bar Association, Inc.,\n\n                                 Upper Marlboro, MD, June 7, 2007.\n     Re: Nomination of Leslie Southwick.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The J. Franklyn Bourne Bar Association, \n     Inc. opposes the nomination of Leslie Southwick to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n       Established in 1977, the Bourne Bar was formed to advance \n     the status of African-American attorneys who work and/or live \n     in Montgomery and Prince George's Counties, Maryland. The \n     organization is named in honor of the Honorable J. Franklyn \n     Bourne, the first African-American District Court judge in \n     Prince George's County. The Bar Association's mission \n     includes assisting in the development of African-American \n     communities through the vehicle of law, educating the general \n     public about legal issues of concern to all, and insuring the \n     continuation of African-Americans in the legal profession. It \n     is in the spirit of our mission that we register our \n     opposition to the Leslie Southwick's nomination.\n       A representative democracy is a must in a free society, and \n     as such the residents of the state of Mississippi, Texas and \n     Louisiana are deserving of a federal judiciary that reflects \n     the composition of their respective citizenry. More \n     importantly, as federal judgeships are lifetime positions, \n     each candidate for such an appointment must he closely \n     scrutinized. Judge Southwick's pattern of approving \n     preemptory challenges that exclude Blacks from juries while \n     approving challenges when whites allege discrimination from \n     such challenges is particularly troubling; so to is the \n     decision Judge Southwick joined in the case Richmond v. \n     Mississippi Department of Human Services which would have \n     reinstated a white woman who used the phrase ``good ole \n     nigger'' about an African American coworker.\n       The Senate Judiciary is constitutionally tasked with the \n     responsibility of approving nominations by the President \n     following fair deliberations. In that regard, the Bourne Bar \n     Association is confident that its opposition outlined above \n     will be duly noted.\n       Thank you for your attention.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Abigale Bruce-Watson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              National Organization for Women,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2007.\n     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Organization for Women \n     strongly opposes the nomination of Leslie Southwick to the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. We urge you to \n     oppose this nomination both in the Judiciary Committee and on \n     the floor of the Senate.\n       Judge Southwick has a disturbing record and an appalling \n     lack of sensitivity on women's rights, racial justice, and \n     discrimination based on sexual orientation. He demonstrates \n     the usual Bush nominee bias toward big business and against \n     consumers and individuals.\n       In the 2006 election, the voters clearly rejected right \n     wing extremism. The National Organization for Women expects \n     that those Senators who were elected by the votes of women \n     will take their ``advise and consent'' role seriously and not \n     put our rights in jeopardy by confirming such an individual \n     to one of the highest courts in the land.\n\n[[Page S13249]]\n\n       As we have learned from many past judicial battles, a \n     ``yes'' vote in committee which allows a nomination to reach \n     the floor of the Senate is tantamount to a vote for \n     confirmation regardless of a subsequent ``no'' vote on the \n     floor. We urge you to stand firm and to vote to stop this \n     nomination in its tracks--in the Judiciary committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Kim Gandy,\n     NOW President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Jewish Alliance for Law and\n\n\n                                                 Social Action\n\n                                         Boston, MA, June 8, 2007.\n     Re Maintaining an Independent Judiciary\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: As an organization devoted to upholding \n     constitutional protections against racial and religious \n     discrimination, we write to urge that you and your colleagues \n     on the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate oppose the \n     appointment to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals of Leslie \n     Southwick.\n       Judge Southwick has demonstrated his disdain for equal \n     rights and equal protection under the law. While on the \n     Mississippi State Court of Appeals, he joined a decision that \n     upheld the reinstatement, without any punishment whatsoever, \n     of a white state employee who was fired for calling an \n     African American co-worker a ``good ole nigger'', finding \n     that this was not an offensive term. In another case, Mr. \n     Southwick went out of his way to go beyond the majority \n     decision against a lesbian mother, in a concurrence that was \n     not only gratuitous but gratuitously anti-gay.\n       While the current President has tried to fill this seat on \n     the Fifth Circuit with other appointees equally out of the \n     mainstream, this is the first nomination since the Democratic \n     Party has regained its Congressional majority. Now is the \n     time to deliver a strong message that Democrats will protect \n     the American people, the Constitution and the judiciary from \n     the prospect of even more extremist right wing judges who \n     will continue to undermine the judiciary's crucial role in \n     preserving our bedrock constitutional protections.\n       We at JALSA urge you not only to reject this nomination but \n     to do so in a way that makes clear that the Senate will \n     protect the independence of the judiciary, and will no longer \n     allow this administration to pack the courts in order to \n     legislate an extremist agenda of bigotry and hatred.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                   Andrew Fischer,\n     Chair, Judicial Nominations Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Legal Momentum,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Spector,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: On behalf of \n     Legal Momentum, the nation's oldest advocacy organization \n     that works to define and defend the rights of women and \n     girls, I urge you to oppose the nomination of Judge Leslie \n     Southwick to the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. \n     While much of Judge Southwick's record remains unknown due to \n     lack of publishing and incomplete Committee records, what has \n     been revealed is disheartening for those who look to the \n     federal courts to uphold and enforce laws barring \n     discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin and \n     religion.\n       Historically, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has served \n     as a bulwark for the protection of civil rights. However, \n     Judge Southwick displays a continued absence of dedication to \n     upholding certain essential civil rights protections. In the \n     case of Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human Services, \n     1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 637 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998), reversed, \n     745 So. 2d 254 (Miss. 1999), Judge Southwick joined a 5-4 \n     ruling upholding the reinstatement of a white state social \n     worker, Bonnie Richmond, who had been fired for referring to \n     an African American co-worker as ``a good ole n*****'' at an \n     employment-related conference. The Mississippi Supreme Court \n     unanimously reversed this ruling. Similarly, Judge \n     Southwick's rulings on race discrimination in jury selection \n     give us pause. A review of his decisions reveals a disturbing \n     pattern in which Judge Southwick routinely rejects defense \n     claims regarding racially motivated prosecutors who strike \n     African-American jurors but upholds claims of prosecutors \n     that defense attorneys are striking white jurors on the basis \n     of their race. The 5th Circuit, which includes Louisiana, \n     Mississippi and Texas, has the highest concentration of \n     racial and ethnic minorities in the country. There is no room \n     at any level of the judiciary for Southwick's troubling and \n     seemingly biased approach to the enforcement of civil rights \n     laws.\n       In another case, S.B. v. L W, 793 So.2d 656 (Miss. App. Ct. \n     2001), Judge Southwick wrote a separate concurring opinion \n     positing that a ``homosexual lifestyle'' could be used to \n     deprive a parent of the custody of her own child. His \n     concurrence, a unwarranted and hurtful piece of work, took \n     great pains to elaborate upon the punitive ``consequences'' \n     that could be imposed on individuals in homosexual \n     relationships, including the loss of custody of a child. \n     Grounding his beliefs in the principles of ``federalism'', he \n     promoted limiting the rights of gay and lesbian parents in \n     the area of family law and characterized the participation in \n     a homosexual relationship as a ``choice'' and an ``exertion \n     of a perceived right.''\n       Discussing an issue not raised by either party in the case \n     and citing incomplete legal analysis, the concurrence also \n     identified a policy position of the Mississippi legislature \n     that would limit the custody rights of homosexual parents. \n     His opinion cited the Supreme Court's decision in Bowers v. \n     Hardwick, which upheld criminal penalties for sodomy, but \n     ignored the more recent decision in Romer v. Evans, in which \n     the attempt to deny anti-discrimination protections to gays \n     and lesbians via ballot initiative was found not to further a \n     proper legislative end, but deemed a means to make them \n     unequal and consequently struck down. His contorted and \n     selective analysis showcases a distinct lack of the judicial \n     impartiality necessary in appeals court judges.\n       Lastly, we cannot accept the possibility that there are no \n     qualified African-Americans to serve on this Circuit's Court \n     of Appeals. President Bush's glaring lack of racially diverse \n     nominations remains unfathomable, and unacceptable to our \n     organization, specifically in a region that displays such a \n     long history of racial apartheid and disenfranchisement and \n     continues to need integration at every level, particularly in \n     the federal judiciary.\n       Given the arguments listed above, it is clear that the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee must defeat Judge Southwick's \n     nomination. He does not possess the requisite abilities to \n     merit a life-tenured position in the federal judiciary. In \n     rejecting Southwick's nomination, please urge President Bush \n     to nominate a well-qualified individual with the appropriate \n     judicial temperament to dispense justice as intended by our \n     Constitution and a demonstrated respect for fundamental \n     constitutional rights.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Lisalyn R. Jacobs,\n                          Vice-President for Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am going to quote very briefly from the \nletter from the Bourne Bar Association where it says:\n\n       A representative democracy is a must in a free society, and \n     as such the residents of the State of Mississippi, Texas, and \n     Louisiana are deserving of a Federal judiciary that reflects \n     the composition of their respective citizenry.\n\n  Ten nominees from this area; none African American.\n  The National Organization for Women states:\n\n       Judge Southwick has a disturbing record and an appalling \n     lack of sensitivity on women's rights, racial justice, and \n     discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\n  The Jewish Alliance for Law and Social Action:\n\n       Judge Southwick has demonstrated his disdain for equal \n     rights and equal protection under the law.\n\n  So I am not convinced Judge Southwick is the best that we can find \nfor the court of appeals. I am not going to give the President a blank \ncheck, and I will vote against the confirmation of Judge Southwick.\n  Once again, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for his courtesy.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I plan to vote against cloture on the \nnomination of Judge Southwick, and, if cloture is invoked, against the \nnomination itself.\n  The Fifth Circuit serves one of the most racially diverse regions in \nthe country. It is especially important, therefore, that a nominee to \nthis court possess an unshakable commitment to equal justice and a \nwillingness to protect the rights of all. Unfortunately, President Bush \nhas chosen a nominee who does not pass this simple test.\n  During his tenure with the Mississippi State court, Judge Southwick \njoined a ruling that reinstated a State employee who used a very \ncharged racial slur about another worker. That decision was unanimously \nreversed by the Mississippi Supreme Court. In another case, Judge \nSouthwick joined in an opinion that took into consideration the sexual \norientation of a mother rather than her love for her child when \ndeciding to deny her custody. On other occasions, he voted against the \nconcept of ``a jury of our peers.''\n  I am deeply disappointed that President Bush has once again attempted \nto fill the Fifth Circuit vacancy with a nominee holding views far to \nthe right of most Americans, and I do not support the nomination of \nJudge Southwick to the Fifth Circuit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I too rise to discuss the nomination \nof Judge Leslie Southwick and to explain why I will vote in favor of \ncloture and in favor of confirming him to the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n\n[[Page S13250]]\n\n  There has seldom been an appellate nominee to whom I have given more \nthought than I have given to Judge Southwick. I am very much aware of \nthe concerns many on my side of the aisle, in the House of \nRepresentatives, and in the community feel.\n  I have reviewed Judge Southwick's record and the transcript of his \nconfirmation hearing. I have read the many letters, both pro and con, \nand I have spent about an hour or more talking with him in person.\n  What emerged for me was an understanding that Judge Southwick is a \nqualified, sensitive, and circumspect person. I think the personal \nqualities of an individual often get lost in our debates about judicial \nnominees. These nominees are not just a collection of prior writings or \nprior judicial opinions. They are, first and foremost, people; and the \nkind of person they are is, in fact, important. In my conversations \nwith Judge Southwick, I have gotten a sense of the type of person that \nI believe him to be. He is not either insensitive or a racist but one \nwho is thoughtful and analytical and a strong believer in the law. As \nan appellate court judge, he evaluates the specific legal issues of the \ncase before him, not necessarily the veracity of the parties involved \nas would a trial judge.\n  I know some of my colleagues are opposed to this nomination. Concerns \nhave been raised about his judicial record, particularly with regard to \ncivil rights and the rights of gays and lesbians. I assure my \ncolleagues that I have taken these concerns seriously. I gave them \ncareful consideration and made my best judgment, which is all any of us \ncan do.\n  While I respect the views of my colleagues who oppose this \nnomination, I also respectfully disagree. I think Judge Southwick made \nmistakes by concurring in the two opinions in question, but I don't \nthink those rulings define his views. I don't believe they outweigh the \nother factors that suggest Judge Southwick should be confirmed.\n  As I see it, there are three factors that weigh in favor of \nconfirmation. They are:\n  First, the qualifications and character of the judge himself;\n  Second, the need to fill this long-time vacancy in the Fifth Circuit \nwhich the judicial branch has designated as a judicial emergency;\n  And third, my very strong belief that when a future Democratic \nPresident sends up a judicial nominee who becomes controversial, the \ntest should be whether the nominee is within the judicial mainstream \nand is qualified by education, experience, and temperament to be a \nsound judge or Justice in the Federal court system of our great \ncountry.\n  When I weighed those factors against the concerns I have heard, I \ndecided to vote in favor of Judge Southwick in committee. They also \nwill form the basis for my vote on Judge Southwick tomorrow.\n  The first factor I wish to address is his qualifications and \ncharacter. I don't think anyone disagrees that Judge Southwick is an \nexperienced appellate court judge. He sat on the State court of appeals \nin Mississippi for 11 years, from January 1995 to December of 2006. He \nhas heard roughly 7,000 appeals.\n  How many judges have we confirmed without nearly that kind of \nexperience? This is a large number of cases.\n  There is no organization better positioned to evaluate the \nperformance of judges in Mississippi than the Mississippi State bar, \nand they awarded Judge Southwick their Judicial Excellence Award in \n2004, after he had been on the State court bench for 10 years. That \naward describes him as: ``A leader in advancing the quality and \nintegrity of justice,'' and as ``a person of high ideals, character, \nand integrity.''\n  Isn't that the kind of judge we want to see on the bench?\n  I think those views from the bar association from his home State are \nimportant. I also think it is significant that the American Bar \nAssociation, which evaluates every judicial nominee that comes to the \nSenate for confirmation, unanimously rated Judge Southwick ``well \nqualified''--their highest rating. In fact, the evaluation by the ABA \nfor him to serve on the Fifth Circuit is stronger than it was when he \nwas nominated to a district court last year.\n  For that nomination, the ABA was not unanimous in finding him ``well \nqualified.'' But they were for the appellate court.\n  The Judiciary Committee approved that nomination, but the 109th \nCongress ended without further action on it. Now, Judge Southwick \nstands before us with a unanimous recommendation for the Fifth Circuit \nfrom the ABA.\n  I am also impressed, as Senator Specter spelled out, by his record of \nmilitary service to our country. I find it singular among the judges in \nthe 15 years I have served on the Judiciary Committee.\n  This judge joined the U.S. Army Reserves in 1992 at the age of 42. To \ndo that, he had to get an age waiver.\n  How many would do that?\n  He had already achieved professional success as a lawyer. At the \ntime, he was serving as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the \nCivil Division of the Department of Justice. Still, he felt a sense of \nduty to his country, and he did not let his age or his promising \ncivilian legal career stop him.\n  He volunteered in 2004 for a unit that was going to be deployed to \nIraq. That unit, the 155th Brigade Combat Team, was, in fact, deployed, \nand he was with it.\n  Judge Southwick was 53 years old at the time. He had a wife and \nfamily and a prestigious job as a judge on the State court of appeals. \nYet, from January to December 2005, he served in Iraq--first as a \nDeputy Staff Judge Advocate at Forward Operating Base Duke, and then as \nStaff Judge Advocate for the 155th Brigade at Forward Operating Base \nKalsu.\n  How many judges have done that? Shouldn't that count for something?\n  Well, it counts to me, Mr. President. To me, it is a clear indication \nof the character of the man, and I deeply respect him for this military \nservice.\n  The second factor that is important, in my judgment, is the need to \nfill this vacancy on the Fifth Circuit. It has been vacant for 7 out of \nthe last 8 years. Judge Southwick is the third nominee for the \nposition--not the first or the second, but the third.\n  The vacancy opened in August 1999--7 years ago--and went unfilled for \nmore than 4 years. Then, in 2004, the President used a recess \nappointment to place Charles Pickering on the bench. The Senate did not \nconfirm Judge Pickering to the seat, and since the end of 2004, it has \nbeen vacant again. Michael Wallace was nominated for it, but that \nnomination wasn't approved by the Judiciary Committee.\n  So at this time the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has \ndeclared this seat to be a ``judicial emergency.''\n  Now, I am not suggesting that we should confirm whomever the \nPresident nominates just because a seat has been vacant for a long \ntime, or because the seat has been designated a judicial emergency. But \nI hope this urgent need to fill a longtime vacancy will help tip the \nbalance in the nominee's favor. By any measure, 7 years is too long for \na vacancy to remain open.\n  The third factor that weighs in favor of confirmation for me is my \nstrong belief that we have seen too much delay and controversy over \nqualified nominees for too many years.\n  There are plenty of examples of long delays in the confirmation \nprocess when President Clinton was in office and the Senate was under \nthe Republican control. For example, when Ronnie White had the support \nof Senator Bond and was voted favorably out of the Judiciary Committee \ntwice, it took more than 2\\1/2\\ years for the nomination to come to the \nfloor, and then the nomination was rejected.\n  William Fletcher was a well-qualified Ninth Circuit nominee in the \n1990s. Unlike Judge White, at least Judge Fletcher was confirmed by the \nRepublican Senate--thanks in large measure to Senator Hatch--but not \nuntil he had waited for 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  During that period of time, I had calls from prospective judges, \nsaying: I don't know what to do. Do I stay the course, or withdraw? \nWhat do I do about my family? These are real problems and we ought to \nrespond to them.\n  I also share the views of my colleague, Senator Lott, that we must \nimprove the confirmation process. He recently wrote an op-ed column in \nwhich he explained his vote to confirm Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to \nthe Supreme Court. Since the Senator is sitting here, let me quote him:\n\n       I probably wouldn't agree with Justice Ginsburg on any \n     philosophical issue, but she\n\n[[Page S13251]]\n\n     was qualified to serve by education, experience, and \n     temperament. Elections have consequences, and she had \n     President Clinton's confidence.\n\n  That is the way it was. I have used the same analysis to arrive at my \nposition on Judge Southwick. I probably would not agree with him on \ncertain philosophical issues, but I think he is qualified to serve by \neducation, by experience, and by temperament.\n  Critics of this nomination have pointed to two opinions: one that \nreinstated an employee who had been fired for using an egregious racial \nslur, and another that denied a woman custody of her child for reasons \nthat included--but were not limited to--her involvement in a same-sex \nrelationship.\n  These are 2 opinions out of 7,000 cases that he heard or that he sat \non. They are opinions he joined, not ones he wrote. One was a majority \nopinion joined by four other judges on his court, and one was a \nconcurring opinion in a case where he also joined the majority opinion.\n  Ultimately, the case involving the racial slur was reversed by the \nState supreme court and remanded for consideration of a different \npenalty. The ruling of Judge Southwick's court in the child custody \ncase apparently was not appealed to the State's high court.\n  Critics of Judge Southwick have also pointed to certain rulings that, \nin their view, suggest that Judge Southwick will be hostile to \nworkers, minorities, and those who lack power and privilege in our \nsociety. These are serious concerns. But I don't think these cases \naccurately reflect Judge Southwick's views. This is only my best \njudgment, based on my own discussions with him.\n\n  The racial slur case, Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human \nServices, involved, as has been stated, a State employee who had used a \nracial slur in reference to an African-American coworker. The State \nagency fired the employee, and she appealed to an administrative board, \nwhich ordered her reinstated.\n  Judge Southwick joined a majority opinion that upheld the board's \ndecision to reinstate the employee. The opinion stated that there was \nsufficient evidence in the record to support the decision of the board.\n  I believe he should not have joined the court's opinion, but I don't \nthink his decision to concur in that opinion should disqualify him from \nbeing a Federal judge.\n  After our meeting in person, I asked the judge to put his thoughts in \nwriting, and he did. I found the letter convincing.\n  Mr. President, I will quote some of this letter:\n\n       The court said that the use of the word ``cannot be \n     justified'' by any argument. It could have gone far beyond \n     that legalistic statement. Captured in this one terrible word \n     is a long, dark, sad chapter in our history. This racial slur \n     is unique in its impact and painful to hear for many, \n     including myself. I said at my hearing that this is the worst \n     of all racial slurs. Its use is despicable. All people of \n     good will should make their rejection of the word clear. The \n     opinion had an opportunity to express more fully and \n     accurately the complete disgust that should greet the use of \n     this word. Such a statement would certainly be consistent \n     with my own beliefs that this is the worst kind of insult. As \n     I testified, everyone took this issue extraordinarily \n     seriously. I regret that the failure to express in more depth \n     our repugnance of the use of this phrase has now led to an \n     impression that we did not approach this case with sufficient \n     gravity and understanding of the impact of this word.\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       I always tried to treat everyone who came before me as a \n     judge with respect. I gave a memorandum to each of my law \n     clerks that they were to use no disparaging words towards \n     anyone in a draft opinion, no matter what the appeal was \n     about. From the bench and in my opinions, I followed that \n     same rule. I believe that everyone whom I encounter, whether \n     as a judge or in some purely private capacity, is deserving \n     of my respect.\n       I took a broad view in looking for staff. I was one of the \n     original ten judges on the Court of Appeals, taking office in \n     January 1995. In my second year on the court, I became the \n     first white judge to hire an African-American law clerk on \n     that court. I could not have been more pleased with her work, \n     and she went on to be a partner in a major Mississippi law \n     firm. I was equally pleased with the two additional African-\n     American clerks I hired before I left the court.\n\n  Judge Southwick concludes by saying:\n\n       Until the last two months, my fairness and temperament had \n     not been subject to criticisms. The recent concern may have \n     arisen from the fact that only one piece of evidence was \n     being used, namely, the racial slur opinion. A much better \n     explanation of my own abhorrence of this slur clearly could \n     have been written. I have tried in this explanation to \n     express my disgust for the use of that word and to present \n     some of the evidence from my own life to prove my commitment \n     to furthering the civil rights of all.\n\n  In the second case, the child custody case, which is called S.B. v. \nL.W., Judge Southwick's court affirmed a decision to deny custody of a \nchild to a mother who was in a same-sex relationship. The lower court \nhad based its opinion on several different factors, such as employment, \nfinancial stability, and stability of the environment, and not just the \nsexual orientation of the mother.\n  In fact, a major concern in the case was that the mother was planning \nto move to a new city, and the mother had admitted that the move was \nnot in the daughter's best interest. She said she did not know where \nher daughter would attend school, and also that she would be devoting a \nlot of time to starting a new business after the move.\n  Judge Southwick joined the majority opinion, upholding a lower \ncourt's decision that the best interests of the child would be better \nserved by being in the father's custody. He also joined a concurring \nopinion written by another judge.\n  When asked about the case at his hearing, Judge Southwick said that \nhe had joined the concurring opinion because it followed State law at \nthe time, which was governed by Supreme Court precedent that has since \nbeen overruled. Judge Southwick conceded at the hearing that under \ncurrent law the analysis of the case, and perhaps the result, would be \ndifferent.\n  Again, the question is whether his decision to join the opinion is \ngrounds for disqualifying him from a Federal judgeship. To me, simply \nstated, it is not.\n  So I am voting in favor of Judge Southwick because I think, based on \nthe letter he wrote to me, on my discussions with him, and on his \nrecord, he is not outside of the judicial mainstream.\n  That is the primary criterion I use when evaluating an appellate \nnominee, and I expect future nominees of Democratic Presidents to be \ntreated in the same way.\n  I believe the concerns that have been raised about Judge Southwick \nare outweighed by his record of service to our country, his long \nexperience as an appellate court judge, and the temperament I have come \nto know in my discussions with him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum \nrequired under rule XXII with respect to the Southwick nomination be \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I obviously rise in support of the cloture \nmotion and in support of the nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick to be \nconfirmed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I begin by thanking Senator Reid for allowing this nomination to be \ncalled up and even considered. He doesn't have to do that as our \nleader, but he should be commended by those of us who support Judge \nSouthwick for his willingness to allow the nomination to be debated and \nconsidered.\n  Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to the very studied \nand careful job that Senator Feinstein has done with regard to this \nnominee. I know it has not been easy, but I also know that she has \ntaken time, she has been patient, she has done her homework. I am sure \nshe has endured criticism. She has shown tonight that she is truly one \nof the outstanding lions or lionesses, I guess, is the correct word, of \nthe Senate. She has shown courage.\n  She and I have worked together. Sometimes we have lost when we have \nworked together, and sometimes we have succeeded. But we have tried to \ndo the right thing for the Senate and for our country. I have nothing \nbut the utmost admiration and appreciation for the position she has \ntaken. I actually am hesitant to proceed after her comments because \nthey were so careful and so well thought out and presented.\n  I do think that I would like to put a few remarks into the Record \ntonight,\n\n[[Page S13252]]\n\nand I will add additional items tomorrow. I thank Senator Feinstein so \nmuch. What she did tonight with regard to this nominee and how she is \ngoing to vote tomorrow is the kind of thing, I believe, that will \naffect in a positive way the nominations of other men and women in the \nfuture in the Senate. We have worked together on nominees from \nCalifornia in the past, and I stood against a filibuster then, and I am \nproud I did. I have voted for nominees, such as Justice Ginsburg, \nbecause I thought it was right.\n  I also have been a party to and have observed conduct in the Senate \nby my colleagues on this side of the aisle that I am sorry about, I \nregret. But how do we ever stop the slide downhill by the Republicans \nand then by the Democrats and then again by the Republicans? When can \nwe rise above that type of personal and partisan attack and consider \nthese nominations and legislation in a more respectful and responsible \nway?\n  I believe Senator Feinstein has taken that first step that can lead \nto other steps, and we will stop this slide I have observed occurring \nmore and more each year for 10 years. Now maybe this is the moment, \nmaybe this will be the catalyst that will lead to other steps on this \nside of the aisle and on the other side of the aisle so that we will \ntreat these nominations and legislation in a proper way.\n  I thank the Senator for staying and allowing me to commend her. I \nhope it doesn't get her into too much trouble, but I admire the Senator \nvery much.\n  I do want to recognize the remarks made by Senator Specter of \nPennsylvania and the thorough job he did in referring to particular \ncases. I don't want to repeat the cases that have been mentioned here \ntonight, or go over his whole resume again, but I wish to take a moment \nto maybe highlight some of the parts of that resume of this very \ndistinguished nominee.\n\n  I also want to note the presence of the senior Senator from \nMississippi, my colleague Senator Cochran. He and I have been in the \nCongress for 35 years. We were in the House together. He came to the \nSenate, and 10 years later I came to the Senate. One of the things I \ndid when I came to the Senate, I sat down and talked to Senator Cochran \nabout how to consider nominees for the Federal judiciary, because he \nwas on the Judiciary Committee. He had some very good, helpful, and \nsimple advice. Basically, he said if they are from your State, \ncertainly if they are personally repugnant, you can vote against them. \nBut basically, he said, if they are qualified by education and by \nexperience and by temperament, you should be supportive. Kind of \nsimple, but it was a thoughtful suggestion to me that came from this \nexperienced member of the Judiciary Committee, and I have tried to do \nthat, and I will continue to do so.\n  I do believe very strongly that this nominee is obviously well \nqualified. One of the things that was noted about his outstanding \nacademic record was that he graduated cum laude from Rice University, a \nwell-known and well-respected academic institution. He didn't just \ngraduate with honors, he graduated cum laude, right at the top. He \nlater graduated from the University of Texas School Of Law, where he \nalso had an outstanding record academically.\n  When he came to the State of Mississippi, he continued that record of \nsuccess. He worked with one of the most revered members of the Fifth \nCircuit, Chief Judge Charles Clark, one of the most outstanding jurists \nI have ever observed in my career of watching our Federal judiciary.\n  When he went to work for a law firm, he didn't go with just any law \nfirm, he went with one of the State's very best--Brunini, Grantham, \nGrower, and Hewes, where he became a partner. At every step along his \ncareer, he didn't do just well, he excelled in how he handled himself \nin the positions he had, and he continued that when he went on the \ncourt of appeals.\n  A lot has been made about the fact that he has served in the \nMississippi National Guard. He reached the rank of lieutenant colonel. \nHe didn't just serve as a reservist to meetings of the National Guard, \nhe was actively involved with the 155th Separate Armored Brigade. And, \nof course, he went with the 155th Brigade Combat Team and was mobilized \nin Operation Iraqi Freedom. So even there he took risks. He was \ninvolved in a way at his age that wouldn't ordinarily have been \nexpected. This further shows that he is a unique individual in terms of \nhis education and his experience.\n  But more than anything else, with rare exception, I have never seen a \nmore qualified nominee to be an appellate court judge; not just a \nFederal judge, but an appellate court judge. His experience has been in \nthe Mississippi appellate court system, where he presided or \nparticipated over 7,000 cases. That point has already been made, but \nthat is an extraordinarily large number of cases for him to be involved \nwith over these several years that he was a member of the appellate \ncourt in Mississippi.\n  In terms of the kind of man he is, let me read one part of one letter \nfrom one of the most revered and respected former Governors of our \nState of Mississippi, a Governor who has a very progressive record of \nleadership and of civil rights issues, and who has continued until this \nvery day to work for racial reconciliation and heads an organization at \nthe University of Mississippi dedicated to that purpose. This is a \nDemocrat. This is what most people would acknowledge in Mississippi \nwould be one of your more moderate to liberal Democrats. Knowing him, \nhe probably doesn't like those labels, but he has a record of \ninvolvement in those areas where this nominee has been challenged or \ncriticized. This is what William Winter, our former Governor, said:\n\n       I further know him to be a very intelligent, conscientious, \n     ethical and hard-working member of the legal profession. I \n     have a great deal of personal respect for him and based upon \n     my association with him I believe he will reflect fairness \n     and objectivity in his approach to all matters which may come \n     before him as a judge.\n\n  I don't know what higher recommendation you could have from our \nState, from a member of the opposite party, and a former Governor of \nour State. So he knows the background of this nominee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe entirety of the letter of William F. Winter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Watkins Ludlam Winter\n\n\n                                              & Stennis, P.A.,\n\n                              Jackson, Mississippi, June 13, 2007.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I join a number of my colleagues in \n     the Mississippi Bar in expressing support for the nomination \n     of the Honorable Leslie Southwick for a seat on the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the Fifth Court.\n       I personally know Judge Southwick as a highly regarded \n     attorney and jurist in Jackson, Mississippi. I further know \n     him to be a very intelligent, conscientious, ethical and \n     hard-working member of the legal profession.\n       While it is generally known in this community that he and I \n     do not share the same views on some public issues. I have a \n     great deal of personal respect for him and based on my \n     association with him I believe that he will reflect fairness \n     and objectivity in his approach to all matters which may come \n     before him as a Judge.\n       I, therefore, commend him to you as one whose personal \n     character and professional record make him worthy of your \n     favorable consideration for this important position.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                William F. Winter.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Judge Southwick was awarded the Judicial Excellence Award \nby the Mississippi State Bar Association, and he was rated not just \nwell qualified but unanimously well qualified by the American Bar \nAssociation. This is supposed to be the gold standard. The previous \nnominee for this position was not given that. He was given a ``not \nqualified'' rating by the bar association. So they don't just \nrubberstamp nominees, they look very closely at them.\n  If there is a question about his temperament, if there is a question \nabout his record on civil rights issues, or anything else, they would \nhave found it and they would have included it in their recommendations. \nAnd, by the way, this is the same nominee who, 1 year ago, was \nunanimously referred by the Judiciary Committee to be a Federal \ndistrict judge. Now, 1 year later, there are those who question the \nsame record they had a chance to review last year.\n  Of the opinions he actually authored, there is no criticism of the \nmore than\n\n[[Page S13253]]\n\n1,000 decisions where he actually wrote the opinion. I assure you, they \nwere scrubbed and reviewed very carefully. There are two decisions in \n7,000 where he concurred but did not write the decision, where \nquestions have been raised.\n  I know we all make mistakes, and we choose to associate sometimes \nwith situations or people we regret later. I know he would do some of \nhis decisions differently now if he had them to do over again. But this \nis a long distinguished record, with only a couple of phrases in two \ndecisions that, obviously, are troublesome.\n  Now, beyond those qualifications, he also has the temperament. He is \nmild mannered, he is very judicious, he is moderate in his approach to \nbeing a judge and in his life; not to say that he won't be conservative \nin a lot of his rulings. I think he will. But I am talking about \ndemeanor and temperament. Clearly, he has what Senator Cochran and I \nthought the Senate indicated they desired.\n  This is the third nominee for this vacancy. The other two didn't make \nit. We heard what the Senate had to say regarding these past nominees \nand we came up with a judge we thought met the criteria that was \nexpressed by a lot of our colleagues here in the Senate. But I also \nwant to emphasize this. I have stood on this floor and argued to my own \ncolleagues that we should not set the precedent of filibustering \nqualified judicial nominees----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes, if my colleague, Senator Cochran, would yield me those 2 to \nwrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have argued we should not filibuster \nFederal judges. One time when I sat in that seat as majority leader, my \ncolleagues actually voted to filibuster a judge and opposed cloture. \nSenator Hatch and I took to the floor and said we are not going to do \nthis. This is wrong. If you want to vote against him, vote against him, \nbut we are not going to filibuster these judges. Those judges were \nJudges Paez and Berzon in 2000. We had a second vote, reversed the \nprevious vote which opposed cloture, invoked cloture, and then voted on \nthose nominees. I voted against them both, but I thought they deserved \nan up-or-down vote.\n  Here tonight and tomorrow, when we vote, at the very minimum we \nshould not filibuster this nomination. We should allow this judge to \nhave an up-or-down vote. One of the speakers tonight indicated he would \nvote against him. Fine, if that is what your conscience dictates. But \nfirst, we have to deal with this question of should we start down this \ntrail of filibustering qualified judges because we disagree with some \nphilosophical position. We shouldn't do that. If we do it here, we will \ndo it again later. If we do it in this administration, we will do it in \nanother administration. Give the man an up-or-down vote. I believe--I \nam absolutely convinced--that he will be confirmed.\n  I will have a few more remarks probably in the morning, but let me \nsay to you, Mr. President, and to my colleagues in the Senate, I have \nnever before done this, but I can vouch on my honor to this institution \nthat I have served for many years now and in leadership positions, this \nis a good and qualified nominee who will reflect credit on the \ninstitution that confirms him and in the court in which he serves.\n  The judicial confirmation process has always shown strong deference \nto the opinions of home State Senators. There is good reason for this. \nHome State Senators are uniquely positioned to know the personalities, \nqualifications, and reputations of the nominees from their state. The \nfact that this traditional courtesy of the Senate is being ignored \nshould be cause for concern for every Senator in this Chamber.\n  I respected this traditional courtesy when I served as majority \nleader. In the last few years of the Clinton administration, a \nRepublican Senate confirmed a string of highly controversial appeals \ncourt nominees who nonetheless had the backing of their home State \nSenators.\n  When the controversial nominations of Paez and Berzon where debated \nin 2000, I filed cloture on both of their nominations. While many on my \nside of the aisle opposed the nominations, I upheld my promise to bring \ntheir nominations to an up-or-down vote.\n  We are in danger of establishing an ill-advised precedent that could \nhave longstanding negative ramifications on not just the legislative \nbranch but also upon the judicial branch. Should this body block a \nclearly qualified nominee based on a ``perceived controversy''?\n  Every Senator in this body needs to understand what is at stake here. \nThis isn't a simple case of controversial nominee being taken down in a \npartisan fight.\n  This is a mainstream nominee to a seat that has been declared a \njudicial emergency, with the strong support of both home State \nSenators, with a ``unanimously well qualified'' rating from the ABA--\nthe supposed gold standard for my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle--who was reported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously for \na lower court nomination less than 12 months ago, and a military judge \nwho courageously served in Iraq.\n  This isn't just about Judge Lesile Southwick. This is about the \nstandard that is being set for the future. Every Senator in this \nChamber will have judicial nominees that come from their home State, \nand they will expect those qualified nominees--with home State Senator \nsupport--to be confirmed. Well, that is not the precedent that we are \nestablishing here. Next time, this could be your nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, under the order, I think there were 5 \nminutes, and 2 of the minutes I yielded to my colleague and \ndistinguished Senator, so it is my intention to proceed with 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9 minutes remaining on the Senator's \nside.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I will use the balance of that in the morning.\n  The purpose of my being here tonight was to be sure I was available \nto hear the comments of all Senators who wanted to speak on this \nconfirmation. This has been a very frustrating experience for me \npersonally, because, as my colleague pointed out, we have confronted \ndifficulties in submitting names for the consideration of the Senate \nfor this particular position. Two he pointed out have been nominated by \nthe President and, in fact, rejected. Names were withdrawn because of \ndelays that made it clear those judicial nominees were unacceptable. So \nwe put our heads together, we talked about what the other options were, \nand decided Leslie Southwick was the epitome of someone who had to be \nacceptable to the Senate. Not only is he an experienced judge in an \nappellate court position, but he is a person of great integrity, widely \nrespected, even though he has been a Republican and active in politics \nin our State, supporting candidates that he thought were the best in \nhis party who were available to be nominated and elected. He is a \nperson who is widely respected by Democrats, as proven by William \nWinter's very generous letter complimenting him and pointing out his \npersonal qualities. That should be instructive to the Senate in its \nconsideration of this nomination.\n  I don't know of any situation I have confronted since I have been in \nthe Senate that has been more frustrating than watching and listening \nto the criticism of this nominee who has been totally unjustified, \ntotally unjustified on the record. Viewing his career as I have \nobserved it, it is not the same person I hear described by those I hear \ncriticizing and objecting to this nomination, reaching through 7,000 \nopinions trying to find something he had said or done or indicating a \nview that was unacceptable in a Federal judge. And they come up with \ntwo opinions that he didn't write, and they are fully explained by him, \nand totally contradictory, in the way they have interpreted, to his \npersonality, his good judgment, and the way he has lived his life.\n  I think it is a lot more instructive if you could have been with me \nyesterday in Natachez, MI, dedicating a new Federal court building, the \nshock, I guess, that others might find, that the Presiding Officer at \nthat ceremony was United States District Court Judge\n\n[[Page S13254]]\n\nHenry Wingate, an African American I had recommended 20 years ago for \nthe Federal bench, who is now the chief judge of the Southern District \nin the United States District Court.\n  There are several other judges, all of whom were there. Edith Jones \nof the Fifth Circuit, who is the chief judge now of the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, was our principal speaker on this occasion. And I \nnoticed that the person who is a U.S. marshal for the Southern District \nof Mississippi is Nehemiah Flowers, whom I had recommended many years \nago and has served in that job with distinction and reflected credit on \nAfrican Americans of our State, but also as an individual in his own \nright who is the chief keeper of the peace and law enforcement official \nin the Federal District Court, I was proud to be there on the podium \nwith him.\n  Leslie Southwick is totally well qualified and ought to be confirmed \nby the Senate. I have spoken on the Senate floor a couple of times at \ngreat length about it and put into the Record letters from people all \nover our State commending him and vouching for him, talking about his \nexperiences as a judge and my familiarity with him as a person. He has \na record that would be the envy of anyone who would aspire to be \nadmired and respected as a judge or a lawyer or a citizen. I can't \nbelieve that he is being challenged as harshly as he is by some in this \nbody, and I urge the Senate to confirm him as a United States Court of \nAppeals judge tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to speak in favor of Judge \nSouthwick and the nomination and would take up that 4 minutes.\n  A couple of quick points I want to make on this because the time is \nshort, the hour is late, and I appreciate the Presiding Officer \nstaying. I have met and I have gotten to know Judge Southwick. I have \nworked with him. I have seen him now through two Senates, the last \nSenate and this Senate. This is an honorable man. This is a good man. I \nthink this is a smear campaign that people are trying to do on him, on \na good man.\n  I think if he came up in different circumstances everybody would say: \nWhy, absolutely he is the right person for it.\n  Part of the reason I say that is you look at the last Congress when \nhe came up in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Judge Southwick \ncame up in the last Congress, and he was unanimously approved by the \nJudiciary Committee, seen as a consensus nominee who should move \nforward. He has been through these parts before. Why is it he was \nunanimous last time around and now he is a controversial candidate? Why \nis it you are looking at 7,000 opinions and somehow now we found \nsomething in a couple of opinions but didn't find those last year when \npeople were fly-specking it?\n  I think this is kind of a sign of the times and where we are and the \nPresident's time period and the President's approval ratings. He is in \nhis last 2 years and people are looking and saying we don't want to get \nthese many circuit court judges approved. But if you look at the \nrecord, this is not fair to this judge.\n  Look at the diversity issue. I just want to put a chart up on the \ndiversity of the Fifth Circuit because that issue has been raised, the \nnumber of appointees to the Fifth Circuit. Under President Clinton and \nBush: Women appointed under President Clinton, zero; President Bush \nappointed two; African Americans, one under Clinton, none under Bush; \nHispanics, one under Clinton, one under Bush, and actually there was a \nthird woman appointed under Bush. I don't think that stands the review \nand test of us being honorable and honest with what the situation is.\n  This is a judicial emergency situation. Senator Leahy has previously \nstated if a vacancy is deemed to be a judicial emergency, it should be \naddressed quickly. This is a judicial emergency, as determined by the \nnonpartisan Administrative Office of the Courts. They have declared the \nseat to which Judge Southwick has been nominated a judicial emergency.\n  Senator Leahy, for whom I have a great deal of respect and worked \nwith on a number of additional issues other than this, has also said it \nis important whether the two home State Senators support the nominee. \nYou have just heard from the two home State Senators who strongly \nsupport this nominee.\n  I think the criteria that have been previously set to fill a circuit \ncourt position have been met, in many cases even exceeded. Yet we have \na controversy over a person who was seen, one Senate ago, one Congress \nago, as a consensus candidate. This seems to be much more reflective of \nthe time rather than the person, and I don't think that is meritorious \nof this body, to decide something on, OK, it is in this session of \nCongress rather than the prior session of Congress.\n  Here is an honorable, good man. If you have qualms with one of the \nnominees, fine. But let's make it a real set of qualms and let's not \nmake it something that we invent this session, during this Congress, \nand try to take it out on somebody who is a good candidate.\n  Here is a person who served honorably in the military, even asked \nthat his age be waived so he could join the Army Reserves at age 42. In \n2002, at the age of 53, he volunteered to transfer to a line combat \nunit that was widely anticipated to deploy to Iraq.\n  This is an honorable man. I urge my colleagues to actually look past \nthe way he is being painted and look to the reality of the facts and to \nthe longevity of his service and what he seeks to do and to vote and to \nsupport this nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/23/senate-section/article/S13254-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to address not only a major \npublic policy issue for the State of Pennsylvania but also a \nfundamental issue of fairness and the proper role of Government, which \nI think will have an impact on the country as a whole.\n  Recently, the U.S. Department of Energy designated 52 counties--52 \nout of Pennsylvania's 67 counties--as part of a power transmission \ncorridor, more formally known as the National Interest Electric \nTransmission Corridor. This means the Government will be able to turn \nthree-quarters of the State of Pennsylvania into a superhighway of \ntransmission towers.\n  Their authority to designate this corridor was granted in the Energy \nbill passed in 2005 in the previous Congress. This designation would \nallow the Federal Government to override State authority and construct \nhigh-voltage power transmission lines wherever they please--virtually \nwherever the Federal Government pleases. They could place the lines on \nfarmland, through neighborhoods, through someone's backyard, and, for \nexample, through a beautiful vineyard such as the one I saw most \nrecently in Greene County in the furthermost southwestern corner of \nPennsylvania, so virtually anywhere in the Commonwealth and anywhere in \nthe country.\n  Earlier this year, the Department had a public comment period where I \nand other public officials and most importantly my constituents spoke \nout loudly in opposition to the draft corridor plan. That draft plan is \nvirtually identical to the final plan.\n  Let me give my colleagues a sense of what we are talking about here. \nThis is a map which depicts the draft Mid-Atlantic and Southwest area \nnational corridor. There are people in Washington who for years have \nbeen talking about creating opportunities for more power, and this is a \nnational priority, they say. Yet we can see just by the dotted areas \nthat there are a lot of States in the Northeast that will be impacted--\nobviously, New York and Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, and a \nfew others, and then out West in the furthermost reaches of the \nSouthwest of our country, principally in the State of California. So \nfor all of the talk about a national priority, there is very little \nthat impacts the middle of our country.\n  I sent letters, as Senator Specter did, to the Department of Energy, \nbut so far, I am not happy to report the Department of Energy has \nignored my\n\n[[Page S13255]]\n\nconstituents. I think this is an outrage, for a government bureaucracy \nto ignore the people they are supposed to serve. They pay their \nsalaries--those taxpayers pay their salaries. The least this Department \nshould do is respond not just in a timely way but to respond \ncompletely. But we haven't seen that yet.\n  Last week, I met with an Assistant Secretary of Energy to discuss my \nopposition to the transmission corridor as it is presently drafted. I \nhave sent letters to the Energy Secretary, Mr. Samuel Bodman, most \nrecently in early October. We are still waiting for a response to that, \na letter signed by both Senator Specter and me, waiting for a response. \nI know people get busy, but I think it is time now to respond to that \nletter. We are also waiting for Secretary Bodman to respond to my \nrequest for a meeting. We are getting a little resistance there as \nwell.\n\n  So while I am waiting for these responses from the Energy Secretary, \nI want to put him on notice and I want to put the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission--which we know by the acronym FERC--I want to put \nFERC on notice and I want to put the Senate on notice that I have grave \nconcerns, as a lot of people in Pennsylvania have grave concerns, about \nthis transmission corridor as presently designed or drafted. I am \noutraged by how my constituents have been treated so far in this \nprocess. I would argue they have been ignored in this process.\n  So I intend to use every means at my disposal--every means at my \ndisposal--to prevent the National Interest Electric Transmission \nCorridor from moving forward until Pennsylvania is at a minimum treated \nequitably. So I intend to place a hold on the renomination of Joseph \nKelliher, who is now serving as the Chairman of the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, known as FERC. I will place a hold on his \nrenomination, and I will be introducing tomorrow, in connection with \nthe amendments to the farm bill, an amendment to prevent the use of \neminent domain to take farmland for use as a part of this power \ntransmission corridor.\n  One more chart before I conclude. The second chart here depicts the \nnumber of counties affected in the northeastern corner of the United \nStates. I will speak just of Pennsylvania for today--52 out of those 67 \ncounties. Basically, what the Federal Government has told us, in \nessence, implicitly--this is what I derive from their failure to \nrespond to the State of Pennsylvania--is there is going to be a \nsuperhighway of power lines across Pennsylvania, and there is nothing \nanyone can do about it. The Federal Government is going to take over \nthis effort and put those lines across the State of Pennsylvania.\n  Well, I have news for them. Pennsylvania is full of a lot of people \nwho are concerned about this, whether they are in small towns or urban \nareas, and, as we are going to be speaking to tomorrow, rural areas in \nPennsylvania, farm communities. Most of those counties designated there \nare in rural communities. If the Federal Government and the Department \nof Energy or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or anyone else in \nthis town wants to fight about this, we are ready to fight, and we will \nfight morning, noon, and night until our State, the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, is treated equitably.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/23/senate-section/article/S13255-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     24TH ANNIVERSARY OF BOMBING OF MARINE CORPS BARRACKS IN BEIRUT\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, 24 years ago today, at 6:20 in the morning, \nin Beirut, a yellow Mercedes-Benz truck drove into the Beirut \nInternational Airport, where the 1st Battalion 8th Marines was keeping \nits headquarters. The truck crashed through a barbed wire fence, went \nthrough the parking lot, passed between two sentry posts, and then \ncrashed through a gate and into the lobby of the large building where \nthe marines were keeping their headquarters.\n  At that point, the explosives were set off in this truck, ending up \nwith the deaths of 241 American military servicemembers. This was the \nlargest loss of life for the U.S. Marine Corps in one single day since \nIwo Jima. It was the largest loss of life in one day for American \nservice people from the beginning of the Tet Offensive of 31 January \n1968, and it remains the largest single loss of life in one day since \nthat time.\n  I believe it is appropriate for us to take a few minutes and remember \ntoday the sacrifices that were made and the contributions the United \nStates was attempting to make in that particular circumstance.\n  I make these comments as someone who is proud to have served in the \nU.S. Marine Corps, who has a brother who served in the Marine Corps, \nwho has a son who is now serving in the Marine Corps, and as someone \nwho covered the marines in Beirut as a journalist and had recently left \nthe country when this incident occurred.\n  The marines who went to Beirut came in peace. They had been sent in \nafter several incidents occurred regarding multiparty incidents, which \nI will describe in a minute, at the request of the Lebanese Government. \nWe had a U.S. Marine Corps representation. We had military people from \nthe United Kingdom, Italy, and France. They were asked to help separate \nthe warring factions inside Beirut during a vicious civil war and also \nto help separate the end result of an Israeli incursion, in which the \nIsraelis were attempting to take out large elements of the Palestinian \nLiberation Organization.\n  So our marines began this ``visibility'' presence in September of \n1982. They had been there through different cycles of rotation for a \nlittle more than a year when this event occurred.\n  They operated under enormously difficult rules of engagement. The \nsituation in Beirut at that time was rather similar to what we see in \nIraq today in terms of having a weak central government and many \ndifferent factions around it.\n  On any given day, our marines in Beirut could be bumping up against \nShia militia, Sunni militia, Christian Phalange, Druze militia, the \nSyrians over the border on one side--as well as with French, U.K., and \nItalian military units all operating in this environment. The Israeli \nmilitary, which at this point had pulled back over the Chouf mountains, \nalso was present.\n  These were very fine marines. I spent a good bit of time with them on \ntheir different positions. They were overall commanded by COL Tim \nGeraghty, an extraordinarily capable officer who had spent more than 2 \ntours in Vietnam. Their battalion commander, LTC Howard Gerlach, had \ndone a tour and a half in Vietnam as infantry leader.\n  The rules of engagement were so strict in Beirut at the time that \nwhen our marines took fire, they could only return fire with the same \ntype of weapon they were receiving fire from. These very restrictive \nrules ended up contributing to the situation in which the truck bomb \nwent off. The sentries at the gate where the truck came in were not \neven allowed to have ammunition in their weapons at that time. They \nwere precluded from being able to take out this truck when it entered \nbecause once they saw what was happening, they had to attempt to load \ntheir weapons and then fire at it.\n  This was an incident which combines so many different factors that \nare still in play right now in the Middle East. We should be \nremembering it. We should be remembering when we look back on it that \nthe United States must play its hand very carefully in that part of the \nworld. As one marine said to me during a firefight at one outpost I was \ncovering as a journalist:\n\n       It is always difficult when you get involved in a five-\n     sided argument.\n\n  We ought to think about that when we are looking at what is going on \nin other parts of the Middle East today.\n  But the main purpose of me speaking today is to urge all of us never \nto forget the courage and the risk and, ultimately, the sacrifice that \nso many of our young people are required to make on behalf of our \ncountry and under the direction of the leadership of those who decide \nto send them into harm's way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/23/senate-section/article/S13255-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13255-S13256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                 Chief Warrant Officer John W. Engeman\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in the lush green hills of Arlington \nCemetery, where peace holds its gentle sway, there is a headstone \ninscribed with the name of John W. Engeman. On it are his rank of chief \nwarrant officer, and his honors, the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, and \nPurple Heart. But, like all of the iconic white markers at Arlington, \nit only tells part of a hero's story.\n\n[[Page S13256]]\n\n  Chief Warrant Officer Engeman enlisted in the Army when he was 18, \nand was stationed in Korea and Germany, and served in Kosovo and \nOperation Desert Storm. Two years ago, he moved with his family to West \nVirginia, where he was the active duty liaison between the National \nGuard and Reserves.\n  But he was more than a career military man; he was also a devoted \nfather and husband, brother and son.\n  The soldiers in his unit called him a father figure and a great story \nteller. They recalled that whenever they needed advice, they always \nwent to the Chief. They said they would follow him anywhere because he \nwas a great leader, a good decisionmaker, and a good friend. And, they \nsaid, he loved to talk about his wife Donna or his two children, Nicole \nand Patrick.\n  So I can only imagine how he must have felt when the Army made \nspecial arrangements for him to watch his wife graduate from college. \nIt had been a shared goal between the two of them, and on the day \nbefore Mother's Day, he sat half-a-world away and watched the dream \nturn into a reality. He ended that day by telling his wife how proud he \nwas of her, and that he would call the next day to wish her a happy \nMother's Day.\n  It was a call that would never come. Chief Warrant Officer Engeman's \nhumvee would be struck by a roadside bomb later that evening.\n  From the earliest days of the Republic we have held a special place \nin our hearts for those families who have lost a loved one in war. \nLater this week, as part of the White House Commission of Remembrance, \nthe family of Chief Warrant Officer Engeman will be honored, along with \nthe families of other soldiers, sailors, and marines who have been lost \nin combat.\n  It is altogether right and fitting that we do this. Chief Warrant \nOfficer Engeman answered the call to duty and served with honor and \ndistinction. He won the respect of his soldiers and the admiration of \nhis country.\n  But those truly timeless qualities--his laugh, his quirky smile he \nwould give you when you needed his advice, and his love for his \nfamily--will live in the hearts of his wife, children, sisters, and \nparents forever.\n  All of West Virginia joins with me today in keeping the Engemans \nclose in our hearts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/23/senate-section/article/S13256-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ESTABLISHING A FEDERAL STATUTORY FIRST AMENDMENT PRIVILEGE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, The Senate Judiciary Committee has \nconsidered and for the first time reported a bill to establish a \nFederal statutory privilege to safeguard the freedom of the press. The \nFree Flow of Information Act, S. 2035, is bipartisan legislation that \nwas reported on a strong bipartisan vote. The House has already passed \nlegislation on this same subject, H.R. 2102, with a strong, bipartisan \nand apparently veto-proof majority of 398 to 21. Thus, both S. 2035 and \nH.R. 2102 are available for Senate action on the Senate business \ncalendar. I strongly support the enactment of a Federal shield law for \njournalists, and I urge the Senate to promptly consider Federal shield \nlegislation.\n  All of us have an interest in enacting a balanced and meaningful \nfirst amendment privilege. Sadly, the press has become the first stop, \nrather than the last resort, for our Government and private litigants \nwhen it comes to seeking information. This is a dangerous trend that \ncan have a chilling effect on the press and the public's right to know.\n  Enacting Federal shield legislation would help to reverse this \ntroubling trend. In fact, proceeding promptly to consideration of this \nlegislation is something I strongly support. Should the Senate take up \nthe bipartisan shield bill that overwhelmingly passed in the House, \nFederal shield legislation could go immediately to the President's desk \nand be signed into law without delay this year.\n  The Senate bill has the support of a bipartisan coalition of \nSenators, including Senators Specter, Schumer, Lugar, Dodd, Graham, and \nmyself, who have all united to cosponsor this legislation. In addition, \nmore than 50 news media and journalism organizations support this \nlegislation, and the call for Senate action on this historic bill \nextends to editorial pages across the country, including the New York \nTimes, Arizona Republic, L.A. Times, Salt Lake Tribune, and San \nFrancisco Chronicle, among others.\n  The Senate and House bills protect law enforcement interests and \nsafeguard national security. Moreover, both of these bills follow the \nlead of 33 States and the District of Columbia which have shield laws, \nand many other States, including Vermont, which recognize a common law \nreporters' privilege. Tellingly, the Bush administration has not \nidentified a single circumstance where a reporters' privilege has \ncaused harm to national security or to law enforcement, despite the \nfact that many courts have recognized such a privilege for years.\n  When he testified before the Judiciary Committee in favor of Federal \nshield legislation in 2005, William Safire told the Committee that the \nessence of newsgathering is this:\n\n       [I]f you don't have sources you trust and who trust you, \n     then you don't have a solid story--and the public suffers for \n     it.\n\n  On behalf of the American public, I urge the Senate to protect the \npublic's right to know by promptly considering and passing a Federal \nshield law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/23/senate-section/article/S13256-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13256-S13257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        KINGDOM GEMS OF VERMONT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to stand before the Senate \ntoday to tell my friends about Vermont's Northeast Kingdom--a place \nthat is known as much for its natural beauty as the rural and \nindustrious Vermonters who have settled there.\n  This region, defined by the three northeastern-most counties of \nVermont that sit between the headwaters of the Connecticut River and \nthe U.S.-Canadian border, became one of America's first National \nGeographic geotourism destinations. The designation highlights the \ncharacter and sense of place that has come to define the dozens of \nmountain valley communities that sit in Orleans, Essex, and Caledonia \nCounties.\n  My wife Marcelle was born in the Northeast Kingdom, just south of the \nCanadian border in the city of Newport. Since then, like many \nVermonters, we have often found ourselves heading to this part of \nVermont to visit friends, go for a hike, or find a special place to \nhave a meal. The people of the Northeast Kingdom have made this region \nof Vermont advance while carefully holding on to the key elements of \ntheir identity. Whether they are crafting furniture from the forests of \nthe north woods or diversifying their family farm, these individuals \nhave helped the communities of northeastern Vermont grow.\n  This autumn, Michelle Edelbaum and Daria Bishop of the Burlington \nFree Press published an article about a trip the two of them shared \nthrough the area, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the text of the article offering a glimpse into these ``Kingdom \nGems.''\n  There being no objection, the materials was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From The Burlington Free Press, Sept. 30, 2007]\n\n                              Kingdom Gems\n\n                         (By Michelle Edelbaum)\n\n       When trees scream with crimson, gold and orange, head to \n     the Northeast Kingdom for world-class leaf peeping.\n       With foliage in mind, photographer Daria Bishop and I spent \n     a day exploring the towns, shops and people that make the \n     area special. We strayed from our loose plan to follow \n     locals' hand-drawn maps down scenic dirt back roads to not-\n     to-miss destinations.\n       On our 13-hour tour we didn't reach half the locations on \n     our list, which included classic attractions Cabot Creamery, \n     Great Vermont Corn Maze, Stephen Huneck's Dog Mountain and \n     Fairbanks Museum. But we did visit a handful of gems worth a \n     stop.\n\n\n                               GREENSBORO\n\n       Twenty-eight years ago an enthusiastic David Smith and his \n     wife, Willie, took over Highland Lodge in Greensboro from his \n     parents and fostered a community-centric gathering place that \n     hosts out-of-town guests and community gatherings. ``The \n     Walking Ladies,'' a group of 55 women who range in age from \n     40 to 86, meet thrice weekly in the dining room for coffee \n     and muffins after they exercise.\n       On their recommendation we ate moist, sugar-crusted \n     blueberry muffins, from-scratch blueberry pancakes and a \n     fluffy cheese and veggie omelet with McKenzie sausage links. \n     After breakfast, we set out on the lodge's 30 miles of trails \n     from a grove of soaring pine trees decorated with colorful \n     placards of children's artwork, courtesy of the lodge's \n     summer campers.\n\n[[Page S13257]]\n\n       In Greensboro village two stores dominate the retail scene. \n     The Miller's Thumb, housed in a former grist mill, is filled \n     with local artwork, fancy kitchen knickknacks, Italian \n     pottery and antiques. Watch water rushing under the red \n     building through a plexiglass-covered hole in the floor.\n       At Willey's Country Store, customer Doug Aronson of \n     Woodbury declares ``if you can't find it here, you can't find \n     it anyplace.'' Wine, appliances, groceries, hardware and \n     clothes are sold at the town institution, housed in a \n     rambling white building that dates to the 1800s and has been \n     owned by the Hurst family for five generations.\n\n\n                               CRAFTSBURY\n\n       Look up as you approach Pete's Greens in Craftsbury. The \n     roof of the farm's serve-yourself stand is laden with \n     trailing plants, flowers and herbs. Peek inside at artful \n     displays of colorful organic vegetables.\n       Consider yourself lucky if you hit Stardust Bookstore and \n     Cafe on the idyllic Craftsbury Common during its limited \n     school-centric hours. The store, run primarily by students \n     from Craftsbury Academy, sells new and used books, coffee and \n     espresso drinks inside the quaint 1940s former public \n     library. Part of the proceeds are given to nonprofit \n     organizations and granted as scholarships.\n       Just outside of town down a long dirt road lies Craftsbury \n     Outdoor Center, on Great Hosmer Pond with 10 kilometers of \n     trails open for biking and hiking. Ski director John Brodhead \n     suggests spending an afternoon canoeing, mountain biking, \n     walking with a naturalist, kayaking or relaxing in an \n     Adirondack chair by the lake.\n\n\n                                 GLOVER\n\n       Untold treasures lie within Red Sky Trading Co. in Glover. \n     Owner Cheri Safford's whimsy is on display in the unique and \n     colorful assortment of vintage house wares, Melmac resin \n     dishware, trays, china tea cups, garden decor, picture frames \n     and more, that fill the maroon barn.\n       Buttery cookies, dense bars and rich chocolate cakes from \n     Safford's kitchen share counter and refrigerator space with \n     Vermont cheeses, natural sodas and local produce. Don't miss \n     Safford's award-winning canned jellies, jams, bread and \n     butter pickles, chutneys and pickled beets--just like Grandma \n     made.\n       Between a bank of beer coolers and a rack of chips at \n     Currier's Quality Market Inc. stand three stuffed deer and a \n     black bear; turn the corner into the postal area and you'll \n     come face-to-face with a 948-pound moose. More than 100 \n     taxidermy animals are on display in the one-stop shop, \n     including a porcupine, wild boar, ram and British timberwolf.\n       Jim Currier, who's owned the store for 40 years with his \n     family, started the ever-growing collection 25 years ago with \n     a deer head from his father. Hunters with a mount at the \n     store earn ``bragging rights,'' said Currier's daughter Julie \n     McKay. Coming soon: a red fox, possum, and snow goose.\n       By 4 p.m. we hadn't eaten lunch and regretfully skipped \n     Bread and Puppet Museum and its ``Cheap Art.'' We missed \n     Mount Pisgah in Barton, with stunning views of Lake \n     Willoughby, biking in Burke at Kingdom Trails, and a mandarin \n     orange chicken salad at River Garden Cafe. We also passed on \n     flat bread and microbrews at Trout River Brewing Co. in \n     Lyndonville and coffee and chitchat at Miss Lyndonville \n     Diner.\n\n\n                             ST. JOHNSBURY\n\n       Instead we split for St. Johnsbury, where local-food-\n     centric Elements Food and Spirits, like many destinations in \n     the Northeast Kingdom that have irregular hours, isn't open \n     on Monday.\n       At Kham's Thai, chef and manager Souki Luangrath, whose \n     Essex Junction-based parents own the restaurant, says quality \n     ingredients are a priority--he even deveins shrimp. Our \n     refreshing late lunch included fresh spring rolls filled with \n     crisp veggies, savory coconut Tom Kha soup and saucy panang \n     curry with chunks of vegetables.\n       Railroad Street in downtown St. Johnsbury is home to \n     several dozen independently owned shops and restaurants. \n     Moose River Lake and Lodge Store sells jewelry with a \n     Southwestern flair, Adirondack and Amish-style furniture, \n     fine wine kept in a walk-in vault, art by illustrator Philip \n     R. Goodwin, quality sportswear and home decor.\n       Scottie Raymond, formerly an employee at Outdoor Gear \n     Exchange in Burlington, recently opened Kingdom Outdoors, \n     which sells technical outdoor wear and gear. Raymond inked \n     the graffiti-style mural in the skate shop and lounge \n     downstairs.\n       During the day, hit Dylan's Caf for creative breakfast and \n     lunch combinations, the newly opened Village Baker for \n     artisan bread and pastries, or Boxcar and Caboose for coffee \n     drinks and books.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National \nPhysical Therapy Month. What we currently celebrate as National \nPhysical Therapy Month began in 1981 as a week long celebration in the \nmonth of June. In 1992, that week was extended to a whole month and was \nmoved to October.\n  National Physical Therapy Month focuses attention on the value of \nphysical therapy to one's health and the contributions of physical \ntherapists to the health of their communities. This year National \nPhysical Therapy Month is focusing on obesity because physical activity \nis a crucial component of weight loss and better health.\n  My understanding of physical therapy has greatly increased over the \npast several months. I owe a debt of gratitude to a great many doctors, \nnurses, and therapists who brought me through the darkest moments of my \nlife and who are walking with me on the road to recovery.\n  I am blessed to work with professional and talented physical \ntherapists as I continue my recovery. Their confidence in my ability to \nimprove is infectious, and my physical therapists motivate me to work \nharder than I thought possible. I am confident that with my hard work \nand the dedication of my physical therapists, my potential to improve \nis limitless.\n  Throughout my career in the U.S. House and Senate, I have strongly \nsupported expanding access to all kinds of health care professionals. \nPhysical therapists provide critical services to their patients. In a \nrural State like ours, where they may be the only provider of these \nservices in their community, physical therapists greatly improve \npatient access to care and quality of life.\n  This year the Senate is considering the Medicare Access to \nRehabilitation Services Act which would repeal the annual Medicare \noutpatient cap on certain physical and occupational therapy services \nand the Medicare Patient Access to Physical Therapists Act which would \nauthorize qualified physical therapists to provide services for \nMedicare beneficiaries without requiring a physician referral. It would \nalso provide for treatment of outpatient speech-language pathology \nservices separately from outpatient physical therapy services. I am \npleased to support both of these measures, and I commend them to my \ncolleagues for their consideration.\n  I encourage everyone to consider with their health care professionals \nhow physical therapy might benefit them, whether recovering from an \naccident or illness or seeking preventive care. National Physical \nTherapy Month is a great time to learn more about the benefits of \nphysical therapy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/23/senate-section/article/S13257-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/23/senate-section/article/S13257-4", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/23/senate-section/article/S13257-5", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13257-S13258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the\n\n[[Page S13258]]\n\nfollowing bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 53.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     implement food policies that promote healthy food, farms, and \n     communities by encouraging local production of fruits and \n     vegetables by specialty crop farmers; to the Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 156\n\n       Whereas, the federal Farm Bill traditionally provides crop \n     subsidies to corn, wheat, soybean, and cotton farmers, and \n     less than 40 percent of all United States farmers and \n     ranchers actually receive any kind of subsidy from the \n     federal government. However, there are many different kinds \n     of farmers, both in Michigan and nationwide, growing \n     nutritious and affordable fruits and vegetables that are \n     vital to the health and well-being of Americans. Government \n     support must emphasize nutritious, affordable, and locally \n     available foods; and\n       Whereas, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 \n     (the 2002 Farm Bill) encourages institutions participating in \n     the school lunch program to purchase locally produced foods \n     for school meals. While the real price of fruits and \n     vegetables has increased by 40 percent since 1985, the cost \n     of junk foods and sodas has declined by as much as 20 \n     percent. We need to encourage the choice of fresh fruits and \n     vegetables by purchasing locally grown produce and other \n     foods, thereby supporting local farmers and benefiting \n     students in need of high quality, nutritious food products. \n     However, the USDA continues to discourage efforts by schools \n     and other institutions to develop these important programs. \n     The USDA claims that 7 CFR 3016.60(c) clearly prohibits the \n     use of state or local geographic preferences and that all \n     purchases are to be made competitively; and\n       Whereas, the Community Food Projects, a federally funded \n     program designed to fight food insecurity through development \n     of local food projects, promotes self-sufficiency of low-\n     income communities. Grants from this program support urban \n     nonprofits and urban residents in growing fresh vegetables in \n     their neighborhoods. Funding is also used to provide \n     entrepreneurship training to urban farmers, again encouraging \n     local specialty crop farmers in Michigan. However, \n     maintaining current funding for the Community Food Projects \n     is important to promoting healthy, locally grown foods in \n     low-income communities; and\n       Whereas, the emphasis on traditional crops in the \n     allocation of farm subsidies has resulted in a loss of fruit \n     and vegetable farmers as well as a decrease in the acreage of \n     specialty crop farmland used for farming nationwide. At the \n     current rate, Michigan will lose 15 percent of its \n     agricultural land by 2040, including 25 percent of the \n     acreage used to grow fruit and 36 percent of the acreage used \n     to grow dry beans. The Michigan House of Representatives \n     supports the federal government encouraging and providing \n     programs and assistance to farm operations that grow fruits \n     and vegetables including but not limited to asparagus, \n     cherries, apples, carrots, beets, lettuce, celery, squash, \n     potatoes, peppers, pumpkins etc: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we encourage \n     Congress and the United States Department of Agriculture to \n     implement food policies that promote healthy food, farms, and \n     communities by encouraging local production of fruits and \n     vegetables by specialty crop farmers; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the Secretary of the \n     United States Department of Agriculture, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-241. A resolution adopted by the California State Lands \n     Commission expressing its support for legislation which would \n     reduce pollution from marine vessels that use the nation's \n     ports; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, California's 1,100 mile coastline, with its \n     beautiful beaches, wild cliffs, abundant fish stocks and \n     fragile environment is a national treasure and a valuable \n     state resource, which is at the heart of a tourist industry \n     that generates nearly five billion dollars in state and local \n     taxes each year; and is central to the state's $46 billion \n     ocean economy; and\n       Whereas, the California State Lands Commission has \n     jurisdiction over the state-owned tide and submerged lands \n     below the mean high tide line out to three miles from the \n     coast as well as the lands underlying California's bays, \n     lakes, and rivers; and\n       Whereas, the Commission is charged with managing these \n     lands pursuant to the Public Trust Doctrine, common law that \n     requires these lands to be used for commerce, fishing, \n     navigation, recreation, and environmental protection; and\n       Whereas, the impacts of air pollution affect the public \n     trust values of the lands under the Commission's jurisdiction \n     and the utility of these lands to the public, future \n     generations, and the environment; and\n       Whereas, most commercial goods imported to the United \n     States come through our nation's ports by means of marine \n     vessels; and\n       Whereas, California is home to the busiest ports in the \n     nation, with large volumes of international goods entering \n     through the Ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach, and Oakland, \n     which rank as the first, second, and fourth busiest ports in \n     the country, respectively; and\n       Whereas, in 2004, 1,900 ships visited California's ports, \n     87% of which were foreign vessels, and it is estimated that \n     freight volume will more than double in the Los Angeles \n     region over the next 20 years; and\n       Whereas, marine vessels at California's ports emit large \n     amounts of diesel particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides \n     (NOx), and sulfur oxides (SOx), and\n       Whereas, most marine vessels use high emitting diesel \n     bunker fuel, a low quality petroleum, high in sulfur, that is \n     capable of producing approximately 50 times more haze-forming \n     pollutants than the dirtiest trucks on our nation's highways; \n     and\n       Whereas, bunker fuel used by marine vessels contains, on \n     average, 27,000 parts per million (ppm) of sulfur, compared \n     to the 15 ppm of sulfur allowed in diesel fuel used by heavy-\n     duty trucks in the U.S.; and\n       Whereas, the pollutants emitted from burning bunker fuel \n     cause environmental problems such as smog, soot, acid rain \n     and global climate change, as well as damaging health effects \n     such as asthma and cancer--as reported by the California Air \n     Resource Board's Emission Reduction Plan for Ports and Goods \n     Movement, air pollution from California's ports is the cause \n     of 750 premature deaths each year; and\n       Whereas, in 2006, Maersk, Inc., which operates the largest \n     container terminal in the Los Angeles harbor, voluntarily \n     switched all 37 of its cargo ships to low-sulfur fuel, \n     proving that it is feasible for marine vessels to use \n     environmentally safer fuels, and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n     announced a delay until December 2009 to adopt new emission \n     and fuel regulations for big ocean ship propulsion engines \n     and there is no assurance that the rules will be adopted by \n     then or that they will be strict enough to significantly \n     reduce air pollution; and\n       Whereas, the United Nations International Maritime \n     Organization has before it a proposal, supported by the EPA, \n     World Shipping Council, Pacific Maritime Shipping \n     Association, and U.S. Coast Guard, to develop, among other \n     things, stringent new standards on sulfur content in fuel \n     used by marine vessels; however, it is uncertain if enough \n     nations will support this proposal; and\n       Whereas, the Marine Vessel Emissions Reduction Act bill, \n     introduced by Senators Boxer and Feinstein through S. 1499, \n     and Congresswoman Solis through H.R. 2548, seeks to regulate \n     the emissions of domestic and foreign-flagged marine vessels \n     entering or leaving U.S. ports or offshore terminals; and\n       Whereas, specifically, the Marine Vessel Emissions \n     Reduction Act, if passed, will mandate the EPA to set limits \n     on the sulfur content of fuel used by these vessels, if they \n     are within a certain distance from the coast (for the west \n     coast, it is 200 miles), to no more than 1,000 ppm beginning \n     December 31,2010, unless the EPA determines that such a limit \n     is not technically feasible, in which case there will be an \n     interim limit of 2,000 ppm; and\n       Whereas, the Marine Vessel Emissions Reduction Act, if \n     passed, will also mandate the EPA to establish standards for \n     new and in-use engines in marine vessels that will require \n     the maximum degree of emission reduction for PM, NOx, \n     hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide achievable by no later than \n     January 1, 2012; therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the California State Lands Commission, that it \n     supports the Marine Vessel Emissions Reduction Act (S. 1499 \n     and H.R. 2548), which would reduce the emissions of air \n     pollutants from marine vessels, including foreign-flagged \n     vessels, entering or leaving U.S. ports or offshore \n     terminals;

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     address the recent approval of increased pollution by British \n     Petroleum into the Great Lakes; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 172\n\n       Whereas, Lake Michigan is a national treasure and a vital \n     natural resource shared by four states in trust for the \n     entire nation. Lake Michigan is a drinking water source for \n     millions of people and a recreational haven for swimming, \n     fishing, and boating in all the states. Tourism and \n     recreation based around Lake Michigan are worth billions of \n     dollars each year to these states' economies; and\n       Whereas, Michigan and the other states bordering Lake \n     Michigan rely on the federal Clean Water Act to limit \n     polluted discharges originating from other states. Pollution \n     originating from any state can negatively affect the public \n     health and economy of the other states that use Lake Michigan \n     water. Improving and preserving Lake Michigan's water quality \n     are imperative to support the many uses of its water; and\n       Whereas, despite provisions in the federal Clean Water Act \n     that prohibit degradation of water quality, the Indiana \n     Department of Environmental Management approved, and the \n     United States Environmental Protection Agency concurred with, \n     a permit that allows the British Petroleum (BP) refinery in \n     Whiting, Indiana, to increase significantly the dumping of \n     industrial pollutants into Lake Michigan. These discharges \n     threaten other uses of Lake Michigan water and are \n     inconsistent with regional efforts to clean up the Great \n     Lakes; and\n       Whereas, this decision sets a poor precedent for the \n     future. States could approve increased pollution discharges \n     to interstate waters for industries that economically benefit \n     that state at the expense of other states that rely on that \n     water: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     Congress of the United States and the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency to address the recent \n     approval of increased pollution by British Petroleum into the \n     Great Lakes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the Administrator of \n     the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-243. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     enact H.R. 2927, which responsibly balances achievable fuel \n     economy increases with important economic and social \n     concerns; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 165\n\n       Whereas, H.R. 2927 sets tough fuel economy standards \n     without off ramps or loopholes, by requiring separate car and \n     truck standards to meet a total fleet fuel economy between 32 \n     and 35 mpg by 2022--an increase of as much as 40 percent over \n     current fuel economy standards--and requires vehicle fuel \n     economy to be increased to the maximum feasible level in the \n     years leading up to 2022; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 2927, while challenging, will provide \n     automakers more reasonable lead time to implement technology \n     changes in both the near and long term. Model year 2008 \n     vehicles are already available today, and product and \n     manufacturing planning is done through Model Year 2012. H.R. \n     2927 recognizes the critical need for engineering lead times \n     necessary for manufacturers to make significant changes to \n     their fleets; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 2927 respects consumer choice by protecting \n     the important functional differences between passenger cars \n     and light trucks/SUVs. Last year, 2006, was the sixth year in \n     a row that Americans bought more trucks, minivans, and SUVs \n     than passenger cars, because they value attributes such as \n     passenger and cargo load capacity, four-wheel drive, and \n     towing capability that most cars are not designed to provide; \n     and\n       Whereas, while some would like fuel economy increases to be \n     much more aggressive and be implemented with much less lead \n     time, Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards must be \n     set at levels and in time frames that do not impose economic \n     harm on the manufacturers, suppliers, dealers, and others in \n     the auto industry; and\n       Whereas, proponents of unrealistic and unattainable CAFE \n     standards cite Europe's 35 mpg fuel economy, without ever \n     mentioning Europe's $6 per gallon gasoline prices, the high \n     sales of diesel vehicles, the high proportion of Europeans \n     driving manual transmission vehicles (80 percent in Europe \n     vs. 8 percent in the U.S.), the significant differences in \n     the size mix of vehicles, or that trucks and SUVs are \n     virtually nonexistent among Europe households; and\n       Whereas, proponents of unreasonable CAFE standards claim \n     they will save consumers billions, but they neglect to talk \n     about the upfront costs of such changes to the manufacturers \n     of meeting unduly strict CAFE standards--more than $100 \n     billion, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration--which will lead to vehicle price increases of \n     several thousand dollars; and\n       Whereas, proponents of unrealistic CAFE standards ignore \n     the potential safety impacts of downsized vehicles on \n     America's highways and overlook the historical role and \n     critical importance of manufacturing plants to our national \n     and economic security. They seem unconcerned about threats to \n     the 7.5 million jobs that are directly and indirectly \n     dependent on a vibrant auto industry in the United States. \n     They also seem unconcerned about maintaining CAFE rules that \n     require the continuance of small car production in the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 2927 is a reasonable bill that balances a \n     number of important public policy concerns. The bill \n     represents a tough but fair compromise that deserves serious \n     consideration and support: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the United States Congress to enact H.R. 2927, \n     which responsibly balances achievable fuel economy increases \n     with important economic and social concerns, including \n     consumer demand; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-244.

In \n     Michigan, for example, world-renowned Mackinac Island hires \n     up to 4,500 seasonal workers each year. Its 500 year-around \n     residents cannot begin to supply the workforce necessary for \n     peak-season employment levels; and\n       Whereas, foreign workers supplement the seasonal staff \n     needs in a host of our tourism and recreation destinations. \n     Many of these employees are in our country under the H2B visa \n     program; and\n       Whereas, all workers under the H2B visa program are here \n     legally, are tracked by the federal government to ensure they \n     are doing the work their visa is intended for, and are paid \n     under federally prescribed wage scales; and\n       Whereas, Congress took action to help alleviate problems \n     with the H2B visa program by capping the number of visas \n     available at 66,000, but also exempting workers who already \n     held an H2B visa. This action ensures that there is enough of \n     a workforce available for those industries that depend on \n     seasonal workers; and\n       Whereas, there is a sunset in the law on the federal level \n     that would remove the returning worker exemption. As of \n     September 30, 2007, every returning worker will again be \n     considered a new worker and be forced to apply under the \n     66,000 visa limit. This cap had been reached for each of the \n     previous few years before Congress took action, just as the \n     national economy has surged and more and more people are \n     traveling. The cap also distorted hiring patterns across the \n     nation, as employers are forced to put on workers far beyond \n     service needs to help assure that they will have the \n     employees they need when their season begins; and\n       Whereas, legislation has been introduced in Congress to \n     revise the H2B visa program. The measure would extend the H2B \n     returning worker exemption by removing the sunset language \n     from current law. Clearly, this is an issue that needs prompt \n     action: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to continue exempting returning workers \n     allowed into this country under the H2B visa program by \n     passing H.R. 1843; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-245.

This industry is dependent upon seasonal \n     workers in order to do business; and\n       Whereas, recently, the Congress of the United States took \n     action to help alleviate problems with the H2B visa program \n     by capping the number of visas available at 66,000 but also \n     exempting workers who already have H2B visas.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     reestablish medical care for certain veterans whose income \n     and disability status disqualified them for medical care as \n     of January 17, 2003; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 175\n\n       Whereas, we have been at war for nearly six years since the \n     September 11th terrorist attacks on our soil. During this \n     time, American military personnel have served around the \n     world in combat. The wounds and illnesses that they may \n     endure as the result of this service in our defense could \n     affect them for a lifetime. It is our responsibility as a \n     nation to honor their service and sacrifice by doing all we \n     can to restore their health and opportunities in civilian \n     life; and\n       Whereas, beginning January 17, 2003, veterans with income \n     above certain levels and who have no service-connected \n     disability have been ineligible for Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) medical care. These Priority 8 category veterans \n     may lack other sources of health care, and so ineligibility \n     for VA health care could be a threat to their long-term \n     health. Even veterans without evident war-related injuries or \n     illnesses could have hidden health issues that can evolve \n     into serious problems. Infections or viruses from serving in \n     foreign lands might not reveal themselves until later in \n     life. In addition, veterans with combat wounds such as \n     traumatic brain injury (TSI) from blast effects or post-\n     traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may not display symptoms for \n     years. Without early access to the VA healthcare system, \n     veterans may not have the benefits of medical monitoring and \n     early intervention in developing health issues; and\n       Whereas, Congress has before it two bills that would \n     restore VA eligibility to these Priority 8 veterans under \n     current standards with income levels too high and no service-\n     connected disability. In the House of Representatives, HR 463 \n     would restore this eligibility, while in the Senate, S 1147 \n     has been introduced. We owe it to our veterans to act on this \n     legislation to ensure that any long-term problems that may \n     not be currently evident can be identified and treated in a \n     timely manner. Providing quality health care is part of our \n     duty as a nation to our veterans, and there is no excuse for \n     failing to right this mistake: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the United States Congress to reestablish medical \n     care for certain veterans whose income and disability status \n     disqualified them for Department of Veterans Affairs medical \n     care as of January 17, 2003; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/23/senate-section/article/S13261-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LEAHY, from the Committee on the Judiciary, with an \n     amendment in the nature of a substitute and an amendment to \n     the title:\n       S. 1845.

    By Mr. ROBERTS:\n  S. 2218. A bill to provide for the award of a military service medal \nto members of the Armed Forces who were exposed to ionizing radiation \nas a result of participation in a test of atomic weapons; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to honor those \nveterans who have served their Nation as quiet heroes. These quiet \nheroes, otherwise known as Atomic Veterans, were exposed unknowingly to \nionizing radiation resulting from atomic testing conducted between \n1945-1963.\n  Sacrifice in the service of your country can take many different \nforms. We see it everyday in our military efforts in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We see it in the hospital beds of Walter Reed and VA \nhospitals nationwide. It is our duty as Americans, to honor the \nsacrifice made by our Nation's servicemembers.\n  In the case of the Atomic Veterans, sacrifice was not necessarily \nsomething that happened on the battlefield, nor on the navel fleet. The \nprice that many Atomic Veterans paid came due after their years of \nmilitary service, when enduring mysterious cancers and other medical \nconditions related to their exposure to ionizing radiation. Their fight \ncontinues and the time is long overdue to recognize what, for some, has \nbecome the ultimate sacrifice.\n  In recognition of the silent sacrifices made by these American \nheroes, I am introducing the Atomic Veterans Medal Act. It is the \nSenate companion to H.R. 3471, offered by my colleague, Congressman \nTodd Tiahrt, in the House. We owe a debt of gratitude to brave \nAmericans who have worn the uniform. It is my hope that this measure \nhelps to show the respect and honor these Atomic Veterans deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Ms. Stabenow, Mrs. Boxer, \n        and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 2219: A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \ndeliver a meaningful benefit and lower prescription drug prices under \nthe Medicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, nearly 4 years have passed since Congress \nenacted the Medicare Modernization Act. Adding a prescription drug \nbenefit to Medicare was long overdue, and many senior citizens and \npeople with disabilities are relieved to finally have drug coverage.\n  But the drug benefit was not structured like the rest of Medicare. \nFor all other Medicare benefits, seniors can choose whether to receive \nbenefits directly through Medicare or through a private insurance plan. \nThe overwhelming majority choose the Medicare-run option for their \nhospital and physician coverage.\n  No such choice is available for prescription drugs. Medicare \nbeneficiaries must enroll in a private insurance plan to obtain drug \ncoverage.\n  A report released today by the Medicare Rights Center, with the \nsupport of Consumers Union, identifies the problems this decision to \nrely exclusively on private drug plans has created.\n  Seniors are having trouble identifying which of the dozens of private \ndrug plans works best for them. Anyone who has visited a senior center \nor spoken with an elderly relative knows that the complexity of the \ndrug benefit has created much confusion.\n  Each drug plan has its own premium, cost-sharing requirements, list \nof covered drugs, and pharmacy network. After you have identified the \nright drug plan, you have to go through the whole process again at the \nend of the year because your plan may have changed the drugs it covers \nor added new restrictions on how to access covered drugs.\n  Medicare beneficiaries often cannot obtain the drugs they need \nbecause they are trapped in an appeals process that the Medicare Rights \nCenter calls ``hopelessly dysfunctional.'' Drug plans often do not tell \nbeneficiaries that they can appeal a drug plan's decision to deny \ncoverage of a drug, even though they are required to do so. \nBeneficiaries who do appeal soon find that it is a long and difficult \nprocess.\n  The complexity of the Medicare drug benefit also has made \nbeneficiaries more vulnerable to aggressive and deceptive marketing \npractices. Some insurers try to steer seniors into more profitable \nMedicare Advantage plans. Some seniors have been signed up for Medicare \nAdvantage plans without their knowledge, and, unfortunately, there have \nalso been unscrupulous insurance agents who have misrepresented what \nbenefits would be covered.\n  Adding to the frustration with the program so far is accumulating \nevidence that private drug plans have not been effective negotiators, \nwhich means seniors end up paying more than they should.\n  Drug prices are higher in private Medicare drug plans than drug \nprices available through the Veterans Administration, Medicaid, and \nother countries like Canada.\n  A report by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee \nestimated that taxpayers and Medicare beneficiaries would have saved \nalmost $15 billion in 2007 if administrative expenses in the drug \nprogram were as low as the traditional government-run Medicare program \nand if drug prices were the same as Medicaid levels.\n  It should come as no surprise then that the average beneficiary who \nstays in their current Medicare drug plan will see their monthly \npremiums increase 21 percent in 2008.\n  Today, I am introducing the Medicare Prescription Drug Savings and \nChoice Act. The bill would create a Medicare-operated drug plan that \nwould compete with private drug plans and would require the Health and \nHuman Services Secretary to negotiate with drug companies to lower drug \nprices.\n  This is the kind of drug plan that Medicare beneficiaries are looking \nfor. According to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, \\2/3\\ of \nseniors want the option of getting drug coverage directly from \nMedicare, and over 80 percent favor allowing the government to \nnegotiate with drug companies for lower prices.\n  The Health and Human Services Secretary would have the tools to \nnegotiate with drug companies, including the use of drug formulary. The \nbest medical evidence would determine which drugs are covered in the \nformulary, and the formulary would be used to promote safety, \nappropriate use of drugs, and value.\n  The bill would establish an appeals process that is efficient, \nimposes minimal administrative burdens, and ensures timely procurement \nof nonformulary drugs or nonpreferred drugs when medically necessary.\n  The Secretary would also develop a system for paying pharmacies that\n\n[[Page S13264]]\n\nwould include the prompt payment of claims.\n  Seniors want the ability to choose a Medicare-administered drug plan. \nLet us give them this option, just as they have this choice with every \nother benefit covered by Medicare. Many seniors will find direct \nMedicare coverage to be a simpler, more dependable, and less costly \noption than private drug plans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2219\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Prescription Drug \n     Savings and Choice Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF MEDICARE OPERATED PRESCRIPTION DRUG \n                   PLAN OPTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subpart 2 of part D of the Social Security \n     Act is amended by inserting after section 1860D-11 (42 U.S.C. \n     1395w-111) the following new section:\n\n\n           ``MEDICARE OPERATED PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN OPTION\n\n       ``Sec. 1860D-11A.

To the extent practicable and \n     consistent with the previous sentence, the Secretary shall \n     implement strategies similar to those used by other Federal \n     purchasers of prescription drugs, and other strategies, \n     including the use of a formulary and formulary incentives in \n     subsection (e), to reduce the purchase cost of covered part D \n     drugs.\n       ``(c) Medicare Operated Prescription Drug Plan Defined.--\n     For purposes of this part, the term `medicare operated \n     prescription drug plan' means a prescription drug plan that \n     offers qualified prescription drug coverage and access to \n     negotiated prices described in section 1860D-2(a)(1)(A). Such \n     a plan may offer supplemental prescription drug coverage in \n     the same manner as other qualified prescription drug coverage \n     offered by other prescription drug plans.\n       ``(d) Monthly Beneficiary Premium.--\n       ``(1) Qualified prescription drug coverage.--The monthly \n     beneficiary premium for qualified prescription drug coverage \n     and access to negotiated prices described in section 1860D-\n     2(a)(1)(A) to be charged under a medicare operated \n     prescription drug plan shall be uniform nationally. Such \n     premium for months in 2009 and each succeeding year shall be \n     based on the average monthly per capita actuarial cost of \n     offering the medicare operated prescription drug plan for the \n     year involved, including administrative expenses.\n       ``(2) Supplemental prescription drug coverage.--Insofar as \n     a medicare operated prescription drug plan offers \n     supplemental prescription drug coverage, the Secretary may \n     adjust the amount of the premium charged under paragraph (1).\n       ``(e) Use of a Formulary and Formulary Incentives.--\n       ``(1) In general.--With respect to the operation of a \n     medicare operated prescription drug plan, the Secretary shall \n     establish and apply a formulary (and may include formulary \n     incentives described in paragraph (2)(C)(ii)) in accordance \n     with this subsection in order to--\n       ``(A) increase patient safety;\n       ``(B) increase appropriate use and reduce inappropriate use \n     of drugs; and\n       ``(C) reward value.\n       ``(2) Development of initial formulary.--\n       ``(A) In general.--In selecting covered part D drugs for \n     inclusion in a formulary. the Secretary shall consider \n     clinical benefit and price.\n       ``(B) Role of ahrq.--The Director of the Agency for \n     Healthcare Research and Quality shall be responsible for \n     assessing the clinical benefit of covered part D drugs and \n     making recommendations to the Secretary regarding which drugs \n     should be included in the formulary.

A bill to amend the Outdoor Recreation Act of 1963 to \nauthorize certain appropriations; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill amend the Outdoor Recreation Act of 1963, to further enhance \neducation, instruction and recreation opportunities available in our \nNation's tropical botanical gardens. I wish to also thank my \ncolleagues, Senators Daniel Inouye, Mel Martinez and Bill Nelson, for \njoining me in sponsoring this measure.\n  Studies have indicated that throughout the world, our plants and \ntheir habitats are quickly disappearing. With 90 percent of these \nspecies existing in tropical areas, it is imperative that we continue \nto strive for a greater understanding of how we can preserve these \nnatural resources.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today, the Outdoor Recreation \nAct of 1963 Amendments Act, will authorize $1\n\n[[Page S13266]]\n\nmillion for the National Botanical Gardens in fiscal year 2009, and up \nto $500,000 each fiscal year thereafter. These funds are to be matched \nby State and local governments as well as private individuals.\n  Since Congress chartered the National Tropical Botanical Gardens in \n1964, the gardens have not only thrived and flourished, but have \nprovided valuable research. This research is vital to enriching our \nlives through not only perpetuating the survival of ecosystems, but \npreserving the cultural knowledge of these tropical regions.\n  As we, and the rest of the world, continue to develop rural areas, we \nslowly deplete our natural resources and place our Nation's tropical \nplant bio-diversity at risk. It is our responsibility to ensure that \nmeasures are in place that will preserve our finite natural resources, \nor we may find ourselves without the basics for survival.\n  These gardens serve as safe havens for endangered tropical plants \nwhere scientists strive to understand the evolution, structure \nrelationships and qualities of these plants for the future benefit of \nall Americans. The gardens also serve as a valuable educational tool, \nwhere students of all ages go to learn about environmental stewardship \nand horticultural practices, and discover that science can be fun. The \ncollections at these gardens provide valuable information that \nconservationists and others utilize to study and determine how to \nprotect these resources by halting further degradation of habitats so \nthat at-risk species will have a better chance of surviving in the \nfuture.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation in order \nto ensure that these gardens continue to not only thrive for \ngenerations to come, but ensure that these resources will be preserved.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 2221. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the reporting of sales price data for implantable medical \ndevices; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today with \nSenator Specter the Transparency in Medical Device Pricing Act of 2007.\n  As we all know, both parties to a transaction need information in \norder for the free market to properly work. If only one party has \ninformation, the market does not properly function because you have a \none-sided negotiation. The purpose of this legislation is to bring \ntransparency to medical device pricing so that there will be sufficient \ninformation available for market forces to truly work.\n  In the Medicare program, most hospitals receive a single payment for \nall the health care goods and services provided during a beneficiary's \nstay. This payment structure is designed to give hospitals incentives \nto provide efficient, effective, and economical care. Why? Because when \na hospital lowers its costs, more of the Medicare payment can go toward \nthe hospital's bottom line.\n  Hospitals normally have many resources like consultants or reference \nmaterials to help them when they negotiate prices for things like \ndrugs, nursing care, or hospital gowns. Unfortunately, this is not the \ncase with implantable medical devices like pacemakers, stents, and \nartificial hips and knees.\n  Hospitals have no way of knowing what a fair market price for a \nmedical device is, because in this one industry there is a veil of \nsecrecy over pricing information. In fact, manufacturers typically \nrequire hospitals to agree to secrecy or gag clauses in their \ncontracts. The device makers actually prohibit hospitals from \ndisclosing the price of a medical device to others. So hospitals have \nno idea of what is a fair price. Instead they must engage in one-sided \nnegotiations with medical device manufacturers.\n  We all know that there must be enough transparency for market forces \nto work. The free market, after all, thrives on complete information \nand open competition--not on gag rules and secrecy clauses.\n  As a farmer, when I go out and buy a tractor, I first go out and talk \nto a number of people to help me figure out what is a fair price. \nHaving this information puts me on equal footing with the dealer when \nwe negotiate the price. After all, I don't want to be taken to the \ncleaners.\n  Today, there is no level playing field when hospitals negotiate with \ndevice manufacturers. It shows. This is a major reason why many \nhospitals pay absurdly more than others for the same medical device. \nThe inflated prices many hospitals pay have implications for the health \ncare system on multiple levels.\n  First, higher medical device costs take up more of the Medicare \npayment. That means hospitals have less to spend on other crucial \ncomponents of care such as staff. And hospitals have less of the \nMedicare payment to devote toward their bottom line. So they have less \nmoney for activities to improve hospital quality and safety. They have \nless money to spend on health information technology systems. Most \nimportantly, they have less money to keep their doors open and provide \ncare to Medicare beneficiaries. In rural areas in my state where \nhospitals are barely squeaking by, this is a problem.\n  Also, I want to point out how hospitals paying more than the fair \nmarket price for medical devices adds to skyrocketing entitlement \nspending. Medicare hospital payments are updated every year. The update \ntakes into account the increased cost of goods and services used to \nprovide care to beneficiaries. Let us say medical device prices are \nhigher than they should be. As a result, Medicare hospital payment \nupdates and Medicare spending will rise faster than they should.\n  Also, let us remember that there are cost-sharing requirements for \ncertain hospital services. And so Medicare beneficiaries will be paying \nmore out-of-pocket than they should.\n  All this adds up to one thing: a need for greater transparency in \nmedical device pricing. My good friend and colleague, Senator Specter, \nand I have developed a way to provide greater transparency.\n  The Transparency in Medical Device Pricing Act of 2007 would bring \nthis needed transparency to medical device pricing by building on \ncurrent initiatives at the Department of Health and Human Services, \nHHS. Under the act, here are some conditions device manufacturers would \nhave to receive direct or indirect payments under Medicare, Medicaid, \nor SCHIP. Every quarter they would have to submit to the HHS Secretary \ndata on average and median sales prices for all medical devices that \nare implanted during inpatient and outpatient procedures. Manufacturers \nwould be subject to civil money penalties from $10,000 to $100,000 for \nfailure to report or misrepresentations of price data.\n  Collecting such data is not new to HHS. The Secretary has been \ncollecting average sales price data for drugs covered under Part B of \nthe Medicare program for a number of years now.\n  The Secretary would also be required to make the data available to \nthe public on the website of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices, CMS. CMS would have to update the website on a quarterly \nbasis.\n  Again, this is nothing new at HHS. It has been promoting transparency \nin Medicare for quite some time. The Secretary already publicly reports \nquality and price data of various Medicare providers. This is so \nbeneficiaries can use these resources when selecting a provider.\n  Publicly reporting implantable medical device pricing would help \nhospitals negotiate fair prices. For once, they would have a resource \nto consult so negotiations would be fairer.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear. I fully support the medical device \nindustry making a profit. I just think it should not be at the expense \nof hospitals, beneficiaries and the American taxpayer paying much more \nthan they should. We must let the market work, and markets depend on \ninformation.\n  The Transparency in Medical Device Pricing Act of 2007 would go a \nlong way toward ensuring that free market forces actually work. The act \nwould enable hospitals to obtain medical devices at fair prices.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with Senator Grassley, I introduce a bill \nthat will help control Medicare spending and will increase transparency \nin our health care system. Medicare spending is a huge component of the \nFederal budget. In 2006, Medicare benefit payments totaled $374 billion \nand accounted for 12 percent of the Federal budget.\n\n[[Page S13267]]\n\n  Over the past several months I have received many letters from \nhospitals, consumer groups, employers, health and welfare funds, and \nhealth care journalists about the secrecy that the medical device \nindustry is trying to impose around pricing for implantable medical \ndevices, pacemakers, hip and knee replacements, which hospitals \npurchase. Hospitals are being told they can't share pricing information \nwith any ``third parties,'' that would include patients, physicians, \nauditors, and consultants. The hospitals are not the ultimate payers. \nThe payers are patients and those who provide health insurance \ncoverage, which includes small businesses, large employers, and local, \nState, and Federal Government programs. But the hospitals are the ones \nwho have the role of negotiating fair pricing on behalf of the patients \nand other payers.\n  A New York hospital stated in a letter to me that many hospitals, \npatients, communities and Federal agencies are ``prevented from \nparticipating in an open and fair marketplace--culminating in inflated \npricing and less than optimal cost effective health care.'' This \nhospital said that it has an annual health care supplies spend of \napproximately $300 million, and although the implantable items such as \ncardiac pacemakers and orthopedic implants represent only 3 percent of \nthe total items the hospital buys, the expenditures are close to 40 \npercent of the total spend. Moreover, these devices are characterized \nby annual cost increases of from 8 percent to 15 percent. Since \nnational sales of implant\nable devices are approximately $65 billion annually, with an expected \ngrowth in utilization of close to 20 percent, the potential of adding 8 \nto 15 percent annual price increases to the expenditures clearly \ndemands attention.\n  A smaller health system in Jackson, MS, reports savings in 2006 of \nmore than $10 million because it was able to get detailed objective and \nmeasurable information that neutralized the arguments from the vendors \nwho were telling them that they were getting the best price. The \nNational Partnership for Women and Families told me that consumers can \nlearn more about the quality and price of a car than they can about \nthese medical devices that are implanted in the body. The Pacific \nBusiness Group on Health, a collection of 50 of the Nation's largest \npurchasers of health care who spend billions of dollars annually to \nprovide health care coverage to more than 3 million employees, retirees \nand dependents, also wrote to me that the critical strategy for \nimproving the quality of our Nation's health care system is increasing \nits transparency.\n\n  The Transparency in Medical Device Pricing Act of 2007 would require \nmedical device manufacturers, as a condition of receiving direct or \nindirect payments under Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP, to submit to the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, on a quarterly basis, data on \naverage and median sales prices for all implantable medical devices \nused in inpatient and outpatient procedures. Manufacturers would be \nsubject to civil monetary penalties from $10,000 to $100,000 for \nfailure to report or for misrepresentation of price data. The data \nwould be available to the public on the website of the centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services.\n  Senator Grassley and I believe this bill will improve the overall \nquality and efficiency of our health care system and will help ensure \nthat health care programs administered or sponsored by the Federal \nGovernment, in particular, promote quality and efficient delivery of \nhealth care through 1. the use of health information technology; 2. \ntransparency regarding health care quality and price; and 3. better \nincentives for those involved in these programs--physicians, hospitals, \nand beneficiaries. By making important information available in a \nreadily useable manner and in collaboration with similar initiatives in \nthe private sector and nonfederal public sector, we can help control \ngovernment spending on health care. The rising cost of health care and \nhealth insurance is a problem for consumers, small business owners, \nlarge employers and union health and welfare funds. This bill says that \nif you want to do business with the Federal Government, you have got to \nshow us your prices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/23/senate-section/article/S13267-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3449.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask \nunanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the \nfollowing treaty transmitted to the Senate on October 23, 2007, by the \nPresident of the United States:\n  Protocol of Amendments to Convention on International Hydrographic \nOrganization, Treaty Document No. 110-9.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the treaty be considered as \nhaving been read the first time; that it be referred, with accompanying \npapers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be \nprinted; and that the President's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Protocol of Amendments to the \nConvention on the International Hydrographic Organization done at \nMonaco on April 14, 2005. The Protocol amends the Convention on the \nInternational Hydrographic Organization, which was done at Monaco on \nMay 3, 1967, and entered into force for the United States on September \n22, 1970 (TIAS 6933; 21 UST 1857; 752 UNTS 41). I am also transmitting, \nfor the information of the Senate, the report of the Secretary of State \non the Protocol.\n  The Protocol will facilitate the reorganization of the International \nHydrographic Organization (IHO). The IHO, which is a technical and \nconsultative international organization headquartered in Monaco, \nfacilitates safe and efficient maritime navigation throughout the \nworld. It accomplishes these objectives by facilitating the \ncoordination of the activities of national hydrographic offices, \npromoting uniformity in the nautical charts and documents generated by \nsuch offices, encouraging the adoption of reliable surveying methods, \nand fostering the development of the science of hydrography. \nReorganization of the IHO will result in a more flexible, efficient, \nand visible organization.\n  Ratification of the Protocol would serve important U.S. interests. \nUnited States commercial shipping, the United States Navy, and the \nscientific research community rely heavily on hydrographic information \ncollected and shared under the auspices of the IHO. The United States \nplays an important leadership role in the IHO and as a result enjoys \nexpeditious and economical access to this information. Moreover, the \nUnited States has committed more resources than any other country to \nresearch, development, and evaluation of hydrographic instruments and \ntherefore stands to benefit significantly from the efficiencies \ngenerated by this reorganization.\n  Article XXI of the Convention sets forth the procedure for the \napproval and entry into force of amendments: amendments that are \nadopted or ``approved'' by the Conference enter into force for all \nContracting Parties to the Convention 3 months after two-thirds of the \nContracting Parties have notified the depositary of the their consent \nto be bound.\n  I recommend that the Senate give prompt and favorable consideration \nto the Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W.
