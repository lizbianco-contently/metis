Mr. President, before I outline what we are going to do \nthis afternoon, let me say I had a conversation last week with Pete \nDomenici, who announced he would not run for reelection. I served with \nSenator Domenici for my entire time in the Senate on the Appropriations \nCommittee. We worked on the Energy and Water Subcommittee over many \nyears. During most of that time, he was either chairman or I was \nchairman, and the other one was the ranking member. We traveled the \ncountry looking at different facilities that related to the \njurisdiction we had. It was a great subcommittee because all the money \nwe had was discretionary, and it was a subcommittee that did so many \ngood things for the country. There were water projects that were long \noverdue. We set up the safety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal. \nIt was not easy, but we worked through that.\n  Senator Domenici has a tremendously interesting background. Because \nof my fascination with athletics, and especially baseball, I was \nstunned to learn this respectable man--who has so much mental acuity \nand is good with numbers and all this--had started out as a great \nbaseball player. He was a pitcher, a left-handed pitcher, as I \nunderstand. He played professional baseball. He was in the Brooklyn \nDodgers' farm system. He left there to become a junior high school math \nteacher.\n  He went on to earn a law degree before he began a storied career in \nthe State of New Mexico as a city councilman and mayor. Now, of course, \nhe is one of the more senior Members of the Senate.\n  During the time Senator Domenici and I have known each other, we have \ngotten to know each other's spouses. He is very kind and thoughtful to \nLandra, my wife, as I try to be to his very sweet, personable Nancy. \nThey have eight children.\n  He is a person for whom I have great respect. I will miss him. He has \na unique knowledge of the importance of our National Laboratories. One \nreason, of course, is we have two of them in the State of New Mexico. \nBut we have them in other places--California, Illinois. I have traveled \nwith him to Missouri.\n  He is a person who has looked out for the Nevada test site--a place \nwhere almost 1,000 nuclear devices were exploded, most of them \nunderground, but not all of them underground. He worked with me to make \nsure that facility--that is a billion-dollar facility--is still used \nfor the security of this Nation. He has worked on, as I have indicated, \nthe safety of our nuclear stockpile.\n  He made his decision to retire for reasons that are certainly valid, \nbut that does not take away from the fact we will all miss him.\n  I must say, one of the other issues he has worked so hard on--\noriginally with Senator Wellstone, but after that much of the time \nalone--deals with mental health parity. Fortuitously, a week before we \nadjourned for the Columbus Day recess, we passed that legislation\n\n[[Page S12832]]\n\nin the Senate. Now we have to make sure our bill and the House bill are \nconferenced and we finish those two bills. But it certainly is a step \nin the right direction.\n  So I do offer Senator Domenici my congratulations for the wonderful \njob he has done as a Senator and, as I told him on the phone, I express \nhow much--after the next 15 months--I will miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/senate-section/article/S12832-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR TED KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think it is also important to tell \neveryone Senator Kennedy is strong and well and happy. He had some \nminor surgery that was important surgery. A lot of people do not know \nSenator Kennedy was nearly killed in an airplane crash. His life was \nsaved by Evan Bayh's father, Birch Bayh.\n  He never complains, but Senator Kennedy has constant pain from his \nback. As a result of that, he had some work done to see what was going \non with his back. They did a CAT scan of his full spine, which normally \nis not done because most of the trouble in his back is in the low back, \nnot the high back. As a result of that, they fortuitously--with good \nfortune because of the high x-ray--checked and a carotid artery was \nplugged.\n  It was very fortuitous that was done. His wife Jackie thinks that is \na miracle, and it certainly is a blessing in their lives because as a \nresult of taking a look at his spine, they were able to spot that and \navoid some serious problems in the future.\n  I cannot possibly overstate the importance of Senator Kennedy's \nleadership in this body as we address the critical issues that lie \nahead in this work period. For 45 years he has been a person who has \nbeen on the cutting edge of doing the right thing for this country and \ncertainly for the State of Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/senate-section/article/S12832-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Following \nthe period of morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nthe Department of Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Act.\n  Under an order previously entered, people have until 2:30 p.m. today \nto file any first-degree amendments to the bill. We are going to finish \nthis bill perhaps not tonight, but I hope we can finish it tomorrow \nbecause we are going to move then to the Labor-HHS legislation.\n  Tonight we are going to have a vote, and we are going to see if we \ncan come up with an amendment to the appropriations bill we are working \non. If not, there is still a judge we need to have approved, and we \nwill do that tonight.\n  I hope everyone understands we need to do the Labor-HHS bill. That \nwould be the sixth bill we will have completed. We are going to start \nthat bill as soon as we finish the bill that is before us, the \nCommerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill, and we are going to \nfinish that bill this week. We have to do that.\n  The farm bill is so important all across this country, and the markup \nof that bill is scheduled for next week. The reason we have to finish \nthe Labor-HHS appropriations bill this week is the chairman of the \ncommittee the farm bill will come out of is Senator Harkin, who is also \nthe chairman of the subcommittee that deals with Labor-HHS. So we have \nto finish that. I hope it does not spill into the weekend. We have \ntalked about that several times this year and rarely have we had to do \nit. But we need to get that done.\n  After this week, we will only have four work weeks before we have our \nThanksgiving Day recess. We are all on line to see what we can do to \nwork out our differences with the White House to finish our funding for \nthis year. We need to do that, and finishing this bill will point us in \nthat direction.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/senate-section/article/S12832-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Presidential \nRecords Act Amendments of 2007.\n  The Presidential Records Act of 1978 declared a President's papers \nwere the property of the people of the United States and were to be \nadministered by the National Archives and Records Administration. The \nact provided that Presidential papers would be available 12 years after \na President left office, allowing the former or incumbent President the \nright to claim executive privilege for particularly sensitive \ndocuments.\n  In order to fulfill that mandate--that mandate that was in the 1978 \nlaw--President Reagan, in 1989, signed Executive Order 12667, which \ngave the former or incumbent President 30 days to claim executive \nprivilege.\n  However, in 2001, early in his administration, President Bush issued \nExecutive Order 13233, and this executive order by President Bush \nnullified President Reagan's order and imposed new regulations for \nobtaining Presidential and Vice Presidential documents. President \nBush's new order greatly restricts access to Presidential papers by \nrequiring that all requests for documents, no matter how innocuous, be \napproved by both the former President, whose papers are involved, and \nalso by the current White House occupant. There is no time limit to the \nWhite House review, and the right to review and assert executive \nprivilege has been extended by President Bush in his Executive order to \ninclude the Vice President and to include Presidential family members. \nIn this way, the order goes against the spirit of the Presidential \nRecords Act and against the letter of the Presidential Records Act by \ncreating a presumption of nondisclosure and expanding the executive \nprivilege claim, thus allowing the White House to prevent the release \nof records literally for generations in the future.\n\n  H.R. 1255, the Presidential Records Act Amendments of 2007--which is \nthe bill I came to the floor to speak about--was passed in the House by \na vote of 333 to 93 on June 20 of this year. I introduced a similar \nbill, S. 886, in March of this year in the Senate. The bill I \nintroduced is a bipartisan bill which is cosponsored by Senators \nCornyn, Leahy, Sununu, Feinstein, and Obama. Two weeks ago, Senator \nFeinstein sought unanimous consent for the Senate to proceed to H.R. \n1255, but an objection was heard from another Senator.\n\n[[Page S12833]]\n\n  H.R. 1255 is a bipartisan bill that merely seeks to clarify the \nprocess under which the Presidential Records Act is to be implemented. \nThe bill seeks to nullify President Bush's Executive order by limiting \nclaims of executive privilege to the President and to former Presidents \nin requiring that the President notify the Archivist of any claims of \nexecutive privilege within 60 days preceding a notice of a request for \na document with an additional 30 days if requested. These measures \nessentially return the process to the procedural framework that had \nbeen in place since President Reagan issued his original Executive \norder.\n  This is an important matter that deserves to be brought to a vote in \nthe Senate. There is strong bipartisan support for the reasonable \napproach to the Presidential Records Act that is contained in H.R. \n1255. Now is not the time, in my view, for political ploys but for, \ninstead, a thoughtful debate and an ultimate vote on this bill.\n  Two weeks ago, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia \nruled that Executive Order 13233 is, in part--this is the Executive \norder President Bush entered--invalid in requiring the Archivist of the \nUnited States to delay release of the records of former Presidents at \ntheir request as permitted under the order. The Court found that the \nArchivist's reliance on section 3(b) of that Executive order is without \nconstitutional basis and violates the Administrative Procedures Act. \nThis holding gives us clear direction in legislatively addressing the \nproblems that have arisen as a result of Executive Order 13233.\n  Under the Presidential Records Act, there is a clear and an \nunequivocal assumption that the records of a President's administration \nbelong to the people of this Nation, barring the national security \ninterests or an executive privilege claim. The people of this Nation \nhired the President. His work is undertaken on behalf of the people. \nCan anyone doubt that the Nation is made stronger and our Government \nand the electorate are better served by the study of the actions of \npast Presidents? This is not a matter of trying to uncover dark \nsecrets; rather, it is in everyone's interests and certainly in the \ninterests of this Nation that scholars, students, and the public have \naccess to the records of former Presidents in order to fully understand \nand appreciate the work of those Presidents and to provide guidance for \nfuture Presidents and future administrations.\n  I strongly urge that H.R. 1255 be brought to the Senate floor for \ndebate and for ultimate passage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I certainly do withhold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/senate-section/article/S12833-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RECORD CORRECTION\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I believe midweek this week the House will \ntake up the veto override of the President's veto on the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. There has been a lot of discussion about what \nthis Congress has or has not done. I think despite all of the obstacles \nand roadblocks we have made progress in a wide range of areas. But the \none in which we have made significant progress, which I am very proud \nof, is expanding children's health insurance coverage.\n  Regrettably, we have a lot of children in this country who have no \nhealth insurance coverage at all. So the question of whether when they \nare sick they have a doctor to go to is a function, in many cases, of \nwhether the parents have any income or any money in their checkbook or \nin their pockets. Many times those children get no health care.\n  In 1997, we put in place the Children's Health Insurance Program. We \nknow it works because we have had it for 10 years. In my State, for \nexample, the Children's Health Insurance Program is not a government \nprogram that has created more bureaucracy. It is a block grant to my \nState that is used by State government to purchase health insurance \nfrom Blue Cross/Blue Shield and cover children who have no health \ninsurance. Most States do that.\n  This is not a big government program. This Congress passed a \nbipartisan piece of legislation. Let me emphasize that it is a \nbipartisan piece of legislation expanding health insurance coverage for \nchildren. I am proud that we have done that. In the Senate, we had 67 \nSenators vote in favor of it. Two Senators who were in favor of that \nbill were absent at that time, so that is 69 Senators who said, yes, \nlet's expand the program. It was fully paid for. It doesn't increase \nthe debt by one penny. It expands the program and would allow 3.8 \nmillion additional children in this country to have access to health \ncare coverage.\n  Mr. President, I don't know what is in second or third or even fourth \nplace in terms of people's priorities. I know what is in first place \nfor most people: their children and their children's health.\n  The President says he vetoed this legislation because it is big \ngovernment. He vetoed this legislation because he says it would cover \nkids at the family level of income of $83,000. The President knows \nbetter than that. He wasn't telling the truth. Let me just, if I can, \nspeak a bit of truth to this issue. This is not big government. \nContrary to most of what the President is sending down to the Congress, \nthis is paid for. Contrast this children's health insurance--a proposal \nfrom the Congress that is paid for--with the proposals that sit in \nfront of the Congress from the President for Iraq and Afghanistan to \nprosecute the war. Right now, we have a $189 billion request by this \nPresident to continue funding the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Not one \npenny of it is paid for.\n  We send the soldiers to war, and the President says let's send them \nthe bill later when they come home and they can help pay for it. \nContrast that with what we have done with children's health insurance. \nIt is $35 billion over 5 years, all of it paid for, and 3.8 million \nchildren, who at this point don't have access to health insurance \ncoverage, will get that coverage. Is that something we ought to be \nproud of? In my judgment, it is. Now, the President, when he vetoed \nthis, he said this is going to provide coverage to kids whose parents \nare at the $83,000 level. That is not the poverty level. There is no \n$83,000 level. That was a level requested by the State of New York, \nwhich was not approved.\n\n  It is true that there are a number of States that cover children from \nfamilies who have incomes above the 200-percent level of poverty, but \nlet me point out that this George W. Bush administration approved these \nexpansions, and I will give an example. In 2003, New Jersey applied for \na waiver to be able to cover parents in their program. Secretary \nThompson of the Bush\n\n[[Page S12834]]\n\nadministration said: Absolutely. He signed the waiver saying:\n\n       With this waiver, New Jersey will be able to expand health \n     insurance coverage to thousands of residents who otherwise \n     would be uninsured.\n\n  California asked for a waiver. The Bush administration said:\n\n       By giving parents of children with the CHIP program health \n     insurance, we are providing quality health care to the whole \n     family.\n\n  This is the Bush administration that has actually approved these \nwaivers, the very waivers the President seems now to be critical of.\n  Let me also say this. The President campaigned--he campaigned--on \nexpanding children's health insurance. In 2004, here is what he said:\n\n       In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll \n     millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up \n     for the government's health insurance programs. We will not \n     allow a lack of attention or information to stand between \n     these children and the health care they need.\n\n  So the President vetoed this bill. The sky is the limit when it comes \nto the other spending, but this bill, which is fully paid for, gets a \nveto. There are plenty of votes in the Senate to override the \nPresident's veto. The question is in the House. My hope is that Members \nof the House will understand the opportunity to override this veto and \nto establish a clear priority for this Congress on a bipartisan basis. \nMy hope is they will round up the votes in the House to override this \nPresident's veto.\n  This is about priorities. The fact is 100 years from now all of us \nwill be dead and gone and the record of our service here and the record \nof this President's service, the record of this Government, will be in \nthe history books. They will be able to tell a bit about our value \nsystem by looking at how did we spend our money. They will see there \nwas a time in October of 2007 that this Congress had a couple of \nchoices: First of all, the President says, give me another $189 billion \nfor Iraq and Afghanistan to prosecute the war; give me another $189 \nbillion, and by the way, I don't intend to pay for a penny of it. Just \nadd it to the debt. Another priority was the Congress saying, let's \nexpand health insurance for children--$35 billion over 5 years. Let's \nexpand health insurance for children and, by the way, we will pay for \nit in the bill, which we did. And the President says the second \npriority is the one that is inappropriate? What can he be thinking of?\n  When historians look at this value system and determine that the \nvalue system said children are less important, children are not the \npriority, they are going to scratch their heads and wonder how on Earth \nwe came to that conclusion. I hope that is not the lesson that will \ncome from this effort to override the President's veto. I hope the \nlesson will be a bipartisan Congress saying to this President: Not this \ntime. Not today. Your priorities aren't square with what we ought to be \ndoing in this country today. Our priority is, No. 1, expand health \ninsurance coverage for America's children. My hope is at the end of \nthis week that will be the result from the House of Representatives. I \nknow very soon the Senate will vote and easily override the President's \nveto.\n\n\n               Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\n\n  In a moment I will talk about General Sanchez's speech this weekend, \nwhich I read about in the Washington Post, but before I do that, there \nis some interesting news about what is happening at the Defense \nDepartment in advanced research in something called DARPA--Defense \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency.\n  The head of DARPA, Dr. Tony Tether, came and spoke at a technology \nconference I had in Fargo, ND, last week. His speech was extraordinary. \nHe is a good presenter and a wonderful public servant. I know there are \nsome who wonder if the Government ever does anything right. Well, the \nGovernment does a lot of things to improve and help the American people \nand advance this country's interests, and I will describe one of them.\n  Dr. Tether described experiments that are going on in advanced \nresearch in DARPA, in which they have taken a monkey, and the monkey \nsits at a console with a joystick. He sees a red ball go across in \nfront of him, and he uses the joystick to touch the red ball with the \narm of the joystick, and he is then given a treat. That is learned \nbehavior for the monkey. The ball goes across the screen, the monkey \nexercises the joystick, the joystick aperture touches the red ball, and \nthe monkey gets a treat. Then they took the joystick away and instead \nput on the monkey a mechanical electrical arm they are working on for \nthose who have lost their limbs. They implanted electrodes in the brain \nof the monkey. Now, when the red ball goes across in front of the \nmonkey, the monkey has no joystick, but the monkey thinks about \ntouching the ball and getting the treat and so the electrodes capture \nthe thought. Think of that--the electrodes capture the thought, which \nsends the electric impulse to the prosthetic arm that has been \ndeveloped, and the arm reaches out and touches the ball, all because \nthe monkey is thinking about touching the ball.\n  This is about breathtaking new technology and research into \napproaches that will help those who have lost limbs in warfare, yes, \nand in every other area of life. There is so much going on that is \ninteresting and breathtaking in the advanced research area, and again I \nsay to Dr. Tether that I appreciated his coming to North Dakota and \ngiving such a wonderful presentation. It was extraordinary.\n  Well, that is something called DARPA. Not a lot of people know about \nDARPA at the Department of Defense.\n\n\n                 Retired General Sanchez on Iraq Policy\n\n  Now, let me go from DARPA to the issue of General Sanchez's speech on \nIraq policy that he gave this past weekend. General Sanchez was in \ncharge of the war in Iraq and he has now retired and General Sanchez \nhas some very strong things to say about the war in Iraq since his \nretirement.\n  He says the war began with:\n\n       A catastrophically flawed, unrealistically optimistic war \n     plan . . . Since the start of this war, America's leadership \n     has known that our military alone could not achieve victory \n     in Iraq. Starting in July 2003, the message repeatedly \n     communicated to Washington by military commanders on the \n     ground was that the military alone could never achieve \n     victory in Iraq.\n\n  General Sanchez said the ``surge,'' which he called the ``latest \nrevised strategy,'' is, in his words, ``a desperate attempt by an \nadministration that has not accepted the political and economic \nrealities of this war and they have definitely not communicated that \nreality to the American people.''\n  As a result, the American military, he says:\n\n     finds itself in an intractable situation. The best we can do \n     with this flawed approach is stave off defeat. The war in \n     Iraq has been a ``catastrophic failure.''\n\n  This, according to General Sanchez, who was in charge of the war in \nIraq from mid-2003 to mid-2004. Over 20 other retired generals have \nspoken out after they have retired. General Eaton said:\n\n       The military ethos is: Give your advice privately to those \n     in a position to make changes, not the media, but this \n     administration is immune to good advice.\n\n  So retired General Eaton went public with his criticism of this \nadministration's flawed policies.\n  General Batiste--I had the opportunity to meet General Batiste--was \none of the brightest stars in the military and was considered virtually \ncertain for promotion to the highest ranks. But, he turned down his \nthird star and retired rather than continue to implement a war policy \nthat he felt, and that he had experienced firsthand, was flawed. He \nretired so he could ``speak out on behalf of soldiers and their \nfamilies.''\n  The point is, General Sanchez has said, and the other retired \ngenerals have said--in fact, I believe that most believe--there is not \na military solution in Iraq, there is only a solution that embodies \nsubstantial diplomatic efforts and efforts in the political system in \nIraq as well. The military alone cannot possibly prevail in Iraq.\n  I wish to make a point I have made before. We have now apparently \ntrained about 350,000 people in Iraq to be soldiers or to be in law \nenforcement. To the extent that I have numbers, this was from the 2007 \nreport of the General Jones Commission, we have trained 152,000 members \nof the Iraqi Army--which incidentally, is about the number of American \nsoldiers in Iraq--and 194,000 members of the Iraqi police. That is \n346,000 Iraqis to be soldiers and\n\n[[Page S12835]]\n\npolice men and women. Now, I think one can reasonably ask the question, \nafter we have been in Iraq longer than we were in the Second World War, \nthat if we have trained over 350,000, or roughly 350,000 police men and \nwomen and soldiers, when will they have the will to provide for their \nown security?\n  They have a new Constitution. The people of Iraq have seen Saddam \nHussein executed. They have a new government. And they have had nearly \n350,000 of their own trained to be law enforcement and military \nsoldiers. Yet they cannot provide for their own security?\n  My nephew went into the Marines about 10 months ago. He is fully \ntrained and now in Iraq. We do it, and we can train 350,000 Iraqis. Yet \nthey can't provide for their own security? Something is wrong with \nthat.\n  So, Mr. President, I only make the point that I read with interest \nGeneral Sanchez's comments this weekend, and they mirrored comments we \nhave heard previously from General Eaton, from General Batiste, from \nColonel Hammes, and many others that the current strategy has been \nflawed all along and must change. We must understand that the solution \nin Iraq is not going to be a military-imposed solution, it is going to \nbe a diplomatic solution and a solution within the political system in \nIraq, the absence of which means there will remain in Iraq a protracted \nlong-term civil war.\n  While we are going door to door in Baghdad in the middle of a civil \nwar with American soldiers, Osama bin Laden continues to send us \nmessages over the internet and the airwaves. Our National Intelligence \nEstimate says that he is in a ``secure'' hideaway in northern Pakistan \nand has now rebuilt training camps and reconstituted the al-Qaida \nleadership.\n  Now, think of that. Those who committed the acts of terror against \nour country and murdered thousands of Americans are now in a safe, more \nsecure place, according to our intelligence estimates, and is \nreconstituting training camps and plotting new attacks against our \ncountry. We, on the other hand, have our soldiers going door to door in \nBaghdad in the middle of a civil war. I think General Sanchez's \ncomments and the comments of over 20 other high-ranking military \nofficers upon their retirement represent a basic body of thought most \nof us have long understood but is not understood at this point by the \nPresident.\n  All of us want this country to succeed. We want our country to \nsucceed in our war against terrorism. But the fact is we have to \ndevelop the right processes and the right policies to embrace that war \nagainst terrorism and to eliminate the al-Qaida leadership, which \nrepresents the greatest terrorist threat to our country. Again, the \nNational Intelligence Estimate that we have all read says the greatest \nterrorist threat to our country, including to our homeland, is the \nleadership of al-Qaida and they are in a safe or secure haven and they \nare plotting additional attacks against our country and they are \nreconstituting their training camps to train the terrorists. Now, it \nshould be clear to us what our obligations are.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/senate-section/article/S12835-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Mikulski, the chair of the \nsubcommittee, will be here at 4 o'clock. I know Senator Shelby is here, \nand I believe he will be out momentarily. I have agreed to be on the \nfloor until Senator Mikulski returns.\n  I did want to take a moment to talk about an amendment I was \ndiscussing when we were previously in session on this bill, dealing \nwith law enforcement on Indian reservations. I did not actually offer \nthe amendment. I had filed the amendment.\n  The subcommittee itself restored some funds that the President had \ncut. I indicated to the subcommittee that I hoped we could work between \nnow and next spring, when we begin the new fiscal year legislation, so \nwe could add some funding for these critical areas. I want to make note \nthat Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby already added funding to \naccounts the President had decided to zero out. These accounts are \naccounts dealing with law enforcement on Indian reservations.\n  We just held a hearing on these issues in the Indian Affairs \nCommittee here in the Senate. It is pretty stark, when you hear from \nfolks who talk about the crisis on reservations with respect to law \nenforcement.\n  The U.S. Government made a decision a long time ago, well over a \ncentury ago, that law enforcement on Indian reservations is a \nresponsibility of the Federal Government. Our country has a legal \nobligation to be involved in preventing crime on Indian lands. That \nobligation is a result of treaty provisions and Federal laws that grant \nthe United States the responsibility and the authority to investigate \nand prosecute major crimes on Indian reservations. That is not the \nchoice of Indian tribes; that is a decision our Government made over a \ncentury ago. The tribal governments on our Indian reservations rely on \nthe Federal Government--specifically, the FBI and the U.S. attorney's \noffice--to investigate and prosecute violent crimes on Indian \nreservations.\n  We had a hearing 2 weeks ago. There was testimony at that hearing \nfrom some research that had been done that 34 percent of Indian women \nwill be raped or sexually assaulted during their lifetime. One-third of \nthe Indian women will be raped or sexually assaulted during their \nlifetime. That is the state of violent crime on Indian reservations.\n  A retired BIA police officer who worked on the Standing Rock Sioux \nReservation said we do not have the resources. ``We all knew they only \ntake cases with a confession.'' If there wasn't a confession, there \nwasn't a case. ``We were forced to triage our cases,'' he said. When \nthis violence becomes so commonplace that the police have to triage \nrape cases, there is something dreadfully wrong.\n  One of the big factors in the rise of violent crime on Indian \nreservations is the lack of a police presence or law enforcement \npresence on Indian lands. There are little more than 2000 Federal and \ntribal law enforcement officers who patrol 56 million acres of Indian \nland. In North and South Dakota, we have two police officers who patrol \nthe 2.3 million-acre Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation. We have \nheard from people who called to report a violent crime as it was \noccurring, and they waited an hour and 15 minutes for the police to \nshow up. In other cases, they wait days for the police to show up.\n  The lack of tribal jails and bedspace also adds to the problem \nbecause there is no place to put criminals. I have\n\n[[Page S12836]]\n\nbeen in tribal detention facilities. I have seen kids lying on cement \nfloors in tribal detention facilities because there was not a juvenile \nfacility and the other detention facilities did not have proper beds \nand didn't have enough space, so young children were lying on the floor \nof a detention facility.\n  There is a $400 million backlog for construction for tribal jails. \nOne Federal official said that there is what is called a catch-and-\nrelease system--just catch the criminals and release many of them back \ninto the community because there is no space to put them. Because of \nthat, the Indian reservations have become soft targets for organized \ncrime and particularly for organized efforts dealing with \nmethamphetamine.\n  In May of last year, Federal officials seized a huge methamphetamine \norganization's business plan, and the business plan outlined how that \norganization wanted to replace alcohol abuse as it infiltrated Indian \nreservations with methamphetamine abuse on Indian reservations. The \nplan also outlined how the tribal police could not arrest them while on \nthe reservation. They described in the business plan how they were \ngoing to introduce and use the reservations as the basis for their \nmethamphetamine distribution to run their business.\n  After creating a system in which we said law enforcement is the \nFederal Government's responsibility, the administration in its budget \nnow wants to tell the tribes: We are too busy, so you are on your own.\n  The statistics I have described are really sobering: crumbling jails. \nWhat does the administration propose to spend for detention facilities, \nTribal Jails Discretionary Grants Program? Well, the administration \nproposes we spend nothing. Not a thing. Assistance to the tribal \ncourts, what does the administration propose that we spend? Nothing.\n  Those are all programs that have always been funded. These are \nprograms for which the Federal Government has a responsibility by \nprevious agreement. Tribal COPS Program, the President says let's fund \nit at zero. Tribal Youth Program, fund it at zero; Indian Alcohol and \nCrime Demonstration Program, zero.\n  Every single one of those, all except the last, have always been \nfunded. The President says: Not my responsibility, not this \nadministration; we do not intend to provide funding.\n  Now, let me thank Senator Mikulski and the ranking member as well, \nSenator Shelby, because they have provided some funding in this \nsubcommittee mark. It is not as much as I would like. It is not as much \nas I am sure they wanted to do, but they should be complimented for \nrejecting the President's recommendation at a time when we have a \nserious problem, and at a time when that problem is our responsibility \nto deal with because we have made agreements and required that we will \nbe responsible for dealing with it.\n  The President says: Let's not do it. And Senator Mikulski and Senator \nShelby said: We reject that. We have a responsibility.\n  I was intending to offer an amendment 2 weeks ago--I did not do \nthat--to add even further because Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby \nindicated they want to work with me. But, first and foremost, I want to \ncompliment them for rejecting the President's suggestion that we ignore \nour responsibility, and for Senators Mikulski and Shelby deciding these \nprograms are exactly what we should be funding; it is our \nresponsibility to do so.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                 SCHIP\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate is just returning from a week \nhome. I spent the week in my home State of Illinois traveling from far \nsouthern Illinois to Chicago and most points in between. It was a busy \nweek. I met with a lot of people and continue to be amazed that there \nis such a disconnect between the real world of America and the world of \nCapitol Hill.\n  In about 48 hours, the U.S. House of Representatives is going to have \na historic vote. It is about children's health insurance. Here we are, \nthe wealthiest Nation on Earth, with the best doctors, the best \nhospitals, the best technology, amazing medical research. Yet when it \ncomes down to basic health care protection, America falls short. We \nspent more money per capita than any nation on Earth on health care, \nbut our outcomes do not show it. Countries that spend a lot less get a \nlot more. Other countries around the world have made a dedicated effort \nto make sure every citizen in their nation has the protection of basic \nhealth care.\n  But not America. Forty-seven million Americans have no health \ninsurance. We tried to address that with the Children's Health \nInsurance Program 10 years ago. We looked at the 40 million uninsured \nAmericans and said: 15 million are kids; let's start there. Let's cover \nthese children. Let's make sure they have health insurance, not through \na government plan but through private health insurance. We will take \nmoney, grants and money, send it to the States, work with the \nGovernors, share the expense, and bring these kids under \nhospitalization coverage. In 10 years it worked. From 15 million \nuninsured, we were able to insure 6.6 million children in America; \n300,000 in my home State of Illinois.\n  Well, with the new Congress and the expiration of this program, we \ntook another look at it and said: Can we do better? Can we extend this \nbeyond 6.6 million kids to more of the 15 million targeted group of \nchildren? We found a way to do it. We did it in a bipartisan way, a \ncooperative effort with the Republican side of the aisle, an effort \nthat involves Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Senator Orrin Hatch of \nUtah, well-known, conservative Republicans who sat down with Senators \nMax Baucus and Ted Kennedy and hammered out the details--Thirty-five \nbillion dollars more in spending over the next 5 years.\n  Now, the first reaction, of course, is that most people say: Great, \nyou dreamed up an expansion of a program that costs us $35 billion. \nThanks a lot. Our kids will pay for it.\n  Wrong. We insisted that it be paid for. How is it paid for? By \nincreasing the Federal tax on tobacco products. That is it. I am not \ngoing to beat around the bush and tell you there is some secret way to \ndo it. That is how we did it. We raised the Federal tax on tobacco \nproducts, cigarettes and cigars. You can sign me up, incidentally, any \nday of the week. I am one Senator. I am sure there are many like me who \nhave lost a loved one to cancer brought on by tobacco. Most people in \nAmerica have been touched by tobacco disease and illness.\n  I believe one of the best things we can do is to keep tobacco \nproducts out of the hands of our kids. When you raise the price by \nraising the tax, children are discouraged from buying the product. \nGood. If kids do not get addicted early and stick around until they are \nabout 18 to make the choice, they will decide it is a pretty dumb idea. \nBut if they start smoking at 14, 15, 16, an addiction gets started. So \nwe raised the tobacco tax to come up with the $35 billion. Over the \nnext 5 years we will expand the health insurance coverage from 6.6 \nmillion children to 10 million children in America--still not 15 but \nclearly moving in the right direction.\n  We passed the bill over here with an amazing vote. In a time when we \nhave these death-defying votes of 1 vote here, 1 vote here, 69 Senators \nvoted for the bipartisan approach to expand children's health \ninsurance.\n  We sent the bill over to the House. They were disappointed because \nthey wanted more. I want more. I would like to see all 15 million kids \ncovered, to be honest with you. I would like to see all Americans \ncovered. I will get to that point in a moment. But they passed it, and \nwe sent it to President Bush.\n  Now, President Bush is in his seventh year as President of the United \nStates.\n\n[[Page S12837]]\n\nHe has used his veto pen four times--four times--once to veto a plan \npassed by Congress on a bipartisan basis to change the policy in Iraq \nand start bringing our troops home; President Bush vetoed it; next, he \nhad two opportunities and used his pen twice to veto the expansion of \nmedical research using stem cells. You will recall the President \nstopped this research at the Federal level. States are now doing it, \nprivate companies are doing it, and foreign governments are doing it. \nBut the Bush administration will not allow our National Institutes of \nHealth, through Federal funding, to do this. Well, the President used \nhis veto pen twice to stop this promising research to find cures for \ndiseases and causes of death.\n\n  His fourth use of the veto pen was to kill the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. What did they say about it? Why did the President \nveto this bipartisan bill that came out of the Senate and the House? \nWell, they said, first, it was socialized medicine--socialized \nmedicine. You know that is a cliche that was probably born in the \n1960s, maybe before, on the notion that the Government would provide \nall the health insurance for America.\n  Well, it did not work then. We created Medicare, and thank goodness \nwe did, for millions of Americans who have had peace of mind at age 65 \nbecause of it. Socialized medicine. What the President failed to say \nwas if he gets sick tomorrow, God forbid, he will go to a military \nhospital. The doctors will be members of the military. The nurses who \nanswer his call will be members of the military. He will be protected \nby Government health services as President of the United States.\n  Is that socialism? I think I will leave it to the President to \ndecide. But I think it is troublesome that we have reached a point that \nwe dismiss a program of such value to so many children and call it \nsocialized medicine. What was even more galling was someone in the \nWhite House along the way argued the point that this plan would cover \nindividuals who make up to three times the poverty level in the United \nStates.\n  Let me translate that into terms Americans can understand. If you \nmake up to $60,000, you get help under this plan. And the argument the \nWhite House made was, people making $60,000 a year--or ``well off'' in \ntheir terms--do not need this help.\n  Really? Well, let's think about that for a second. Sixty thousand \ndollars a year is gross pay. Now, let's take about 40 percent of that \nfor all of the taxes that are taken out and all of the deductions that \nare taken out. That leaves us somewhere in the range of $36,000 a year, \nabout $3,000 a month in take-home pay.\n  Now, go out and look for health insurance for a sick child. I will \ntell you what you will find. You will be lucky to get by with $1,000 a \nmonth for health insurance for your family if you have a sick child. If \nyou have a healthy family, it may still cost $600 or $800.\n  So out of a take-home pay of $3,000, they say you are well enough off \nthat you do not need help to pay $1,000 a month for health insurance. \nWho is kidding whom? The reality is that families are crippled by these \ncosts. Many of them cannot afford insurance, and they need the help of \nthis program. It is a reasonable thing to do.\n  Those people in the White House who just want to call this socialism, \nor whatever the word of the day may be, or dismiss families making \n$60,000 as not needing a helping hand with health insurance for \nchildren, they are so out of touch they do not understand the drama \nthat these families go through every single month for lack of health \ninsurance.\n  There is a story closer to home for the Members of the Senate. It \ndoes not relate to the Children's Health Insurance Program, but I think \nit is a story worth telling. It is a story about a member of the Senate \nfamily, someone whom most of us have seen many times. Many may not know \nhis name, but he is someone who has gone through a life-changing \nexperience because of no health insurance in his family.\n  Forty-seven million Americans have no health insurance. We who are \nprivileged in the Senate probably do not lie awake at night worrying \nabout it because a bad diagnosis is not going to lead to bankruptcy for \nus. We are lucky. We are part of the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram. We have got the best coverage in America. Eight million \nFederal employees, Members of Congress, we get an open enrollment \nperiod every year. You do not like your company, change it. It is like \nshopping for a car. There are so many choices out there. You want a big \nplan, you pay more. You have more money taken out of your check. You \nwant less coverage, pay less. You have less money taken out of your \ncheck. It has been around for decades.\n  Members of Congress benefit from it, and we have a peace of mind that \ncomes with it. But we do not have to look far to see families who are \nstruggling and facing terrible decisions because of the high cost of \nhealth insurance. They are everywhere. They are in every town, every \ncounty, every State, all across our Nation, and they are right here in \nthe family. There is a young man who works just a few feet away from \nwhere I am standing. He is an elevator operator. His name is Sergio \nOlaya. He has worked here off and on as an intern and has been an \nelevator operator since last May. He always has a big smile on his \nface, great young fellow, says hello, and most of us, of course, see \nhim and greet him and head off on our business.\n  He is 21 years old, a bright young man, happy disposition, a great \nfuture ahead of him. But a few months ago, Sergio, who works right \noutside this door, had a tragedy strike his family. His mother died of \nan aggressive form of brain cancer. She was 61 years old, a single mom. \nSergio was her only child. Doctors think she may have had the tumor for \na long time, but the symptoms didn't show up until 2 months ago, and \nthen she died. Before that, she had suffered a stroke which left her \nparalyzed on her right side. She was an authority on health and \nnutrition and worked for organizations, including the Centers for \nDisease Control, USAID, UNICEF, and the Organization of American \nStates, but she had been unemployed and uninsured for 5 months when she \ngot sick. Even COBRA, which is the way to purchase health insurance \nwhen one is not working, was too expensive for someone with a limited \nincome such as Sergio's mother. As a result, when she died from an \naggressive form of brain cancer, she left $255,000 in unpaid hospital \nand doctor bills--a quarter of a million dollars.\n  The hospital first threatened to sue her son for payment. A lawyer \nwho is helping him pro bono negotiated the hospital charges down, first \nto $216,000, then to $95,000. With another $40,000 in doctors bills, \nSergio, a member of the Senate staff, still owes $135,000 in medical \nbills for his mom. How is he dealing with this? He is selling his home \nin Bethesda where he and his mom have lived for the last 8 years. It is \nthe only home they have ever owned. The proceeds will go for the \npayment of these medical bills.\n  Sergio said when his mom got sick she had been waiting to hear about \na possible new job with the Federal Government, and it would have had \nhealth insurance. When the job offer finally came, his mother had just \nsuffered a stroke and couldn't get out of bed to answer the phone. Two \nmonths and $255,000 in medical bills later, she passed away at the age \nof 61. In another week or month, she might have had health coverage \nwith a new job. In another 4 years, she would have been eligible for \nMedicare. Instead, she had the bad luck and bad timing to fall through \none of the gaping holes in America's unravelling health care safety \nnet. Now her only child, her son, is paying the price.\n  I wonder how many Senators have been in the elevator with Sergio, \ntalked to him, shared a smile with him, but had no idea of the terrible \nburden he and his mother were carrying as a result of the cost of \nhealth care and the cost of being uninsured in America today. How many \nmore families will have to sell their homes? How many more bright, \ntalented young people will have to drop out of college so their family \ncan pay medical bills before we finally come up with a real plan to \nmake health care more affordable for all Americans? The truth is, \nalmost every family is at risk because of a fraying and failing health \ncare safety net. Almost all of us could be one pink slip, one election, \none bad diagnosis, or one serious accident away from a health and \neconomic disaster for our family.\n  This affects Sergio, our Senate family. It affects all families. We \nneed to\n\n[[Page S12838]]\n\ndeal with it. We need to find a way or a combination of ways to give \nevery American access to affordable health coverage. We can't help \nSergio pay these bills, but we can sure look to the possibility of 3.4 \nmillion children across America and their moms and dads finally having \nthe peace of mind of knowing that their kids are covered. It is a small \nstep for a big nation, but isn't it the kind of step we want to take \ntogether in a bipartisan way? President Bush says no. He vetoed the \nbill. He sent it back to the House of Representatives, and on Wednesday \nthey will take a vote. Fifteen Republican Congressmen who voted against \nthe plan have to change their votes to override his veto. Overall, 62 \nRepublican Senators and Congressmen voted for this plan, so it is \nbipartisan. I hope the 15 who are thinking about it now will think \nabout the vulnerability of a lot of people such as Sergio, people we \ndon't know who every single day have to wrestle with this terrible \nchallenge in our great Nation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Illinois has raised the issue of the \noverride of the President's veto that will occur in the House this \nweek. When the President vetoed the bipartisan legislation that would \nexpand opportunities for health coverage for America's children--\nanother 3.8 million kids who don't have health coverage now would have \nit under that bill--the President referred to it as some kind of \nsocialized medicine, some sort of big-government solution. Then he \ntalked about the prospect of families with $83,000 in income.\n  Isn't it the case that most States--my State included--receive a \nblock grant and use the block grant to provide coverage by buying the \ncoverage from BlueCross BlueShield? In other words, it is a block grant \nthe States use to purchase coverage for children. Is that what the \nPresident was referring to as big government? If so, isn't the \nPresident misrepresenting what this bill does?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, that is the case in almost every State. \nThis isn't a matter of the State of Illinois health insurance plan; it \nis a matter of our State or the State of North Dakota taking the \nFederal funds and buying private health insurance, which is something \nthese families currently cannot afford. It strikes me as reasonable for \nus to give them a helping hand. It is not socialism, whatever that \ndefinition may be. It is not a big-government plan.\n  The President argued that he thought it was unfair to the health \ninsurance industry. I don't understand that. If these 15 million \nchildren have not had health insurance for years, that industry has had \nplenty of chances to sell it. The fact is, it is too expensive for \nthese families.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further for a question, the \nPresident, when vetoing the legislation, referred to some families with \n$83,000 who will be getting this largess so that their children can get \nsubsidized health insurance coverage. My State, as an example, covers \nchildren at 140 percent of poverty, most States at around 200 percent \nof poverty, which I believe is around $44,000 gross income, and the \n$83,000 to which the President referred does not exist. It was a \nrequest from the State of New York which was not granted. In any event, \nall those requests that have been granted for above the 200 percent \nhave been approved willingly and in a way that allowed this \nadministration to boast that they had approved them. Now the President \nobjects to the very thing they had approved.\n\n  The other point is, didn't this President actually campaign in the \nyear 2004 saying he supports expansion of this very program? I ask the \nquestion about the $83,000. That clearly must be a misrepresentation. \nIs that the judgment of the Senator from Illinois as well?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The State of New York said: We want to cover families up \nto $83,000; it is more expensive to live in New York than it might be \nin some other State. But ultimately it was a decision to be made by the \nPresident. The President had to give them permission, and he denied it. \nUnder this bill, the President still has that authority to deny States \npermission to go beyond $62,000 a year. So he still has that authority. \nArguing $83,000 makes no sense. He turned it down. We didn't change \nthat in this bill. The President still has the authority to stop any \nprogram that would expand in that direction.\n  In my State and others, I concede, we have been trying to find every \nway we can to insure people. Our Governor, the general assembly, and \nother people have tried to find ways to work with the Federal \nGovernment to cover people who don't have health insurance.\n  As a reminder--I know the Senator from North Dakota is well aware--\nthe poorest children in America are covered by Medicaid. The poorest \nchildren have health insurance. The children who are fortunate enough \nto have parents with health insurance aren't the ones we are talking \nabout. We are talking about the group of children who belong to \nfamilies who go to work every single day and have no health insurance. \nThat is a lot of Americans and a lot of kids. I have had several press \nconferences during the break at hospitals with doctors and nurses. They \ntell the story of these children. These children don't have a regular \nphysician, regular checkups, a regular place to go. So an earache turns \ninto a substantial infection. Asthma at an early stage becomes a \nserious challenge. Diabetes goes undetected because these kids are not \nbrought into our health care system until they have reached such a \ngrievous situation that they end up in emergency rooms, and we all pay \nfor it.\n  This really is an ounce of prevention that we would have health \ninsurance for more of these kids to be covered, the children of working \nfamilies who go to work every single day and don't have health \ninsurance. The President vetoed the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for one additional question, \nthe Senator from Illinois is on the Appropriations Committee with me. \nMy understanding is the President is going to be sending down a second \nsupplemental request within days. I understand the White House might \nnot want to send it down before the override issue on the SCHIP \nprogram. But the SCHIP program would spend $7 billion a year for 5 \nyears. That is $35 billion. All of it is paid for. None of it is \ncontributing one penny to the debt. The result of that spending? The \n3.8 million children who at this point have no health insurance \ncoverage would now be fully covered with health insurance. The \nPresident seemed to, when he vetoed the legislation, be saying: I am \ngoing to be the guardian of the Federal Treasury and the taxpayers' \ncheckbook. This is big-government bureaucracy--socialized medicine, in \nfact.\n  This is fully paid for, $7 billion a year. Isn't it the case that the \nPresident has requested two things of us? One is already here, and the \nother will come next week. One is $145 billion in emergency funding for \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, not a penny of it paid for all this \nyear, and on top of that, we believe another roughly $44 billion \nsupplemental. So that will be a $189 billion emergency supplemental \nthis year. In other words, $7 billion for kids is too much; $189 \nbillion, which will bring us somewhere close to two-thirds of a \ntrillion dollars, the President has requested we spend, not a penny of \nit paid for. The implication of all that is, let's send soldiers to \nfight. When they come back, they can pay for the debt we have incurred \nbecause we don't intend to pay for any of it.\n  Isn't it the case that the very same President who says $7 billion a \nyear which is fully paid for and which will result in children's health \ninsurance for 3.8 million children is the President who is sending us a \n$189 billion additional request for 1 year, none of it paid for?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The math is right. This President has funded this war in \nIraq and Afghanistan borrowing money from future generations. He has \nnot paid for a single day of this war by imposing a tax or cutting \nspending in some other area. He is the first President in the history \nof the United States, in the entire history of our Nation, to cut taxes \nin the midst of war.\n  I am sure the Senator from North Dakota joined a lot of us in \nwatching the Ken Burns documentary ``The War.'' It has been on for the \nlast couple weeks on public television. One of our great friends and \nheroes in the Senate, Danny Inouye of Hawaii, was featured in it, as he \nshould have been. A Congressional Medal of Honor recipient, he\n\n[[Page S12839]]\n\ntold the story of his life that led to his service to our country. You \ncouldn't help but feel that America was at war. It wasn't just our \nsoldiers and sailors and marines and airmen; America was at war. We \nwere all involved.\n  This war which has claimed 3,821 American lives, this war which has \ninjured more than 30,000 of our fighting men and women, this war which \nhas left 10,000 grievously injured with amputations and serious burns, \nthis war has been waged in a much different way.\n  When America was going to wage this war on terrorism, the President \nsaid: We are going to invade Iraq. And America, you can help: go \nshopping.\n  That isn't what they said in World War II. They said: We can all \npitch in together and get behind this effort.\n  Then he said: We have to sacrifice. We have to give tax cuts to \npeople at the wealthiest levels.\n  So we end up with a debt, a debt that continues to grow because the \nPresident does not pay for a penny of this war. The Senator from North \nDakota is right. It will be close to $750 billion by the end of next \nyear. We are spending $12 to $15 billion a month on this war in Iraq, \nnone of it is paid for, none of it is generated by taxes, and none of \nit is paid for by compensating cuts in other spending. It is added to \nour debt.\n  The President who proclaims himself a fiscal conservative when it \ncomes to vetoing a children's health insurance program within the next \nseveral days will send us a massive spending bill of $190 or $200 \nbillion for the next year of this war. The $7 billion for health \ninsurance for children is paid for; the President says it is wasted \nFederal funds. But $200 billion for a war with no end in sight he \nconsiders to be appropriate. I don't understand this. I understand we \nhave to stand behind our men and women in uniform. But a strong America \nbegins at home. It begins with our families and our communities and our \nparishes and church groups and neighborhoods. It begins with the peace \nof mind of knowing that you have health insurance. For literally 3.8 \nmillion children, the President's veto means no help to buy private \nhealth insurance so these families have a chance to have that peace of \nmind.\n\n  I sincerely hope those who feel this is an important program will \ncontact their Members of Congress--both House and Senate--in the next \n48 hours. This is a critical moment in our history. We have to decide \nonce and for all whether we are going to start taking important steps \nforward to bring the peace of mind of health insurance to every family \nin America. That is a worthy American goal. President Bush's veto \nshould not stand in its way. I certainly hope the House of \nRepresentatives, when it votes on Wednesday, will override this \nPresidential veto.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3233, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n3233, previously agreed to, be modified with the changes at the desk. \nMy understanding is both sides have cleared this request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, while we are \nwaiting for the ranking member, to speak as in morning business for 3 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Do Not Call List Legislation\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last week I introduced some legislation in \nthe Senate for which it is my hope my colleagues will join in. It deals \nwith the issue of the Do Not Call List that is housed down at the \nFederal Trade Commission.\n  I do not think there is much more irritating in life than to receive \ncalls from telemarketers. Almost everybody has received bundles of \ncalls from telemarketers--always during mealtime. They always wait \nuntil the family has been able to sit down to start a meal, and then \nthe family gets a telephone call: Would you like to take our cable \nservice? Would you like to take our cell phone service? Do you need new \nsiding? We will have some people in your neighborhood tomorrow selling \nsheetrock or siding.\n  So on and on and on, telemarketers are unbelievably annoying. So \nCongress passed a piece of legislation. It says: We are going to set up \na list at the Federal Trade Commission called a Do Not Call List. You \ncall in, put your name on that list, and it says to telemarketers: You \nmay not call the names on that list.\n  So the list has been very successful, except the Federal Trade \nCommission did one very inexplicable and dumb thing. I guess that is a \ngentle description. They said of the people who call in and put their \nnames on a Do Not Call List, the list will expire at a certain time, so \nyou would have to call back in.\n  So we have had 149 million people call in. Think of this: 149 million \nAmericans picked up their phone and called their Federal Government and \nsaid: Put my name on a Do Not Call List. I am sick and tired of getting \ntelephone calls from telemarketers. I want my name on a list.\n  That is the biggest vote in American history, isn't it? They just \nvoted by picking up the phone. Mr. President, 149 million people voted \nto say: I do not want those calls anymore. Stop it. So the Federal \nTrade Commission put their names on a list. Then the Federal Trade \nCommission said: Oh, by the way, your name goes off the list at the end \nof 5 years. And by the way, next October, on or about the first day or \nso\n\n[[Page S12840]]\n\nof the month--or within a couple of days of that time--we will have \nabout 50 million people whose names come off the list.\n  That makes no sense to me. If you put your name on a list saying, ``I \ndon't want people making annoying calls to my house,'' that name ought \nto stay on the list. You ought not have to pick up the phone and recall \nthe Federal Trade Commission.\n  I do not know who made the decision but what a dumb decision. Let's \nput a list together. If you call and get your name on the list and say, \n``I don't want irritating, annoying calls from telemarketers,'' your \nname ought to stay on the list until you decide to pull it off.\n  So I have put in a piece of legislation that says if you put your \nname on a list, your name is going to stay on the list. You do not have \nto call in. There is not going to be an automatic expulsion. We did not \nprovide for that in the Congress. The Federal Trade Commission came up \nwith that goofy idea. So my legislation will say that idea is gone. If \nyour name is on a list, it stays on the list. You deserve to have \nsupper or dinner--or whatever you might call it at the end of the day--\nwithout having your phone ringing by somebody wanting to sell siding or \na new telephone service.\n  My hope is every Member of the Senate might cosponsor the \nlegislation--except for those Members of the Senate who love to get \ntelemarketing calls. For those who do, I expect they would not sign on, \nand I will probably come and announce their names soon. But if we can \nget all of those to cosponsor it, we can get this passed quickly and \nsolve a problem for all American families.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 SCHIP\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, to bring our colleagues up to date, we \nare working on the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations. Senator \nShelby and I are working to clear amendments now. All amendments have \nbeen filed. We have 60 of them, but we hope some can be cleared. For \nthose Senators who wish to have a vote on their amendment, I wish they \nwould consider offering the amendment and debating it this evening. I \ncertainly will be willing to stay for that.\n  While we are working on clearing these amendments, I rise to stand up \nfor my constituents, to stand up for a family in Baltimore who has been \nvilified by the rightwing bloggers because they dare to say that they \nbenefited from and support a public program called the Children's \nHealth Initiative.\n  I don't know what is happening in America now, where instead of \nworking to change policies, the right wing tries to change the subject, \nand they do it by attacking people rather than attacking the problem--\nthe problem of poverty, the problem that our children don't have health \ncare, the problem that one of my constituents, a little boy named \nDeamante Driver, died in Prince George's County because he didn't have \naccess to dental care and had a severe oral bacterial infection. My \ncolleague Senator Cardin has taken up the cudgels on that issue, and I \nsupport him. It is our Children's Health Initiative, and I will help to \noverride the veto.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what happened. I am taking up for a family \nnamed Bonnie and Halsey Frost who live in Baltimore. A few weeks ago \nthey stood here in the Congress to say that they benefitted from the \nSCHIP program. They told the story about how two of their children had \nbeen in a horrific accident.\n  Graeme, the boy who gave the Democratic radio address, spoke about \nwhat he needed. He had a brain injury. He was treated at Johns Hopkins \nHospital. So was his little sister. Graeme was in a coma for weeks. One \nof his vocal cords was paralyzed. One of his eyes continues to be \ndamaged. Gemma, his little sister, has suffered permanent injuries, \nwhich I will not go through. The families had their business spread all \nover the right wing blogs. I will not spread it all over the Senate \nfloor. But I want to take up for them, for the fact that when they \nstood up to talk about how they benefitted from this program, they were \nattacked because they weren't seen as worthy. The Frosts have four \nchildren: Graeme, who is 12; Max, Graeme's twin, who saw the accident; \nGemma, who also was in the accident; and an older brother named Zeke.\n  Bonnie and her children were in a car crash in 2004 when the SUV she \nwas driving had an accident. The children had these terrible problems. \nWho is the Frost family? Well, the Frost family is a family of six. \nThey live in Baltimore and they qualify under the Maryland SCHIP \nprogram, which says that if you have a family of this size and an \nincome under $51,000 a year, you qualify. They qualified. What \nhappened?\n  Through other friends of theirs who were involved with health \nadvocacy in the State, they were invited to come and tell their story \nto show why there is a compelling need for the Children's Health \nInitiative. Well, they did it. Then guess what happened. After young \nGraeme, who, along with his sister, had this terrible thing happen to \nthem--after they then spoke up and Graeme gave the Democratic radio \naddress, what followed was unbelievable. It was a firestorm against \nthem that went across the right wing bloggers. It\n\n[[Page S12841]]\n\nwas vitriolic, volcanic, ugly, nasty, shredding their names and \nreputations. You ought to talk to them about what they went through. \nThey could not believe they were in the United States of America. One \nof the right wingers showed up in the area where he has his business to \ndo on-the-spot investigative reporting. I wish we were as good at \nkeeping our borders safe as we are at keeping the boundaries around \nSCHIP. I wish we were as good at keeping an eye on terrorists. But, no, \nthey went after the Frost family.\n  Paul Krugman felt so outraged about it that he wrote a column in the \nNew York Times about it. He called it ``a teaching moment on politics \nand health care.'' He tells the story about this and then he said what \nhappened to this family should be a teaching moment.\n  I will read from this and then I will ask unanimous consent that it \nbe printed in the Record:\n\n        . . . The Frosts and their four children are exactly the \n     kind of people SCHIP was intended to help: working Americans \n     who can't afford private health insurance.\n       The parents have a combined income of about $45,000.\n\n  What they have is that the father is a self-employed woodworker and \nwelder. They bought a house in east Baltimore in a neighborhood that is \ngoing gentry, called Butchers' Hill. When they bought it, it was called \nButchers' Hill from years and years ago, when there were \nslaughterhouses where they were killing cows for beef and making \nsausage for the ethnic communities. But it took on another name about \nthe time they bought it. It was like a frontier town--riddled with \ndrugs and all kinds of problems--but they believed in Baltimore, they \nbelieved in their country, and they were willing to be urban pioneers, \nso they bought this home for a modest price. Now, we have been \nreclaiming Baltimore. Yes, the houses are selling at very high prices, \nbut that is not what they paid for it.\n  This man is self-employed. When he married, yes, they were from a \nprominent family. Their wedding announcement was in the New York Times. \nSince when does that mean anything? He has a small warehouse that \nprovides a modest rental income. His wife works part time at a medical \npublishing firm. They don't have health benefits.\n  To go on with what Krugman said, he said that soon after the radio \naddress, right wing bloggers began insisting that there is something \nwrong with the Frosts; that they have a house in a neighborhood they \nsaid is expensive. I can tell you that when they bought it, it was \ntruly Butchers' Hill. They have two children in private school, but \nthey were on scholarship. Nobody bothered to find that out. The right \nwing bloggers made unfounded accusations against them all of the time. \nIt was led by a woman who, according to the technocrats, is the most \ntrafficked right wing blog on the Internet.\n  This tone of vitriol and viciousness has to stop. The attack on this \nfamily was picked up by Rush Limbaugh, the same guy calling dissident \nmilitary people ``microphone marines.'' And then the smear went on with \nthat. At the same time this was going on, a CNN report suggested that \nthe Democrats made a tactical error because we had this family on.\n  I don't know what we are doing here. Again, we are attacking a family \nwhen we should be attacking the problems of children's health. First, I \ncalled the Frost family. I listened to what they have had to endure \nbecause they didn't have health insurance, after what happened to their \nchildren after this terrible accident and the recovery. Then I listened \nto what they had to endure because they spoke up for the Children's \nHealth Initiative.\n  When I listened to them, I said to them I think the Senate owed them \nan apology that we now have come to this point. Now, I have watched \ngood people be attacked by the right wing. The other day, we sanctioned \nMoveOn.org because of what they did to General Petraeus. I voted for \nthat sanction. What about my Frost family? Should we have a sense of \nthe Senate on that? I don't know if I am going to put this family \nthrough more. But I will tell you this: I think we have to start \nchanging the tone. We have to start changing the tone in our \ninstitution to work on a bipartisan basis the way the Senator from \nAlabama and I have. We are moving forward a solid bill that promotes \nscientific research, keeps America's space program going, but equally \nwe are funding local law enforcement.\n  Can we not change the tone? Do we always have to attack each other? \nDo we have to be so violent in our language, so vicious, so vitriolic? \nI don't think so. I think our country has to get back to the basics, \nwhere you can disagree without being disagreeable, where you focus on \nthe policies, not on the person, where you try to deal with issues and \nyou don't attack people for the simple reason that they have spoken up \nand they have spoken out.\n  I think we need to take a timeout in this country. I respect free \nspeech, I respect the bloggers and what they have; but when there is a \ndeliberate attempt from either the right or the left to go after people \nsimply because they have spoken up, I think it is the wrong direction. \nI think we have been heading in the wrong direction.\n  I wanted to bring to everyone's attention what happened to this \nfamily. I ask unanimous consent that the Krugman article be printed in \nthe Record and that the David Herszenhorn article about what happened \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Sliming Graeme Frost\n\n                           (By Paul Krugman)\n\n       Two weeks ago, the Democratic response to President Bush's \n     weekly radio address was delivered by a 12-year-old, Graeme \n     Frost. Graeme, who along with his sister received severe \n     brain injuries in a 2004 car crash and continues to need \n     physical therapy, is a beneficiary of the State Children's \n     Health Insurance Program. Mr. Bush has vetoed a bipartisan \n     bill that would have expanded that program to cover millions \n     of children who would otherwise have been uninsured.\n       What followed should serve as a teaching moment.\n       First, some background. The Frosts and their four children \n     are exactly the kind of people S-chip was intended to help: \n     working Americans who can't afford private health insurance.\n       The parents have a combined income of about $45,000, and \n     don't receive health insurance from employers. When they \n     looked into buying insurance on their own before the \n     accident, they found that it would cost $1,200 a month--a \n     prohibitive sum given their income. After the accident, when \n     their children needed expensive care, they couldn't get \n     insurance at any price.\n       Fortunately, they received help from Maryland's S-chip \n     program. The state has relatively restrictive rules for \n     eligibility: children must come from a family with an income \n     under 200 percent of the poverty line. For families with four \n     children that's $55,220, so the Frosts clearly qualified.\n       Graeme Frost, then, is exactly the kind of child the \n     program is intended to help. But that didn't stop the right \n     from mounting an all-out smear campaign against him and his \n     family.\n       Soon after the radio address, right-wing bloggers began \n     insisting that the Frosts must be affluent because Graeme and \n     his sister attend private schools (they're on scholarship), \n     because they have a house in a neighborhood where some houses \n     are now expensive (the Frosts bought their house for $55,000 \n     in 1990 when the neighborhood was rundown and considered \n     dangerous) and because Mr. Frost owns a business (it was \n     dissolved in 1999).\n       You might be tempted to say that bloggers make unfounded \n     accusations all the time. But we're not talking about some \n     obscure fringe. The charge was led by Michelle Malkin, who \n     according to Technorati has the most-trafficked right-wing \n     blog on the Internet, and in addition to blogging has a \n     nationally syndicated column, writes for National Review and \n     is a frequent guest on Fox News.\n       The attack on Graeme's family was also quickly picked up by \n     Rush Limbaugh, who is so important a player in the right-wing \n     universe that he has had multiple exclusive interviews with \n     Vice President Dick Cheney.\n       And G.O.P. politicians were eager to join in the smear. The \n     New York Times reported that Republicans in Congress ``were \n     gearing up to use Graeme as evidence that Democrats have \n     overexpanded the health program to include families wealthy \n     enough to afford private insurance'' but had ``backed off'' \n     as the case fell apart.\n       In fact, however, Republicans had already made their first \n     move: an e-mail message from the office of Mitch McConnell, \n     the Senate minority leader, sent to reporters and obtained by \n     the Web site Think Progress, repeated the smears against the \n     Frosts and asked: ``Could the Dems really have done that bad \n     of a job vetting this family?''\n       And the attempt to spin the media worked, to some extent: \n     despite reporting that has thoroughly debunked the smears, a \n     CNN report yesterday suggested that the Democrats had made \n     ``a tactical error in holding up Graeme as their poster \n     child,'' and closely echoed the language of the e-mail from \n     Mr. McConnell's office.\n       All in all, the Graeme Frost case is a perfect illustration \n     of the modern right-wing political machine at work, and in \n     particular\n\n[[Page S12842]]\n\n     its routine reliance on character assassination in place of \n     honest debate. If service members oppose a Republican war, \n     they're ``phony soldiers''; if Michael J. Fox opposes Bush \n     policy on stem cells, he's faking his Parkinson's symptoms; \n     if an injured 12-year-old child makes the case for a \n     government health insurance program, he's a fraud.\n       Meanwhile, leading conservative politicians far from trying \n     to distance themselves from these smears, rush to embrace \n     them. And some people in the news media are still willing to \n     be used as patsies.\n       Politics aside, the Graeme Frost case demonstrates the true \n     depth of the health care crisis: every other advanced country \n     has universal health insurance, but in America, insurance is \n     now out of reach for many hard-working families, even if they \n     have incomes some might call middle-class.\n       And there's one more point that should not be forgotten: \n     ultimately, this isn't about the Frost parents. It's about \n     Graeme Frost and his sister.\n       I don't know about you, but I think American children who \n     need medical care should get it, period. Even if you think \n     adults have made bad choices--a baseless smear in the case of \n     the Frosts, but put that on one side--only a truly vicious \n     political movement would respond by punishing their injured \n     children.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Capitol Feud: A 12-Year-Old Is the Fodder\n\n                       (By David M. Herszenhorn)\n\n       Washington, Oct. 9.--There have been moments when the fight \n     between Congressional Democrats and President Bush over the \n     State Children's Health Insurance Program has seemed to \n     devolve into a shouting match about who loves children more.\n       So when Democrats enlisted 12-year-old Graeme Frost, who \n     along with a younger sister relied on the program for \n     treatment of severe brain injuries suffered in a car crash, \n     to give the response to Mr. Bush's weekly radio address \n     earlier this month, Republican opponents quickly accused them \n     of exploiting the boy to score political points.\n       Then, they wasted little time in going after him to score \n     their own.\n       In recent days, Graeme and his family have been attacked by \n     conservative bloggers and other critics of the Democrats' \n     plan to expand the insurance program, known as S-chip. They \n     scrutinized the family's income and assets--even alleged the \n     counters in their kitchen to be granite--and declared that \n     they did not seem needy enough for government benefits.\n       But what on the surface appears to be yet another partisan \n     feud, all the nastier because a child is at the center of it, \n     actually cuts to the most substantive debate around S-chip. \n     Democrats say it is crucially needed to help the working \n     poor--Medicaid already helps the impoverished--but many \n     Republicans say it now helps too many people with the means \n     to help themselves.\n       The feud also illustrates what can happen when politicians \n     showcase real people to make a point, a popular but often \n     perilous technique. And in this case, the discourse has been \n     anything but polite. The critics accused Graeme's father, \n     Halsey, a self-employed woodworker, of choosing not to \n     provide insurance for his family of six, even though he owned \n     his own business. They pointed out that Graeme attends an \n     expensive private school. And they asserted that the family's \n     home had undergone extensive remodeling, and asserted that \n     its market value could exceed $400,000.\n       One critic, in an e-mail message to Graeme's mother, \n     Bonnie, warned: ``Lie down with dogs, and expect to get \n     fleas.'' As it turns out, the Frosts say, Graeme attends the \n     private school on scholarship. The business that the critics \n     said Mr. Frost owned was dissolved in 1999. The family's \n     home, in the modest Butchers Hill neighborhood of Baltimore, \n     was bought for $55,000 in 1990 and is now worth about \n     $260,000, according to public records. And, for the record, \n     the Frosts say, their kitchen counters are concrete.\n       Certainly the Frosts are not destitute. They also own a \n     commercial property, valued at about $160,000, that provides \n     rental income. Mr. Frost works intermittently in woodworking \n     and as a welder, while Mrs. Frost has a part-time \n     administrative job at a firm that provides services to \n     publishers of medical journals. Her job does not provide \n     health coverage.\n       Under the Maryland child health program, a family of six \n     must earn less than $55,220 a year for children to qualify. \n     The program does not require applicants to list their assets, \n     which do not affect eligibility.\n       In a telephone interview, the Frosts said they had recently \n     been rejected by three private insurance companies because of \n     pre-existing medical conditions. ``We stood up in the first \n     place because S-chip really helped our family and we wanted \n     to help other families,'' Mrs. Frost said.\n       ``We work hard, we're honest, we pay our taxes,'' Mr. Frost \n     said, adding, ``There are hard-working families that really \n     need affordable health insurance.''\n       Democrats, including the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, have \n     risen to the Frosts' defense, saying they earn about $45,000 \n     a year and are precisely the type of working-poor Americans \n     that the program was intended to help.\n       Ms. Pelosi on Tuesday said, ``I think it's really a sad \n     statement about how bankrupt some of these people are in \n     their arguments against S-chip that they would attack a 12-\n     year-old boy.'' The House and Senate approved legislation \n     that would expand the child health program by $35 billion \n     over five years. President Bush, who proposed a more modest \n     increase, vetoed the bill last week. Mr. Bush said the \n     Democrats' plan is fiscally unsound; the Democrats say Mr. \n     Bush is willing to spend billions on the Iraq war but not on \n     health care for American children.\n       Republicans on Capitol Hill, who were gearing up to use \n     Graeme as evidence that Democrats have overexpanded the \n     health program to include families wealthy enough to afford \n     private insurance, have backed off, glad to let bloggers take \n     the heat for attacking a family with injured children.\n       An aide to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the \n     Republican leader, expressed relief that his office had not \n     issued a press release criticizing the Frosts.\n       But Michelle Malkin, one of the bloggers who has levied \n     harsh criticism against the Frost family, insisted that \n     Republicans should hold their ground and not pull punches. \n     ``The bottom line here is that this family has considerable \n     assets,'' Ms. Malkin wrote in an e-mail message. ``Maryland's \n     S-CHIP program does not means-test. The refusal to do assets \n     tests on federal health insurance programs is why federal \n     entitlements are exploding and government keeps expanding. If \n     Republicans don't have the guts to hold the line, they \n     deserve to lose their seats.''\n       As for charges that bloggers were unfairly attacking a 12-\n     year-old, Ms. Malkin wrote on her blog. ``If you don't want \n     questions, don't foist these children onto the public \n     stage.''\n       But Mr. and Mrs. Frost said they were bothered by the \n     assertion that they lacked health coverage by their own \n     choice. ``That is not true at all,'' Mrs. Frost said. \n     ``Basically all these naysayers need to lay the facts out on \n     the page, and say `How could a family be able to do this?' S-\n     chip is a stopgap.''\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, they speak more eloquently about it than \nI have been able to. I felt badly about what happened to the Frost \nfamily. I hope we can focus on dealing with the Children's Health \nInitiative. It is for protecting all of the children. Today I stand up \nhere for the Frost family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to speak on the pending bill before \nthe Senate for a few minutes.\n  This is the second day of consideration of the fiscal year 2008 \nCommerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill. This bill funds the \nDepartments of Commerce and Justice, NASA, and the National Science \nFoundation. Given the extremely diverse subject matters contained \nwithin this bill's jurisdiction, we must entertain a wide range of \namendments on the Senate floor. This has been true in the past and is \ntrue again this year.\n  Chairwoman Mikulski and I are currently reviewing a substantial list \nof amendments and are working with various Members and staffs to \ndetermine appropriate resolutions to the list of amendments. I ask \nMembers to come to the floor to discuss with the chairwoman and myself \nyour concerns so we can move this critical funding bill forward.\n  We hope and expect to finish this bill no later than mid-day \ntomorrow, but to accomplish this we will need every Senator's help.\n  It is Monday afternoon and we can move some things tonight and get \nthis bill moved tomorrow with the help of a lot of our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment that has been filed. \nI will call it up so it can be considered at the appropriate time. I \ngather that to do that I must ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment, and I do so now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3208\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, this amendment would ensure that \ncommunities throughout Indian country have the resources they need to \nfight the meth epidemic.\n  The amendment is based on a bipartisan bill I introduced along with \nSenator Smith entitled the Native American Methamphetamine and \nTreatment Act of 2007. It would ensure that Native American communities \nare able to access essential Federal funding to fight the use of \nmethamphetamines.\n  Senators Dorgan, Cantwell, Feingold, Salazar, and Baucus are also \ncosponsors of this amendment.\n  This last March, after hearings were held in the House Judiciary \nCommittee and the Energy and Commerce Committee, the House of \nRepresentatives overwhelmingly passed this legislation by a vote of 423 \nto 0.\n  We all know that Indian country has been hard hit by the use of meth. \nOver 70 percent of Indian tribes surveyed by the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs identified meth abuse as the greatest threat to their \ncommunities, and about 40 percent of violent crime cases investigated \nin Indian country involve meth in some capacity.\n  According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services, or \nSAMHSA, American Indians, Alaskan natives, and native Hawaiians have \nthe highest rate of meth abuse of any ethnic group in our country. \nUnfortunately, when Congress passed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic \nAct, tribes were unintentionally left out as eligible applicants under \nsome of the newly authorized grant programs. They were left out of the \nDepartment of Justice Hot Spots Program, which helps local law \nenforcement agencies obtain the tools they need to reduce the \nproduction, distribution, and use of meth and to clean up meth labs, \nsupport health and environmental agencies, and purchase equipment and \nsupport systems. The Combat Meth Act authorized $99 million in new \nfunding under this program.\n\n  Tribes were also left out of the Drug Endangered Children Grant \nProgram, which helps children who live in a home in which meth has been \nused or manufactured or sold. Under this program, law enforcement \nagencies and prosecutors, child protective services, social services, \nand health care services work together to ensure that these children \nget the help they need. The act authorized $20 million for this \nprogram.\n  I can see absolutely no reason Native-American communities that are \nstruggling to contain the meth epidemic should be denied the resources \nnecessary to address the problem, and to this end I hope my colleagues \nwill agree with me and support this important amendment when the time \ncomes for its important consideration.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to say to my colleague from New \nMexico that we agree with him on the amendment. Certainly there are \nchallenges facing the West. We see the scourge of meth, and that is one \nof the largest areas of requests we have for congressionally designated \nprojects. I know my colleague wants them to be eligible for grants and \nto compete for them, and so we support the intent.\n  Right now, there is an objection from two Senators, and we also \nunderstand that the Senator from Arizona would like to have further \nconversations with my colleague about the possibility of a \nmodification. If you could have that conversation and see if we can \ncome back, we could either move to a vote or see if it could be \naccepted.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, I thank the manager of the bill, \nmy colleague from Maryland, and respond that, yes, I am anxious to deal \nwith any concern any Senator has, and I have spoken to the Senator from \nArizona about his concerns and have tried to accommodate them. To date, \nwe have not been able to get his agreement to an accommodation that has \nbeen suggested. So I just want to be sure we have reserved the right to \nhave a vote on the amendment if we are still not able to get agreement.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I think the Senator has our word that he will have--Mr. \nPresident, what is the parliamentary mechanism to reserving the right \nto a vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no particular order.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would say to the Senator from New Mexico that he has \nour word that if he can work it out, we will see whether we can take \nit, and if not, we will have the vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I very much appreciate that assurance. \nAs I say, I hope very much we can get language that is acceptable to \nthe Senator from Arizona. If not, I think we can allow the Senate to \nwork its will, and hopefully the amendment will pass.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would further like to say to the Senator from New \nMexico, in keeping with what my colleague from Alabama said, we would \nlike to finish this bill before the caucuses tomorrow. So I will \ndiscuss this with the Senator from Alabama, but it would be our \nintention to see how much we can get cleared and then have some stacked \nvotes tomorrow morning. So if the Senator from New Mexico could let us \nknow by tomorrow morning--say, 9:30--whether he has been able to reach \nan accommodation--or this evening--we will be here and would welcome \nthat.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate that, and I am glad to \nadvise the Senator if we reach an accommodation. I think, for purposes \nof ensuring a vote, if there is a group of stacked votes scheduled for \ntomorrow, if this\n\n[[Page S12844]]\n\ncan be included in that list, and then, of course, if agreement is \nreached prior to the time of the vote, we could delete it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator has our word on that.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my colleague, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are working very well, here again on \na bipartisan basis. I thank Senator Shelby and his staff for the way we \nare working. We have been able to look at a variety of amendments \ncolleagues have offered, and we are ready to accept them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be laid \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3309\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I now call up amendment No. 3309 offered by myself and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to raise my voice \nin strong support of H.R. 3093, the Commerce, Justice, Science \nAppropriations Act of 2007. I wish to thank and congratulate Chairwoman \nMikulski and Ranking Member Shelby, Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member \nCochran for their strong leadership on this bill.\n  As a former attorney general for Colorado, I am particularly proud of \nthe investment that this bill will make in the local, State, and \nFederal law enforcement agencies across our country, the more than \n800,000 officers who patrol America's streets and put their lives on \nthe line every day to help make our communities safe and secure. They \nare truly the frontlines of America's homeland security.\n  In my 6 years as attorney general of Colorado, and in the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears as a Senator, I have traveled thousands of miles through my State \nto visit with county sheriffs, police chiefs, and law enforcement \nofficers working in our small towns, rural counties, and big cities. \nThey are public servants through and through. They know that security \nis the foundation of a free society. They know that to enjoy our \nliberties and a prosperous economy, Americans must live in a society \ngoverned by the rule of law, free from the threat of violence and \nsecure in their place of residence.\n  It is the voices of these men and women in uniform across our \ncountry, America's peace officers, that should help guide our law \nenforcement efforts in this country. They should help us make sure we \nare prepared to meet the emergency we will confront and that will help \nus address the domestic security priorities we face in the Nation. We \nshould therefore take notice when sheriffs and police officers tell us \nthey do not have the resources they need to combat the scourge of meth \nthat is devastating so many communities across our Nation.\n  Meth is tearing families apart and financing an underground economy \nin abandoned farm buildings, fire traps, and houses that are shrouded \nwith plastic. When police go to raid a lab, they never know what they \nare going to find; whether it is going to be a drug armed to the teeth, \nwhether it is going to be chemicals that are ready to burn and to \nexplode or drug users who are in desperate need of medical attention.\n  In my State, on a raid on a meth lab in Aurora, CO, this past summer, \npolice found a 2-year-old boy lying in the basement next to a highly \ntoxic cocktail of chemicals. The police rescued him. But what his \nparents were doing or thinking one can only imagine. Stories such as \nthis story have been too common across our country.\n  We should also take notice when people such as the U.S. attorney in \nColorado, Troy Eid, tell us we do not have enough Federal law \nenforcement officers to serve Native American communities in \nsouthwestern Colorado. Last year, we had a total of five Bureau of \nIndian Affairs officers policing 600,000 acres in one corner of my \nState. This is astonishing--five Bureau of Indian Affairs officers \npolicing 600,000 acres.\n  Criminals, in fact, were calling in false crime reports on one side \nof the reservation, drawing police away from their target they were \naiming to hit on the other side of the reservation.\n  With this shortage of law enforcement, the murder rate on the Ute \nMountain Ute and Southern Ute reservations in Southwestern Colorado has \nclimbed to almost 20 percent of the national average. We need to take \nnotice when people such as recently retired Sheriff Liggett, of Mineral \nCounty, CO, tell us our communications equipment in rural communities \nis woefully inadequate.\n  I have known Sheriff Liggett for many years. On snowy nights, Sheriff \nLiggett would call ahead and make sure that I and other travelers made \nit safely over Slumgullion Pass or Wolf Creek Pass on our way to our \ndestinations.\n  That is the way things are done in rural Colorado. Sheriff Liggett \nknows very well the boundaries of his department's communications \ncoverage and the risks that the limitations of that coverage pose to \nresidents and travelers.\n  The Mineral County Sheriff's Department, similar to so many rural \nsheriffs' departments, need broader communications coverage and a \nbetter ability to talk across agencies and jurisdictions in case an \nemergency arises.\n  In late 1990, we made some progress in helping bring safety and \nsecurity to American's communities. The Federal Government, seeing the \nhomicide rate on the rise, responded to the public's\n\n[[Page S12848]]\n\ncall for a crackdown on crime by making smarter investment in law \nenforcement and crime prevention. These investments paid off, with \nviolent crime in the United States dropping by nearly 40 percent from \nthe record highs of the early 1990s.\n  Unfortunately, these investments have lagged in recent years, and the \nadministration has tried to cut key programs at the very moment, at the \nvery moment that our law enforcement officers are facing a set of \ngrowing challenges from homeland security and emergency preparedness to \ncombating meth, to all of the other issues that the 800,000 men and \nwomen who keep the security in our country face every day.\n  I know this administration has been focused on Iraq and that this has \nconsumed a massive proportion of Federal spending; almost $750 billion \nin the last 4\\1/2\\ years. But this focus on Iraq and our security \nobjectives abroad should not come at the expense of American security \nright here at home in our United States.\n  Too many Americans live with fear of drug-related violence in their \ncommunities. Too many Americans have seen meth destroy the lives of a \nfamily member or of a neighbor. Too many Americans worry that when a \ndisaster strikes, the way it did with Katrina, help will come but help \nwill not come quickly enough.\n  This bill, which the chairperson from Maryland and Ranking Member \nShelby have put together, resets our priorities to where they should \nbe, on the safety and security of America's families. For that I thank \nand applaud the leadership of Senator Mikulski.\n  The Appropriations Committee has reported a bill that restores \ncritical investments on law enforcement that this President had \nproposed to cut. I wish to briefly talk about a few of those provisions \nthat will benefit the peace officers of my State of Colorado.\n  First, I am pleased the bill we are considering today includes $1.4 \nbillion for State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance, including $660 \nmillion for the Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants and $190 \nmillion for Byrne discretionary grants.\n\n  This program, which the President had--beyond my understanding--\nproposed to eliminate, provides grants to State and local governments \nfor law enforcement, for prosecution and court programs, for prevention \nand community education programs, drug treatment, and community \ncorrections programs. These are the kinds of programs that the men and \nwomen in law enforcement in this country know do, in fact, work to make \nour communities safe.\n  Secondly, this bill includes $550 million for the Community Oriented \nPolicing Services, known as COPS. These funds go to tribal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement agencies for community policing initiatives which \nput law enforcement professionals on the streets with a beat so they \ncan build relationships with the people they serve and they protect.\n  By earning the trust of the members of their communities and making \nthese individuals stakeholders in their own safety, community policing \nmakes law enforcement safer and more efficient. Some of the COPS \nProgram funds that are set forth in this bill will go directly to the \ndrug task forces that have been operational and effective in my State \nof Colorado. They include: The San Luis Valley Drug Task Force, my \nnative valley; they include the 22nd Judicial District Drug Task Force, \nthe North Metro Task Force, the Delta/Montrose Drug Task Force, the \nEagle County Drug Task Force, the Greater Routt and Moffatt Narcotics \nEnforcement Team, the Weld County Drug Task Force.\n  Rest assured that from my point of view as a former attorney general \nof the State of Colorado, I know these task forces are at the point of \nthe spear in combating the scourge of drugs in my State of Colorado, \nand these important funds will allow us to keep up that fight.\n  Finally, I am pleased this bill provides $5.6 billion for the Bureau \nof Prisons to help curb the staff shortages, construction needs and \noperations budgets for the Federal prison system.\n  The correctional officers who handle some of the most dangerous \ncriminals in America will tell you the funding levels over the past few \nyears have been inadequate.\n  At the Supermax Prison in Florence, CO, which houses inmates such as \nTed Kaczynski, al-Qaida terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui, and the shoe \nbomber, Richard Reid, at that Supermax facility, where we house the \nmost dangerous of the most dangerous of America's enemies, funding cuts \nhave left them short staffed and short on beds.\n  At the prison that houses terrorists, gang leaders and the most \nviolent members of society, this is a dangerous game that we cannot \nafford, and this legislation moves forward in a way to address those \nshortfalls.\n  I am not going to take time to go through all the other good that is \nincluded in this bill, but I would mention very briefly the $340 \nmillion this bill provides to the juvenile justice program and the \ninvestment this bill makes in all our Federal law enforcement agencies \nsuch as the DEA, the FBI, and the ATF.\n  When you look at these investments, you begin to understand how \nimportant this bill is to our Nation's law enforcement authority. \nAnyone who has worked or who works in law enforcement today and who \ntakes the time to look at this bill, will understand this is a strong \nstatement of support for peace officers and for protecting our public \nacross the country. That is why I am perplexed that there is a veto \nthreat by the President on this bill.\n  There should not be that veto threat because this is a bill that \ntakes a strong position to secure Americans here in the homeland. I \nhope that as this bill makes it through the Congressional process and \nto the President's desk, President Bush will decide he is going to \nstand up for the Nation's law enforcement and for the security here in \nthe homeland and will, in fact, sign this bill.\n  I end where I began. This is a very good bipartisan product that \nSenator Mikulski and Ranking Member Shelby have put together for the \nconsideration of this Chamber. I am proud to be a supporter of this \nbill. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator from Colorado yield for a question?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I will.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator for his comments about our bill \nthat were so complimentary and for speaking out. As a former attorney \ngeneral of the State of Colorado, who is essentially the top cop in \nColorado, knows one of the hallmarks of good law enforcement is strong \nlaw enforcement opportunities, along with prevention in terms of \nintervening with our young people. But is the Senator aware why this \nbill is under a veto threat?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I have understood that the President has said he doesn't \nlike the funding levels in this bill which I interpret to mean that he \ndoesn't support funding of these very important programs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator is exactly right. We face a veto threat not \nbecause we have done bad legislation but because we have done good \nfunding.\n  Is the Senator aware that the legislation called for the elimination \nof the COPS Program?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I am aware that the President has \ncalled for elimination of the COPS Program. I am also aware that when I \nspeak to the law enforcement community throughout the country and \nthroughout my State, sheriffs and chiefs of police across the board say \nthe COPS Program is, in fact, working, and when we see what happened \nwith the dip in violent crime in the 1990s, it occurred precisely \nbecause we had programs such as the COPS Program which were very \neffective.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. So then it is the belief of the Senator that our \naddition of over $500 million to guard the streets and neighborhoods \nand communities of America will be well spent?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I can think of no more important priority for all of us. \nAs we deal with issues of crime and violence and the rule of law in \nplaces far away such as Iraq and Afghanistan, it ought to be an \nimportant priority, a high priority for us to make sure we are \nenforcing the rule of law and providing security for Americans at home; \nthat we take care of the homeland first.\n  I strongly agree with the Senator from Maryland that, in fact, this \nbill moves us in that direction.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Colorado. I appreciate his \ncomments and support.\n\n[[Page S12849]]\n\n  Madam President, by way of information for our colleagues, when we \ntalk about the COPS Program, one might recall, as the Senator from \nColorado said, violent crime really skyrocketed in the mid-1990s. \nPresident Clinton, working then with our colleague who continues to be \nin the Senate, Senator Joe Biden, a leader on the Judiciary Committee, \ncame up with the COPS Program. During the Clinton administration, from \n1993 to 1998, they put 118,000 extra police officers on the streets of \nAmerica. They were in 13,000 communities, and violent crime dropped 10 \npercent. Cops do make a difference. We are concerned that by \neliminating the COPS Program, the thin blue line that protects us in \nour communities is even getting smaller. So working on a bipartisan \nbasis within the Senate, we have added over $500 million to restore \nthat COPS Program; not that we micromanage from the national level, but \nwe empower the local communities to apply for these grants and deploy \nwhere they know best to protect their citizens.\n  We think we have a great bill. We want to move it along. We thank the \nSenator for the kind words. Now our colleagues can help us not only \nwith words but with deeds, which is, if they have an amendment, offer \nit or send their staff to either see if we can modify it or have it \nwithdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2360\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of amendment No. 2360 offered by the Senator from \nOhio, Mr. Brown. There will be 30 minutes of debate equally divided \nbetween the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Maryland, Ms. \nMikulski, or their designees, prior to a vote in relation to the \namendment.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I begin my thanking Senator Mikulski and \nSenator Shelby, as well as Senators Baucus and Grassley, for their \nsupport of this amendment. The amendment is cosponsored by Senators \nStabenow, Byrd, Rockefeller, and Levin. I should note that the Finance \nCommittee chair has drafted a bill to boost trade enforcement. I look \nforward to working on that very important piece of legislation.\n  This amendment will help America's manufacturers compete on even \nterms with foreign manufacturers. For generations American \nmanufacturing has been a tremendous source of pride and work for our \nwhole country. Especially for working families, it has been a ladder to \nthe middle class. American manufacturing fuels our economy and supplies \nour national defense infrastructure. It would be dangerous on many \nlevels for our country to ignore the anticompetitive forces that are \nbuffeting every day our manufacturing sector. In the State of Michigan, \nin Ohio, across the Midwest, throughout the country, it would be and is \ndangerous to ignore that.\n  Over the last several years, U.S. manufacturing has faltered. \nMillions of good jobs have been lost. In my State of Ohio, from Toledo \nto Gallipolis, from Ashtabula to Middletown, well over 200,000 \nmanufacturing jobs have disappeared in the last 6 years.\n  American industry, we know, can compete with anyone in the world when \nit is a fair fight. Our international trade laws are intended to secure \na level playing field. Unfortunately, some of our trading partners have \nrepeatedly found ways to circumvent these laws to gain an unfair \nadvantage against our workers and our companies. This has led to \nrecord-breaking trade deficits--some $800 billion in 2006--which \nthreaten the long-term health of our economy and massive job losses \nwhich have wreaked havoc on the middle class. Foreign governments have \nunfairly and illegally doled out massive subsidies to their own \ncompanies and others willing to reestablish offshore, contributing to \nthe migration of manufacturing jobs overseas and artificial price \nadvantages for imported products. Despite ample evidence that something \nis very wrong--when I first ran for Congress in 1992, the U.S. \nmultilateral trade deficit was $38 billion. Last year it was literally \nmore than 20 times that, and we can look at job loss figures, the trade \ndeficit, outsourcing figures, offshoring figures--the Bush \nadministration needs to aggressively enforce American trade law.\n  Recent WTO decisions threaten to create enormous loopholes in trade \nlaw enforcement. This affects industries and local economies throughout \nthe country. We know about steel. We know about paper. But it affects \nall American manufacturing. That is why we need to be more aggressive \nin enforcement of the trade laws. If the WTO continues to target U.S. \ntrade remedy laws, we in this Chamber need to fight back. This \namendment is a modest reminder to the administration that we need to \nvigorously enforce our trade laws.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee for their \nsupport. I ask my colleagues for their support.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I stand here with my colleague from \nAlabama to tell all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle it is \nthe intention of Senator Shelby and myself to finish this bill \ntomorrow. We have some amendments that have been filed, and yet we do \nnot know what the intent is of the Senators who have filed such \namendments. We are going to be voting very shortly--in a matter of \nminutes--and we would like every Senator who has filed an amendment to \ncome and tell us what their intent is. Do they intend to offer it? When \ndo they intend to offer it? Or do they wish to seek another \naccommodation?\n  We would like to present to the leaders on both sides of the aisle--\nthe majority leader and the Republican leader--a finite list tonight \nbefore Senator Shelby and I go home so we can have the finite list for \ntomorrow and assiduously, earnestly, thoroughly work through these \namendments. But we must know the intent of the Senators.\n  I believe there is an old-fashioned saying: It is now time to fish or \ncut bait. We would prefer Senators actually cut their bait. But being \nan old Maryland fisherwoman myself, we want to talk to our colleagues. \nTalk to us during this vote. Senator Shelby is at his desk. I will be \nat mine. Let's talk things over and see how we can move this bill and \nmake America proud of us. Too often when all is said and done, too much \ngets said and nothing gets done.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I join with Senator Mikulski. She is \ntelling our colleagues--and I join with her--that we have accepted and \nare working through a lot of amendments on both sides of the aisle. \nThere are a number of amendments that have been filed. We, as she \npointed out, need to know if people are going to insist on amendments \nor if there is some way we can accommodate Senators, if they would come \nto the floor and meet with us, because in a few minutes we are going to \nvote. The leaders will be on the floor and they are going to want a \nreport from us as to what is pending, because tomorrow we want to move \nthis bill. This is a very important bill, as the Presiding Officer \nknows. We need to move on with it and not delay it more. We are back \nnow in a new week and I think we can make some progress. If my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will meet with us and tell us if \nthey want a vote, we will debate it and vote. If they want to see if we \ncan work out something with them, we will do that. But it is our \nintention again to move this bill tomorrow.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 3260, as modified, offered by the Senator \nfrom Ohio, Mr. Brown.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3277\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside any \npending amendment or business so that the Vitter amendment, No. 3277, \nmay be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter], for himself, Mr. \n     Sessions and Mr. DeMint, proposes amendment numbered 3277.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with \nthe reading of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit funds from being used in contravention of section \n 642(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility \n                              Act of 1996)\n\n       On page 70, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec. 217.  None of the amounts made available in this title \n     under the heading ``community oriented policing services'' \n     may be used in contravention of section 642(a) of the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n     (8 U.S.C. 1373(a)).\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this is amendment No. 3277, and it is very \nsimple and straightforward and, I believe, very needed. The amendment \nwould simply prohibit COPS funding, which is governed under this bill, \nfrom going to so-called sanctuary cities. In doing so, it would do \nnothing more than to enforce current Federal law.\n  Mr. President, as you know, in 1996, Congress passed the Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. In that 1996 \nlegislation, which is current law, there is a very clear section on \nsanctuary city policy. It is section 642(a), and it states in clear \nunmistakable terms:\n\n       Federal, State or local government entity or official may \n     not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity \n     or official from sending to, or receiving from, the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding \n     the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of \n     any individual.\n\n  Mr. President, the idea behind that policy is very simple. Law \nenforcement around the country should be free to cooperate with Federal \nauthorities regarding immigration, regarding immigration enforcement, \nand no State or local government should be able to contradict Federal \nlaw by establishing a State or local law which bars this sort of \ncommonsense cooperation. Unfortunately, that is exactly what several \nlocal jurisdictions and at least two States on a statewide basis have \ndone. They have established, by State law, by local law, by local \nordinance, so-called sanctuary policies absolutely prohibiting law \nenforcement and other public personnel in their jurisdiction from \nworking with or cooperating with Federal authorities with regard to \nimmigration enforcement.\n  This is by no means the majority policy of jurisdictions around the \ncountry. Far from it, Mr. President, because I think a clear \noverwhelming majority of the American people and their State and local \nelected officials support commonsense cooperation with the Federal \nGovernment in enforcing our laws. But it is a very significant trend, a \nvery significant happening around the country. Many local jurisdictions \nand at least two States have adopted this very conscious and very \nboldly proclaimed policy, calling themselves sanctuary cities, or \nsanctuary jurisdictions.\n  My amendment would simply prohibit COPS funding from going to these \njurisdictions. It would say this is our Federal law, and that States, \nthat localities must cooperate with Federal immigration officials. And \nif they are not going to do that, if they are going to pass laws \nclearly in contravention, 180 degrees opposed to Federal law, then they \nwill not get COPS funding under this bill.\n  Again, Mr. President, it couldn't be simpler. It couldn't be more \nstraightforward--COPS money, COPS funds, will not go to sanctuary \ncities, so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, if my amendment passes. And, \nagain, this is doing nothing more than enforcing present Federal law, a \npolicy or law that has been on the books for over 10 years. So why \nshouldn't we put some meaningful teeth in that Federal law and prevent \nthese local and State jurisdictions from simply flaunting Federal law \nand not abiding by Federal law?\n  I would note that the House of Representatives has already acted on \nthis issue in the companion bill to this CJS appropriations bill. In \nthe House bill, a similar amendment to mine passed by voice vote. \nHaving said that, I would hope that a huge majority of the Senate \nsimilarly votes to pass this Vitter amendment, to adopt it, and to put \nit on the CJS appropriations bill.\n  This is common sense. It does nothing more than enforce current \nFederal policy and Federal law. It is clearly the sort of commonsense, \nstraightforward legislation that a huge majority of the American people \nsupport. I know there will be a vote on this sometime tomorrow, Mr. \nPresident, so I urge all my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to \njoin with the huge majority of the American people behind this \nreasonable and commonsense policy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the Vitter \namendment. I don't believe it is common sense, I don't believe it is \nreasonable, and I want to lay out the reasons.\n  This body has, during the immigration debate, actually acted on a \nvery similar amendment and defeated it. And the reason this body was \nwise enough to defeat it was because they understood that some of the \ntoughest law enforcement officials in our country, from sheriffs to \nprosecutors, and a whole host of law enforcement officials in between, \nunderstand that the cooperation of a community is essential\n\n[[Page S12851]]\n\nfor police and law enforcement entities to do their job.\n  Under Senator Vitter's amendment, denying money to municipalities \nacross the landscape of the country--and this would deny monies to \nabout 126 cities in a whole host of States represented by people on \nboth sides of the aisle--would set up a series of circumstances under \nwhich a crime could be committed and the witness to that crime happens \nto be someone who is undocumented in some fashion. Do we want the \nwitness to be able to come forward and provide essential, crucial \neyewitness testimony about the crime or do we want them to hide in the \ndarkness and not talk to the police because they are afraid of their \nimmigration status?\n  I want to solve the crime, Mr. President. I want to get the \nperpetrator. I want to convict that person and put them in jail. I \ndon't want the opportunity to do that to go wasted because of some \npolitical statement that has nothing to do with the core issue of \nsecurity in our communities.\n  I want to make sure a witness comes forth and testifies against a \nperpetrator and has no fear to do so.\n  Senator Vitter's amendment would undermine that ability. Senator \nVitter's amendment would undermine the ability of someone who is a \nvictim of a crime and who happens to be in an undocumented capacity to \ncome forward because they might very well be concerned that their \nstatus is such that it might create a problem for them. So victims of a \ncrime would not come forward, which not only is inhuman as it relates \nto the victim of that crime--and that crime could be of all types and \nmanner that was committed against the individual--but the unwillingness \nof that person to come forward because of fear--fear--may lead to \nanother crime committed against someone else by that same individual in \nthat same community; perhaps to a child who might be molested, to a \nperson who might be assaulted, to a family who might get robbed.\n  So instead of catching the perpetrator, the criminal element, and \nbeing able to prosecute them either through the witness or through the \nvictim, no, we prefer to deny monies to that community because they \nhave a view that in their own interest--and I hear so many times in \ndebates that States and municipalities know best, but when it comes to \nthis, they know nothing. They know nothing about how best to secure \ntheir communities. They have made decisions across the landscape of the \ncountry--urban, suburban, and rural--to say we care more about \nprosecuting the crime and having witnesses come forward to tell us \nabout the crime than we care about the person's status, and we are not \ngoing to put a chilling effect across the landscape of our community to \nbeing able to achieve those goals.\n  That is what tough law enforcement will tell you--sheriffs will tell \nyou, prosecutors will tell you, and police chiefs will tell you. They \nwill tell you that they want the community to participate.\n  Now, when Secretary Chertoff was before the committee recently \ntestifying in a House hearing, he responded to a question about this \nissue. He said: I am not aware of any city that actually interferes \nwith our ability to enforce the law.\n  So let's not mix apples and oranges. The suggestion is that these \ncities interfere with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE's \nability to go ahead and pursue someone to be deported. That is not the \ncase. But that is the argument that is trying to be made in pursuit of \nan amendment that is all about immigration and nothing about security. \nWe need to be about security in our communities. We need to be able to \nhave witnesses come forward and be able to have victims come forward.\n  Now, local governments have taken the initiative to reassure these \ncommunities in order to deliver services vital to the public health and \nsafety. And these may be immigrant families who also, in fact, have \nperfect status in this country. But the message being sent out is: \nDon't talk to the local police.\n  We have had incidents where people who, in fact, have total legal \nstatus, and who, because they came forward as witnesses to a crime, \nended up feeling more like a criminal themselves than the person they \nwere trying to testify against. That sends a chilling effect across \nimmigrant communities which says: Do not participate.\n  It would not be in the interest of security in our communities to \nhave that be the message. If immigrant families are afraid to access \nthe opportunities for local law enforcement to have their participation \nas the eyes and ears of what is happening, it would have a negative \neffect and be a ripple effect of what would happen. If that is the \nmessage, then if you are a perpetrator of a crime and you want to do \nbreaking and entering, robbing in a community, God forbid you want to \ndo rapes, you say: This community will not go to the police. Let's do \nit in that sector. Then the crime continues and the perpetrator \ncontinues to be free and the process gets worse and worse.\n\n  It seems to me all Americans are at higher risk of preventable crimes \nwhen the population fears coming forward to give information.\n  This is also about telling municipalities that they cannot figure out \nfor themselves what is the best way to combat crime in their \ncommunities. Our whole effort under the fantastic bill that Senator \nMikulski has put together is to ensure communities have the wherewithal \nto combat the rise in crime we have seen over the past 2 years, \naccording to recent reports. The way to do that is to have citizens \ncome forward and participants in communities come forward and tell the \npolice about what is happening. It is not to put a chilling effect on \nit.\n  The Senate has in the past already largely rejected these \namendments--in good judgment. Let's listen to the cops, let's listen to \nthe prosecutors, let's listen to the sheriffs, let's listen to the \ntough law enforcement people, let's listen to the communities that have \nelected officials who are in the midst of these communities and who \nsay: When it comes to identifying crime and victims of crime, we want \nthem to come forward. That is in the public interest.\n  Nothing in these cities is used in a way, as Secretary Chertoff said, \nto impede the opportunity for ICE to do what they want to do should \nthey want to deport somebody.\n  For all those reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject the Vitter \namendment when it comes up for a vote and preserve the security of our \ncommunities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, rise to oppose the Vitter \namendment. For the benefit of our colleagues, they should know a \nsimilar amendment was defeated on the immigration bill this year. I \nopposed the amendment then and I oppose it now. I oppose it on \nsubstantive grounds, and I oppose it also on the grounds related to \nStates rights and home rule.\n  To refresh everyone, what the Vitter amendment would do is ban local \ngovernments from receiving Federal law enforcement funds if a city or a \nlocality has passed a law prohibiting police from asking an immigration \nstatus.\n  Why is this bad? First of all, local law enforcement officers all \nacross America are opposed to this amendment. Their opposition has been \nvery well articulated by our colleague from New Jersey. What has been \narticulated by local law enforcement communities is they believe they \nshould not be held responsible for enforcing Federal immigration laws; \nthat Federal laws on immigration should be enforced by Federal \nimmigration authorities.\n  This amendment would also make it harder for local police to enforce \nlaws and stop crime. One of the things that would happen, if police are \nforced to do this, it would foster great mistrust in our immigrant \ncommunities--meaning immigrants who are here legally. You know, there \nare many immigrants who are here legally. Because you might have a last \nname such as Sanchez doesn't mean you are an illegal immigrant. You \nmight be the owner of an IT business in Silver Spring, MD.\n  One of the things we are concerned about is that immigrants, then, \nwill not report crimes or will not give information to those who could \ngo after serious crimes--such as the gang effort.\n  We are also concerned when people will not come forward particularly \nrelated to domestic violence. If there is domestic violence, a battered \nspouse might not call the police because it could trigger some type of \nraid in their own community.\n  This is not a good way to go. Let's go to the consequences of local \ncommunities deciding what they want to do.\n\n[[Page S12852]]\n\nWhat we are talking about is a situation where a city or a locality has \npassed a law prohibiting police from asking an immigration status. That \nis their right. That is their right, to say what they want to do in \ntheir own community. Then to deny Federal funds for law enforcement, \nfunds for all the other things they might be applying for funds for, I \nthink is outrageous. What happens if they are applying for \ninteroperable communication equipment so they can fight violent crime? \nOh, no, they can't have it.\n  What happens when they have applied for funds for the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, to deal with battered spouses or abused children? \nOh, no, they would not be able to get their Federal funds.\n  What happens, then, in the issue of sexual predators? We have a \nrobust effort to go after sexual predators in our communities. If they \nhave applied for grants to be able to protect our children, they will \nnot be able to get them under the Vitter amendment. So the Vitter \namendment is not targeted at illegal aliens or illegal immigrants. What \nthe Vitter amendment does is target law enforcement. If the Vitter \namendment is agreed to, in many of these communities it will stifle, \nshackle, and impede local law enforcement from applying for Federal \nfunds to which they would otherwise be entitled.\n  I think this is misguided. I think it is misdirected. For those of us \nwho are very concerned about the issues of protecting our borders, we \nunderstand we need to protect our borders, but we also need to protect \nour communities. One of the ways we protect our communities is to let \nlaw enforcement apply for Federal funds for a variety of things, from \ncops on the beat, which they wouldn't be able to get; Byrne grant money \nfor technology or bulletproof vests, they wouldn't be able to get it; \nviolence against women funds, they wouldn't be able to get that. I \nthink the Vitter amendment is misguided and misdirected. We should \ndefeat it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have on this bill that is now before the \nSenate--the Commerce-Justice appropriations bill--about eight \namendments that Democrats have pending or wish to offer, and we have 26 \nRepublican amendments. Everyone should understand we are going to \nfinish this bill tomorrow. It does not matter what events are going on \naround town, we are going to work and finish this bill. If it takes \nuntil 8 o'clock tomorrow night, fine; there will be no windows. We are \ngoing to work right through this. If people try to hold this up, we \nwill have a bunch of votes. We will have the Sergeant at Arms \ninstructed. We are going to move through this.\n  I am told we want to finish appropriations bills. This is our second \nweek on this bill. We are going to finish this bill tomorrow or \nsometime early Wednesday morning. We are going to continue working on \nthis until it is completed or until we find there is such intransigence \nby the Republicans that they do not want us to finish this bill. I hope \nthat is not the case.\n  We have had on our appropriations bills some decent cooperation from \nthe Republicans, for which I am appreciative, but we have other bills \nwe have to do. If we finish this legislation, we will still have seven \nappropriations bills to do.\n  I am aware we have had to file cloture 49 different times this year \nto defeat Republican filibusters or to turn them around, and if it is \nnecessary to file the 50th, we will do that. I think that would be a \nshame to have to do that.\n  We have a finite number of amendments now, and we need to try to work \nthrough them. What we could do, of course, here--there are more \nDemocrats than Republicans--we could move to table all the Republican \namendments. It would take a lot of time to do that. I hope we do not \nhave to do that. I hope we can work through these amendments and some \nof them will be accepted and some will be voted upon.\n  I want to be as reasonable as possible, but I have the Nation's \nbusiness to be concerned about. We have to\n\n[[Page S12854]]\n\nwork through this. We have been off work now doing other things in our \ndistricts. We all worked hard. Now we are back to legislating. As part \nof that legislation is this bill that is before the Senate now. We are \ngoing to work on it and complete it. I was hopeful that with the 2:30 \ndeadline we would come back with a reasonable number of amendments, but \nthat is not, in fact, the case.\n\n  We have on the Republican side a number of Senators who are offering \nmultiple amendments. I know they are important, and I understand that, \nbut I hope that we can, as I have said, work our way through these. We \nwill one way or the other work through these, because I do not want and \ndo not intend to file cloture. I intend to work until we finish this \nbill.\n  I don't know how I can be more clear than that. We have to move after \nthis to another appropriations bill, one that is extremely important, \nthe Labor-HHS bill, an extremely important piece of legislation \ninvolving so many different and important issues, as the Presiding \nOfficer, for example, is well aware.\n  It is my understanding the distinguished junior Senator from South \nDakota wishes to call up an amendment before I do the closing matters, \nand I am happy to wait. I ask now to return to legislative business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. What is the matter before the Senate now, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Vitter amendment is the pending question.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3317\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for yielding to \ngive me an opportunity to offer this amendment. I call up amendment No. \n3317 and ask unanimous consent that it be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3317.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide, in a fiscally responsible manner, additional \n  funding for United States attorneys to prosecute violent crimes in \n                            Indian country)\n\n       On page 70, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec. 217. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, the amount appropriated under the heading ``united \n     states attorneys salaries and expenses'' under the heading \n     ``Legal Activities'' under this title is increased by \n     $20,000,000, which shall be used for the prosecution of \n     crimes described in section 1152 or 1153 of title 18, United \n     States Code.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     amount appropriated under the heading ``payment to the legal \n     services corporation'' under the heading ``Legal Services \n     Corporation'' under title IV is reduced by $20,000,000.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this appropriations bill, as all \nappropriations bills, comes down to a matter of priorities. We have a \nlimited amount of resources and we have to figure out where to put \nthose limited resources to the most effective use for the taxpayers.\n  My amendment is very simple. It takes $20 million from an authorized \nprogram that has problems with wasteful spending and it spends that $20 \nmillion instead to give Federal prosecutors badly needed additional \nfunding to fight violent crime in Indian country. Violent crime has \nbecome a serious problem on reservations in South Dakota and elsewhere, \nand I am determined to put an end to it. If our tribal communities are \nto have a chance to be prosperous, they must first have strong public \nsafety.\n  A few weeks ago I cosponsored an amendment with Senator Dorgan to \nprovide more law enforcement presence in Indian country. I strongly \nsupport this effort. The other part of the equation, though, is to \nensure that those who have been arrested for violent crimes are \nprosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Because the Federal \nGovernment has a trust responsibility to the tribes, the task for \nprosecuting violent crimes in Indian country lies with our U.S. \nattorneys. However, our U.S. attorneys often cannot prosecute crimes \nbecause of a lack of resources. An article published last June in the \nWall Street Journal by Gary Fields about crime in Indian country \npointed out that Federal prosecutors often do not intervene in cases \ninvolving serious crimes due to the long distances involved, lack of \nresources, and the cost of hauling witnesses and defendants to Federal \ncourt. The same article goes on to say that in the past two decades, \nonly 30 percent of tribal land crimes referred to U.S. attorneys were \nprosecuted, according to Justice Department data compiled by Syracuse \nUniversity. That compares with 56 percent for all other cases. I ask \nunanimous consent that the June 12, 2007 Wall Street Journal article \nheadlined ``Tattered Justice on U.S. Indian Reservations, Criminals \nSlip Through Gaps'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THUNE. I hasten to add that the U.S. attorney in South Dakota is \ndoing a fantastic job prosecuting violent crime and white-collar crime \non South Dakota's Indian reservations. However, I am certain he can put \nmore funding to good use in his office, as could every U.S. attorney \nprosecuting violent crime in Indian country.\n  The rate of violent crime in Indian country is disproportionately \nhigh. The Department of Justice reported that from 1992 to 2001, the \naverage rate of violent crime among American Indians was 2\\1/2\\ times \nthe national rate. According to one report in the Indian Country Today \nnewspaper, Native American women are 7 times more likely to be victims \nof domestic violence than all other women are, and more than 60 percent \nof Indian women will be victims of violent assault during their \nlifetimes. According to the same report, nearly one-third of all Native \nAmerican women will be raped. This is unacceptable.\n  The FBI estimates that 40 to 50 percent of Indian country violent \ncrime is now methamphetamine related. In fact, we know that meth \ntraffickers and dealers target Indian country jurisdictions because \nthey believe they will not be prosecuted, even if they are apprehended. \nAccording to Chris Chaney, the BIA Deputy Director of the Office of \nJustice Services, meth distribution on tribal lands often occurs due to \nthe belief that it is easier to get away with such a crime in Indian \ncountry. That is why we must dramatically ramp up prosecutions of \nviolent crime, of meth-related violent crime in Indian country.\n  I offer my amendment today to help provide more resources to U.S. \nattorneys in Indian country to prosecute more crimes referred to them. \nSpecifically, my amendment would provide an additional $20 million to \nU.S. attorneys that can only be spent to prosecute crimes under the \nMajor Crimes Act of 1885 and the Indian country Crimes Act of 1834. The \namount will be paid for by subtracting $20 million from the amount \nappropriated under this bill to the Legal Services Corporation.\n  This bill provides $390 million to the Legal Services Corporation, a \nprogram that has not been reauthorized since 1980. This is a 12-percent \nincrease over the amount appropriated to the LSC in fiscal year 2007, \nand a 30-percent increase above the administration's recommendation. \nThis substantial increase comes at a time when the Legal Services \nCorporation has faced serious questions about its management and \nexpenditure of taxpayer dollars.\n  In August, the GAO published a report entitled ``Legal Services \nCorporation: Governance and Accountability Practices Need to be \nModernized and Strengthened.'' In the report, the GAO noted that a \ndozen officers and employees of the Legal Services Corporation had \nreceived compensation in excess of the statutory compensation \nlimitation. According to the GAO, an outside legal counsel issued an \nopinion last May concluding that the Legal Services Corporation had not \ncomplied with the statutory limitation on the rate of compensation. The \nGAO agreed with that conclusion and went on to state that without a \nproperly designed and implemented process for overseeing\n\n[[Page S12855]]\n\ncompensation, the Legal Services Corporation remains at risk of not \ncomplying with related laws and regulations and engaging in imprudent \nmanagement practices.\n  The GAO also noted in the report that:\n\n       In recent years, LSC management has engaged in practices \n     that may have been prevented through effective implementation \n     of strong ethics policies.\n\n  These practices are reported by the LSC's inspector general. The \ninspector general found that food costs at meetings exceeded per diem \nallotments by 200 percent and that LSC used funds to pay travel \nexpenses for its president for business related to her positions with \noutside organizations. The inspector general also found that LSC hired \nacting special counsels from grant recipient organizations, causing \npotential conflicts of interest, and could not complete an \ninvestigation into this practice because of the failure to provide \ndocumentation required by Federal law and LSC grant agreements. The GAO \nconcluded that:\n\n       Without the presence of a strong ethics committee providing \n     effective oversight in the development, implementation, \n     updating, and training for the code of ethics, the LSC is at \n     increased risk of fraud or other ethical misconduct.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the executive summary of the LSC Office \nof Inspector General ``Report on Certain Fiscal Practices at the Legal \nServices Corporation,'' dated September 25, 2006 be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my remarks. Also, I commend to my colleagues a GAO \nreport entitled ``Legal Services Corporation Governance and \nAccountability Practices Need to be Modernized and Strengthened,'' \ndated August of 2007.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2).\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I do not believe an organization that has \nreceived such stinging criticism from the GAO about management \npractices and its handling of taxpayer dollars should be receiving such \na substantial increase in funding that is reflected in the underlying \nbill. My amendment simply reduces a $40 million increase to a $20 \nmillion increase for the Legal Services Corporation for fiscal year \n2008. That is, the Legal Services Corporation would still receive an \nincrease under my amendment, just not nearly as substantial as \noriginally reflected in the underlying bill.\n  As I said earlier, we must begin to choose priorities. Should we \nprovide more badly needed funding to fight violent crime in Indian \ncountry or should we reward an organization that is engaged in wasteful \nspending of taxpayer dollars by providing a massive increase over the \nPresident's recommendation of $300 million, and a massive increase even \ncompared to the amount of funding it received in the last fiscal year \nof $348 million?\n  I urge the Senate to join me in voting for more funding to help \nreduce violent crime in Indian country and to address what is a very \ndesperate need across Indian reservations in South Dakota, and to do it \nin a way that is consistent, I believe, with what the priorities in \nthis underlying bill ought to be, by paying for it with a $20 million \nincrease, actually, that is going to be allocated this year to the \nLegal Services Corporation. In my judgment, in my view, that makes \nsense. It is an issue that needs to be addressed, and my amendment \nwould take us down that road, coupled with the agreement that was \nearlier reached on the Dorgan amendment, to provide more of a law \nenforcement presence on Indian reservations. So I hope we can \naccomplish both of those objectives through the appropriations process \nthis year, and it starts right here with adopting this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to do that. I again thank the distinguished \nmajority leader for his patience in yielding me time to speak to this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 12, 2007]\n\n        On U.S. Indian Reservations, Criminals Slip Through Gaps\n\n                            (By Gary Fields)\n\n       Cherokee, N.C.--Jon Nathaniel Crowe, an American Indian, \n     had a long-documented history of fighting with police \n     officers and assaulting women. But the tribal court for the \n     Eastern Band of the Cherokee, under whose jurisdiction he \n     lives, couldn't sentence him to more than one year for any \n     charge. Not when he left telephone messages threatening to \n     kill an ex-girlfriend, not when he poured kerosene into his \n     wife's mouth, not when he hit her with an ax handle.\n       ``We put him away twice for a year, that's all we could \n     do,'' says James Kilbourne, prosecutor for the tribe. ``Then \n     he got out and committed the same crime again.''\n       Indian tribes are officially sovereign nations within the \n     U.S., responsible for running services such as schools and \n     courts. But a tangle of federal laws and judicial precedents \n     has undermined much of their legal authority. As a result, \n     seeking justice on Indian reservations is an uneven affair.\n       Tribes operate their own court systems, with their own \n     judges and prosecutors. Sharply limited in their sentencing \n     powers, they are permitted to mete out maximum jail time of \n     only 12 months for any crime, no matter how severe. The law \n     also forbids tribal courts to prosecute non-Indians, even \n     those living on tribal land.\n       Federal prosecutors can intervene in serious cases, but \n     often don't, citing the long distances involved, lack of \n     resources and the cost of hauling witnesses and defendants to \n     federal court. In the past two decades, only 30% of tribal-\n     land crimes referred to U.S. attorneys were prosecuted, \n     according to Justice Department data compiled by Syracuse \n     University. That compares with 56% for all other cases. The \n     result: Many criminals go unpunished, or minimally so. And \n     their victims remain largely invisible to the court system.\n       The justice gap is particularly acute in domestic-violence \n     cases. American Indians annually experience seven sexual \n     assaults per 1,000 residents, compared with three per \n     1,000 among African-Americans and two per 1,000 among \n     whites, says the Justice Department. The acts are often \n     committed by non-Indians living on tribal land whom tribal \n     officials cannot touch. Local prosecutors say members of \n     Indian communities have such low expectations about \n     securing a prosecution that they often don't bother filing \n     a report.\n       ``Where else do you ask: How bad is the crime, what color \n     are the victims and what color are the defendants?'' asks Mr. \n     Kilbourne, who has prosecuted cases on Cherokee lands since \n     2001. ``We would not allow this anywhere else except Indian \n     country.''\n       The lack of prosecutorial discretion is one of many ways in \n     which Indian justice has been split off from mainstream \n     American due process. For example, some defendants appearing \n     before Indian courts lack legal counsel, because federal law \n     doesn't require tribes to provide them with a public \n     defender. Although some tribes have them, others can't afford \n     to offer their members legal assistance. It's not unusual for \n     defendants to represent themselves.\n       The Indian Civil Rights Act, passed by Congress in 1968, \n     limited to six months the sentences tribes could hand down on \n     any charge. At the time, tribal courts were seeing only minor \n     infractions. Congress increased the maximum prison sentence \n     to one-year in 1986, wrongly assuming that the Indian courts \n     would continue to handle only misdemeanor-level crimes. \n     Tribal offenses, meanwhile, escalated in both number and \n     severity, with rape, murder and kidnapping among the cases.\n       The Supreme Court weighed in on another level, with its \n     1978 Oliphant decision ruling that tribes couldn't try non-\n     Indian defendants in tribal courts--even if they had \n     committed a crime against a tribe member on the tribe's land. \n     In its ruling, the court held that it was assumed from the \n     earliest treaties that the tribes did not have jurisdiction \n     over non-Indians.\n       ``If you go to Canada and rob someone, you will be tried by \n     Canadian authorities. That's sovereignty,'' says University \n     of Michigan law professor and tribal criminal-justice expert \n     Gavin Clarkson. ``My position is that tribes should have \n     criminal jurisdiction over anybody who commits a crime in \n     their territory. The Supreme Court screwed it all up and \n     Congress has never fixed it.''\n       Jeff Davis, an assistant U.S. Attorney in Michigan who \n     handles tribal-land cases, acknowledges that his hands are \n     often tied. Mr. Davis is also a member of North Dakota's \n     Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. ``I've been in the U.S. \n     Attorney's office for 12 years, and both presidents I have \n     served under have made violent crime in Indian country a \n     priority. But because of the jurisdictional issue and \n     questions over who has authority and who gets to prosecute, \n     it is a difficult situation.''\n       Often cases don't rise to the level of felony Federal \n     crimes unless the victim has suffered a severe injury. \n     Federal prosecutors have limited resources and focus almost \n     exclusively on the most serious cases. Compounding that is \n     the fact that domestic-abuse cases are difficult to prove, \n     especially if the lone witness recants.\n       ``It requires stitches, almost a dead body,'' says Mr. \n     Davis. ``It is a high standard to meet.''\n       For some non-Indians, tribal lands are virtual havens. \n     Chane Coomes, a 43-year-old white man, grew up on the Pine \n     Ridge Reservation in South Dakota--home to the Oglala Lakota, \n     near the site of the infamous 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee. \n     Marked by a small obelisk, the mass grave is a symbol of \n     unpunished violence, literally buried in the soil of the \n     tribe. The 2000 census documented Shannon County, which \n     encompasses the remote and desolate reservation, as the \n     second-poorest county in the U.S., with an annual per-\n     capita income of $6,286 at the time. Only Buffalo County, \n     SD, was poorer.\n\n[[Page S12856]]\n\n       According to local authorities, Mr. Coomes used his home on \n     the reservation as a sanctuary, knowing he would be free from \n     the attentions of tribal prosecutors.\n       Tribal Police Chief James Twiss says Mr. Coomes was \n     suspected of dealing in small amounts of methamphetamine for \n     years. Tribal police also thought he might be trafficking in \n     stolen goods.\n       In 1998, Mr. Coomes assaulted a tribal elder, Woodrow \n     Respects Nothing, a 74-year-old decorated World War II and \n     Korean War veteran. Because it couldn't prosecute, the tribe \n     ordered Mr. Coomes off its land. But attempts to remove him \n     were unenforceable.\n       ``All I could do was to escort him off the reservation,'' \n     says tribal police officer Eugenio White Hawk, who did that \n     several times, the last when he spotted the banned man \n     hauling horses in a trailer. ``He kept coming back. After a \n     while I just left him alone and let it go. It was just a \n     waste of time.''\n       Mr. Coomes remained in his Shannon County home until 2006 \n     when he was accused of beating his estranged wife in nearby \n     Nebraska and threatening to kill her, according to Dawes \n     County District Attorney Vance Haug. The crime was committed \n     off the reservation, and the subsequent investigation gave \n     state authorities official jurisdiction.\n       After raiding his home, they found stolen equipment as well \n     as 30 grams of methamphetamine and $13,000 hidden in the \n     bathroom, along with syringes.\n       Mr. Coomes is now in the Fall River County Jail charged \n     with possession of stolen property, grand theft and \n     unauthorized possession of a controlled substance. He also \n     faces separate charges, of assault and ``terroristic \n     threats'' related to his wife, in Dawes County, NE. If \n     convicted on the latter charges, he faces up to six years in \n     prison, Mr. Haug said. Mr. Coomes's attorney declined to \n     comment.\n       The jurisdictional quagmire also has implications for \n     Indian members on the other side of the tribal border. Gene \n     New Holy, an ambulance driver on Pine Ridge, had been \n     arrested by the tribe more than a dozen times for various \n     drunk-driving offenses, for which he received only two \n     convictions totaling about a month in a tribal jail. In state \n     court, four convictions would have led to a maximum sentence \n     of five years.\n       Lance Russell, the state prosecutor for Shannon County and \n     neighboring Fall River County, had never heard of Mr. New \n     Holy until Feb. 11, 2001, when Mr. New Holy got drunk at a \n     Fall River County bar. According to court documents, he \n     nearly hit one car on a main highway, forced two others into \n     a ditch and sideswiped a third that had pulled off the road \n     as Mr. New Holy approached it in the wrong lane.\n       The last car he hit contained three tribe members--cousins \n     Bart Mardinian, Anthony Mousseau and Russell Merrival--all of \n     whom died. The accident was less than a mile off the \n     reservation, enough to give Mr. Russell and the state \n     jurisdiction in the case. Mr. New Holy is serving 45 years in \n     state prison for three counts of vehicular homicide--much \n     longer than the 12 months per count he would have served \n     under tribal law. His attorney didn't return a call \n     seeking comment.\n       ``The holes in the system are more practical than legal, \n     and the victims of crime pay the price,'' says Larry Long \n     III, the South Dakota attorney general. ``The crooks and the \n     knotheads win.''\n       The Eastern Band of Cherokee, located in the Smoky \n     Mountains of North Carolina, is one of the most efficiently \n     run tribes in the country. Its ancestors hid in these \n     mountains while Cherokee east of the Mississippi River were \n     forcibly moved to present-day Oklahoma, a migration known as \n     the ``Trail of Tears.'' Today the tribe is spread across five \n     counties and is economically well off: It takes in more than \n     $200 million annually from the Harrah's Cherokee Casino & \n     Hotel, which it owns, and has a robust tourist industry. \n     About half of the tribe's gambling spoils go to pay for \n     infrastructure and government services.\n       Its court, which is housed in a prefabricated building, \n     looks like any other in the U.S., except the judges wear \n     bright, red robes. The offices, while cramped, are modern and \n     computerized, and are a little over one hour's drive from the \n     federal prosecutor's office in Asheville. Tribal authorities \n     meet regularly with federal prosecutors for training. The \n     tribe's top jurist is a former federal prosecutor who has \n     regular contact with his successors.\n       Yet even here, the justice system works erratically. In \n     2005, tribal police received a tip that James Hornbuckle, 46, \n     an Oklahoma Cherokee who had moved to the reservation, was \n     dealing marijuana. Officers built a case for weeks. They \n     raided the business and then Mr. Hornbuckle's home, where \n     they found 10 kilograms of marijuana, packaged in small \n     bricks. By tribe standards, it was a big haul, and \n     authorities approached the U.S. Attorney's office.\n       Gretchen Shappert, U.S. Attorney for the Western District \n     of North Carolina, says federal sentencing guidelines for \n     marijuana are so lenient, that ``we'd need 50 kilograms in a \n     typical federal case'' to pursue it. The feds rejected the \n     case.\n       If the state court had jurisdiction to prosecute the crime, \n     Mr. Hornbuckle might have received a three-year term. \n     Instead, he pleaded guilty to the marijuana charge and was \n     sentenced to one year in tribal court. Recently the tribal \n     council voted to permanently ban him from the reservation, \n     with backing from the feds. Messages left for Mr. \n     Hornbuckle's attorney weren't returned.\n       Mr. Crowe's name is all too familiar on the reservation. \n     Tribal Police Chief Benjamin Reed has known him since he was \n     a juvenile. ``What I remember is his domestic-violence \n     incidents. He just wouldn't stop,'' Mr. Reed says.\n       Crystal Hicks, who dated Mr. Crowe before his marriage, \n     says the tribal member was verbally abusive. She says she \n     left him after she had a miscarriage, when he berated her for \n     not giving him a ride to a motorcycle gathering. ``He said I \n     was using the miscarriage as an excuse,'' says Ms. Hicks, 27 \n     years old.\n       After that, in several telephone messages saved by Ms. \n     Hicks and her family, Mr. Crowe threatened to kill them and \n     bury Ms. Hicks in her backyard. He was jailed by the tribe \n     and ordered to stay away from the Hicks family.\n       ``One year,'' says Ms. Hicks. ``He even told me he was fine \n     in jail. He got fed three times a day, had a place to sleep \n     and he wasn't going to be there long.''\n       After he married, the violence escalated, says Police Chief \n     Reed. During one incident he drove to the home Mr. Crowe \n     shared with his wife, Vicki. ``He had threatened her, and dug \n     a grave, and said no one would ever find her. We believed \n     him,'' Mr. Reed said. ``Just look at some of the stuff he'd \n     done. That girl was constantly coming down here, her face \n     swollen up.'' At one point, he choked his wife, poured \n     kerosene into her mouth and threatened to light it, police \n     reports say. Mr. Crowe's attorney didn't return calls seeking \n     comment.\n       None of these acts led to more than one year in jail, a \n     sentence he has been given twice since 2001. His criminal \n     file at the tribal court building fills a dozen manila \n     folders. There are reports of trespassing and assault \n     convictions, telephone harassment, threats and weapons \n     assaults--one for an incident when he hit his wife with an ax \n     handle, breaking her wrist. His latest arrest, in September, \n     came about a week after he finished his most recent sentence, \n     when he came home and beat his now-estranged wife--again.\n       After seven years, his crimes finally triggered federal \n     involvement, although almost by accident. Federal prosecutors \n     from around the country met at Cherokee earlier this year to \n     discuss crime on tribal land. One federal official mentioned \n     to Mr. Kilbourne, the tribal prosecutor, a new statute that \n     allows federal intervention where defendants have at least \n     two domestic-violence convictions, regardless of the crime's \n     seriousness.\n       Mr. Kilbourne, who was preparing for a new trial against \n     Mr. Crowe the following week, quickly turned the case over. \n     Mr. Crowe pleaded guilty to assault last Friday and is \n     awaiting sentencing.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n         [From the Office of Inspector General, Sept. 25, 2006]\n\n  Report on Certain Fiscal Practices at the Legal Services Corporation\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n       In response to a Congressional request, the Office of \n     Inspector General (OIG) initiated a review of allegations \n     concerning fiscal practices, conflicts of interest, and \n     general mismanagement at the Legal Services Corporation \n     (LSC). This report presents our findings with respect to \n     certain LSC fiscal practices, including allegations of fiscal \n     abuse and wasteful spending. Other matters identified for \n     review will be addressed in subsequent reports.\n       With respect to many of the allegations, our review found \n     spending practices that may appear excessive and \n     inappropriate to LSC's status as a federally-funded non-\n     profit corporation, particularly in light of its mission in \n     distributing taxpayer dollars to fund legal services for the \n     poor. We also found a number of transactions which did not \n     follow LSC's own policies and a number which would be \n     impermissible under the rules governing federal agency \n     spending. While generally those rules are not directly \n     applicable to LSC, they provide a familiar reference point \n     for Congressional overseers and the public. Our principal \n     findings and recommendations are summarized below:\n       We found the cost of food at Board of Directors meetings \n     appeared excessive in some instances and should be reduced. \n     In nine of the eleven Board meetings that we were able to \n     examine, we found that the total cost of food was equivalent \n     to more than 200 percent of the applicable per diem food \n     allowance.\n       We found lunch costs at the January 2006 Board meeting to \n     be more than $70 per person, afternoon snack breaks costing \n     as much as $27 per person, and a total hotel food cost \n     (breakfast, lunch, and snacks) of $8,726 for the entire two-\n     day meeting. We also found the contracting process for Board \n     meetings was not in compliance with LSC's own policies. LSC \n     did not generally follow its competitive contracting \n     practices in selecting a hotel venue for Board meetings or \n     properly document the selection process or the justification \n     for the selection. Finally, we found LSC could save thousands \n     of dollars by holding its local, Washington, D.C., board \n     meetings at its headquarters rather than at a hotel.\n       We found that the LSC Chairman's authorization to allow the \n     LSC president to travel to or from any of her homes in \n     connection with official travel was contrary to the terms of \n     the General Services Administration (GSA) travel contract and \n     LSC's obligations as a mandatory user thereunder. We\n\n[[Page S12857]]\n\n     also found that the LSC president's use of a foreign air \n     carrier violated GSA's regulations implementing the Fly \n     America Act, which LSC is contractually bound to follow. \n     Further, we question the use of LSC funds to pay expenses \n     associated with the LSC president's continued service in \n     various capacities with outside organizations with which she \n     was involved prior to her selection as LSC president.\n       We found that LSC officials traveled first or business \n     class in three instances. In one instance in 2005, the LSC \n     Chairman traveled first class round trip from Atlanta, \n     Georgia, to Washington, D.C. The first class ticket was less \n     than a government ticket on the same flights. In a second \n     instance in 2005, the LSC president traveled one-way first \n     class to an international legal aid conference in Ireland at \n     an additional cost to LSC. Instead of using the government \n     fare initially booked, the president was ticketed full fare \n     coach, allowing her to secure an immediate first class \n     upgrade as a frequent flyer member, which would not be \n     available immediately with a government ticket. Finally, an \n     LSC vice president traveled business class round trip to \n     Melbourne, Australia, to attend the 2001 International Legal \n     Aid Conference. As the trip was well in excess of 14 hours, \n     it appears that business class would have been authorized for \n     this trip under the Federal Travel Regulation.\n       We estimate that LSC spent over $100,000 on coffee, holiday \n     parties and picnics, working lunches, and business \n     entertainment, going back as far as August 2000. These \n     expenditures did not violate LSC policy. While LSC is \n     generally not subject to Federal spending practices, these \n     expenditures would be impermissible under those practices and \n     we question whether many of them were reasonable and \n     necessary, and whether they were appropriate for LSC.\n       We found LSC has spent over $1 million in the past 10 years \n     in settlement agreements with departing employees.\n       We concluded that some of the allegations were unfounded, \n     or could not be substantiated. Specifically:\n       We found no evidence of excessive or undisclosed bonuses or \n     of other confidential or indirect payments by LSC to the LSC \n     president. We found no evidence of any ``secret deal'' \n     between the LSC president and the LSC Board of Directors.\n       We did find, however, that the LSC president has been \n     receiving a ``Locality Pay'' supplement at a rate that is 1 \n     percent of salary greater than that received by any other LSC \n     employee, all of whom work in Washington, D.C. (The Inspector \n     General also received locality pay with a 1 percent \n     differential for the first four months of his employment. \n     This ended December 2004.) We questioned the propriety of \n     such a payment. Locality pay rates by their nature are \n     geographically based; under the Federal system there would be \n     no variation for an individual payee within a given area.\n       We did not find unreasonable LSC's justification for \n     holding a board meeting in Puerto Rico. LSC stated that it \n     was appropriate to visit the largest LSC grantee and meet \n     with various judicial officials and members of the bar who \n     are involved in promoting the delivery of legal services to \n     low-income individuals in Puerto Rico.\n       We did not find widespread first-class travel and found \n     only one instance of questionable first-class travel.\n       We did not find LSC spending practices violated any laws. \n     However, we did find that LSC is not adhering to its \n     contractual obligations under the GSA City Pair Contract, as \n     well as instances where it is not following its own controls \n     and procedures regarding spending, contracting, and travel.\n       Our overall recommendations to the LSC Board and LSC \n     management include the following:\n       Undertake a comprehensive review to bring LSC's spending \n     policies and practices, particularly in the areas of travel, \n     meals, meetings, and entertainment, in line with those \n     applicable to Federal agencies, and require that the board \n     review and approve any deviation from Federal practice.\n       Review the overall cost of LSC board meetings to determine \n     whether there are ways to reduce costs. Also, require that \n     LSC's competitive requirements are followed in contracting \n     for board meeting locations.\n       Provide training and education for LSC staff to ensure that \n     all LSC policies are followed, particularly in the areas of \n     contracting and the Federal Travel Regulation related to the \n     GSA City Pair Contract.\n       Review LSC employment policies and practices to determine \n     if there are opportunities to reduce its potential liability, \n     and review its settlement policies and practices to determine \n     whether costs can be reduced and whether they are in the best \n     interest of the corporation and appropriate expenditures of \n     public funds.\n       LSC Response: The LSC Board and management responded \n     positively to a draft copy of this report. They have agreed \n     to implement substantially all of the report's \n     recommendations. In some cases, they have already taken steps \n     to do so, as noted in the specific recommendations within the \n     report.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       LSC is a private, non-profit corporation established by \n     Congress in 1974 to help provide equal access to the system \n     of justice in our nation to those who otherwise would be \n     unable to afford adequate legal counsel by making financial \n     support available to provide high quality civil legal \n     assistance. In establishing LSC, Congress explicitly \n     recognized ``providing legal assistance to those who face an \n     economic barrier to adequate legal counsel will serve best \n     the ends of justice, assist in improving opportunities for \n     low-income persons,'' and that the availability of legal \n     assistance ``has reaffirmed faith in our government of \n     laws.'' LSC has said, ``The goal of providing equal access to \n     justice for those who cannot afford to pay an attorney \n     remains the reason for LSC's existence and the benchmark for \n     its efforts.''\n       LSC's statutory mission is to provide ``financial support \n     for legal assistance in non-criminal proceedings or matters \n     to persons financially unable to afford legal assistance.'' \n     Pursuant to its mission, LSC funds 138 non-profit legal aid \n     organizations across the United States and its territories to \n     address the most basic and critical civil legal needs of the \n     poor. Controlling statutes require that LSC choose grantees \n     to provide such legal assistance to the poor through a \n     process of competitive bidding, and also require LSC to \n     ensure grantee compliance with applicable laws and \n     implementing regulations and guidelines, and to ensure the \n     maintenance of high quality service. LSC is required to \n     ensure that grant dollars are provided so as to make the most \n     economical and effective use of its taxpayer-provided \n     resources in the delivery of legal assistance to eligible \n     persons.\n       LSC is wholly funded through taxpayer dollars; its 2006 \n     annual appropriation was $326.6 million, including $12.7 \n     million to support LSC headquarters operations (not including \n     the OIG). Given its mission as the principal provider of \n     federal funds for legal assistance to the poor and its status \n     as a quasi-federal agency, it is reasonable to expect that \n     LSC management should conform to the highest standards with \n     respect to fiscal responsibility and accountability. Indeed, \n     LSC, ``[a]s a matter of principle, [is] committed to being a \n     careful and frugal steward of taxpayer funds [and declares \n     that it has] strict policies in place to ensure LSC funds are \n     spent wisely and appropriately.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend leaves the floor, one of \nthe areas we need to get to--and I want to do it before we leave on \nNovember 16--is Indian health, which is something that is long overdue. \nIf we talk about people who need health care, everybody would stand in \nline as second in need to the Indians around this country. We have a \nbill, and the Finance Committee is in the process of getting money to \nget it done. It is not everything we need, but it is starting something \nthat is long overdue.\n  I say to my friend, who has the most needy reservation--Pine Ridge--\nin the country that we need to have the time to get rid of some of \nthese appropriations bills so we can do something about Indian health. \nI have made a commitment that we are going to do that some way before \nwe leave this legislative year. We have to do that piece of \nlegislation. I know my friend from South Dakota understands the need in \nIndian Country for health care. As I said, it is great that we want to \ntake care of the children's health initiative, which is important \nbecause we have 50 million people with no health insurance. All those \nproblems are really in the shadows of how badly it is needed in Indian \nCountry.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I filed an amendment with Senator \nGraham as a cosponsor which may provide up to $2 million, within the \nDepartment of Justice Office of Justice Programs account, for the Sex \nOffender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering and \nTracking, SMART, Office. The funding will be used to help hire \nadditional staff and cover expenses for the office. The SMART Office \nwas created by the Adam Walsh Act to help States change their sex \noffender registry statutes to come into compliance with the law. \nCurrently, the SMART office is only funded through various \ndiscretionary accounts, so it is critical that we ensure they have \nenough staff and resources to help enforce this important law to \nprotect our communities.\n  Mr. President, today I filed an amendment with Senator Kennedy as a \ncosponsor which would authorize the Director of the Federal Prison \nSystem to carry out a pilot program to assist the children of female \nprisoners. The pilot program can be developed at any Federal \ncorrectional facility that houses women in the United States. \nSpecifically, the amendment gives the Director of the Federal prison \nsystem discretion to make expenditures to institute a pilot program for \nnonviolent female offenders and their children up to age 36 months to \nallow the children\n\n[[Page S12858]]\n\nto be housed, fed, and cared for in Federal, or federally contracted, \ncorrectional facilities housing women, in programs specifically \ndesigned to benefit mother and child.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues \nSenator Mikulski and Senator Shelby for their first-class work on the \nFiscal Year 2008 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations bill. They have written legislation that strengthens \ncommunities against crime and terrorism, provides important research \ndollars for science and technology, and protects jobs here in the \nUnited States against unlawful trade practices.\n  Unfortunately, we know from Federal crime statistics that violent \ncrime is on the rise in the United States. To combat this increase, we \nmust make a commitment to boost Federal support for State and local law \nenforcement. This bill contains $2.66 billion for community police \ndepartments, $26 million to hire an additional 100 FBI agents to fight \nviolent crime, and $5 million for the FBI to create a task force on \ngang violence. Since the terrorist attacks on September 11, we have \nasked our local law enforcement officials to assume yet another role in \nprotecting citizens, namely homeland security. I believe that the \nFederal Government must step in and provide a share of the resources to \ncommunity policing for their efforts.\n  I also commend my colleagues for the impressive funding package they \nhave devised for science and technology. This year, along with Senator \nBond, I helped lead the charge in the Senate for an increase in the \nNational Science Foundation's budget. This bill includes over $6.5 \nbillion for the NSF, with a substantial $850 million for educational \nprograms to develop the next generation of leaders in science, \ntechnology, and math. The future of innovation rests upon our ability \nto recruit more talented students who want to pursue careers in science \nand engineering. Looking at the challenges the United States faces in \nmaintaining global economic leadership, a comparatively small \ninvestment now in the National Science Foundation will provide \nexponential benefits for years to come.\n  Finally, I commend the adoption of Senator Mikulski and Senator \nShelby's amendment to add $1 billion to NASA's budget for this upcoming \nfiscal year. Along with several other Senators, I was a proud co-\nsponsor of this amendment, and I laud its adoption by unanimous \nconsent. The additional funding will enable NASA to revive its basic \nscience programs, such as its earth science and aeronautics research \ninitiatives. Global warming is a reality, and NASA's capabilities make \nit uniquely positioned to provide the world's scientific community with \nvital data about changes in Earth's atmosphere and the subsequent \nimpact on climate. Furthermore, we must remember that there are two \n``As'' in NASA, and forgetting the ``Aeronautics'' component of the \nagency's mission would be a grave mistake. Once again, I congratulate \nmy colleagues on a well formulated piece of legislation, and I urge the \nPresident to sign this bill into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/senate-section/article/S12858-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Domestic \nViolence Month. During the month of October, I urge my fellow \ncolleagues and Americans to join me in committing to end violence in \nour homes. It is my hope that we can stand together this month and show \nabusers that we will not tolerate their actions.\n  We must never forget that domestic violence is a wide spread ailment \nwith devastating implications. Domestic violence affects not only the \nvictims of abuse, but their families and communities as well. The \nconsequences of domestic abuse do not end with the violence. Victims \nlucky enough to escape their abusers are sometimes left with no home, \nno money, and no means to support themselves. And most unfortunately, \nchildren are often caught in middle of this tragedy. With as many as \nthree million women experiencing abuse a year, it is clear we must do \nmore to prevent these crimes and help those who are victims.\n  That is why I would like to recognize several organizations that have \ndone extraordinary work to protect the victims of domestic violence in \nNevada. For almost 20 years, the Shade Tree has provided shelter to \nabused women, and their families. Now, Shade Tree has taken on another \naspect of domestic violence. On October 9, 2007, Shade Tree opened \nNoah's Animal House, a shelter for the animals of battered women. Shade \nTree realized that animal abuse occurs in 85 percent of homes from \nwhich battered women arrive. Of those, 20 percent refuse to leave their \nabusers without their pets. Shade Tree's commitment to ending domestic \nviolence knows no boundaries, and I know its impact on countless lives \nwill continue.\n  The Safe Nest is another important organization that has made \ntremendous strides in ending domestic violence in Nevada. Safe Nest \nrecognizes the importance of addressing all sides of domestic violence \nand helps with a range of services from court advocacy to crisis \nintervention. Safe Nest also serves Nevada by sheltering victims and \neducating the public. On October 19, Safe Nest will hold its annual \nDomestic Violence Awareness Month luncheon. On this day, I hope that \nNevada and our Nation will recognize Safe Nest's years of success and \nhard work.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize the S.A.F.E--Stop Abuse in the \nFamily Environment--House for their work. S.A.F.E. House is a community \nbased organization that provides counseling, advocacy, and intervention \nfor victims of domestic abuse. In addition, S.A.F.E. House collaborates \nwith organizations across Nevada to search for ways to end domestic \nviolence. For example, on October 25, S.A.F.E. House and the state \nchapter of National Organization for Women will team up to bring \nawareness to domestic violence. I am pleased to commend S.A.F.E. House \nfor motivating hundreds of Nevadans to take action in their community.\n  It is also important to recognize thousands of other organizations in \nNevada and our Nation that have committed time, labor, and financial \nresources to help victims of domestic abuse. Please join me in \ncommending the dedicated efforts of those individuals who work each day \nto stop aggression in our homes. With their example in mind, I hope \nthat Congress can reflect and take action during this important month. \nI urge all Americans to participate in Domestic Violence Month \nactivities and pledge to make this issue their own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/senate-section/article/S12858-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12858-S12859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL LATINO AIDS AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, October 15 is the fifth annual National \nLatino AIDS Awareness Day, NLAAD. I rise in observance of this \nimportant day to increase our understanding of the Latino community's \nstruggle with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. As we draw attention to the \ndevastating impact of the HIV/AIDS crisis on the Nation's Latino \npopulation, let us recognize the resulting call to action as well.\n  When America first observed the annual National Latino AIDS Awareness \nDay in 2003, we took stock of the dismaying statistics on HIV/AIDS \namong Latinos. Even though they comprise 14 percent of the U.S. \npopulation, they accounted for 19 percent of the new HIV infections \nestimated to occur in the country each year. Over 71,000 Latinos were \nthought to be living with AIDS, constituting one-fifth of all AIDS \npatients in America. Of those, teens and women were among the Latino \npopulation subgroups considered especially hard hit by the HIV/AIDS \nepidemic.\n  These troubling disparities persist today. Latinos continue to be \noverrepresented among HIV/AIDS patients, the greater barriers they face \nin accessing care have not gone away, and too many remain in the dark \nabout the importance of prevention. While advances in medical \ntechnology have improved the outcome for HIV/AIDS patients in general, \nthese benefits are also not reaching Latinos on par with the rest of \nthe population. Underlying\n\n[[Page S12859]]\n\nall these statistics is the sobering message that HIV/AIDS still \ndevastates real people and real families across the Latino community. \nIt is a message with special significance for me as the senior Senator \nfrom Nevada, where 18 percent of the newly diagnosed are Latinos.\n  We must be mindful of other statistics that provide context. \nAccording to the U.S. Census, individuals of Latino or Hispanic origin \nnumbered over 44 million in 2005. They are also the fastest growing \nminority group in the Nation. In Nevada alone, the Hispanic population \nhas soared by 40 percent from 2000 to 2005.\n  All these factors highlight the need to reverse the course of the \nepidemic among Latinos, if we are to make headway against HIV/AIDS in \nAmerica. Fortunately, the disparities and challenges facing the Latino \ncommunity also point to the steps we can take. From teaching health \ncare providers to deliver culturally competent care to funding vital \nprograms like the Ryan White CARE Act, these steps are critical to \nwinning the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n  Educating and engaging the public remains a cornerstone of our \nefforts. In southern Nevada, for example, nonprofit organizations are \npartnering with public health officials to provide HIV testing and \ninformation to the public in observance of National Latino AIDS \nAwareness Day. Similar events are expected to take place across the \nNation.\n  National Latino AIDS Awareness Day is a time not just to spread the \nword about HIV/AIDS issues specific to the Latino community. It is also \na day of hope, an opportunity to reflect on the milestones we have \nreached and to reaffirm the goals and ideals of this day. So, in \nlooking toward the future, let us all renew our commitment to ending \nthe HIV/AIDS crisis--among Latinos and all Americans everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/senate-section/article/S12859-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Sergeant Joseph B. Milledge\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I must \ninform the Senate of the death of Sergeant Joseph B. Milledge a \nGlenwood, IA, native who was killed in Iraq on October 5, 2007, during \ncombat patrol in Baghdad. Sergeant Milledge was part of the 3rd \nSquadron, 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment, 1st Armored Division stationed \nin Vilseck, Germany. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and \nfriends, especially his wife Amanda and their 1-year-old son Joseph, \nJr., as well as his parents, Carla and Jack.\n  Joseph Milledge was born in Council Bluffs, IA, and later moved to \nGlenwood with his family where he attended high school. He enlisted in \nthe U.S. Army in August 2003, a year after he graduated. By all \naccounts, Joseph was a highly literate man who enjoyed reading books on \nreligion and philosophy and writing poetry. In fact, I understand he \ngave his wife a book of his unpublished poetry this summer. Joseph \nloved his family unconditionally and cherished spending time with his \nson, nieces, and nephews.\n  Sergeant Milledge was very dedicated to his country and the cause for \nwhich he was fighting. His mother explained that he didn't want to go \nback for a second tour because of his family but did so because he knew \nit was his duty to his country. Carla Milledge said, ``You couldn't \nhave asked for a better father or husband. He loved his wife and son. \nHe loved them with his whole being.''\n  I know his loss will be felt very strongly, not least by his infant \nson. But, as his wife Carla said, ``He'll know his daddy was a hero and \ndied for what he believed in.'' Sergeant Joseph B. Milledge is indeed a \ngreat American hero who will be remembered for his courage, his \nstrength, and his love. He gave the ultimate sacrifice for his family, \nfriends, and country, and we are forever grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/senate-section/article/S12859-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JO ANN DAVIS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the First Congressional District of \nVirginia is, like all of Virginia, a unique treasure. Beginning not far \nfrom the Nation's Capital, it stretches down Virginia's eastern coast \nalong the Chesapeake Bay, as far south as the cities of Newport News \nand Hampton. Today, the First District is home to crucial national \ndefense resources, like the Marine Corps' installation at Quantico and \nLangley Air Force Base. It is also home to national historic landmarks \nlike Jamestown, Yorktown, and Williamsburg, places that gave birth to \nVirginia and that are forever tied to the independence of our Nation \nand our Constitution.\n  On October 6, 2007, the people of Virginia's First Congressional \nDistrict lost one of its most respected and admired leaders, a \ndedicated Member of Congress and loyal friend, Representative Jo Ann \nDavis. It is with deep sadness that I share my thoughts on the passing \nof my colleague.\n  Born in North Carolina, Jo Ann Davis attended Hampton Roads Business \nCollege in Virginia, later obtaining her real estate license and real \nestate broker's license over the next several years. In 1990, she \nstarted her own company, Jo Ann Davis Realty, and followed this \nsuccessful endeavor with a run for public office in 1997. Serving as a \ndelegate in the Virginia General Assembly for 4 years, Jo Ann Davis \nbecame the first Republican woman to serve Virginia in the U.S. \nCongress after winning election in 2000.\n  Representative Davis was a relentless champion for the needs of the \nFirst District. It was my privilege to work with her on many matters, \nranging from national defense to the environment, and in that regard \nshe worked hard to improve the health of the Chesapeake Bay. Also, I \ncommend her diligent leadership in the removal of the James River \nReserve Fleet from Newport News. From her support for the Rappahannock \nRiver Valley National Wildlife Refuge to her concern with the \npreservation of Dragon Run or providing funding for oyster restoration, \nshe always put the quality of Virginia's environment above politics.\n  With sincere passion and concern, Representative Davis worked to \nimprove our Nation's armed services and the lives of the men and women \nwho bravely answer the call to duty. She provided strong representation \nfor the communities in and surrounding the Naval Surface Warfare Center \nat Dahlgren and the Marine Corps base at Quantico, ensuring that these \nfacilities continue to make important contributions to protecting the \nNation and to the economic foundations of their respective areas. Her \ninitiative to increase the life insurance benefit paid to survivors of \nmilitary members and her advocacy on behalf of the rights and benefits \nof Federal employees will continue to be appreciated in the years \nahead.\n  I have always admired Representative Davis for her strong convictions \nand the tenacity that she brought to bear in acting on them. She fought \na courageous struggle against cancer, and I will miss her insights and \nher friendship in our Virginia congressional delegation.\n  I close with a personal note that we both shared interests in \nequestrian activities. There is an old English saying that ``the \noutside of the horse is good for the inside of the man.'' As an avid, \naccomplished rider, she often quipped with me that the saying applies \nequally to a woman. She loved the noble horse.\n  I join with my colleagues from the Commonwealth and from the entire \nU.S. Congress in expressing my deepest sympathies to her husband, her \ntwo sons, and her extended family. They will remain in our thoughts and \nprayers during the difficult days ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/senate-section/article/S12859-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12859-S12860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BAN ASBESTOS IN AMERICA ACT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

And I \nwould like to thank Pete Weissman who recently left my office but whose \nwords often helped drive home the urgency of this effort. I would also \nlike to thank Mike Spahn who worked with me on the Senate floor to \nguide this bill to passage\n  I also want to recognize and thank Dr. Barry Castleman, Chris Hahn \nfrom the Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation, MaryAnne Dunlap from \nSenator Inhofe's office, Ed Egee from Senator Isakson's office, Linda \nReinstein from the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, Dr. Aubrey \nMiller, Dr. Greg Meeker, Dr. Richard Lemen, Dr. Mike Harbut, Dr. Harvey \nPass, Andrew Schneider of the Seattle PI, and Matt Bergman.\n  I also want to say that it has been a pleasure to work with Senator \nIsakson's staff, the staff from EPW, and Senator Boxer's staff.\n  It takes a lot of people to get something done. A tremendous amount \nof people have worked on this. I thank them. Because of their work, we \nare going to ban asbestos, we are going to dramatically expand research \nand treatment, and we are going to launch a public education campaign \nso all Americans understand how they can protect themselves from the \ndeadly asbestos products that may be in their home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/senate-section/article/S12860-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12860-S12861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MAJOR VAUGHN L.

On October 22, 2007, \nMajor Ward received the Bronze Star Medal with Combat Distinguishing \nDevice for heroic achievement in combat while serving as a Marine Rifle \nCompany Commander in Fallujah, Iraq, from March to October of 2006.\n  During 7 months of combat operations, Major Ward distinguished \nhimself as an exemplary leader of Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 25th \nMarines, Regimental Combat Team 5. Charlie Company was centrally \nlocated in the center of Fallujah and colocated with the Iraqi Police \nHeadquarters. Insurgent forces regularly attacked this strategic \nposition. During the tour, insurgents launched over a dozen complex \nattacks against his position, utilizing more than 120 rounds of \nindirect fire, IDF, AK-47 and PKC fire, vehicle borne improvised \nexplosive devices, VBIEDs, improvised explosive devices, IEDs, and \nsniper fire. Major Ward commanded his marines through these attacks and \nusually led the counterattack against enemy forces. From March through \nOctober, Charlie Company engaged the enemy over 130 times, conducted \nnearly a thousand foot and vehicle patrols, and carried out over 100 \nraids against insurgent locations.\n  Major Ward's military honors are only the latest in a career marked \nby excellence, leadership, and achievement. After graduating from Boise \nState University, he worked on Capitol Hill as a legislative aide for \nformer Senator Dirk Kempthorne in 1993. He joined the Marine Corps in \n1995 and served until 2000, whereupon he entered the University of \nMaryland and obtained his masters in business administration, MBA, in \n2002. He continued his public service by joining the Central \nIntelligence Agency, CIA, where he trained as an operations officer and \nserved in the Middle East and Africa. In January 2006, Vaughn went on \nmilitary furlough from the CIA in order to reactivate with the Marines \nand serve in Iraq. He left active duty in January 2007 and resigned \nfrom the CIA in May 2007. Vaughn, his wife Kirsten, and their daughter \nAve will return home to Idaho in November.\n  Vaughn's penchant for leadership and hard work has its roots on a \nsmall family farm in Shoshone. As young as 8 years old, Vaughn was \nworking at his family's farm, which included a dairy with 70 cows, and \na few thousand acres of grain and hay, and hundreds of free-range \ncattle. By age 11, Vaughn was operating a tractor, plowing the fields \nin the spring and fall and swathing the summer hay crops. He helped to \nrun the family farm throughout most of his teenage years and feels very \nfortunate to have had this childhood experience. His grandfather \nhomesteaded the farm, and it was there that Vaughn internalized a true \nappreciation for the importance of hard work.\n  He was cognizant at an early age of the family's financial \nchallenges. At 14, the age when many teenagers were spending their \nmoney on things like music, clothes, and a new electronic invention--\ncomputer games--Vaughn bought his family a Christmas tree. They would \nnot have had one, otherwise.\n  Vaughn credits his mom, Maria Tranmer, with his success and his \ncharacter development. His mother recounts the circumstances of his \nbirth: Due to complications, they did not expect Vaughn to survive. \nWhen the doctor came to his mother's room, he said, ``Little girl, I \ndon't know what this boy is going to do in life, but it's going to be \nsomething special.'' Maria took these words to heart and, according to \nVaughn, ``she never pushed me to be something I'm not, but she pushed \nme to realize my potential. She always supports me and, from the time I \nwas young, told me to do what I am capable of doing, and be the best at \nit. Her and my family's belief in me is what pushes me to do what I do, \nand accomplish what I have.'' Maria is a remarkable woman herself, \nraising Vaughn and his sister, Shellie, through many years of hardship \nalone, yet, in Vaughn's words, ``never leaving us wanting for \nanything.''\n  Vaughn also points to mentors that have been there for him along the \nway and helped him during his formative years--from a first-grade \nteacher who took the time to care to coaches in high school who acted \nas role models. At age 7, his stepfather, Andrew Ward, a former Marine \nCorps officer, introduced Vaughn to hunting and hiking in the Idaho \nmountains and taught him how to ride a motorcycle. He also calls his \ngrandfather, William Tews, the primary male influence in his life. ``My \ngrandfather taught me how to shoot a rifle, drive a tractor and what it \nmeans to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps.'' Vaughn continued \nstating that ``my grandpa, father, and coaches shaped the life of a \nyoung man and those experiences gave me courage and confidence and \nopened up unique opportunities for me.''\n  Vaughn's time in Iraq cemented and honed his leadership skills. \nVaughn observes that if the talk of leadership doesn't translate into \nthe action of leadership, particularly in combat, your credibility \ndissolves. In war, he says, fear is a cancer, and leaders have to be \nwilling to do themselves what they order others to do. He lived this in \nIraq, personally leading foot patrols from the front against the advice \nof fellow officers. He felt that it was wrong to order his subordinates \nto do something that he was unwilling to do himself. This bravery and \ncommitment to walk and stand with his men meant something to them. His \naward submission in part reads: ``Major Ward's strong leadership style \nand his willingness to always lead literally from the front inspired \nhis Marines to continue to engage the enemy.''\n  For Vaughn, excellent leadership also means not being fully committed \nto one's own ideas in the formulation stage of the decisionmaking \nprocess. An effective leader knows how and when to listen to the \ncounsel of others, evaluate all available information, and have the \nconfidence to make a decision and execute that decision. Good leaders \nare accountable for their actions, good and bad, and a good leader \nshares accolades with those who are part of the effort--a leader, by \ndefinition, has to have able and committed followers. One of the \nlessons he learned in Iraq was the result of the patrols that he led \nregularly. He tells of patrolling in unfamiliar territory and \nencountering times when the way ahead was unclear. ``All you could do \nwas start walking,\n\n[[Page S12861]]\n\nand that was how you found your way.''\n  Vaughn is a committed family man and has the priceless gift of a \nsupportive and loving wife. ``My wife was my strength during the hard \ntimes when I suffered casualties and lost Marines. She was the only one \nI could talk to, and I can't believe how difficult it must have been to \nhear me broken up over the death of my Marines, and be powerless to do \nanything but listen and offer words of comfort, thousands of miles \naway. She got me through my deployment.'' Vaughn also has the support \nand love of two sisters, Shellie Amundson and Logan Tranmer, both who \nlive in Idaho.\n  Finally, Vaughn makes a point of sharing the good things that our \nmilitary is doing in Iraq. He notes that Al Anbar Province has been \ntransformed over the past year. The marines of Charlie Company engaged \nthe enemy, purposefully, and fought al-Qaida on terms determined by the \nU.S. military, not the insurgents. As a direct result of the actions of \nVaughn's company, the insurgents, at one point, issued a public message \nthat if the Marines of Company C would stay ``inside the wire,'' they \nwould cease attacks on coalition forces. Vaughn says, ``We did not let \nthem dictate how we did our job, and we were successful. There are good \nstories out there--stories that need and must be told.''\n  I have only highlighted a few of Vaughn's many accomplishments, both \non the battlefield and off. He is more than deserving of these \naccolades, although he is quick to point out that his company deserves \nthe responsibility for his Bronze Star. We can only hope that men of \nVaughn's caliber will continue their public service to our great Nation \nas his generation begins to take the reigns. I am honored to be able to \ntell of this remarkable Idahoan, his family, and the men of Charlie \nCompany here in the Senate and privileged to publicly offer my humble \nthanks and that of my family, State, and country for Major Vaughn \nWard's extraordinary and valorous service to the United States of \nAmerica, and I am proud to call him an Idaho son.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/senate-section/article/S12861-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BINATIONAL HEALTH WEEK\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

The network of \nMexican consulates throughout the country has partnered with U.S. \nFederal, State, and local agencies, Mexico's Secretariats of Health and \nForeign Affairs, as well as private companies and foundations. These \ngrowing partnerships and the information they provide have reached an \nestimated 238,000 people across the United States and Canada.\n  We must continue to work together at the Federal, State, and \ncommunity levels with our friends throughout the world to encourage \nindividuals and families to practice healthy lifestyles. I wish all \nthose celebrating Binational Health Week every continuing success as \nthey pursue new and exciting opportunities to promote health and well-\nbeing in our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/senate-section/article/S12861-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       IN MEMORY OF HOWARD HOLTAN\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on September 22, 2007, lifelong \nAlaskan Howard Holtan died when his plane crashed during takeoff near \nWhittier, AK. Howard not only was a personal friend of mine but also to \nthe hundreds of Alaskan children he coached through the Alyeska Mighty \nMites, a volunteer-operated ski racing program for children. Under \nHoward's guidance, my two sons developed their skills and a passion for \nski racing while my husband and I volunteered as Mighty Mites parents.\n  Howard began coaching skiing in 1971. He was the magic and the muscle \nbehind the Mighty Mites, running the program almost singlehandedly from \nhis personal laptop since the mid-1980s when he became the Mighty Mites \ndirector. Howard strove to introduce the fundamentals and joy of alpine \nski racing to children of all abilities, while also giving kids self-\nconfidence, a sense of accomplishment, and an appreciation for good \nsportsmanship. Howard ensured that lots of fun was had by all. There is \nno doubt that he helped make the Mighty Mites one of the most \nsuccessful youth ski programs in America. In fact, Olympians Megan \nGerety and Rosey Fletcher and former U.S. Ski Team members Mike Makar \nand Kjersti Bjorn-Roli started out as young Mighty Mites. For the ski \ncommunity, it will be hard to imagine a Mighty Mites ski race without \nHoward's trademark ``cherub'' smile or his presence somewhere on the \nhill.\n  Howard's passion for downhill skiing and dedication to Alaska's youth \nwas almost matched by his commitment to public service--he spent 16 \nyears working for the municipality of Anchorage, and was promoted to \ndirector of project management and engineering 8 years ago. Howard's \nlegacy is everywhere in Anchorage as he had a hand in most of the roads \nand major projects in the city.\n  Howard will be sorely missed by countless Alaskans. Not surprisingly, \nthe Discovery Theatre at the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts \noverflowed with all those who came to celebrate and honor Howard's \nlife. Howard is survived by his wife Roberta Carney; son Aaron Holtan \nand his wife, Carrie Holtan; daughter Kathryn Holtan, now at Washington \nState University; grandchildren, Erik and James; and brother Jay Holtan \nand his wife, Patricia O' Gorman. I would like to extend my condolences \nto his family and friends, and I wish his wife Roberta, who was injured \nin the crash, a speedy recovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/senate-section/article/S12861-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. JEROLD F. LUCEY\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the State of Vermont is proud that \none of its residents, Dr. Jerold F. Lucey, recently received the Alfred \nI. duPont Award for Excellence in Children's Health Care. The award is \noffered each year to an individual in the health care profession who \nhas made a major contribution to preventing childhood diseases.\n  Dr. Lucey helped pioneer phototherapy to prevent infant jaundice. He \nalso played an essential role in bringing artificial surfactants from \nJapan to this country. The surfactants help premature newborns breathe, \nand since their introduction in the United States just over 15 years \nago they have helped reduce infant mortality respiratory distress rate \nby 90 percent.\n  In addition, Dr. Lucey has developed the Vermont Oxford Network, \nwhich links 700 medical institutions in 25 nations to a network that \ntracks data on underweight-newborns, managing the data of more than \n50,000 infants each year. This collaborative system has enabled \nadvanced research, and the sharing of medical procedures that work, \namong pediatricians all over the globe.\n  Jerrold Lucey is Professor of Neonatology at the University of \nVermont College of Medicine, where he has taught for more than 50 \nyears. He also was the chief of Newborn Services at Fletcher Allen \nHealth Care medical center in Burlington, VT, and in addition served as \neditor-in-chief of the journal Pediatrics for 35 years.\n  We in Vermont are very proud of the work Dr. Jerold F. Lucey has \ndone, both with infants in our State, and for the health of children \neverywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/senate-section/article/S12861-4", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12861-S12862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL AIDS WALK PORTLAND\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, next Sunday, October 14, dedicated \nresidents of the Portland area will gather for the 21st annual AIDS \nWalk, an event that raises much needed funding to support the work of \nthe Cascade AIDS Project, CAP. I would like to recognize the\n\n[[Page S12862]]\n\ncommitment of the more than 10,000 walkers who are expected to turn out \nfor this year's walk. Their efforts will better enable CAP, as well as \na number of its community partners, including Our House and Esther's \nPantry, to continue gaining ground in Oregon's fight against HIV/AIDS.\n  In over two decades, AIDS Walk Portland has generated over $2.8 \nmillion in funding for critical services provided to the 6,000 area-\nfamilies who have a loved one living with HIV. I understand the \nchallenges organizations like CAP face in securing steady funding to \nsupport their work. With State and Federal support declining in recent \nyears, more and more is being asked of the community and the private \nsector. That is why I want to personally thank those participating in \nthis year's AIDS Walk, as well as the generous corporate sponsors who \nhave lent their support to ensure the event is a success.\n  While community efforts such as AIDS Walk Portland are a key \ncomponent in generating support for HIV/AIDS services, I believe we can \nand should do more at the Federal level. While participants will be \n``taking a stand'' next Sunday in the fight against AIDS, I want to \nreaffirm my pledge to do the same in Congress. It is a cause I have \nfought for in my 11-year tenure, and it is a cause I will continue to \nfight for until we are successful in eradicating this terrible disease. \nWhen Congress returns from the Columbus Day recess, the Senate will be \ndiscussing funding levels for next year's health and human services \nprograms. I will do my best to secure additional support for Ryan White \ninitiatives, especially those that support the work of local cities and \ncommunities like Portland. When we combine our efforts--at the local, \nState and Federal levels--we are stronger and more capable of turning \nthe tide against HIV/AIDS.\n  In closing, I congratulate the Cascade AIDS Project on yet another \nsuccessful AIDS Walk and wish all this year's participants a safe and \nenjoyable time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/15/senate-section/article/S12862-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 400.

(for himself and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 2160. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish a \npain care initiative in health care facilities of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I, along with my colleague Senator \nBrown, introduce legislation that would enhance VA's pain management \nprogram. It is estimated that nearly 30 percent of Americans, that is \nsome 86 million people, suffer from chronic or acute pain every year. A \nrecent study conducted by VA researchers in Connecticut found that \nnearly 50 percent\n\n[[Page S12871]]\n\nof veteran patients that are seen at VA facilities reported that they \nexperience pain regularly.\n  While pain increases in severity with age, it is also a growing \nproblem among younger veterans who have been injured in the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan. Many of these veterans are coming home with \nsevere injuries, often traumatic brain injuries, that require intensive \nrehabilitation. In some cases, these younger veterans will have to live \nwith the long-term effects of their injuries, of which pain is a large \nand debilitating part.\n  Pain management is an area of health care that by many accounts is \nnot yet up to par, in both the private and public sectors. The bill we \nare introducing would enhance VA's pain management program on a \nnational, system-wide level, by requiring VA to establish a pain care \ninitiative at every VA health care facility. Every hospital and clinic \nwould be required to employ a professionally recognized pain assessment \ntool or process, and ensure that every patient who is determined to be \nin chronic or acute pain is treated appropriately.\n  The profile of a veteran in pain is often times different than that \nof his or her counterpart in the private sector. For example, veterans \nsuffering from chronic pain are more likely to be receiving treatment \nfor other problems including depression, substance abuse, alcoholism, \nor post traumatic stress disorder. Understanding and treating their \npain must be a priority, and this bill will help VA enhance the \ndepartment's existing pain management program.\n  VA's current pain management efforts are worthwhile, but are \nunfortunately not adequate to meet the all of the needs of veterans. \nPain management in VA continues to be relatively decentralized and \nunstandardized. Some VA medical centers have adopted successful \napproaches and procedures to deal with pain, while others have been \nless active. Fortunately, VA has begun the work of identifying \nprofessional talent and developing ideas that provide the groundwork of \nan effective pain management program. This bill would build upon that \nfoundation and help ensure that these ideas become practice.\n  This bill provides us with an opportunity to help the thousands of \nveterans who are living in pain each and every day. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2160\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Pain Care Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Acute and chronic pain are prevalent conditions within \n     the population of veterans.\n       (2) Methods of modern warfare, including the use of \n     improvised explosive devices, produce substantial numbers of \n     battlefield casualties with significant damage to both the \n     central and peripheral nervous systems.\n       (3) The successes of military health care, both on and off \n     the battlefield, result in high survival rates of severely \n     injured military personnel who will be afflicted with \n     significant pain disorders on either an acute or chronic \n     basis.\n       (4) Failure to treat pain appropriately at the time of \n     transition from receipt of care from the Department of \n     Defense to receipt of care from the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs contributes to the development of long-term chronic \n     pain syndromes, in some cases accompanied by long-term mental \n     health and substance use disorders.\n       (5) Pain is a leading cause of short-term and long-term \n     disability among veterans.\n       (6) The Department of Veterans Affairs has implemented \n     important pain care programs at some facilities and in some \n     areas, but comprehensive pain care is not consistently \n     provided on a uniform basis throughout the health care system \n     of the Department to all patients in need of such care.\n       (7) Inconsistent and ineffective pain care provided by the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs leads to pain-related \n     impairments, occupational disability, and medical and mental \n     complications for veterans with acute and chronic pain, with \n     long-term costs for the health care and disability systems of \n     the Department and for society at large.\n       (8) Research, diagnosis, treatment, and management of acute \n     and chronic pain for veterans constitute health care \n     priorities of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today I introduce comprehensive legislation \nto improve the capacity of the Department of Veterans Affairs to care \nfor veterans with invisible wounds.\n  For too many veterans, returning home from battle will not bring an \nend to conflict. They will return home, but the war will follow them in \ntheir hearts and minds. Just as we support our troops as they fight in \nIraq and Afghanistan, we must support them when they return from war \nmarked by their service. Invisible wounds are complicated and wide-\nranging, and our solutions must rise to the challenge.\n  What do we know about the scope of the problem? A March 2007 study \npublished in the Archives of Internal Medicine reported that more than \none-third of war veterans who have served in either Iraq or Afghanistan \nare suffering from various mental ailments, including post-traumatic \nstress disorder, anxiety, depression, substance use disorder and other \nproblems. According to the study, a disproportionate number of young \nsoldiers suffer mental health problems.\n  There is no question that action is needed. One in five Iraq War \nveterans are likely to develop PTSD, as studies have estimated, and \nthis is but one aspect of the mental health challenges faced by \nveterans.\n  We also know that veterans suffering from physical and mental wounds \nuse drugs and alcohol to assuage their pain. Experts believe that \nstress is the number one cause of drug abuse, and of relapse to drug \nabuse. Mr. President, 60 to 80 percent of Vietnam veterans who have \nsought PTSD treatment have alcohol use disorders. VA has been dealing \nwith substance abuse issues for decades, but much remains to be done.\n  On April 25, 2007, I chaired a Committee on Veterans' Affairs hearing \non veterans' mental health concerns and on VA's response. We heard \nheart-wrenching testimony from the witnesses. Randall Omvig spoke of \nhis son's suicide upon returning from Iraq. Tony Bailey spoke of his \nson's struggle with substance abuse, and of his death. Patrick Campbell \nshared his own experience with PTSD and the experiences of his close \nfriends. Witnesses urged us to learn, and they urged us to act.\n  The provisions of this bill are a direct outgrowth of that hearing \nand the testimony given by those who have suffered with mental health \nissues, and by their family members.\n  This bill addresses the immediate needs of veterans by ensuring high \nquality mental health services at VA facilities and in their \ncommunities. The bill also looks to the future. Our legislation has \neleven core provisions. I will highlight some of them:\n  First, VA medical centers would be required to offer a minimum range \nof services for veterans in need of help to overcome their substance \nuse disorders. It would require programs to prevent relapse and to \nprovide medical treatments to reduce cravings for alcohol and drugs, \namong others. Many VA facilities have some of these programs but there \nis no universal minimum.\n  We know that there are large numbers of veterans suffering with a \nterrible confluence of substance use disorders and other mental health \ndisorders. The bill would require that both issues be treated by a \nwell-qualified team of health professionals who would treat the \ndisorders concurrently.\n  To ensure that innovative mental health services are tailored to \nindividual communities, the legislation would create grants to enhance \nprograms and fill holes. VA facilities would compete for grants for \nvarious purposes, from increasing weekend and evening hours to creating \nprograms which encourage urgent care physicians, who are often gateways \nfor new patients, to quickly refer those whom they believe may have a \nmental health disorder.\n  Veterans with debilitating mental health issues, including substance \nuse disorder and PTSD, may need inpatient care. VA has moved rapidly to \nreduce their inpatient mental health capacity, but there is no doubt \nthat inpatient stays are necessary for many veterans. This legislation \nwould require the VA Secretary to designate six inpatient facilities to \nprovide recovery services for veterans with comorbid PTSD and substance \nuse disorders.\n  The legislation would also require a comprehensive review of VA's \nresidential mental health facilities. This provision stems directly \nfrom the hearing testimony of Tony Bailey, whose son suffered from PTSD \nand substance abuse. Tony's son, Justin, died while in a VA \ndomiciliary. He overdosed on medications provided to him by VA. \nResidential facilities are a necessary part of VA's effort to treat \nmental health problems and they must be up to par.\n  It has been made clear to me, by mental health experts and veterans \nexperiencing mental health problems, that families need to be much more \ninvolved in the care of their loved ones. Families are suffering in \nmuch the same way that veterans themselves are suffering. They must \nhave access to care which will aid in the effective treatment and \nrehabilitation of a veteran. An existing provision of law allows such \ncare for family members. Our legislation simply restates this law and \nclarifies the type of services to which family members should have \naccess.\n  Finally, our goal is to define the best possible treatments for \nveterans now and in the future. To that end, this legislation sets up a \nmental health research program based on the successful pediatric \noncology model. We are proposing a network of sites with adequate \npatient flow and clinical and research expertise. The goal is to \npromote rapid progress from research to therapeutic advancement and \neffective treatments for PTSD and PTSD in the presence of a substance \nuse disorder.\n  An aggressive mental health agenda for veterans begins by providing \nVA with financial support. Our comprehensive legislation authorizes the \ncreation of new programs and expansion of existing ones. While these \nchanges amount to significant new funding, every dollar was included in \nour Committee's Views and Estimates Letter to the Budget Committee. The \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs requested a $700 million dollar increase \nin fiscal year 2008 for mental health programs, and the full Senate \nsupported this level in the final budget resolution. A similar level of \nfunding was supported by the full Senate in the VA appropriation bill.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this innovative and \ncomprehensive legislation, which will bring hope and progress to many \nveterans suffering from invisible wounds.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 2164. A bill to establish a Science and Technology Scholarship \nProgram to award scholarships to recruit and prepare students for \ncareers in the National Weather Service and in National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration marine research, atmospheric research, and \nsatellite programs and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I introduce the NOAA Scholarship Act \nof 2007 with my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran. This bill \nprovides a scholarship program for promising students who seek to \npursue an education in a relevant field of study and commit to work for \na branch of the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, \nincluding the National Weather Service, upon graduation.\n  Few can contend with the fact that there is a shortage of American \nstudents devoting themselves to the study of science, math and \nengineering. However, the demand for trained individuals in these \nprofessions is rising. In order to achieve their missions, Federal \norganizations like NOAA require a cadre of young talent to enter the \nworkforce with training in fields like meteorology, hydrology, and \noceanography.\n  In my great State of Oklahoma, we know the importance of NOAA, and \nparticularly the study of meteorology. Two weeks ago, I met with a \ngroup of Fire Marshalls who informed me that there are more declared \nnatural disasters per capita in Oklahoma than in\n\n[[Page S12873]]\n\nany other State in the Union. In May of each year, we experience an \naverage of twenty tornadoes. In fact, the fastest wind speed ever \nrecorded was in one of the May tornadoes to hit Oklahoma in 1999. As \nOklahomans, we know that having accurate and timely reporting of \natmospheric changes can mean the difference between life and death.\n  It is no surprise, then, that the University of Oklahoma, OU, has \ndeveloped an exceptional program for the study of meteorology. The OU \nSchool of Meteorology is the largest meteorology program in the nation, \nwith over 320 undergraduate students and 80 graduate students. It ranks \nfirst in the Nation in severe storms and mesoscale research and is \namong the top seven meteorology programs in the country. OU President \nDavid Boren, my predecessor in the Senate, targets the OU School of \nMeteorology to become the leading radar meteorology program in the \nworld.\n  The OU School of Meteorology is fortunate to have a state of the art \nfacility in the recently constructed National Weather Center. In this \n244,000 square foot structure, federal, state, and OU organizations \npartner together to better understand weather events occurring in the \natmosphere. The research that occurs in this center is truly \ngroundbreaking. The scientists who work at NWC, many of them working \nwith NOAA, have expertise in severe weather, local and regional \nclimate, numerical modeling, hydrology, and radar meteorology. Their \nwork is both abstract and tangible, using theory and advanced \nscientific research to improve the lives of individuals in Oklahoma and \naround the world.\n  The National Weather Center is the home of many notable achievements. \nNWC scientists were able to demonstrate that the Doppler weather radar \ncan be useful in detecting tornadoes, hail, and other severe weather \nevents. Using the Doppler radar, they have developed numerical \nforecasting models for government and industry applications. \nThe scientists at NWC are also known for taking risks to discover new \nand improved ways of collecting data and making observations; for \nexample, they can be credited with showing the effectiveness of rapidly \ndeployable, truck-mounted radars that they drive into the middle of \nfierce storms.\n\n  It is with the first-hand knowledge of the important work of the \nNational Weather Service and the National Oceanic Atmospheric \nAdministration's research in marine research, atmospheric research, and \nsatellite programs that I introduce this bill. The NOAA Scholarship Act \nof 2007 will establish a scholarship program for promising students who \ndesire to pursue an education in a relevant field of study and then \nserve as full-time employees of NOAA at the completion of their \ndegrees. The students will be required to work for NOAA for 24 months \nin return for each academic year that a scholarship is given. This \nprogram will provide an opportunity and an incentive for students to \ndevelop scientific expertise that will continue to enable NOAA, at \nfacilities like the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma and \nelsewhere, to attain its mission.\n  On September 17, 2007, the House of Representatives passed identical \nlegislation, H.R. 1657, by a vote of 360-16. I request that the Senate \nmove quickly on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2164\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE 2010 CENSUS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Article I of the United States Constitution requires \n     the taking of a census that counts all persons in the United \n     States.\n       (2) The census, taken every 10 years since 1790, is \n     necessary for determining Congressional representation, \n     Electoral College votes, and Government program funding.\n       (3) The data provided by the United States Bureau of the \n     Census is essential to understanding population trends and \n     providing the Federal Government and Congress with important \n     information related to public policy debates.\n       (4) According to the Brookings Institution, the Federal \n     Government disburses $323,000,000,000 through 100 Federal \n     programs to State and local governments based on data \n     provided by the census.\n       (5) Congress has historically provided increased funding \n     resources to the United States Bureau of the Census in years \n     prior to each decennial census to allow the Bureau to \n     adequately prepare for the taking of the census.\n       (6) Public Law 110-92, the continuing resolution, which \n     held funding increases for the census at previous fiscal year \n     levels, jeopardizes the ability of the United States Bureau \n     of the Census to prepare for the 2010 census.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that during the 2010 Census, all Federal agencies should \n     cooperate with the United States Bureau of the Census in a \n     manner consistent with the constitutional requirement to \n     count all persons in the United States, and that Congress \n     should provide adequate funding resources to the United \n     States Bureau of the Census to achieve an accurate census.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3302.
