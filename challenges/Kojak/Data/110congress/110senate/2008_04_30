Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man \nwho was a fixture of Kentucky basketball, with a fervent passion for \ncompetition and a fast loyalty to his country, his State, and his \nbeloved University of Kentucky Wildcats.\n  Bill Keightley, affectionately known as ``Mr. Wildcat,'' passed away \nrecently at the age of 81. He embodied the spirit and tradition that is \nKentucky basketball. Born William Bond Keightley in 1926, Mr. Keightley \nwas an All-State center for the Kavanaugh High School basketball team \nin his hometown of Lawrenceburg, KY.\n  He later enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and bravely served his \ncountry during World War II. After the war, Mr. Keightley spent much of \nhis young adulthood working as a mail carrier.\n  Then in 1962, his friend and fellow postman George Hukle asked him to \nhelp out washing jerseys and towels for the University of Kentucky \nmen's basketball team. Over the next 4\\1/2\\ decades, he proved himself \nindispensable as the school's top cheerleader, ambassador of goodwill \nand confidante to players and coaches alike.\n  ``Mr. Bill,'' as he was called by friends and family, witnessed three \nnational championships, befriended six\n\n[[Page S3554]]\n\nhead coaches, and cared for hundreds of players over his long career.\n  Loved by fans and respected by opponents, he earned a permanent seat \non the Kentucky bench at every game. In fact, Mr. Keightley attended \nmore than 1,400 UK basketball games, nearly 60 percent of all games \never recorded. And former UK basketball coach Orlando ``Tubby'' Smith \npoints out that ``it has been . . . us [coaches] sitting next to him, \nnot him sitting next to us.''\n  Mr. Keightley often served as a father-like figure to the players, \nand many recall his talks with ``his boys'' on anything from Kentucky \nsports to lessons of integrity and pride. ``Players, coaches, and \nathletic directors come and go, but Bill Keightley was constant,'' says \nKenny Walker, a friend and former UK player.\n  John Pelphrey, member of the ``Unforgettable'' 1992 Wildcats team and \nnow head coach at Arkansas University, says:\n\n       For 48 years, Mr. Bill looked over coaches and student-\n     athletes with love and care that only a father could give . . \n     . every time we had an encounter, there was a hearty hello, a \n     hug, and a laugh, every single time, just like the first \n     time.\n\n  In 1997, Mr. Bill's jersey was elevated into the rafters of Rupp \nArena, making him one of only two people to receive this honor without \nhaving taken to the court to play the game.\n  In 2005, he was entered with the charter class into the UK Athletics \nHall of Fame. The equipment room in Lexington's Memorial Coliseum was \nnamed in his honor, and he humbly presided over it until his \nunfortunate passing this past March 31.\n  Noted Lexington sportscaster and friend Dave Baker says of Mr. \nKeightley:\n\n       He knew just when to lend a hand to the young man from \n     Appalachia who was adjusting to the big city, or a young man \n     who had been recruited from out-of-state and was getting \n     accustomed to a brand new life in Kentucky. Mr. Keightley \n     lived his life as a celebration.\n\n  Perhaps the most lasting tribute to Bill began in 2002, when the \nUniversity of Kentucky athletic department presented its first Bill \nKeightley Award to the individual ``who exemplifies the pride, respect, \nand positive attributes'' associated with the University of Kentucky \nbasketball program. They still present this award annually, to honor \nMr. Bill.\n  UK followers and basketball lovers across the Commonwealth have lost \nthe sport's No. 1 fan. And I know I speak for all of them when I say \nour prayers and best wishes of support go out to his family, including \nhis wife, Hazel; and his daughter and son-in-law, Karen and Alden \nMarlowe.\n  UK President Lee Todd, Jr., best expressed what many Kentuckians are \nfeeling when he said that we have ``lost someone who was not only the \nface of Kentucky Wildcat basketball, but the University itself.'' I \nsecond his words, and add to them my own: We will not soon forget the \nloyalty, passion, and dedication to excellence that Bill Keightley \nexemplified.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/30/senate-section/article/S3554-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, if you sat down this morning to design a \nsystem that would offer American workers the most secure retirement \npossible, where would you start? If you are starting from scratch, what \nprinciples would guide you?\n  Here are a few I think you might begin with. First, you want to \nencourage companies to offer secure retirement benefits. That is \nobvious. Second, you want to ensure that companies keep their promises \nto their employees and retirees. That ought to be at the top of the \nlist. Third, don't create circumstances under which employers decide \nthey can't afford to keep offering decent retirement benefits without \nbecoming uncompetitive as a business or insolvent. That is pretty \nsensible. Fourth, treat all the companies in an industry equally so as \nnot to pick the winners and losers. Don't tip the scales.\n  There are many other goals you might set out to achieve. Of course, \nwe are not starting from scratch this morning, and this is not \nprimarily a pensions bill, it is a reauthorization bill for the Federal \nAviation Administration. But the substitute amendment we are now \nconsidering contains one pension provision that I think violates the \nprinciples I just laid out. That is why I am offering an amendment with \nSenator Hutchison of Texas, with a lengthy list of bipartisan \ncosponsors, to strike that provision of the bill.\n  The impact of our amendment will be to provide retirement security \nfor over 180,000 American workers and at the same time maintain air \nservice for all of our constituents in over 300 cities in our Nation \nand around the world.\n  Who supports this amendment dealing with the pensions of workers? The \nworkers themselves. It is supported by the 135,000-strong Transport \nWorkers Union of the AFL/CIO, and it is supported by a long list, a \nbipartisan list of cosponsors starting with Senator Hutchison, who will \nbe speaking a little later on this amendment this morning, as well as \nSenator Brown of Ohio, Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma, Senator Lautenberg \nof New Jersey, Senator Voinovich of Ohio, Senator Bill Nelson of \nFlorida, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, Senator Bob Menendez of New \nJersey, and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. As you can tell from this list, \nthis is a very diverse sponsorship--both sides of the aisle, all over \nthe country. We have the support of the workers whose pensions are \nbeing affected, and we have the support of Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle in a bipartisan fashion to strike this section of the bill.\n  It is a little complicated, but for the record we need to get into \nthe background of why we are here today.\n  In 2006, we passed the Pension Protection Act, which established new \nrules for defining which companies were meeting their obligations to \ntheir employees and retirees and which companies were not. All the \ncompanies in America were, in effect, given 7 years to catch up on any \nunderfunded pension plan, and rules were established regarding how the \nunderfunding was to be estimated. That is only right and sensible \nbecause if we are going to offer a pension to an employee and the \nemployee can count on that pension, they have to make sure the pension \nplan is adequately funded so when they call on that plan at the time of \nretirement, the benefits will be there, the benefits that have been \npromised over the lifetime of a worker.\n  It affected all the companies in America except for airlines. We \nrecognized at the time that the airlines were facing unique \ncircumstances. They owed huge amounts of money to hundreds of thousands \nof workers and retirees, and yet they were facing a very\n\n[[Page S3555]]\n\ndifficult struggle to profitability after 9/11. We all recall what \nhappened. Airlines were shut down completely across the United States \nand then air travel was at least compromised if not inhibited for \nmonths and years afterward.\n  We understood the airline industry needed special consideration, so \nwe gave the airlines a special arrangement when it came to funding \ntheir pension plans. We said airlines had 10 years to make their \npensions whole instead of 7 years, which gave them a little longer \nperiod of time. We allowed the airlines to assume a rate of return on \ntheir investments of 6 percent instead of assuming a lower rate based \non the formula that other companies were forced to use--all airlines, \nthat is, except for two, Delta and Northwest. These airlines had frozen \ntheir defined benefit retirement plans.\n  What does that mean to freeze the benefit plan? It meant no new \nworkers at those airlines could participate. It meant the workers then \nworking were covered by their defined benefit pension plans; those new \nworkers coming onboard at these airlines did not get that benefit; and \nno new benefits could be provided to existing workers and retirees. The \ncurrent pension benefits were frozen, excluded new employees from \ncoverage.\n  So, in a way, Delta and Northwest were given special treatment. They \nwere allowed to deal with their retirees in a different fashion than \nany company in America, than any airline in America. These airlines \nwere told they could take 17 years to catch up on the payments instead \nof 10 years, and they could assume a rate of return of not 6 percent \nbut 8.85 percent. It was a very generous deal.\n  Let me restate that another way. Some airlines, but not all of them, \ncould assume a far higher rate of return and spread their payments over \na much longer period of time. What difference does it make? It meant \nthose airlines, Delta and Northwest, had to set aside far less cash \ntoward their pension plans each year than the other airlines with which \nthey were competing.\n  In a very competitive industry such as air travel in this country, \nthis created a huge advantage for these two airlines, Delta and \nNorthwest. To make matters worse, we rewarded the airlines that froze \ntheir pensions. Let's compare that result then to the principles I laid \nout at the beginning of the statement.\n  Did we encourage, with this decision, companies to offer secure \nretirement benefits? No. It seems to me instead we encouraged companies \nto freeze their benefit plans.\n  Second, did we ensure that companies keep their promises to their \nemployees and retirees? I do not know about that. Does allowing \ncompanies to take 17 years to adequately fund their obligations ensure \nthat they keep their promise? It is a fair question.\n  Third, did we avoid creating circumstances under which employers \nmight decide they could not afford to keep offering decent retirement \nbenefits without becoming uncompetitive or even insolvent? I think \ntrying to avoid this scenario was part of the rationale for giving \nairlines a bit more of a cushion. So perhaps we did.\n  Did we treat all companies in an industry equally, so as not to pick \nwinners and losers and create a competitive advantage for some airlines \nover others? We most certainly did not.\n  Now, fast-forward to last year. On the first day of the new Congress, \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas introduced legislation to bring \nmore balance to pension rules for the airline industry. We passed this \nlegislation as part of the Iraq supplemental last spring, and I \nsupported Senator Hutchison.\n  What did the language do? It gave the airlines that have not frozen \ntheir pension plans--and let me be specific which airlines: American \nAirlines, Continental, Hawaiian, Alaskan, and US Airways--the \nopportunity to assume a better rate of return on their investments. \nThey now can assume a rate of return of 8.25 percent.\n  Remember, Delta and Northwest, under the law that we passed, can \nassume a rate of return of 8.85 percent, whether that, in fact, takes \nplace. So even under the existing law before the bill that we have \nbefore us, those two airlines are going to benefit. They get a better \nbreak, better treatment, Delta and Northwest, than all the other \nairlines, and they can smooth out these payments over 17 years, not 10 \nyears.\n  So did the change in the law on pensions benefit those two airlines \ninitially? Yes. Is their benefit compromised by what we are doing with \nthis amendment today? No. But does it bring the other airlines in the \ncountry closer to the same treatment? Yes, it does. So we still have \nnot provided all of the industry players with parity. Delta and \nNorthwest still do much better. The airlines that are still trying to \nprovide their workers secure retirements through defined benefit plans \nthat are not frozen are still getting a much worse deal than the \nairlines that froze their plans, but it is a bit fairer.\n  So what was done years ago rewarded those airlines--struggling, I \nwill concede--with better treatment in terms of funding their pension \nplans from a corporate point of view than other airlines. What we are \ndoing today is lessening that advantage slightly but not at the expense \nof Delta and Northwest. In fact, what we are doing is maintaining what \nhas been the law since last year. That brings us today to this \nsubstitute amendment which we are considering.\n  Section 808 of the substitute amendment would place new \nresponsibilities on only those airlines that we tried to help last \nyear. This section would once again widen the disparity between the \nrules that apply to some airlines versus the rules that apply to \nothers. That does not make any sense. This section would require only \nthe five airlines that I mentioned to fully fund all new pension \nobligations this year and every year going forward, only those five \nairlines.\n  Now, you might say, in a vacuum that seems reasonable, fully funding \na pension. We want companies to pay their pension plans, right? Well, \nit is up to a reasonable point. There are three fundamental problems \nthat I think are very important for my colleagues to understand. First, \nthe provision in the bill which Senator Hutchison and I would strike \npenalizes the airlines that have worked the hardest to fully fund their \npensions already. Don't we want companies to work hard to fully fund \ntheir pensions? If we do, why would we want this section of the bill \nwhich penalizes them for their effort to protect their workers and be \nfair in their pension plans?\n  Take American Airlines, for example. According to the rules, American \nAirlines' pensions are 116 percent funded. To put it another way, the \nmanagement has put more money into their pension plans than they \nactually need to put in to make sure they make all of the payments \npromised, 16 percent more. It is not as if American is \nunderfunding their pensions; they are overfunding their requirements. \nThe assets on hand, after assuming the investment rate of return over \ntime, are worth more than what American Airlines has promised its \nworkers and retirees. How can we ask for anything more than that?\n\n  So why should American Airlines have to then fully fund all of its \nnew obligations each year so it continually maintains 116 percent \nfunding? Is not 100 percent enough?\n  Second, this provision unnecessarily pushes these five airlines \ncloser to bankruptcy. Is it really in our Nation's best interest that \nthese five airlines pay an additional $2 billion into their pension \nfunds over the next 5 years when they simply do not have cash laying \naround?\n  As a national policy, is it better for us to have more airlines or \nfewer? Do we want more competition or less? Do we want fewer \nbankruptcies or more? And if we really care about the retirements of \nthese hundreds of thousands of workers who are employed at these five \nmajor airlines, why would we push their companies closer to bankruptcy?\n  Do you know what happens when a company goes into bankruptcy? Ask the \nemployees of United Airlines what happened? The first casualty is their \npension plan. I have been there. They are based in Illinois; they are \nbased in Chicago. It was painful. And if you push more airlines into \nbankruptcy, you are not helping their workers and their retirement, you \nare jeopardizing it.\n  If that sounds dramatic, I would like to show this chart to my \ncolleagues who are following this debate. These are the bankrupt \nairlines, recent bankrupt airlines: Frontier Airlines filed for\n\n[[Page S3556]]\n\nbankruptcy, 6,000 employees were affected by that decision; ATA filed \nfor bankruptcy, 2,230 employees affected; Skybus, 450 employees \nterminated; Aloha, 1,900 employees; EOS airlines, 450 employees.\n  This is the reality of the airline industry today. By my count, over \n11,000 employees were affected by these bankruptcies. So why in the \nworld would we put a provision in this bill which would require our \nairlines, these five airlines, to put dramatically more cash into these \npensions, beyond what is required of other airlines, beyond what is \nrequired for 100 percent funding, and jeopardize them and endanger them \nso that they face bankruptcy?\n  Let's look at the losses recently reported for the first quarter by \nsome of the largest domestic carriers, just in case those who are \ncritical of this amendment believe these airlines are flush with cash. \nLook at what happened in the first quarter of this year: Delta \nAirlines' first quarter losses, $274 million; American Airlines, $328 \nmillion; and United, $537 million.\n  If there is someone who believes--and I do not know who it might be--\nthat the airline industry is so flush with cash, that they are so \nstrong they can handle this new pension requirement that is put in this \nbill, and it will not have a negative impact, they have not noticed the \nreports on the first quarter. In virtually every instance every airline \nin America has struggled and fallen behind because of jet fuel costs.\n  Now comes this bill, not providing these airlines a helping hand \nthrough one of their most difficult periods in history where \nbankruptcies are rampant and losses are at record levels. This bill \nimposes new regulations on airlines struggling to survive.\n  At a time where crude oil is threatening to reach $120 a barrel--it \ndid last week--and jet fuel is pushing $160 a barrel, I do not think \nthe airlines are in a position to add another $2 billion to their \npensions which are already well funded.\n  Remember, Delta and Northwest were given a privileged position when \nit came to the treatment of their pension plans under the law. They did \nnot have to put as much money into their pension plans. They were given \na longer period of time to pay out or to fund them, 17 years, and the \nrest of the airlines were given circumstances which were more demanding \nof them. They had to put in more money.\n  What Senator Hutchison and I are trying to do is protect a difference \nbut one that we think is reasonable. What the bill does is to push \nthese airlines at exactly the wrong moment in America's business \nhistory into a position where they are going to have to surrender cash \nreserves and risk bankruptcy.\n  Now, is that in the best interests of the workers and the pilots of \nthose airlines? Eleven thousand workers at airlines are already \nbankrupt or out of work. There are over 180,000 workers in America who \nstand to lose nearly everything if we push these airlines into \nbankruptcy, and the over 300 cities that could lose air service and \nface higher fares? Why? Why do we want this?\n  Third, and finally, this provision creates an even larger disparity \nbetween the way some airlines are treated and the way other airlines \nare treated. In this most competitive industry, why in the world are we \ntrying to tip the scales to the advantage of some airlines and push \nothers near bankruptcy? It does not sound right.\n  Why are we demanding these five airlines to follow rules that no \nother company in America must follow? Why are we demanding these five \nairlines follow rules that two of their competitors do not have to \nfollow?\n  The amendment I have with Senator Hutchison and others would strike \nthis provision from the bill and leave current law unchanged. I think \nthis is important to all Senators. It is not just an issue for those of \nus whose home States entertain these airlines and have them as \ncarriers. I urge every Member who is interested in providing equitable \ntreatment under the law to all companies in a given industry to support \nour amendment.\n  Do this for 180,000 workers who have weighed in, whose pensions are \nat stake and strike section 808. It is a bad idea. And let me also say \nthis on behalf of the largest carrier affected, American Airlines. This \nlegacy carrier is the only one left--of the larger carriers, I should \nsay--that has not gone through bankruptcy. They have made sacrifices. \nThey have cut back. They have tried to protect their workers and \nprovide quality service. It has not been easy.\n  Now they are facing recordbreaking jet fuel costs. That is a reality. \nThey have tried to keep their word to their unionized workforce to keep \nthem on the job, to pay them as promised, to give them the pension they \npromised. Why do we want to punish good conduct? Why do we want to \npunish an airline that has tried its level best to keep its word to its \nemployees and retirees? That is a question not only asked by the \nmanagement of American Airlines, it is being asked by the workers of \nAmerican Airlines.\n  They oppose section 808. They think it could be the end of their \nairline. What a legacy we would leave at the end of the day if we pass \na bill that is supposed to pass to make air travel safer and jeopardize \nthe existence of five major airlines in the process. That is exactly \nwhat section 808 would do.\n\n  I urge every Member who is interested in giving their constituents as \nmany options for flight travel as possible by keeping afloat as many \nairlines as we can to support our amendment. I thank the 135,000 \nmembers of the transport workers unions whose pensions are at issue \nwith this amendment. They have stood up in what I think is the best \ninterest not only of transportation workers today but those retirees. I \nthank Senators Hutchison, Brown, Inhofe, Lautenberg, Voinovich, Nelson, \nCornyn, Menendez, and Harkin for cosponsoring the amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us. Let's strip this section from the bill and then \nmove forward to do what we need to do to make American air travel safe \nand to respect the companies and workers we count on every day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for \ntaking the lead on this very important amendment. He and I are in \ncomplete agreement. I have never seen a time or an amendment or an \nissue before our Senate that has shown the companies fighting so hard \nto do the right thing for their employees; the employees standing with \nthem in total solidarity, saying: This is something we should be \nencouraging companies to do, not discouraging companies from doing; \nthat is, to provide the very best pension plan.\n  These are huge corporations. American, Continental, US Air, these are \nbig corporations. They are trying to do the very best. They are going \nthe extra mile for their employees. Yet they can't rely on the Congress \nto make a law and then keep it.\n  Let's go back a little bit in history. First, we settled this issue \nin a very hard-fought negotiation last year. We had airlines that chose \nto keep their defined benefit plans, doing the very best for their \nemployees they could, making added contributions based on the law as it \nwas. So they got ahead in their backup payments because, under the law \nas it was, anything in excess of their backup payments would help them \noffset their going-forward payments. They were in relatively good \nshape, as good shape as an airline could be last year. They had extra \nmoney. They poured it right into their pension plans. They overfunded \ntheir past obligations or the obligations they had for their past \npension deficits. They did that, thinking that if they got into a \ncashflow problem, they would be able to offset those overages, which is \nwhat the law has been.\n  Now, in an aviation modernization bill that is to modernize our air \ntraffic control system, that will address the safety issues we want to \nmake sure are the very best that we can provide for consumers and \npassengers, a bill that will provide a passenger bill of rights--when a \npassenger is in an airplane and it is delayed, there are going to be \nnew rules; there will be plans that have to be submitted for airlines \nto take care of them--in a bill that has so much good, that came out of \nthe Commerce Committee, of which I am the ranking member of the \nAviation Subcommittee and Senator Rockefeller is the chairman, it came \nout with complete bipartisan support. Now we have in the\n\n[[Page S3557]]\n\npackage that is going to be put forward a rehash of long negotiations \nthat were settled last year.\n  I will take a moment here to say that I had a very telling \nconversation with the CEO of a major international corporation based in \nAmerica.\n  I said: Why are you opening plants overseas instead of America? Why \nare you sending jobs overseas instead of America?\n  This CEO said: Well, really, basically two things. One is, the \nregulatory environment is better overseas. And secondly, the regulatory \nlaws are more stable.\n  I said: More stable? This is America. What do you mean? There is a \ncountry overseas that has more stable regulations?\n  He said: Absolutely. Because we can't count on the law being the law. \nWe see time and time again Congress or a regulator coming in, after a \nlaw has been on the books, we have done things in compliance with the \nlaw, relying that it is the law, and Congress changes something that \naffects something that we have done in reliance on that law.\n  I said: If there is one thing that the United States should be able \nto do, it would be leading in stability in laws and regulations. Maybe \nthere are too many laws and regulations. Maybe there are too many \ntaxes. But at least we should be able to be stable. We are the greatest \neconomy on Earth.\n  Yet here we have a prime example of a law that was passed, \ncontributions were made from the company to these pension systems based \non the law that was passed, thinking we had come to an agreement. It \nwas hard fought. A deal is a deal.\n  Let's go back and look at that law. In 2006, Congress passed the \nPension Protection Act. Included in that legislation was a change in \nfunding rules for airlines that had chosen to freeze their defined \nbenefit pension plans. I argued strongly at the time that the playing \nfield should be leveled for those carriers that continued to meet their \nobligations. There was virtually unanimous support for this view in the \nSenate. But in conference, the chairman of the Committee on Ways and \nMeans of the House, who is no longer a Member of Congress, refused a \nprovision that would level that playing field. Accordingly, we reached \nagreement with the leadership of the Senate at the time that we would \ntake the first available opportunity in the next Congress to rectify \nthis inequity. That is why on January 4, 2007, my colleague from Texas, \nSenator Cornyn, and I introduced S. 191. This bill was referred to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. My staff also \nprovided it to Finance Committee staff and personally briefed them on \nthe bill on January 26, 2007.\n\n  The bill, which was subsequently enacted into law, established \nfunding rules that, while not as generous as those given to airlines \nthat froze their plans, were at least more equitable and created a \nbetter unlevel playing field than we had seen in the 2006 bill. It was \nvery clear, when we introduced this bill, that we had it out there for \nthe purpose of everyone knowing that we intended to offer it when \nappropriate legislation came through. That is the way things work in \nthe Senate.\n  The provision adopted by the Senate and agreed to by the House is the \nexact language we drafted in S. 191. It should be a surprise to no one \nthat we would offer that bill at the first available opportunity, which \nwas the last omnibus appropriations bill. There has been something said \nin writing in opposition to our amendment, that this was a big surprise \nthat was crammed into the supplemental appropriations bill. It was not \na surprise. It was out there in the open. All of the relevant \ncommittees had been briefed and knew this was a bill that was pending \nthat would be available for amending a proper vehicle. The proper \nvehicle was the appropriations omnibus, because there was not anything \nelse that was going through.\n  None of the airlines adversely affected by the proposed change in the \npension laws has missed a pension payment under current law. The \ngreatest risk to pensions is bankruptcy. I am not saying the proposal \nin the bill would necessarily result in bankruptcy of these carriers, \nalthough that has been brought up as one eventuality. But at the very \nbest case, it is going to restrict their cash reserves precisely at a \ntime when they need it the most. Jet fuel is now being sold at $160 a \nbarrel. At these prices, it is a race against time for airlines to \npreserve their cash. For Congress to intervene now, undo a law that was \npassed and relied on by the airlines to restrict the flexibility of a \nfew airlines that need the maximum flexibility to meet this crisis, \nwould be irresponsible.\n  It is as if maybe some of our Senators who I think have very good \nmotives are not realizing the situation today, which is 10 times worse \nthan it was last year when this legislation was passed. Prices of oil \nhave gone up. Every airline is on its knees. Everyone is struggling. We \nare seeing the beginning of mergers, which I don't like, but it is a \nfree world, and I don't think we have the right to intervene. But I \ndon't want to have fewer airlines. I want our airlines to be robust, \ncompete, and do the best for their employees they can possibly do.\n  It is as if we are living in another world to think that this is not \na crisis time for the airlines. I don't want to hurt the other airlines \neither. I have nothing against Delta and Northwest. I hope they \nsurvive. I hope they do very well, because the more airlines we have \ndoing well, the better it is for consumers and passengers. But I want \nto make sure that airlines that have kept their defined benefit plans, \nthat are trying to go the extra mile for their employees and do the \nvery most they can, as they are at the same time struggling with the \nhigher cost of fuel, especially, I don't think we ought to penalize \nthem. I don't think we ought to retroactively change what they relied \non and made contributions to their pension plans, relying that the law \nwas the law, and that the Senate and the Congress was a body of \nintelligent people who could reasonably look at the economic news in \nthe world and know this is not a time when we would destabilize and \nfurther hurt an industry that is so important to commerce and the \noverall viability of our country.\n  Let's put it on the table. In the past 5 years, American Airlines has \nmade $1.7 billion in contributions to its pension plans, when--I may be \nwrong; I am not saying that I know exactly--in the last 5 years, I \nmight remember two quarters, maybe three, where they have actually \nshown a profit. Maybe it has been 1 year out of 5. But every time I \npick up the papers, I am not seeing airlines with robust profits being \nreported at the end of a quarter. Last year alone, as oil prices were \ngoing up--and jet fuel is even more expensive than gasoline--they made \na contribution of $386 million, which is more than they needed to make \nto keep their obligations current. Under the rules in place today, \nbefore this change would take place, they are 115 percent funded.\n  Continental Airlines has made a $1.3 billion contribution to its \ndefined benefit pension plan in the previous 5 years, including $336 \nmillion last year--significantly above the minimum funding required. So \nif there is anything our Senate ought to be able to do, it is, No. 1, \nwhen a law is passed and relied on, that we would not retroactively \nchange that law to penalize one company in an industry. It is not the \nplace of the Senate to pick winners and losers. We are the model of \nfree enterprise in the world, and we must keep that stability.\n  Secondly, if the parts of the bill that are being added that are \nextraneous to the underlying FAA modernization bill stay in, it is \ngoing to bring down a great bill, a bipartisan bill, that my colleague, \nSenator Rockefeller, and I have worked on very hard, along with Senator \nInouye and Senator Stevens, the chairman and vice chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  We have all supported the bill that came out of Commerce almost \nunanimously. It has been a joy to work on a bill that provides a better \nconsumer environment, a safer environment for passengers, that would \nmodernize our air traffic control system even further, that would \naddress the issues that have been raised in the last few months about \npassengers being held hostage on airplanes that are on the ground, and \ngiving them rights, and requiring airlines to do right by them. It is a \ngreat bill.\n  But if we do not strike this pension plan--which I do not think is \nright in any sense of the word--if we do not strike this from the bill, \nand if we do not take out some of the other extraneous tax provisions \nwe will deal with\n\n[[Page S3558]]\n\nlater that do not have anything to do with aviation, it is going to do \ngreat damage to the flying public and to commerce in our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at the arguments and help us remain \nstable--as stable as an airline can be in this very volatile \nenvironment. Let's not change the rules. Let's not give advantages to \none over another. Let's try to help all of the airlines make it, be \nprofitable, be robust, provide competition, and, especially, give the \nvery best benefits to their hard-working employees they can possibly \ndo. And, please, let's do not penalize those that are going the extra \nmile and giving their employees what is becoming more and more rare in \nthis country today, and that is defined benefits for their pension \nplans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on the surface, this is a complicated \nmatter. Pension law is complicated. It gets into whether a company has \na defined contribution plan, a defined benefit plan, issues such as: \nWhat is the assumed interest rate that applies to the pension plan? It \nis backwards: the higher the rate, frankly, the less of an obligation \nby the company to contribute to the plan. I think on the surface we \nwould think it would be a little bit of the opposite. It gets into \nlength of years, the time within which companies are required to \ncontribute to their plan to fully fund their plan. It is very \ncomplicated on the surface.\n  It is very simple. This question we are dealing with here is very \nsimple when you get down to what is going on around here. So I ask my \ncolleagues to pay a lot of attention to the statistics and all the \ncomplexities at the surface, but pay more attention to what is going on \nhere. After all the charts and all the statistics and all the stuff, \nwhat is going on here?\n  I think Senators and their staffs will find, when they do that, what \nis going on here is the question of--there are two questions here--do \nwe want to keep the playing field level among the airlines? Airlines \nare going through some difficult times today, clearly. Fuel costs are \nhigh. There are other problems facing the airlines. But do we want the \nplaying field to be level? The second question: Do we want to help \nprovide adequate protection to the pension plans, to retirees? Those \nare the two basic questions.\n  So how did we get here? Back several years ago, after 9/11, and when \nthe country was facing some economic difficulties, when pension plans \nwere going belly up because companies, regrettably, were not adequately \nfunding their pension plans--especially the defined benefit plans; to \nsome degree, the defined contributions, but especially defined benefit \nplans--what did we do? We in the Congress exercised our responsibility \nto do something about all that. What did we do?\n  In 2006, we passed a pension bill. What did that provide? Well, we \nwere kind of caught in the middle--Congress was--especially with \nrespect to airlines because after 9/11, airlines were not doing well at \nall because people were not flying as much, and they were under \nsignificant stress and strain, and, at the same time, pension plans \nwere not in good shape generally--not just airline pension plans but \nother companies' pension plans.\n  So we refined the law in 2006 to give much more protection to \nretirees in their pension plans because companies basically were not \ndoing what they should have been doing back up to that time.\n  We had another little problem on the side, and that was airlines \nbecause they were under a lot more financial stress than other \ncompanies in the United States generally. So what did we do? We said: \nWell, we want to help the airlines. We do not want to hurt the \nairlines. We also want to protect the pension plans. So we raised the \npension plan requirements that all companies must face.\n  But we gave a little break to the airlines. We gave a longer period \nof time in which they had to fully fund their plans. We said: For those \nthat are in bankruptcy--there were a couple back then--you get a long \ntime. You get 17 years. We will also give you a big, high interest \nrate. ``Big, high interest rate'' means it is computed at a greater \nrate of return on your assets so you do not have to contribute as much \nto the plan. We also gave a big break to the airlines that were not in \nbankruptcy. We gave them 10 years. The standard rule was 6 years for \nall other companies. We said: OK, you are in real stress. You get 17 \nyears. If you are in some stress--not as much--you get 10 years. Those \nare companies that were not in as much stress. Those are companies that \ndid not freeze their plans, whereas, those that had 17 years did freeze \ntheir plans. We said: OK, after 10 years and 17 years, the playing \nfield will be back to level again.\n\n  A couple airlines with plans that were not frozen, that had the 10-\nyear requirement--remember, the standard rule is 6 years, but they got \nthe 10 years, not the 17 years--said: Wait a minute, you are helping \nthose who are in bankruptcy too much at our expense. They said they \nwere doing the right thing. So we said: OK--that is what this bill \ndoes--OK, we will give you virtually the same interest rate as the \nothers. What does that mean? It means you do not have to contribute to \nyour pension plan. You do not have to.\n  So we think that levels the playing field because now all companies \nwill have to contribute to their plans, at least prospectively. We are \nsaying to the other companies--the 10-year companies--you do not have \nto contribute to your plan up to today's date, up to 2008. You are \nfree. You are off the hook.\n  So these arguments you hear on the floor that this underlying bill is \nputting financial stress on certain companies are not true because \nthose companies will not have any obligation to contribute more to \ntheir pension plan for past liabilities, but they will currently.\n  We think that is a fair compromise. This is not a perfect world. But \nunder our committee bill, it is clear it is basically a level playing \nfield because all companies now will have the same computed interest \nrate to calculate what their assets are to indicate the degree to which \nthey have to contribute to the plans.\n  Now the Durbin amendment says: No. No. We want to give a bigger break \nto the companies that do not freeze their plans that are not in \nbankruptcy. The effect of the Durbin amendment will be that those \ncompanies will not have to contribute to their pension plans. They have \nnot, and they will not have to for a couple years in the future because \nthe Durbin amendment gives a higher interest rate, which, in effect, \nmeans they will not have to contribute.\n  Well, if I am a retiree, and I work for one of these airlines, I \nwould say: Wait a minute. I want to make sure I am protected too.\n  So, as I said, there are two questions here. Is the playing field \nlevel? And, are we going to protect the pension plans?\n  The effect of the committee bill is to level things off. It is not \nperfect, but it is almost perfect; where the effect of the Durbin \namendment is to make it much less perfect and basically help a couple \nairlines that, as a consequence, will not have to contribute to their \npension plans for past liabilities, and will not have to in the future \neither, because of the interest rate they provide for in their \namendment, and other airlines will have to contribute into their plans.\n  I say the right answer here--airlines are squabbling among themselves \nover all this--the right answer is to keep it fair for everybody, have \nthe same law essentially apply for everybody. The committee bill does \nthat.\n  I might say also, we want to protect our pension plans because that \nwas the whole purpose of the 2006 pension bill. The effect of the \nDurbin amendment is to say: No, these plans are not going to be \nprotected as much under the Durbin amendment. That is not the right \nthing to do.\n  There are some who say: Gee, this is going to cause bankruptcies in \nthe poor financial condition the country is in right now. That is a \nbogus argument. We are saying: Keep the playing field level. That is \nall we are saying in this committee bill. It is not going to affect the \nbottom line. Our committee bill will not affect the bottom line of \nthese airlines because, basically, it is a cashflow issue because cash \nis transferrable between the plan and the\n\n[[Page S3559]]\n\ncompany. So it is not going to affect the bottom line of these airlines \nat all--the committee bill--nor will the Durbin amendment affect the \nbottom line. That is a bogus argument.\n  But the effect of the Durbin amendment is to give less protection to \nretirees--that is indisputable--less protection to retirees. And do not \nforget, under the 2006 pension bill, we were trying to give more \nprotection to retirees.\n  Also, the second effect of the Durbin amendment is to unlevel the \nplaying field. It favors certain airlines at the expense of others. I \nthink the best policy is to protect pensioners and to protect retirees, \nand also to keep the playing field level. That is why I think it is \nbetter to not adopt the Durbin amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I respect the Senator who is the chairman \nof the Finance Committee. It is one of the toughest assignments on \nCapitol Hill. He has adequately described what I think is the challenge \nof pension plans--how to make sure companies put the money in they \npromised, and to keep their promise to their retirees.\n  What I am saying is, the approach the Senator brings to the floor, in \nsection 808, is opposed by the retirees and workers. They do not \nbelieve it is in their best interest. They certainly do not think it is \nin their best interest if their airline goes into bankruptcy. They know \nwhat has happened repeatedly. When an airline goes into bankruptcy, the \nfirst losers are the retirees and the pension benefits of current \nworkers. They are worried, and they should be. Look at how precarious \nthis industry is, with the jet fuel costs and the record losses these \nairlines are facing.\n  Secondly, I cannot quarrel with the chairman's premise about keeping \nthe playing field level when it comes to airlines. But if that is the \ncase, how can he explain to us that two airlines are treated so \ndramatically different than others? Delta and Northwest have 17 years \nto make their pension liability right. We assume they are going to earn \n8.85 percent each year on their investments regardless of what they \nactually earn.\n  The airlines we are talking about have 10 years to make their pension \nliability right, and their assumption of interest is 8.25 percent. \nDoesn't sound like much. It has been dismissed a little bit here. But \nif you are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars that are being \ninvested in pension funds, you can understand the impact this might \nhave.\n  The last point I wish to make is this: Senator Hutchison and I wish \nto keep the status quo. The section 808 amendment we want to strike \nchanges it. Under the current status, the largest airline affected, \nAmerican Airlines, has 115 percent of funding--115 percent. They are \nnot falling behind; they are keeping their word to their employees and \ntheir retirees. That is why I hope my colleagues will support our \namendment to strike section 808.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent before yielding the floor that \nSenator Bond be added as a cosponsor of our amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have some responses to the Senator from \nIllinois when we get back because they are bogus arguments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/30/senate-section/article/S3559-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   JOINT MEETING OF THE TWO HOUSES--ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF \n                                IRELAND\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today is the 33rd anniversary of the fall of \nSouth Vietnam, where the North Vietnamese offensive that had begun in \nthe aftermath of a vote in this Congress to cut off supplemental \nfunding to the Government of South Vietnam. This was combined with a \nmassive refurbishment of the North Vietnamese Army that allowed an \ninvasion to kick off at a time when our South Vietnamese allies were \nattempting to reorganize their positions in order to adapt to the \nreality that they were going to get markedly less funding from the \nUnited States in their effort to grow their incipient democracy.\n  I think it is important for us to look back on that event and to give \ncredit where credit is due, and also to talk a little bit about the \nfuture of relations between our country and the present Government in \nVietnam.\n  Too often in today's school systems and in the discussions that \nexamine the Vietnam war, we are overwhelmed by mythology. In many \ncases, we tend to assume this was a war between the United States and \nVietnam. Nothing could be further from the truth. This was an attempt \nby the United States to assist a government in the south that had been \nformed with the idea that it would evolve into a properly functioning \ndemocracy, in the same way that we assisted South Korea when it was \ndivided from North Korea, in the same way that we very successfully \nassisted West Germany when the demarcation line at the end of World War \nII divided Germany between the Communist east and the free society in \nthe west. We were not successful in that endeavor in Vietnam for a \nnumber of reasons. But it would be wrong to assume that this was an \naction by our country against the country of Vietnam. It was an attempt \nto actually assist that country.\n  There is a lot of talk about the domino theory and the heightened and \nunjustified warnings about what was going on in the rest of the region \nwith respect to different efforts that were backed by the Soviet Union \nand Communist China at that point. But these were actually valid \nconcerns at the time. Indonesia had suffered an attempted coup that was \nsponsored by the Chinese. We had a hot war in South Korea when North \nKorea invaded. This was a region in a great deal of turmoil, when you \nlook back at the European powers that had colonies throughout Southeast \nAsia, which had largely pulled back after World War II because of the \nenormous costs of that war. It had shrunk back into their own national \nperimeters. The Japanese had colonized a good part of Southeast Asia, \nand after World War II they had withdrawn their forces. There was a \ngood deal of turbulence, and there was a great deal of strategic \njustification for what we attempted to do.\n  The bottom line is 58,000 Americans were killed in action or died of \nhostile causes during the Vietnam war. We should remember them with the \nvalidity that their effort deserves. Mr. President, 245,000 South \nVietnamese soldiers fought alongside us and perished; 1.4 million \nCommunist soldiers died in that endeavor.\n  The events following the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, have never \nreally been given the proper attention in terms of how we evaluate the \nhistory of what we attempted to do. One million of the cream of South \nVietnam's leaders were sent into reeducation camps, and 240,000 of them \nremained in those camps for 4 years or longer; 56,000 of them died in \nthe reeducation camps. This was the cream of South Vietnam's \nleadership--almost as many as we lost in the entire war. Two million \nVietnamese were displaced, a million of them hitting the ocean, risking \ntheir\n\n[[Page S3560]]\n\nlives in order to try to reach a better life that would not be under \nthe oppression of a government that had succeeded in conquering the \nsouth. Many of them came to the United States.\n  Many of the families whose fathers and, in some cases, mothers had \nbeen in reeducation camps were able to relocate here and begin a \ndifferent life. A Stalinist system took over in the north. When I \nstarted going back to Vietnam in 1991, that system was very much in \nplace.\n  We should look to the future. I believe there are two important \nthings for us to keep in mind at this point in the evolution of our \nrelations with Vietnam. First is that over a pretty rocky period of \ntime, the Communist Government of Vietnam has made adjustments and \npositive contributions. This is not to say that we are in a perfectly \nbeneficial relationship, but I have been pleased, since 1991, to \nparticipate in many of these endeavors to bring a more moderate society \ninside Vietnam and to assist in bringing in American businesses.\n  Vietnam and Thailand, in my view, are two of the most important \ncountries in terms of how the United States should be looking at East \nAsia and Southeast Asia with the emergence of China, the emergence of \nIndia, and the evolution of Muslim fundamentalism that spills over in \nSoutheast Asia into countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the \nsouth Philippines. Vietnam and Thailand are very important to us, and \nthe relationships evolving between Vietnam and the United States are \nhealthy and in the long term are going to be successful.\n  The second thing we should remember is that there are many Vietnamese \nAmericans in this country who suffered not only during the war, but \nafter 1975. We tend to forget that with the reorganization of the \nsociety that occurred under Communist rule. I have spent a good bit of \nmy life working to assist this refugee community in the United States. \nI also have been working to build a bridge between the overseas \nVietnamese community and the ruling Government in Vietnam today. \nThrough that bridge, we are going to have a much healthier society here \nand also a much more productive society in Vietnam.\n  Today, I wanted to do my small part in making sure we in this country \nremember not only a struggle that had a great deal of validity to it--\neven though it did not turn out the way many of us wanted it to--but \nalso the positive aspects of our relations with Vietnam looking into \nthe future.\n  With, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Durbin's \namendment.\n  The debate is not about an arcane, technical pension funding rule. \nThe issue before us is about whether thousands and thousands of airline \nemployees are allowed to keep hard-earned defined benefit pensions or \nif we are going to regulate them or throw them out to the underfunded \nPBGC, which has so much debt that you cannot count the zeros. This \nissue is about whether we are going to send additional major carriers, \nwho have so far avoided bankruptcy in these brutal financial \ncircumstances, into a downward spiral. My premise is to hold the main \ncarriers harmless. They are up against it, at the cliff. We should hold \nthem harmless.\n  Adding this pension provision to the FAA bill would defeat the whole \npurpose of this compromise brokered by the Finance and the Commerce \nCommittees, which was done with the underlying principle that we should \nhold the commercial airlines harmless during these turbulent economic \ntimes, which are expected to last. That is sacred. That is why it would \nbe unwise to load up an additional liability on airlines trying to do \nthe right thing for their employees.\n  It would be especially wrong to cause that result in a misguided \neffort to put the preservation of regular order before common sense--in \nother words, going around a committee. It happens. Airline employees \nwill pay the unnecessary price for this change from current law. It \ncannot happen.\n  During these tough times of rising fuel prices and mounting financial \nlosses, this is not the time to impose tougher, unrealistic pension \nfunding requirements upon the airline industry. To do so would risk \nmore bankruptcies and force carriers to dump their pensions into the \nwoebegone PBGC. That would put in danger the economic security of \nworkers who would prefer to stay employed and not have their pensions \nfrozen.\n  In 2005, when the Senate was considering the Pension Protection Act \non the Senate floor, we passed an amendment by voice vote that I \ncosponsored with Senator Isakson and Senator Lott. The amendment would \nhave given all airline carriers substantial pension relief. The \namendment did not pick winners or losers within the airline industry. \nIt is not our business. Rather, it focused on keeping their defined \nbenefit pension plans solvent.\n  Unfortunately, as Senator Hutchison pointed out, the final product \nthat came out of conference in 2006 limited the pension relief the \nSenate sought to give all airlines. Led by--and I will say he is gone \nand I am not sad--the Ways and Means Committee chairman, Bill Thomas, \nthe conference report chose winners and losers. It gave some carriers \nmore pension relief than others, creating a competitive advantage for \nsome carriers.\n  A number of Senators were not happy with the airline provisions bill, \nincluding Senators Durbin, Reid, Obama, Harkin, Menendez, Lautenberg, \nBill Nelson, and a lot of the rest of us. They entered a colloquy on \nthe floor arguing that this disparity needed to be dealt with.\n  That is why in last year's Iraq war supplemental appropriations \nlegislation Dick Durbin did the only thing that he had available to him \nto do, and with the strong support of Senator Hutchison, he sought to \nright this wrong and inserted a provision that brought the airlines up \nto par and gave them the necessary pension relief that they deserved. I \nunderstand this was perhaps not the best process. We are not a body \nknown for our meticulous protocol. We are trying to get something in \nthat is lifesaving for the Nation.\n  As a senior member of the Finance Committee myself, which has \njurisdiction of pension legislation, I agree with Senator Baucus that \nit would have been more ideal to go through the regular order and have \nthe Finance Committee review and vet the provision. The problem is that \nit wasn't going to happen.\n  However, airlines need and deserve pension relief. We cannot adopt \nthe pension provision of the Finance Committee tax title and impose \nhigher pension burdens upon five domestic airlines, which has been \ndiscussed by various people, during these tougher economic times.\n  Remember, hold legacy commercial airlines harmless. So we would be \nturning our backs on American, Continental, US Airways, Hawaiian, and \nAlaska Air. To do so would risk more bankruptcies and more job losses. \nI pointed out earlier that one out of every six jobs in the airline \nindustry has been lost in the last 6 years.\n  In 2005, while we were debating the Isakson-Rockefeller-Lott \namendment that brought all airlines equitable pension relief, I stated \non the Senate floor that my goal was to protect the employees and \nretirees who worked so hard to earn retirement benefits, and that \nremains my goal today.\n  To deny disadvantaged airlines the relief they rightfully deserve in \nthe Pension Protection Act and which the Senate voted to give them \nwould be unfair.\n  I have the utmost respect for Senators Baucus and Grassley. They are \na superb team. They did their very best and did a very good job on the \nwhole on the Pension Protection Act. But the Finance Committee in the \nSenate should not have received the dicta of the now thoroughly retired \nformer Ways and Means Committee chairman. The former House majority \nsucceeded with their desperate efforts to achieve questionable policy \ngoals by holding long-awaited pension reform legislation hostage. But \nthat was then and\n\n[[Page S3561]]\n\nthis is now, and we should not give the former House majority the \nsatisfaction of achieving their desired objective over a jurisdictional \nsquabble, and that is all it is. It counts. I understand that. It \ncounts. People lie on the floor to protect it, but in this case, we are \ndealing with something much larger.\n  We can do better, and that must begin by us stepping back and \ninvoking the ``do no harm'' principle. America cannot afford another \nmajor bankruptcy to cripple our aviation system.\n  With all of my respect to the Finance Committee leadership, we just \ncannot do one more thing to jeopardize the health of our domestic \naviation industry, particularly the commercial sector. The rest of it \nis doing very well. For that reason, I will support Senator Durbin's \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I take a view opposite what was just \nspoken by Senator Rockefeller on the amendment that is before the \nSenate, the Durbin amendment, No. 1, because of a very carefully \ncrafted compromise that was worked out when the pension reform bill was \npassed, and No. 2, the purpose of that legislation was to protect the \npensions of the workers of the corporations of America, including the \nworkers who work for our airlines.\n  What we are trying to do is stay within the realm of that compromise \nand the protection of workers' pensions. This effort detracts from it. \nI am trying to make sure workers' pensions are protected.\n  I am going to ask my colleagues to be against the Durbin-Hutchison \namendment. The amendment before us seeks to keep in place a policy that \nis wrong from a pension policy standpoint. The amendment also would \npreserve a process followed against two committees with jurisdiction \nover pension policy--the Finance Committee and the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee. These two committees worked arm in arm \nfor all of 2006 to get a pension reform bill together that would \nprotect workers' pensions.\n  If the proponents of this amendment succeed in their effort, it will \ntaint the legislative process with respect to one of the most important \npolicy challenges before Congress, and this is strengthening retirement \nsecurity.\n  The provision the proponents seek to strike is not only justified \nfrom a policy perspective--but the way in which the original provision \nof the Pension Protection Act was modified should raise the eyebrows of \nsome of my Senate colleagues.\n  I would first like to walk my Senate colleagues through the yearlong \nconference negotiations of the Pension Act which occurred less than 2 \nyears ago. But let me first remind my colleagues that the underlying \nintent of the Pension Act is to require defined benefit plan sponsors \nto fully fund their pension plans; in other words, keep their promise \nto their employees.\n  In nontechnical terms, the Pension Act makes sure plan sponsors are \nnot digging a deeper hole by requiring plans to pay off their unfunded \nliabilities.\n  The Pension Act requires defined benefit plan sponsors to make \ncontributions, one, to cover benefits accrued in the current year and, \ntwo, to pay off any unfunded pension liabilities or past liabilities \nover a 7-year period of time. A lot of people think we were not doing \njustice to the workers of America by giving these companies 7 years to \npay off these past liabilities, but at least we have a plan in place \nthat two committees of this Senate worked on that was a compromise that \nwould bring us to the point where even after 7 years, workers' pensions \nwould be protected.\n  There is an interest rate issue with a lot of pensions--the interest \nrate used to determine these past liabilities based on the yield curve \nof high-quality corporate bond rates. Currently, the corporate bond \nyield curve rate is approximately 6 percent. The Pension Act provided \ntwo exceptions to this general rule. The exceptions were specifically \nprovided for certain commercial airline carriers that may have had \ndifficulty meeting the general requirements within the bill. In other \nwords, we were taking into consideration 2 years ago the very critical \nand--how would I say it--very unpredictable future of airlines. That is \nsomething that was legitimate at the time.\n  There were exceptions for these commercial airline carriers. Under \nthe first exception, carriers that froze their pension plans were \npermitted to pay off any past pension liabilities over 17 years--that \nis instead of 7 years--and use in the process an 8.85-percent interest \nrate to calculate past liabilities. And that would be instead of \ncurrent law, which is a 6-percent rate. Under the second exception, \ncarriers that did not freeze their pension plans were permitted to pay \noff liabilities over 10 years instead of 17 years, if they chose the \nother course, and use the current 6-percent rate instead of the 8.85-\npercent interest rate.\n  During the Pension Act negotiations, those airline carriers freezing \ntheir plans were permitted to take advantage of the first exception. We \nwere aware at that time that these carriers pledged to make new 401(k) \ncontributions on behalf of current and new employees in their union \nnegotiations.\n  Those airline carriers that did not freeze their plans did not need \nto make the same pledge for a 401(k)-type retirement because these \ncarriers continued their pension plans. The workers for these carriers \ncontinued to accrue benefits under the pension plan.\n  The opponents of section 808 do not understand or maybe they choose \nto ignore that this was a carefully crafted compromise which was \nintended to place workers of each of these carriers in a similar \nposition from a retirement perspective. Workers of carriers that did \nnot freeze their plans continued to accrue their usual pension \nbenefits. Workers of carriers that froze their plans received \nretirement benefits under 401(k) plans. Under each approach, the \ncarriers remain obligated to pay their retirement benefits that accrue \nin the current year.\n\n  This was a proworker, proparticipant approach that recognized the \nfinancial distress the airline industry was experiencing. It also \nrecognized the differences in the financial health of the carriers that \nfroze their pension plans and the financial health of carriers that did \nnot freeze their retirement plans.\n  The amendment's proponents are now saying they want the same set of \nrules that were offered to carriers that froze their plans.\n  What is on the books that we in the Finance Committee are trying to \ncorrect in this legislation is that we gave maximum flexibility to \nairlines to choose one plan or another, the one that fit, whether they \nwanted to freeze their pension plans or not freeze their pension plans. \nAnd if they froze their pension plans, they chose a future 401(k) for \ntheir employees. It was maximum flexibility because these union \nagreements were much different among the airlines and the financial \nconditions of the airlines were very much different. We wanted to give \nchoice for flexibility for the financial management of the corporations \nto keep their promise to their workers, and we wanted to keep our \npromise that Congress made under our laws that workers' retirement \nought to be protected. So there was maximum flexibility.\n  OK, everybody agreed to this, and then later on, people wanted to \nchange the rules in the middle of the game to benefit one airline over \nanother airline. So the proponents of the present law, the present \ndistraction from our compromise that was made less than 2 years ago, \nwill tell you that just before passage of the Pension Act, an agreement \nwas reached with Senate leadership that the Senate would take the first \navailable opportunity in the next Congress to offer the same set of \nrules to carriers who do not freeze their pension plans. If that is \ntrue, then why did we worry and try to make this compromise over a \nperiod of 7 months during 2006? We wouldn't have had to spend the time \nto do that.\n  On January 4, 2007, Senator Hutchison and Senator Cornyn introduced a \nbill that loosened the rules for those carriers that did not freeze \ntheir plans. The bill increased the current interest rate of 6 percent \nto 8.25 percent, which, in their view, is closer to the 8.85-percent \nrate given to frozen plans.\n  The bill was referred to the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. I don't recall Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi \nconsidering the Hutchison-Cornyn bill in\n\n[[Page S3562]]\n\nthe normal course of the committee process. I know for a fact that \nneither Chairman Baucus nor I considered the Hutchison-Cornyn bill in \nthe Finance Committee.\n  Language that was identical to Hutchison-Cornyn was slipped into the \nwar supplemental conference agreement. This action was taken without \nconsideration by the two committees of jurisdiction over pensions, the \nvery same two committees that worked for several months during 2006 to \nwork out this carefully crafted compromise that took into consideration \nthe financial conditions of the various airlines, the desire of some \nairlines to freeze their pensions and substitute 401(k)s and those \nairlines that wanted to keep their pension system going as was, without \nany consideration to the people who worked on this for so long.\n  It was slipped into the conference agreement of an appropriations \nbill. Isn't that the process we here in the Senate are trying to put an \nend to? No promises were broken. The promise to make the rules the same \nwas taken up in this Congress. Specifically, the Senate Finance \nCommittee included the provision we are debating today and the \nmodification of the chairman's mark of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration authorization bill. The mark was considered by the full \nSenate Finance Committee in September of last year. The full committee \noverwhelmingly supported that provision and favorably reported it out \nof committee. Proponents of this amendment cannot stand on the Senate \nfloor and cannot in good conscience argue that promises made to them \nwere not kept.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that we here in the Senate have a \ncommittee process which enables Members to debate and dispense with \nissues in an orderly process. Without this orderly process, the \ndemocratic process our Founding Fathers gave us breaks down. I didn't \nserve as chairman and now ranking member of the Finance Committee to \nlet an orderly and democratic process break down, particularly \nconsidering the months of compromise the House and Senate took to work \nout what that pension bill was all about.\n  For my Senate colleagues to suggest that a provision that was not \nconsidered during the normal course of the committee process is making \ngood on a promise that was made to them--I think that is not \nacceptable. For my Senate colleagues who, alternately, contend that the \npromises that were made to them were not kept, I ask them why they did \nnot speak up during the full and open deliberation that occurred in the \nFinance Committee in September. Why are they now opposing a provision \nthat was out there in the clear light of day for over 7 months and, if \nthey had problems with the provisions, not speak to us about them? Or \nis it that the airline carriers that oppose this provision finally woke \nup? I don't know. Did they wake up to the fact that their blatant end \nrun around the committee process would not go unnoticed and they wanted \nto find some way to undo the careful compromise of 2006? I am \nskeptical, of course. ``Skeptical'' is an understatement.\n  But let me turn to the policy in the Finance Committee bill. As we \nhave established, opponents of that provision successfully increased \nthe interest rate for nonfrozen plans to 8.25 percent. They say the \n8.25-percent rate levels the playing field. I admit that and agree with \nthem. But it only levels the playing field in the context of \ncalculating past liabilities. So I agree it is equitable to allow all \nthe carriers to use the more favorable interest rate to calculate past \nliabilities, but it is not equitable to allow carriers that did not \nfreeze their plans to underfund benefits earned in the future and maybe \nget us back to the position we are still in somewhat, even regardless \nof the law that is now on the books. This is what is going to happen if \nwe do not do something about it right now.\n  I would like to correct the manner in which my distinguished \ncolleague from Illinois--and he is here on the floor--refers to the now \ninfamous 8.25 percent, versus the 8.85 percent. These are not \n``earnings rates.'' The rates are not used to determine the value of \nplan assets. Instead, the rates are discount rates that actuaries use \nto determine the present value of pension liabilities. Basically, the \nrates are used to determine how much a company has to contribute today \nto make good on the promised pension payments that would be due when an \nemployee retires.\n  This is an important distinction because when a company uses a higher \ninterest to project the present value, the company is able to \nunderstate--or I would use the word ``mask''--the promised pension \npayments. This understatement allows the company to contribute less \nmoney to the plan. Less money to the plan is an important distinction \nbecause we are talking about protecting workers and their pension \nrights.\n  Why would a worker support a policy that places the full value of \ntheir promised pension payments in jeopardy? My colleague from Illinois \ncontends that the workers of the carriers in question support this \npractice and, of course, the Durbin-Hutchison amendment. Most workers I \nknow ask for bigger payments or at least want to make sure they are \nsecure in retirement. It is usually management that wants to short the \nworker. That is why we get into the trouble we are in and why the \nPension Act of 2006 was necessary.\n  But let me get back to what the war supplemental actually \naccomplished. Carriers that are currently using the 8.25-percent \ninterest rate are now permitted, No. 1, to mask the pension plan's \nunfunded liabilities and, No. 2, contribute less money to a pension \nplan. The greater extent to which a pension plan is underfunded, the \ngreater the risks to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the \nFederal insurer of the pension plans. Then, obviously, if that comes up \nshort, the taxpayers pick up the bill.\n  Opponents of the Finance Committee provision argue that the most \nimportant risk factor for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is \nthe financial health of a plan sponsor. This is not entirely true. \nWhether a plan is underfunded is an equally important risk factor. \nSpecifically, if the company goes into bankruptcy and pushes the \npension liabilities onto the PBGC, guess who is holding the bag for \nthose unfunded liabilities--it is the PBGC. In the most extreme cases, \nthen the taxpayers might be left holding the bag.\n  My opponents cannot tell half of the story. Yes, the financial health \nof the plan sponsor is important, but so is the funding status of the \nplan. What we have here is an issue of underfunding. I told you that \nfrom an actuarial perspective, higher interest rates mean lower plan \nliabilities. When a plan's sponsor uses a higher interest rate to \ndetermine its liability, the sponsor is effectively masking the plan's \nliabilities. In other words, the plan's liabilities are artificially \nunderstated. I want to emphasize the word ``artificial'' because what \nwe have here is a case where the carriers that oppose the Finance \nCommittee provision are trying to take advantage of a special funding \nrule based on an artificial funding status.\n  I went to great lengths to say to my colleagues during 2006 how we \ntried to take into consideration--between the two committees, the Labor \nCommittee and the Finance Committee--considerations of the different \nfinancial conditions of the various air carriers and to give them some \nchoice. Specifically, if a plan sponsor using the normal 6-percent rate \nis 100 percent funded, the plan sponsor is only required to contribute \nmoney to cover the current year's costs. If the plan is, say, 115 \npercent funded, the plan sponsor may use the excess to cover the \ncurrent year liabilities. In some cases, the plan sponsor will not have \nto contribute any money because the excess would cover the current year \ncosts. Carriers that are using the 8.25-percent are contending that, \nbecause their plan is 116 percent funded, they do not have to make the \ncurrent year contribution. The problem here is that the 116-percent \nfunding status is artificial. It is artificial because the 8.25 rate \neffectively masks the underfunding of the plan.\n\n  So I ask my Senate colleagues, should a plan that is artificially \nfunded be permitted to avail itself of a rule that is only available to \nplans that are adequately funded? Or put another way--this is fuzzy \nfunding math. It is fuzzy in the way it puts the plan at risk. Should \nplans that are artificially funded be allowed to skip making their \ncurrent year contributions? In that case, are they not just digging the \nhole deeper?\n\n[[Page S3563]]\n\n  The Finance Committee provision says that if these carriers use the \n8.25-percent rate, which results in an artificial funding level, these \ncarriers cannot skip their current year's contributions. So the Finance \nCommittee provision makes good on the promise that was made to Senators \nduring the year 2006; that is, that we are allowing carriers that did \nnot freeze their plans to use a more favorable interest rate to \ndetermine their past liabilities--the same deal that was given to \nfrozen plans. What we are also saying, however, is that if you are \nusing the more favorable rate, you have to contribute the current \nyear's cost. That is the grand compromise of 2006.\n  Again, the same deal was given to the other set of airlines and/or \nother corporations--to freeze their plan. To do otherwise would, No. 1, \nadversely affect active workers and, No. 2, allow these carriers to dig \na deeper hole by allowing pension liabilities to continue to grow.\n  Moreover, taxpayers can end up being on the hook for these unfunded \nliabilities.\n  It all comes down to this bottom line: Workers, retirees, and \ntaxpayers are in better shape if there is more money in the retirement \nplans. Workers, retirees, and taxpayers are in worse shape if there is \nless money in the retirement plans. Management wins if the company puts \nless money into the plan and workers, retirees, and taxpayers lose.\n  A vote for this amendment is a vote to put less money in the \nretirement plan. A vote against this amendment is a vote to put more \nmoney in.\n  Let me make sure I said that right. A vote for the amendment is a \nvote to put less money in the retirement plan. A vote against the \namendment is a vote to put more money into the retirement plan. If you \nvote for the amendment, you are putting workers and retirees--and you \nought to be concerned about taxpayers, most of all--at risk.\n  I hope my colleagues join me in opposing this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I greatly respect the Senator from Iowa. I \nknow he may have to leave, but I do have to tell him I disagree with \nseveral things he said.\n  First, the point he raised: Why wasn't I in the Finance Committee \nstating my position? I am not a member of that committee and I do not \nknow the procedure that was followed by the committee.\n  I will tell you, in this Federal Aviation Administration \nauthorization bill, this is the only pension provision. To think this \nis a pension bill and we should have been forewarned that airline \npensions would be part of the discussion about keeping America's skies \nsafer and air travel safer came as somewhat of a surprise.\n  I learned of this amendment last week. I have known for a long time \nthe position of the chairman and ranking member in opposition to my \nposition on this issue, and I knew the day would come when we would \nrevisit it.\n  But there are several things here which I think have to be said: \nFirst, freezing a pension plan might not sound like much unless you are \na retiree. A frozen pension, which is what we are talking about with \nsome airlines, would disqualify new workers from qualifying for the \npension and restrict the airline from expanding any benefits under the \nretirement plan.\n  That is a frozen plan. That is what happened with several airlines as \nthey faced and went into bankruptcy. They froze their plans. They said \nto their retirees: Times are tough. We cannot cover new employees. We \ncannot give you anything more; it is frozen.\n  Now, they were given pretty good treatment by the Finance Committee. \nIn fact, they were given the most preferred treatment of any \ncorporations in America. They were allowed to fund their pension plan \nover a longer period of time than any company in America, 17 years, and \nthey started with an imputed assumption of 8.85 in terms of--as the \nSenator from Iowa called it the discount rate or others, the interest \nrate. But they were given this preferred position. It applied to two \nairlines, Northwest and Delta.\n  Now, what about the rest of the airlines? They were put in a \ndifferent category. In their situations, airlines such as American \nAirlines did not freeze their pension plans; new workers came into \ntheir pension plans; benefits could be improved in their pension plans.\n  They were told: You will not be given the preferred treatment given \nto those that freeze their pension plans. It seems like it is upside \ndown. You would think we would be benefitting those companies that are \ntrying to do better by their employees. But, instead, we went the other \nway and said: We limit their catchup funding and liability to 10 years \nand the imputed interest to 8.25 percent, not as good a deal, and in \nthe world of hundreds of millions of dollars, a very expensive \ndifference between frozen pension plans and those that still have \nactive defined benefit plans.\n  So now comes the argument with this new amendment in the Federal \nAviation Administration authorization bill, that we have to freeze the \ncurrent level of contributions being given by the airlines. Well, let \nme give you an example of what that means. In the instance of American \nAirlines, they have not only funded their liability to 100 percent, \nthey have added more, despite the tough economic times.\n  Their funding level is 115 percent. It is not as if they are trying \nto pull anything over on their workers and retirees, they are putting \nmore money in than they are required, even in these tough times.\n  The effect of this amendment, if it is not removed, is to hold them \nat that 115 percent contribution. What does it mean to the airlines \nsuch as American? It means $1 billion over 5 years. It means $200 \nmillion each year to keep the funding level way beyond the 100 percent \nthat is necessary.\n  Now, if these were prosperous times, and these were companies that \nwere making money, having record profits, you might be able to make \nthat argument. I am not sure how, but you might be able to make it. But \nexactly the opposite is true.\n  I think the Senator from Iowa knows as well as I do how many airlines \nhave gone bankrupt. The first time I met the Senator from Iowa, we were \nflying together on Ozark Airlines. That goes back a few years. Then we \nwere flying together on TWA. That goes back a few years. And these \nairlines are gone. In the last few weeks, another five airlines are \ngone. This is a very risky business with the cost of jet fuel.\n  To say: Well, this will not hurt the airlines, another $200 million a \nyear, just have them keep overfunding their pension liability is to \nignore the obvious. As dangerous as it may be to have an unfunded \npension plan, it is even more dangerous to be working at a company that \ngoes into bankruptcy. I have been with companies that have gone through \nthis PBGC. They do not always come out whole at the end of the day. \nThere are limits on what the PBGC will pay, in terms of outstanding \nbenefits to workers. They can end up with less.\n  So what we have is a circumstance where the Finance Committee is \nwanting to roll the dice. They want to bet that American airlines in \ngeneral, not the American Airlines but American airlines in general, \nthat do not have frozen benefits plans are going to start making a lot \nof money. They seem to think the price of a barrel of oil is going to \ngo down; they think the cost of jet fuel is going to go down; they \nthink these airlines are going to be flush with cash and be able to \noverfund their pensions.\n  Well, that is one possibility, but you would have to say, looking at \nwhat has happened over the last several weeks, not very likely; it is \nmore likely that airlines will continue to face the pressure of \nincreasing energy and fuel costs, more airlines will be flirting with \nbankruptcy, they will be struggling to meet the bottom line.\n  United Airlines laid off 1,000 workers last week, a $500 million loss \nin the first quarter. I think it is the largest they have ever \nsustained. Things do not look that rosy.\n  What Senator Hutchison and I are saying is be careful. Do not toy \nwith the pensions of so many workers. Do not bet the farm, even an Iowa \ncorn farm, on the possibility that things are going to get better for \nthe airlines. Be conservative. Be careful. But protect the workers in \nthe meantime. So as you listen to the Senator from Iowa close and say: \nWell, if you want to put more money in the pension system,\n\n[[Page S3564]]\n\nvote against this amendment. If you want to take money out, vote for \nit.\n  I would say to the Senator, there is only one problem with his \nargument: 150,000 of the 180,000 workers affected by your amendment \nsupport the Durbin-Hutchison amendment. They believe it is far better \nto maintain the current system of funding, not jeopardize these \nairlines so they might go into bankruptcy, have fair funding that makes \nsure these retirement benefits can continue to be paid. That is a fact.\n  When Senator Baucus, the chairman of the committee, came to the floor \nearlier, he said he wants to level the playing field. Well, the current \nlaw is already unfair. The field is far from level. And section 808 \nmakes this inequity even worse, even worse.\n  It tips the playing field heavily on the side of Delta and Northwest \nat the expense of the other airlines, the five that would be hit by \nthis. I urge my colleagues, if we are going to err, let's err on the \nside of caution. Caution tells us: Good funding of the pension \nliabilities in a difficult economic climate, with airlines going into \nbankruptcy, listen to the workers whose pensions are at stake and vote \nfor the Durbin-Hutchison amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Durbin and \nSenator Hutchison, the senior Senator from Texas, along with Senators \nBrown, Voinovich, Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, and Senator \nLautenberg from New Jersey in support of this amendment which would \nstrike section 808 of the FAA reauthorization bill.\n  I would like to explain why. The 30,000-foot view is, if enacted, it \nwould impose a significant and unfair burden on airlines that have done \nthe most to provide for secure retirements for their former employees \nor their employees who will retire.\n  This amendment will make sure Congress does not jeopardize the \npensions of 50,000 of my constituents in Texas who depend on the \nairline industry for their retirement, their nest egg, that they will \nretire on when they leave active duty.\n  Also, if this amendment is passed, it will relieve a significant \ncompetitive disadvantage some airlines, not coincidentally a couple \nheadquartered in my State, American and Continental, would operate \nunder, if the Finance Committee proposal would prevail.\n  That is why I support striking section 808 of the FAA authorization \nbill. Section 808 would undermine the ability of some airlines to \nmaintain their commitments to their workers at a time when our economy \nis becoming softer and more questions than answers are apparent with \nregard to what our economic future, at least in the short term, is \ngoing to look like. It would reduce the financial flexibility of \nairlines, precisely at a time when they need it the most.\n  Now, I think a little refresher on recent history is important. \nBecause what has actually happened is, in 2006, the Pension Protection \nAct was passed, and to be blunt about it, what happened is it \nbenefitted airlines such as Delta and some others around the country, \nwhile American and Continental were basically told to wait, there will \nbe an opportunity later on to come back to take care of your concerns \nand level the playing field and to eliminate the preferential treatment \nthat was given to some other airlines during the Pension Protection Act \nof 2006.\n  So patiently we waited. Last year's supplemental appropriations bill \nwas the vehicle we used to correct the inequitable treatment created \nfor airlines such as Continental and American in the Pension Protection \nAct of 2006. The act included language that is in the supplemental \nappropriations bill, language out of S. 119, that I introduced with \nSenator Hutchison. As I said, it corrected the inequity that was \nearlier created in the Pension Protection Act of 2006.\n  But now, section 808 in the Finance Committee provision would simply \nundo the corrective action that Congress undertook in the supplemental \nappropriations bill I mentioned a moment ago. It should not be a part \nof the bill, I would also say, that is about improving and modernizing \nthe air traffic control system in this country. Why would we be messing \nwith the pensions of 50,000 Texans who depend on those two major \nairlines for their retirement benefits in this bill? It makes no sense.\n  I believe it is unfair and would reverse the corrective action we \nwere able to accomplish in last year's supplemental appropriations \nbill. I have worked hard, along with my colleagues I mentioned, to make \nsure those folks who work in the airline industry will have a pension \nwhen they retire. I will continue to do so. I sincerely believe that \npassing the Finance Committee provision, section 808, would jeopardize \ntheir retirement benefits; could, in all probability, result in more \nairlines becoming bankrupt with tremendous uncertainty injected in \nterms of how their pensions would be protected.\n  At a time when airlines and their employees are facing enormous \nchallenges, Congress should not pull the carpet out from under their \nfeet and get in the business of picking winners and losers by giving \nsome airlines preferential treatment over other airlines.\n  I wish to extend my gratitude to the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin, and my colleague, Senator Hutchison, for their leadership on \nthis issue. I am proud to join them in this bipartisan amendment, which \nwould strike section 808 of the FAA authorization bill, as I have \ndescribed, and would, I think, make sure that what we do is keep the \nlevel playing field, not jeopardize the pensions of thousands of \nairline workers and would comport with fundamental fairness and equity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business on the energy crisis taking place in our \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Energy Crisis\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I think virtually everyone in America \nunderstands our country is in extremely difficult straits; that the \nmiddle class is collapsing; that poverty is increasing; and that one of \nthe immediate factors that is driving so many Americans over the edge \nis outrageously high energy prices.\n  This impacts every community in America, but it especially impacts \nrural States such as the State of Vermont, where workers are forced to \ndrive long distances to work and end up spending an inordinate amount \nof money at the gas tank.\n  It is not uncommon in my State for people to travel 100 miles a day \nto work and back. If you do the arithmetic, you will find that in many \ncases, as oil prices and gas price have risen, people today are paying \n$1,000 a year more than a year and a half ago to fill up their gas \ntanks.\n  If you are a worker earning $30,000 or $35,000 a year, and you got a \n3-percent increase in your wages, that is pretty good; in some cases \nall of your wage increase is going down that gas tank. You have to pay \nhigher health care costs, higher educational costs, higher property \ntaxes, and you are in a lot of trouble, which is why the middle class \nin America is, in fact, shrinking significantly.\n  Not only is this a major crisis in terms of what is happening at the \ngas pump, there is also severe worry about what happens next winter \nwhen people have to fill up their home heating oil furnaces and stay \nwarm in the winter in States such as Vermont.\n  I can tell you that all over my State, a lot of senior citizens and \nother people are extremely worried about how they are going to stay \nwarm next winter with the price of home heating fuel soaring to the \ndegree it is.\n  Meanwhile, while prices at the gas pump are soaring, while home \nheating oil and diesel fuel are soaring, the profits of huge oil \ncompanies are going up to recordbreaking levels; hedge fund managers \nmake billions speculating on oil futures, and OPEC continues to \nfunction as a price-fixing cartel in violation of World Trade \nOrganization rules.\n  The average price for a gallon of gas recently hit a record breaking \n$3.60 a gallon, which has more than doubled since President Bush has \nbeen in office. The price of diesel fuel is now averaging over $4.17 a \ngallon, which is a $1.36 more than a year ago, and the price of oil is \nwell over $114 a barrel. These prices say it all. What they say is we \nhave a national emergency on our\n\n[[Page S3565]]\n\nhands. It is absolutely imperative for the Congress to begin to act in \norder to lessen this onerous burden on tens of millions of families. \nThese record-breaking oil and gas prices at the pump are impacting not \nonly consumers of oil and gas but, obviously, our entire economy. They \nare impacting family farmers, small businesses, airlines, grocery \nstores, restaurants, tourism and, of course, the price of food. This \nnational oil emergency demands both short-term and long-term solutions.\n  One of the issues that concerns me is, I hear people getting up and \nsaying: Long term, we have to transform our energy system away from \nfossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. There is \nnobody in the Senate who believes that more than I do. We are on the \ncusp of a major transformation of our energy system. We need an Apollo-\ntype project to invest heavily in wind, solar, and geothermal energy \nefficiency. We can do that. In the process, we can create millions of \ngood-paying jobs. We have made a start in that direction, but we have \nnot gone far enough. But to say we must focus on long-term solutions \ndoes not mean we can ignore the immediate crisis. Yes, we have to break \nour dependency on fossil fuel, but that is not going to solve the \nproblem for a worker in Vermont who is paying $3.50 for a gallon of gas \ntoday. We have to address his and her problem as well. So it is not \neither/or. Yes, we break our dependency on fossil fuel and move to \nsustainable energy, but we also address the crisis of today. We tell \nworkers all over this country that we understand they cannot afford to \npay outrageous prices for gas.\n  There have been literally dozens of ideas from both sides of the \naisle, good ideas, an understanding of the crisis as to why oil prices \nare soaring and also good ideas as to how we might solve the problem. I \napplaud all of those Senators who have come up with ideas. But it seems \nto me if we are going to be successful in helping the average American, \nwe have to come forward with a comprehensive package. It is not good \nenough to say: I have an amendment in this bill and I have some \nlanguage in that bill which may come about in 2 years or may never come \nabout, and I have something over there. What we need is a comprehensive \npiece of legislation which understands the cause of this crisis is not \njust one thing--it is a multipronged problem which is causing oil \nprices to soar, and we will not solve this crisis through one simple \naction. We need a series of actions, but we have to bring our solutions \ntogether in a comprehensive package which says to the American people \nif that package is passed, oil and gas prices are going down. That is \nwhat we need to do.\n  I have been working with a number of my colleagues in order to do \nthat. Let me briefly talk about what I believe should be in that \npackage. It is about four provisions that could play a major role in \nlowering gas prices today. First, we need to impose an excise tax on \nthe profits of the oil and gas industry. The American people simply do \nnot understand why they are paying record-breaking prices at the pump \nwhile ExxonMobil has made more profits than any company in history in \nthe last 2 years. Last year alone, ExxonMobil made $40 billion in \nprofits, and they rewarded their CEO with a $21 million package in \ntotal compensation. A couple of years ago, they rewarded their former \nCEO, Lee Raymond, with a retirement package of $400 million. But it is \nnot ExxonMobil alone. We have seen BP come in the other day with a 63-\npercent increase in their profits. Shell made a huge increase in their \nprofits.\n  Since President Bush has been President, the five largest oil \ncompanies have made over $595 billion in profits, and that number is \nonly going to go up as the oil companies report last quarter's profits. \nLast year alone, the major oil companies made over $155 billion in \nprofits. People are sitting at home saying: I can't afford to fill up \nmy gas tank to go to work, and ExxonMobil and Conoco and Shell, all the \nbig oil companies, are making huge profits. What is the Congress doing \nabout it?\n  Well, up to now, the truth is, the Congress is doing nothing about \nit. Obviously, the President is not doing anything about it. But I \nthink most people understand the President and Vice President are never \ngoing to do anything to represent the interests of ordinary Americans. \nThe question is, what do we do about it? The time is now that we should \nmove forward with an excise profits tax. If we enacted a 23-percent \nexcise tax on oil company profits, that would bring in about $35 \nbillion this year. That sum of money would be enough to provide a 6-\nmonth suspension in Federal gas and diesel taxes and would also allow \nStates to suspend all or part of their gas and diesel taxes as well. In \nother words, we are not just talking about Federal taxes; we are \ntalking about State taxes. That would lower gas prices at the pump by \nalmost 37 cents a gallon and up to 48.8 cents for diesel during the \nnext 6 months. Is that going to solve all of the problems? No. But if \nyou can't afford to get to work right now, it will help. Having an \nexcise profits tax on the oil companies is only one of the things we \nshould be doing.\n  Congress has to also address another area where there is strong \nevidence that speculators, both in hedge funds and in other financial \ninstitutions, are driving the price of oil to outrageously high levels. \nWhat we have to address is undoing the so-called Enron loophole. This \nloophole was created in 2000, as part of the Commodities Futures \nModernization Act. At the behest of Enron lobbyists, a provision in \nthat bill was inserted in the dark of night with no congressional \nhearings. Specifically, the Enron loophole exempts electronic energy \ntrading from Federal commodities laws. Virtually overnight the loophole \nfreed over-the-counter energy trading from Federal oversight \nrequirements, opening the door to excessive speculation and energy \nprice manipulation. Of course, nobody knows exactly what the impact of \nthe Enron loophole is. But we do know huge amounts of money are being \nmade, not simply in the production of oil but in driving oil futures \nprices up.\n  Let me quote Stephen Simon, a senior vice president of ExxonMobil, on \nApril 1, 2008, in recent testimony before the House:\n\n       The price of oil should be about $50 to $55 per barrel.\n\n  Right now it is more than double that. He attributes the addition, \nthe almost doubling of the price, to speculation that is taking place.\n  Closing the Enron loophole would subject electronic energy markets to \nproper regulatory oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nto prevent price manipulation and excessive speculation. I applaud \nSenators Levin, Feinstein, Dorgan, and others who have focused on this \nissue. In addition to an excise profits tax on the oil companies, we \nmust go after the speculation on the part of people within hedge funds \nand in the financial institutions industry who are simply playing \ngames, making money, and driving the price of oil up. Those are two \nimportant steps we must take to lower the price of gas and oil.\n  Thirdly, the Bush administration must stop the flow of oil into the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve and, in fact, release oil from this Federal \nstockpile. At a time of record-breaking prices, it makes no sense to \ncontinue to take oil off the market and put it into the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. This is not just my opinion. We have seen staff at \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve recommend against buying more oil for \nthe SPR in the spring of 2002. This is not a new idea. The truth is, \nthis is an idea that has been used before under Democratic and \nRepublican administrations. For example, when President Clinton ordered \nthe release of 30 million barrels of crude oil from the SPR in 2000, \nthe price of gas fell by 14 cents a gallon in 2 weeks. When the first \nPresident Bush released 13 million barrels of crude oil from SPR in \n1991, crude oil prices dropped by over $10 a barrel. This is an \napproach which has been used in the past. It has worked in the past, \nand it is something we should do right now. That is the third provision \nI believe we should undertake.\n  Further, and in terms of where I think the comprehensive package \nshould be, we must begin to address the OPEC cartel. I hear a lot of \nfolks around here talk about the wonders of the free market and \ncapitalism and free enterprise. But every single Member of the Senate \nunderstands that by definition, OPEC is a cartel. That is what they \nare. They are a group of oil-producing nations that come together\n\n[[Page S3566]]\n\nto control oil production, to limit oil production, and, therefore, to \nartificially raise the price of oil. That is what a cartel is, and that \nis what OPEC is doing.\n  In that regard, we have to do two things. No. 1, the President must \nfile a complaint with the World Trade Organization. The truth is, OPEC \nitself is a violation of the rules of the WTO which is presumably about \ncreating the free flow of goods and free trade. On the surface, OPEC is \nin violation of those rules and agreements. The second thing we must do \nis to tell people in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, people whom American \nsoldiers died for in 1991, when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait: \nFriendship is a two-way street. We protected you in 1991. Now the \nUnited States economy and much of the world's economy is in serious \ntrouble. What you, Saudi Arabia, have to do is increase the production \nof oil.\n  My understanding is that right now Saudi Arabia is producing less oil \nthan they did 2 years ago. There are experts who believe Saudi Arabia \ncan produce almost 2 million barrels a day of oil more than they are \ncurrently producing.\n  So that is where we are. Where we are right now is, we have a \nnational crisis. We have working people suffering and wondering about \nhow they are going to be able to afford to get to work or keep warm in \nthe wintertime, at the same time as oil companies are enjoying \nrecordbreaking profits, and at the same time as speculators are making \nbillions and billions of dollars in profits.\n  Now, it is no secret--everybody knows--that the oil and gas industry \nis enormously powerful. Everybody understands these people have spent \nhundreds of millions of dollars in the last 10 years on lobbying, and \nwe know their lobbyists are hard at work at this very moment. We know \nthose people have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars in \ncampaign contributions. That is the reality and that is the American \npolitical system. That is the way it is. It is a system we have to \nchange, but that is the way it is.\n  I think the time is now for the Congress and for the Senate to begin \nto stand up to these very powerful special interests. I think we need a \ncomprehensive energy approach, and I have outlined it. I think we need \na long-term approach moving away from fossil fuels to sustainable \nenergy. I think we need a short-term approach, and I have outlined the \nfour provisions I believe should be in it.\n  Let me conclude by saying this: The crisis we are facing as a nation \nis not just an energy crisis. It is a crisis as to whether the American \npeople have faith in their own Government, in the people they elect. It \nis no secret that the President's approval ratings are perhaps as low \nas any President in American history, and the approval ratings of this \nCongress are even lower. That is the simple reality.\n  We are a democratic society. When people have problems, they look to \ntheir elected officials to respond to those problems and, hopefully, to \naddress them. If we cannot do that, I am not quite sure why we are \nhere. If the oil companies and the gas companies are so powerful with \nall of their money and their lobbyists and their campaign contributions \nthat we cannot address the crisis facing working Americans, well, maybe \nwe should rethink about what we do here.\n  But I think we can do something, and I have outlined what I think is \na series of ideas that, if passed, would address, in a very significant \nway, this crisis. I look forward to working with my colleagues to do \njust that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Foreclosure Crisis\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, as I come to the floor to speak this afternoon, \nmillions of Americans are struggling to hold on to their homes in the \nwake of the foreclosure crisis. Thousands of them have lost their jobs, \njust in the last couple of months. Millions more are finding it harder \njust to get by because sky-high oil prices are forcing many of our \nfamilies to pay more at the pump, more at the grocery store, and more \nin their power bills.\n  Yet while all of these working families are scrimping so hard today, \nthe economic downturn has not even registered for one segment of \nAmerica--big oil. The major oil companies reported their profits this \nweek, and they are seeing record increases.\n  ConocoPhillips reported first quarter profits of $4.1 billion. That \nbeats their previous record by $600 million. Shell and BP are also \nreporting huge gains.\n  Americans do not have to look very hard to figure out where the \nresponsibility lies--why oil companies are seeing their profits soar--\nwhile working families are watching their bank accounts bottom out. \nOver the last 7\\1/2\\ years, Republicans have backed an energy policy \nthat does very little but gives big oil companies tax breaks and \nspecial favors. Meanwhile, our middle-class families today are paying \nthe price, and they know it.\n  In the first month of the Bush administration, oil prices averaged \n$29.50 a barrel. Almost 8 years later, that price has quadrupled. It is \nalmost $120 a barrel this week.\n  When President Bush first took office, Americans were paying just \n$1.46 a gallon to fill their gas tanks. Last week, gas prices averaged \na whopping $3.60 a gallon.\n  I went home last week--like I always do--to Washington State, where \ndrivers are paying even more. A gallon of gas in Seattle, WA, costs \n$3.70; up in Bellingham, near the Canadian border, $3.80.\n  Families across my State are telling me they are cutting back on \neverything from shopping errands to summer vacations, and they are \npretty angry they have to pinch their pennies while oil companies are \nmaking record profits.\n  When I travel around my State, gas prices are one of the first things \npeople come up and talk to me about. They have written me countless \nletters about this.\n  For example, there is a stay-at-home mom from Yakima, WA, who wrote \nme that she worries every single day because her husband now has \nstarted riding a motorcycle to work instead of his car in order to save \nmoney on their gas bill. She wrote to me, and I want to read to you \nwhat she said. She said:\n\n       It is unnerving to think of him riding his motorcycle after \n     working a 10-plus hour shift. . . . It does not seem fair \n     that my middle class family has to choose between paying the \n     doctor--or putting gas in [our] car--while oil companies are \n     making record profits.\n\n  High gas prices are not just affecting our drivers. Industries from \nshipping to trucking to commercial fishing in my State are all hurting. \nOur farmers in Washington State are especially concerned. We have \nthousands of farmers in Washington State. They grow everything from \napples to wheat. They have to plow their fields and harvest their \ncrops. Cutting back is not an option for them. They have no choice but \nto absorb the cost of fuel.\n  One woman--from the southern Washington farming community of \nGoldendale--just wrote to me that she and her husband are finding it \nhard to pay for groceries. I want to quote what she said:\n\n       We, the little people, are struggling. Meanwhile, the gas \n     companies are still netting billions. When is it going to \n     stop? Something needs to be done to stop the nonsense.\n\n  That is how a farmer's wife from southwest Washington sees it.\n  Republicans have supported the energy policy of tax breaks for the \noil companies because, they say, oil prices would be higher without \nthem. But even President Bush said that was not true. In April of 2006, \nhe said:\n\n       Congress has got to understand that these energy companies \n     don't need unnecessary tax breaks like the write-offs of \n     certain geological and geophysical expenditures--or the use \n     of taxpayers' monies to subsidize energy companies' research \n     into deep-water drilling.\n\n  That was President Bush.\n  The reality is, not only have Republicans allowed oil companies to \nmake record profits while gas prices have soared, but their policies \nhave made us\n\n[[Page S3567]]\n\nmore dependent on foreign oil than ever before. That has put our \neconomy and our national security at risk. The amount of money we have \nsent to OPEC countries, such as Saudi Arabia, has skyrocketed from $41 \nbillion to $140 billion since 2001. Just this week, the president of \nOPEC said oil prices could go as high as $200 a barrel.\n  Now, I come to the floor to talk about this today because over the \nlast several days we have seen a parade of Republican Senators coming \nto the floor complaining about high gas prices. In many cases, they \nhave been blaming Democrats for failing to address this crisis over the \npast 16 months. They are bringing out charts that show the price of gas \nwhen Democrats took over in Congress and the price now, and they ask \nall of us to simply forget the real reason for this crisis; that is, \nthe misguided energy policy this administration has pursued for over 6 \nyears.\n  But I have to tell you, the people in my State and the American \npeople are not going to forget. They are not going to forget it was \nthis administration that asked oil and gas companies to write that \nenergy plan. They are not going to forget that the only real idea \ncoming from the other side is to drill our way out of this problem. And \nthey will not forget this is an administration closer to the oil and \ngas industry than any in U.S. history.\n  Now, we are not going to forget either, and that is why we are \nfighting for change. We have already won higher fuel economy standards \nand new investments in renewable energy sources. We all know we need to \ndo more. We know that Americans cannot rely on big oil to solve our \nenergy problems.\n  People in my home State of Washington are worried. They are worried \nabout the future. They want to be sure their kids are going to have \neconomic security. They want a solution to our energy problems that is \ngoing to keep us safe and protect our environment for the long \nterm. Democrats have been fighting for policies that will help cut our \ngas prices, help to create jobs, and help keep our air and our water \nclean and, importantly, our Nation secure. We are going to keep up that \nfight. We know it is not going to be easy. The oil companies and those \nwho support them are not going to give up on the status quo. Still, I \nhope our friends on the other side of the aisle will see what I see \nwhen I go home: Americans have had enough. I hope they will join us in \ninvesting in America's future and putting our working families first \nagain.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Presdient, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask you to let me know when I have \nspoken for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will advise.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to address a serious issue \nand that is the dramatically rising cost of energy and its impact on \nAmerican families. The problem with rising gas prices compounds the \npain felt in the American economy. Today we learned the economy had \nstalled to a paltry .6-percent growth rate. If you factor out the \nhighest 10 percent in income, the remaining 90 percent of Americans are \nclearly experiencing a recession. Only people at the very high end--the \nwealthiest, the best educated, by and large--are experiencing \nsignificant increases in income, and when you factor that out, \neverybody else is experiencing decreases in income. The vast majority \nof Americans are already in a recession, and they do not need any \nstatistic to tell them that.\n  It is also obvious from today's data that the entire economy has \nstalled. The last time we had two significant quarters such as this, we \nwere battling a recession in the 1990s. Americans are being squeezed at \nevery possible pressure point--at the gas pump--I am going to talk \nabout this issue later--the grocery store, by their mortgage company, \nand by their employers. Just because President Bush will not say the \nword does not mean Americans are not feeling like we are in a \nrecession. If we look at income numbers for most Americans, that is \nabsolutely true.\n  It is long past time for the President to work with the Congress to \nhelp get this economy and American families back on track. If President \nBush simply gives speeches and brings out the same old saws, we know he \ndoes not want to work with us. He is simply trying to say: I am out \nhere talking about this, but there is no real solution. Imagine, the \nsolution to the oil crisis is ANWR, the Alaskan oil reserve, which has \nbeen defeated even in a Republican-controlled Congress, which would not \nproduce a drop of oil for 10 years and would bring no relief to the \nAmerican driver. But I guess it is better than saying nothing, at least \nif you are the President of the United States.\n  With regular gasoline prices in States such as mine already over \n$3.75 a gallon--over $4 a gallon in many other States--and with the \nentire national average threatening to surpass $4 a gallon this summer, \nit is no surprise Americans are outraged as they hear about record \nprofits for both the big oil companies and OPEC. Sometimes I wonder if \nthere is any difference because OPEC and the big oil companies are \nalmost always in cahoots.\n  Gas prices are 63 cents higher than last year, more than double in \nthe time since President Bush took office, and they show no intention \nof slowing down. Shockingly, our very own President responded with a \nsurprise to a question at the end of February about the likelihood of \n$4-a-gallon gasoline by saying:\n\n       That's interesting. I hadn't heard that.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, I hope you hear us now because gas is at $4 a \ngallon already in many places in America, and it is only going higher. \nThe only people who are happy about $4-a-gallon gasoline are big oil \ncompanies and OPEC in the Middle East.\n  We know the reason prices keep going up, of course, is in good part, \nworld demand is increasing. We know, too, in the long run, we will not \nbe able to reverse this price increase if we do not have a real energy \npolicy. In fact, we have had no energy policy since President Bush took \noffice. If you think it is energy policy to say let the oil companies \ndo what they want, you are sadly mistaken. That is why we have $4-a-\ngallon gasoline.\n  This administration's energy policy is simply of, by, and for big oil \nand OPEC, of course, their partners, their buddies benefit. So in the \nlong run, we need a comprehensive plan. We need conservation--that is \nthe cheapest and easiest way to get lower prices--and we need new \nproduction of alternatives and also, in a reasonable and sound \nenvironmental way, new production of fossil fuels in America.\n  But we are also looking for some short-term ways to reduce the price \nof gasoline because even should we embark on a long-term energy policy \nthat makes sense--and I am hopeful under the next administration, the \nnew President, she or he, will make sure that happens--there are things \nwe can at least attempt to do in the short term because people cannot \nwait 4, 5, 6 years to begin reducing the price. Even if tomorrow we \nwere to implement a comprehensive policy, it would not be enough, it \nwould not happen quickly enough.\n  So what can be done in the short term? One of the most important \nthings that could be done quickly in the short term is to increase \nsupply in existing reserves. The one country that has ample supply and \nhas held back is our good ``ally''--and I use that word in quotes--the \nSaudis. The Saudis should\n\n[[Page S3568]]\n\nbegin to understand that their relationship with America is a two-way \nstreet. They want our weapons, they want our troops to provide them \nwith protection, but then they rake us over the coals when it comes to \nthe price of oil.\n  The Saudis and big oil are in cahoots, and this administration has \ncoddled both of them for far too long. There is no better evidence of \nthis cozy cooperation than BP and Shell reporting record earnings this \nweek and ExxonMobil and others on deck to do the same.\n  The bottom line--the sad bottom line--is the whole Bush tax cut for \nmiddle-class families this year will line the pockets of OPEC. Let me \nrepeat that. The whole Bush tax cut for middle-class families this year \nwill line the pockets of OPEC. People will pay out more because of the \nincrease in energy prices than they got back on any tax rebate. The \nstimulus checks we are all so proud people are receiving, the stimulus \nchecks families will receive in the mail next month will, in all \nlikelihood, go to paying eye-popping gas and grocery bills this summer \nand end up in the coffers of countries such as Saudi Arabia. Therefore, \npeople will pay more for gasoline this year than they will receive from \ntheir stimulus checks. It is galling to think our stimulus checks will \nbe lining the pockets of OPEC.\n  Yet despite all this, last week, Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister said \nthere was no need to increase supplies by even one barrel of oil. \nHowever, as they are saying no, no, no to U.S. consumers, the Saudis \nare planning to double oil production for China.\n\n  Despite record billion-dollar profits, it seems the big oil \nproducers, such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait, \nare willing to turn a blind eye to the supply demands and leave \nAmericans with skyrocketing prices at the pump. In Saudi's case, they \nhave not produced as much oil in the last 2 years as they did in 2005.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at this chart when they get a \nchance because it says it all. Here is Saudi oil production in 2005. It \nis lower in 2006 and lower still in 2007. This is not new production \nthey have to explore for, this is not something where they have to \nchange things around. They can order the new production and we could \nhave millions of extra barrels of oil a day out there in the markets \nwithin a month or two, and the price would come down significantly.\n  The countries are putting profits straight into their pockets. So \nthat is why I, along with four others of my colleagues, have demanded \nthe Bush administration stipulate that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab \nEmirates, and Kuwait must increase their oil production or risk that \nCongress will block their lucrative arms deals while they stick it to \nAmerican consumers at the gas pump.\n  The administration has proposed selling roughly $14 billion in arms \nto gulf countries that are members of OPEC, and it is clear to us that \nwithout pressure from this administration, oil prices will continue to \nrise as countries such as Saudi Arabia will continue to reap the reward \nof high prices.\n  It is terrible that this administration, after making the American \ntaxpayer foot the bill for its war in Iraq, is now rewarding the very \ncountries that are driving up the price of oil.\n  Congress has the authority to block these arms deals, and we want to \nput the administration on notice that if they fail to deal aggressively \nwith OPEC countries that are not producing at their full capacity, we \nwill seriously consider blocking this and other arms deals.\n  On their face, I question the merit of these deals, $14 billion in \narms, but it is particularly egregious when Americans are paying \nthrough the nose to put money in the pockets of the administration's \nfriends in the Middle East. OPEC nations may have to protect themselves \nwith these weapons systems, but American consumers and our economy also \nneed protection from high oil prices, exacerbated by OPEC's \nstranglehold on supply.\n  The administration needs to use all the leverage it has to influence \nthe OPEC cartel to stop manipulating the world's oil supply to its \nmember nations.\n  Again, to those who say we cannot do anything in the short term to \nreduce prices, look again at this chart. Saudi production in 2005, \nSaudi production in 2006, Saudi production in the last full year we \nhave numbers for, 2007, it is lower and lower. The Saudis have not kept \nthe supply flat; they have decreased it at a time when the world is \nthirsty for oil.\n  At a time when the world is thirsty for oil, we know they are driving \ndown supply, increasing the price. Yesterday, President Bush said there \nis not much you can do about the price of oil. Mr. President, we beg to \ndiffer. Get your friends, the Saudis, get your close buddy, the King of \nSaudi Arabia, to begin producing more oil. If they produce half a \nmillion more barrels of oil a day, the price would come down a very \nsignificant amount and at the same time it would stop the speculation \nthat keeps driving up the price of oil. We would get a double benefit.\n  We need to ask ourselves what the economic consequences are for our \nNation--not only from the long and expensive war in Iraq but from this \nadministration's cozy relationship with the only international \norganization he seems to have any high regard for--OPEC.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we have been talking about the Durbin-\nHutchison amendment during most of the day. I have heard some of the \ndebate going back and forth. I want to address some of the issues \nraised in the debate, trying to stop our amendment from going forward.\n  First, let me say I so appreciate Senator Durbin joining with me to \nmake sure we have a bipartisan effort that stands for the companies \nthat are trying desperately to keep their defined benefit plans for \npensions for their employees.\n  These airlines that are doing this are doing it at the same time that \nthe price of jet fuel has gone up exponentially. For instance, since \nJanuary 2007, a little bit more than 1 year ago, the price of jet fuel \nhas increased 107 percent. Continental Airlines' year-over-year \nincrease in fuel costs is approaching $2 billion. This year, American \nAirlines' fuel bill is going to be $9.3 billion. Everybody who is \ndriving an automobile to their job or to pick up their children from \nschool knows how much it costs to fill up the tank of a car. Just \nmultiply that for an airline whose entire business is flying back and \nforth across the country and across the globe. You can imagine what \nthat does to the bottom line of a business.\n  Here we are, looking at actually three airlines that are trying to \nmake their benefits the most generous they can be while they are \nlooking at rising fuel prices that are about to sink them. They are all \nshowing unprofitable months and quarters. Now we have legislation \ncoming forward that would take away a law that was passed last year \nthat attempted to equalize the airlines that have benefit plans that \nare defined benefits and plans that are defined contributions, which \nare 401(k)s. We want to keep the playing field as level as we can. If \nyou put on top of that the fact that the timing of this could not be \nworse because of the rising fuel costs, it is just impossible to \nimagine that the Senate will do this.\n  The underlying provision, it has been suggested, would have no effect \non the bottom line. Of course it is going to have an effect on the \nbottom line. It requires full funding of pension obligations, \nirrespective of past overfunding. In plain English, the carrier must \ncome up with more cash, even if they have overpaid. According to one \ncarrier, the new cash demand would be $1 billion over the next 3 years. \nWhere are we going to find that amount of cash?\n  Domestic fare increases are not even covering the rising cost of \nfuel. As compared to January 2007, the price of jet fuel was 65 percent \nhigher and domestic average fares have risen 9 percent. You are \nbeginning to see they are not going to be able to recover this at the \nfare box. But if we pass this legislation requiring one airline, \ninstead of putting in $80 million, to put in $350 million, how is it \ngoing to offset those higher costs? There is only one way, and that is \nhigher ticket prices. Are we going to pass a law that is going to raise \nticket prices at a time when the airlines--and every American--are \nfeeling the pinch of this economy? I cannot even imagine we would do \nthat.\n\n[[Page S3569]]\n\n  I have also heard it argued that the provision in the bill that we \nare trying to eliminate is fair. The truth is the current law is \nequitable and fair. Changing the current law in the manner suggested \nwould treat two carriers differently from the other carriers that do \nnot have defined benefit plans. We had the equity debate. The current \nlaw is the product of that debate. Ask the carriers if they think the \ncurrent law is equitable. They will say yes.\n  The carriers that are not affected by this have told me they are \nagnostic on this issue. They are not pushing for a competitive \nadvantage because I think all the carriers know that this is not the \ntime that anybody wants to go into bankruptcy and they do not even want \ntheir competitors to go into bankruptcy because we can't handle the \ncommerce in this country without the airlines we have operating without \na disruption.\n  We settled this debate. We settled it in 2006. It was undone. We \nsettled it again in 2007. The law we passed must be adhered to because \nthese businesses made decisions based on the law.\n  The employees of these airlines will be the biggest losers if this \nbill is allowed to stand with this provision in it. Senator Durbin and \nI are trying to take this provision out to protect the employees and \nto, hopefully, keep the airlines from having a hit they cannot take \nright now.\n  I have heard the argument on this floor that the amendment we are \nputting forth would mean less money to employee pensions. It is exactly \nthe opposite. The carriers that are hurt by this provision are trying \nto do the right thing by maintaining their pensions and providing their \nemployees with strong retirement benefits. In fact, these impacted \ncarriers have been prepaying their pension obligations in good years, \nshowing their employees they are committed to these benefits. The \nexcess contributions helped ensure that, in tough times, if cash \nbecomes tight, the pensions of these hard-working employees are \nprotected and funded. If the pension rules are changed to disallow the \nflexibility of using past excess contributions, they will actually \ndiscourage overfunding of pensions. The carriers will only provide the \nminimum contributions in order to preserve cash in difficult times.\n  Some have challenged this claim on the belief that cash contributed \nto pensions can be pulled out in tough times, so they wouldn't be in \nany way discouraged from overcontributing to pensions. But this is not \ntrue. Once cash is contributed to the pension plans, it cannot be taken \nout. In fact, that is one of the reasons the current law allows \ncompanies to offset ongoing pension costs with previous overfunding. If \nthey couldn't do it, a company would never put extra cash into pension \nfunds. Instead, they would put it in a bank account where they could \nget it out. In the end, a carrier would never contribute in excess to \nthe plan because they just couldn't do it.\n\n  Employees are at risk with the underlying provision we are trying to \ntake out. The cash demands this language places on the carrier trying \nto secure solid pension benefits for its employees will simply be too \nhigh. If we destabilize this environment, we could very well jeopardize \nthe ability of these carriers to weather the current storm, and the \noutcome would be devastating to employees. Bankruptcy is not kind to \nemployees. Ask any person who has worked for a company that has gone \ninto bankruptcy. Whether it is their present livelihood or their \npensions, the employees would lose. That is why they support striking \nthis provision with our amendment.\n  The current pension laws for air carriers are fair and equitable. \nThey do not need changes. They especially do not need changes \nretroactively, after they have made decisions to overfund pension plans \nbased on the law as it is today. The change could lead to disastrous \nconsequences for impacted carriers and especially for their employees.\n  Why would we take such a risk? We should be doing everything to help \nthese companies during difficult operating environments, not \ndestabilizing them, not giving advantages to some in the industry.\n  No one in the industry is asking for this. This is something that has \ncome up seemingly because there were process arguments about what bill \nthe fix went into. The bill that the fix went into was the only \navailable bill where you could put an amendment, and the amendment had \nbeen given to all of the relevant committees, so they knew what we were \ntrying to do. There was nothing hidden. There was nothing sudden. \nEverybody knew we were going to try to correct the inequities, as we \nhave all negotiated at the table to do. If you ask any of the carriers \nI have spoken to, no one is asking for this to be retroactively fixed \nin a different way from the present law, a law that has been relied on.\n  The bottom line is some airlines have overfunded their pension \nobligations because they had cash and that is where they wanted to put \nit, to assure employees of a safe and sound pension system, more than \nthe law required. American Airlines is 115 percent funded. But that was \nalways done because, under the present law, you had the flexibility to \njust catch up with the current obligations with a credit for the \noverobligation as these airlines are working out their pension plans \naccording to the law we passed last year and the year before.\n  I hope we can get a vote on the Durbin-Hutchison amendment. The \nmembers of the committee who have worked on this--the Commerce \nCommittee, Senator Rockefeller, the chairman of the Aviation \nCommittee--have been very supportive of us having our bill, which we \nworked so hard in a bipartisan way to produce, which has such good \neffects for the aviation industry, not to be hobbled by an extraneous \nissue that has been put in by another committee that does not have the \naviation jurisdiction but is a tax committee.\n  I hope we will keep the underlying bill, which is very solid. Senator \nRockefeller and I, Senator Inouye, and Senator Stevens have worked very \nhard. We have a great bill. It is a bill that will fund more safety \nmeasures. It will put more inspectors in the FAA. It is a bill that has \na passengers bill of rights--Senator Boxer has worked on this for a \nlong time. It will assure that passengers who are stranded in a plane \nthat cannot take off will have accommodations for comfort or they will \nbe able to get off the airplane--something we have never had before.\n  It is a bill that will modernize the traffic control system so we \nwill have more service in our country. This bill has so many good \nfeatures. I hope we can pass the Durbin-Hutchison amendment that will \nkeep the bill intact that was hammered out by the Commerce Committee \nand not have it taken down by a tax bill, most of which has nothing to \ndo with aviation at all.\n  The aviation part of the bill is great. It is a good, solid \ncompromise. But the pension and the extraneous provisions are going to \nsink this bill, and it will be a sad day for the consumers in the \naviation system in this country if that happens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                          Mission Accomplished\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, tomorrow we mark the fifth anniversary of \nthe now infamous ``Mission Accomplished'' speech which was delivered by \nPresident Bush on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln on May 1, 2003.\n  Five years ago, I took issue with the President's choreographed \npolitical theatrics because I believed then that our military forces \ndeserved to be treated with respect and dignity, and not used as stage \nprops to embellish a Presidential speech.\n  The President's declaration of ``Mission Accomplished'' and the ``end \nof major combat operations'' proved wildly premature and dangerously \nnaive. The complete lack of foresight and planning by the President for \nwhat lay ahead became tragically clear in short order. Our Nation \ncontinues to pay the price every single day. More than 97 percent of \nthe more than 4,000 Americans killed in Iraq lost their lives after\n\n[[Page S3570]]\n\nthe President's flashy declaration of victory.\n  Years from now, I expect that history books will feature the sorry \n``Mission Accomplished'' episode as the epitome of this \nadministration's reckless and arrogant foreign policy, which has reaped \ndisastrous consequences for our Nation and the world. We have seen a \nPresident who is eager to use American troops for a political backdrop, \nyet who is seemingly indifferent when it comes to providing those same \nAmerican troops with the equipment they need, quality health care, or a \nreal plan for ending this terrible war.\n  President Bush has said that history will judge him on his decision \nto go to war in Iraq. I say that history is already delivering its \nverdict. It is evident in the strains of the long and multiple \ndeployments that are wearing down our mighty military, and in the \nsufferings of the American people as they bury their fallen heroes. It \nis evident in the fear and distrust with which the rest of the world \nviews us, and in the instability wracking the Middle East, Iraq, and \nAfghanistan as a result of the Bush policies.\n  President Bush has recklessly squandered more than 200 years of \nAmerican leadership, American good will, and prosperity. If that is \nwhat he was aiming for when he took office, then he can claim ``Mission \nAccomplished.'' That is his legacy. As we write the next chapter in our \nNation's history, let us commit to building a new legacy that restores \nthe promise of America, both at home and around the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I wish to inform the Presiding \nOfficer of a quandary. We have in front of us a bill which would come \nclose to rescuing the aviation industry of the United States of \nAmerica. It is a bill that the aviation industry supports. It is a bill \nthat the general aviation community supports. But it is not supported \nby a couple of Senators, with their reasons, and we find ourselves, \ntherefore, in a position not to be able to move forward in the short \nterm. It is one of those situations when the more you wait, or the \ngreater the disagreement, the more people dig in.\n  I wish to offer my feelings which are that in a big bill such as \nthis, which I think would be the biggest policy bill this Congress has \npassed this year if we were to do it, there are always areas of \ndisagreement. The trick is to work out those areas of disagreement. \nThat is what the floor of the Senate is for. That is what negotiations \nare for.\n  But I do want people to understand that in the interests of \nprotecting certain prerogatives, protocols, our aviation industry as a \nwhole is being ignored and thereby threatened. If we were to put up \nsome purportedly helpful amendments, we have no idea at this point how \nthey might turn out. So there are really a couple of people who control \nthis entire situation. As long as they remain negative, there is very \nlittle we can do that we can count on turning into success.\n  The aviation industry, just in my State, as I have explained a number \nof times, is a $3.4 billion industry that employs 51,000 people. That \nis something almost nobody does in a State as small as West Virginia. \nBut we have to work this through. Everybody can't come out an exact \nwinner. If I were to line up one side versus another side, I think \nhaving an aviation industry, giving them the confidence to go forward, \nthe passing of this bill would be like an increase in their bond \nrating, certainly psychologically, and it would give them the \nconfidence that we are trying to do the right thing by them.\n  In doing that, we have held all of the commercial aviation airlines \nharmless so they will not have to pay any more fuel tax than they do \ntoday, which is about $10.7 billion, and adding a small portion of fuel \ntax on to the general aviation industry so they would be paying about a \nbillion dollars.\n  We found a mechanism, being clever but correct, to actually raise \n$400 million a year for the life of this bill. Of course, there would \nhave to be other bills to get us on our way to building a $20 billion \nto $30 billion to $40 billion air traffic control system which is \nsufficient for the needs of the aviation industry. I know the Presiding \nOfficer has an amendment which I would support, and there are others \nwho have--they just don't want to--I don't know how to put it, but they \njust don't want to lose their position in all of this.\n  So the question is, What do we do? I am just here to report that we \nare hard at work. Everybody is working feverishly in back rooms--that \nis in a good sense--the Democratic and Republican cloakrooms. Senator \nHutchison and I are in precise agreement on all of this, and it is a \nbipartisan bill. It has enormous consequences to the economy of \nAmerica, to the passengers who are held hostage by delays and \nmaintenance problems. Sixty-eight rural States have had airports \nentirely removed from service which were previously served. It is very \npainful if you are from a rural State. It sort of defines the meaning \nof being cut off from the rest of the world. That is not important to \nsome people, but it is very important to those of us who come from a \nrural State, and to be quite frank, every one of us comes from a rural \nState in some part.\n  So what I am saying is, the stakes are extraordinarily high. It is, \nin my judgment, and on a bipartisan basis, an amazingly one-sided case. \nYou protect your legacies; that is, your commercial airlines, you get \nthe support of the general aviation community which has an enormous \nnumber of airplanes with millions more to come, and you get the \nfinancing to start on an air traffic control system which is behind \nthat of, as I have said today several times, Mongolia. Landing aircraft \nby ground radio and x-rays is not really the way to run a safe system. \nWe have had so many close collisions that have been averted only at the \nlast moment by air traffic control folks and very quick-witted pilots. \nHundreds and hundreds of deaths could have easily resulted.\n  So I think it is a choice of the people doing the negotiating or the \npeople who want to block the people who are doing the negotiating to \nthink in very clear terms about what is important. Is it pride? Is it \nthe future of the aviation industry? We haven't passed any bills in \nCongress on our side, and this would be a major accomplishment. But \nthat is not important. The importance is it would save an aviation \nindustry, and they believe that because the bill carries on for a \nnumber of years. They would begin to get their safe landing system.\n  So people must be wondering what is going on, and I just wanted to \nreport that people are at work, hopefully in good faith, trying to get \na parliamentary situation or an amendment situation or whatever that \nworks our way through this crisis.\n  In the meantime, we are on hold. I wanted to make that report to the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, our Nation depends on our system of \nair travel to do business, to visit family and friends, to connect us \nwith the world. We depend on the Federal Government to keep an eye on \nthat system and to make sure air travel is as safe as humanly possible. \nBut over the last 7 years, the American people's trust in the Federal \nAviation Administration has come crashing down. When we learned that \nthe FAA had allowed hundreds of flights on planes with cracks in them, \nthat was just the latest abuse of our trust.\n  It seems as if we are finding new regulatory problems in American \naviation every day. With every new headline and every whistleblower who \ncomes forward, we learn that something else has gone wrong--something \nthat could inconvenience us, at best and, at worst, claim human lives. \nMeanwhile, the FAA is enveloped in a cloud of cronyism and neglect. \nWhether we are\n\n[[Page S3571]]\n\ntalking about managing delays, maintaining safety, or managing its \nemployee relations, the FAA has constantly let us all down and put us \nall at risk.\n  Last month, we found out that Southwest Airlines was allowing dozens \nof planes to take off without inspection. We found out American \nAirlines was flying planes for weeks that had potentially dangerous \nwiring problems. When the news got out, thousands of Americans saw \ntheir flights canceled while airlines scrambled to comply with safety \nguidelines they should have been following all along.\n  Why did it take so long for the FAA to notice?\n  A few weeks ago, one FAA employee testified before Congress that when \nhe found out these planes were flying with cracks and complained about \nit, Southwest contacted the FAA, and he was removed--removed--from his \nrole of overseeing the airline. Other employees who complained were \nencouraged to transfer or removed from their posts.\n  Now, what is the FAA--the Federal Aviation Administration--supposed \nto be doing? Job 1, it seems to me, is to ensure the safety of the \nflying public. I know they have this dual mission. I have always \nwondered about that dual mission of safety and promoting the industry--\nthe other mission. But safety is job 1--job 1.\n  When they take employees who come forward and say: Look, there are \ncracks, maybe we should not let this airplane take off, or a series of \nairplanes take off, and because the company objects, it gets them \nhauled off of the job, or when others come forth and they are told: \nWell, maybe you should consider transferring, it simply undermines the \nvery essence of what is job 1. The message that was sent is: If you are \nan inspector, don't do your job too well or you will lose it.\n  Those are not the only safety concerns. The people of my home State \nof New Jersey have reason to be worried about safety at our airports. \nWe just learned that Teterboro Airport, which is one of the small but \none of the busiest airports we have in the region, has one of the \nhighest numbers of near-misses in the country. A few months ago, at \nNewark Airport, two planes came within seconds of crashing into each \nother. There was a similar incident in December and three near-misses \nlast May. How many serious close calls do we have to live through \nbefore the FAA takes this problem seriously?\n  Not only is the FAA failing to do due diligence on behalf of the \npeople in the air, they have risked the well-being of people on the \nground as well.\n  A while back, the FAA decided to redesign the airspace around some \nNew Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania airports. Now, I have been a big \nsupporter of airspace redesign since when I was first in the House on \nthe Transportation Committee. We live in the most congested airspace in \nthe Nation. We are in somewhat of a straitjacket. But the redesign \nshould have been done in such a way that not only did we do something \nabout delays, which this redesign does not do very much about, but it \nshould not have the pounding decibels of noise upon communities that \nthis new redesign does.\n  They decided to change the flightpaths--and it is fair to do that \nevery now and then--but they forgot one thing: They forgot to listen to \nthe people who are going to be flown over. When they rearranged the \nflightpaths, the FAA simply did not account for air noise and how it \naffects people's lives. I am not talking about simply being bothered by \na little noise. I am talking about the pounding and pounding and \npounding of decibel levels that actually affect hearing.\n  Some of the communities have populations that are least likely to be \nable to be in a position to do something about it. They forgot about \npeople such as Ray Bennett, who lives in Westville, NJ. He has lived \nthere for nearly 40 years. In all those years, he could not remember a \nsingle plane flying directly overhead, especially at low altitudes. \nNow, since the FAA rushed to implement this plan, not only is there \nnoise, but it is noise that causes his windows to vibrate and keeps him \nup at night. Imagine that. In the comfort of your own home, in a place \nwhere you should be able to find your own peace and quiet with your \nfamily, one day the Government decides to turn the volume level way up \nby running jet planes over your house regularly. Ray has seriously \nthought about moving out of his home, and it is hard to blame him. This \nis not a case of one or two isolated households. Planes are now flying \ndirectly over the center of the city of Elizabeth, NJ, affecting tens \nof thousands of people.\n  The effects go beyond annoyance. It can cost people money by reducing \nproperty values. In the midst of a nationwide housing crisis, in a time \nwhen far too many New Jerseyans are facing foreclosure, skyrocketing \nelectricity and home heating costs, and the specter of $4 per gallon \ngasoline, the last thing they need is for air noise to bring down their \nproperty values.\n  It is almost no wonder that we are seeing this agency become so out \nof touch, considering how toxic the working environment there has been. \nIn addition to the FAA's questionable safety record, there is also the \nissue of its hostile relationship with its own employees. Experienced \nair traffic controllers are leaving their jobs at an alarming rate, and \nthe FAA is struggling to attract, train, and keep new ones. But instead \nof trying to work with the unions to try to finally implement a \ncontract, they fan the flames by publicly suggesting that if the \ncontrollers do not like working for the FAA, they should reconsider \ntheir line of work. With this kind of working environment, it is no \nwonder we have a shortage of experienced controllers working to keep \nour skies safe.\n  We are talking about increasingly--and I fly, obviously, quite a bit, \ncertainly to my home State of New Jersey through Newark International. \nBut in the whole region, and across the country, where we have \ncontrollers--trainees, I should say. They are still not fully \ncontrollers. It takes about 5 years to fully train a controller. \nTrainees can only do part of the segment necessary, whether it be on \ntakeoffs, whether it be on landings, or whether it be about controlling \nthe airspace, as delays take place and aircraft are made to be put in \nholding patterns.\n  So imagine you and your family are up in an airplane and you are \ndealing with, increasingly, individuals who do not have the full \ncertification to do all of these elements together, which is what we \nwould like to see--for them to have the expertise. Because we can spend \nall the money in the world--and I appreciate the bill does move us \nforward in modernization and technology, and that is critically \nimportant--but at the end of the day, we can have the best technology \nin the world, but if, in fact, we do not have the human capital to make \nthat technology work successfully, then, in fact, we have failed. That \nhuman capital happens to be the air traffic controllers. At the end of \nthe day, all the technology in the world will be used by those \nindividuals. Human capital in this regard is incredibly important. The \nFAA has disdain for them. I believe they are the critical nexus to the \nsafety of the flying public. So you are seeing a system that is on a \npath to becoming slower and less safe because experienced personnel are \ncolliding with management.\n  When you have problems that are so widespread and an institutional \nculture that shows no sense of urgency, it is not just about one \nemployee or another, it is about a lack of leadership. That is why \nSenator Lautenberg, my colleague from New Jersey, and I have placed a \nhold on the nomination of Robert Sturgell as the FAA Administrator, and \nwe will continue the hold until the FAA truly addresses these and other \nconcerns.\n  We have no choice but to use every tool at our disposal to make this \nunresponsive bureaucracy do what is right for the well-being of the \nAmerican public. If the public's concerns are not being addressed at \nthe FAA, we will have to make sure they are addressed in Congress.\n  Which brings me to this bill. We have an opportunity--and I salute \nSenator Rockefeller and the members of the Commerce Committee who have \nworked with him to bring this bill to the floor--we have a tremendous \nopportunity with this authorization bill to set some things right.\n  This bill makes smart investments to make air traffic safer. It \nupgrades our aging airport infrastructure.\n\n  The bill improves the oversight of airlines and the FAA. This \nlegislation makes great strides in making air travel safer not only in \nthe skies, but on the runways.\n\n[[Page S3572]]\n\n  But I also believe the base bill can have some improvements, so at \nthe appropriate time--I want to talk about a few of them now--I will be \noffering some amendments to it. The first is to strengthen the \nprovision with reference to the revolving door between the FAA and the \nairline industry and end the cozy relationship between safety \ninspectors and the airline industry. We have to have faith and \nconfidence in the people who are critical to making sure that when we \nfly, we are flying in airplanes that are as safe as safe can be; that \nthey are not compromised. I appreciate what the committee did in the \nbill, but I think there are some elements of it that can be \nstrengthened.\n  The second amendment will require the FAA to monitor the air noise \nimpacts of the air space redesign and simply provide that data to the \npublic. I don't even understand why the FAA has no intention--no \nintention whatsoever--of monitoring air noise as a result of the \nredesign. I think the public has a right to know what health \nconsequences there are in that redesign, and that is a minimal--a \nminimal--amount of information and transparency that we should be \nallowing the flying public to have and the communities that are \naffected to know.\n  The third will help local communities coordinate with nearby airports \nto plan compatible land use and mitigate air noise and to receive \ngrants from the FAA to do so. This is incredibly important. There are \nseveral communities, I am sure, across the Nation, but in our State in \nthe city of Elizabeth, which is the third largest city in the State, it \nis pounded, pounded, pounded away--schools have actually held a press \nconference at one of the schools. I don't know how students learn at \nthat school, because all you hear is one constant drone of jet noise. I \ncan imagine a teacher in the classroom having to overcome that \nchallenge day in and day out to keep the attention of the students. We \nshould have the ability to make sure that in fact there is mitigation \nmoney for that noise, and we look forward to being able to offer that.\n  The last amendment we are considering is to address the growing \nproblem of low fuel landings. We have had a whole host of low fuel \nlandings at Newark International. That means you are sitting on an \nairplane and because the industry is trying to save money, they have \nless fuel in the aircraft and now, because you have been put in delays \nand holding patterns, it gets pretty low, maybe dangerously low. We \nwant to know what is the level of that and what is the reporting of \nthat so we can make judgments--and certainly so the FAA can make \njudgments--along the way. We think that is incredibly important.\n  Finally, one of the worst casualties of the Bush administration is \nhow much trust the public has lost in their Government. We lost trust \nwhen the administration flew us into Iraq on the wings of a lie. We \nlost trust when millions of dollars in tax breaks were given to those \nwith million-dollar bank accounts while the middle class saw their \neconomic situation get worse. And at the very least, at the very least, \nwe should be able to trust our Government to keep us safe when we take \nto the skies. That is the core mission of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. It is time for them to put that mission ahead of the \nfinancial interests of the industry they regulate. It is time for them \nto put that mission and our safety first. This bill goes an enormous \nway to making that happen.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Energy Independence\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, in 1942 President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt summoned a bipartisan group of congressional leaders to the \nWhite House. He outlined with them a secret plan to win World War II. \nAt the conclusion of the briefing, the President asked Kenneth McKellar \nof Tennessee, who chaired the Appropriations Committee in the Senate, \nif the Senator could hide $2 billion in the appropriations bill for \nthis project to win the war. Senator McKellar replied:\n\n       That will be no problem, Mr. President, but I have one \n     question: Just where in Tennessee do you want me to hide the \n     $2 billion?\n\n  That place in Tennessee turned out to be Oak Ridge, one of the three \nsecret cities, along with Hanford in Washington and Los Alamos in New \nMexico, that became the principal sites for the Manhattan Project.\n  The purpose of the Manhattan Project was to end the war by finding a \nway to split the atom and build a bomb before Germany could. Nearly \n200,000 people worked secretly in 30 different sites in three \ncountries. President Roosevelt's $2 billion appropriation equaled $24 \nbillion in today's dollars.\n  Less than 3 years later, after that conversation between President \nRoosevelt and Senator McKellar, the project succeeded when on August 6 \nand 9, 1945, the first atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and \nNagasaki. On August 14, Japan surrendered unconditionally.\n  According to New York Times science reporter William Laurence, who \nwatched the Nagasaki bombing:\n\n       Into its design went millions of man-hours of what is \n     without doubt the most concentrated intellectual effort in \n     history.\n\n  On Friday, May 9, I will go to one of those secret cities--Oak \nRidge--to propose that the United States launch a new Manhattan \nProject: A 5-year project to put America firmly on the path to clean \nenergy independence. Instead of ending a war, the goal will be clean \nenergy independence so we can deal with rising gasoline prices, \nelectricity prices, clean air, climate change, and national security--\nfor our country first, and--because other countries have the same \nurgent needs and therefore will adopt our ideas--for the rest of the \nworld.\n\n  By independence, I do not mean the United States would never buy oil \nfrom Mexico or from Canada or from Saudi Arabia. By independence I do \nmean the United States could never be held hostage by any country for \nour energy supplies.\n  In 1942, many were afraid that the first country to build an atomic \nbomb could blackmail the rest of the world. The overwhelming challenge \nin the Manhattan Project veteran George Cowan's words was:\n\n     the prospect of a Fascist world and the need to build a \n     weapon so powerful that it would quickly guarantee victory.\n\n  Today, countries that supply oil and natural gas can blackmail the \nrest of the world. Today's need is to create clean energy independence \nto quickly guarantee victory over that kind of extortion.\n  Such a concentration of brain power directed toward an urgent \nnational need is not a new idea, but it is a good idea, and it fits the \ngoal of clean energy independence.\n  The Apollo project to send men to the Moon in the 1960s was a kind of \nManhattan Project. Senator Susan Collins of Maine has suggested an \nenergy independence by 2020 project, comparable to the goal of putting \na man on the Moon. Others such as Senator Kit Bond of Missouri and \nCongressman Randy Forbes of Virginia have suggested a Manhattan Project \nfor clean energy or energy independence. As part of their ongoing \nPresidential campaigns, both Senator John McCain and Senator Barack \nObama have called for a Manhattan Project for new energy sources. \nLikewise, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Democratic National \nCommittee Chairman Howard Dean have said a Manhattan Project-type \nprogram is needed to develop technologies to free us from oil \ndependence.\n  All throughout the 2 years of discussion that led to the passage by \nthis Congress of the America COMPETES Act, several participants \nsuggested that we should focus on energy--believing that solving the \nenergy challenges would force the kind of investments in the physical \nsciences and research and teaching that the America COMPETES Act seeks \nto encourage.\n  The Manhattan Project in 1942 was in response to an overwhelming \nchallenge: the prospect that Germany would build a bomb and win the war \nbefore America did.\n  In his address on Monday to the annual meeting of the National \nAcademy of Sciences, Academy President Ralph Cicerone described today's \noverwhelming challenge, and that is the need to discover ways to \nsatisfy the human demand and use of energy in an\n\n[[Page S3573]]\n\nenvironmentally satisfactory and affordable way so we are not overly \ndependent on overseas sources. According to Cicerone, this year \nAmericans will pay nearly $500 billion overseas for oil--that is $1,600 \nfor each one of us--some of it to nations that are hostile to us or \neven trying to kill us by bankrolling terrorists. That weakens our \ndollar. It is half our trade deficit. It forces gasoline prices toward \n$4 a gallon, and it is crushing family budgets.\n  Then there are the environmental consequences. If worldwide energy \nusage continues to grow as projected and fossil fuels continue to \nsupply over 80 percent of that energy, humans would inject as much \nCO2 into the air from fossil fuel burning between 2000 and \n2030 as they did between 1850 and 2000. We have plenty of coal to help \nachieve our energy independence, but we have no commercial way yet to \ncapture the carbon from the coal, and we have not finished the job of \ncontrolling sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury emissions.\n  So instead of finding a way to build a bomb to win a war, the new \ngoal would be to find ways to help our country, which consumes 25 \npercent of all the energy in the world, to achieve clean energy \nindependence, and to do it at a price the family budget can afford, \nwith the hope that the rest of the world will follow our lead.\n  In addition to the need to meet an overwhelming challenge, other \ncharacteristics of the Manhattan Project are suited to the challenge of \na new Manhattan Project. First, it will require what Harris Mayer has \ncalled meta-engineering. Next, it needs to proceed as fast as possible \nalong several tracks to reach the goal.\n  According to Don Gillespie, a young engineer in Los Alamos during \nWorld War II:\n\n       The entire project was being conducted using a shotgun \n     approach, trying all possible approaches simultaneously, \n     without regard to cost, to speed toward a conclusion.\n\n  Next, it needs Presidential focus and it needs bipartisan support in \nCongress. It needs the kind of centralized, gruff leadership that Gen. \nLeslie R. Groves of the Army Corps of Engineers gave the first \nManhattan Project. A new Manhattan Project needs to put aside old \nbiases and subsidies and instead break the mold. As Dr. J. Robert \nOppenheimer said in a speech to Los Alamos scientists in November of \n1945 about the atomic bomb, the challenge of clean energy independence \nis ``too revolutionary to consider in the framework of old ideas.''\n  Most important, in the words of George Cowan as reported in a book on \nthe Manhattan Project edited by Cynthia C. Kelly:\n\n       The first Manhattan Project wouldn't have come into \n     existence at all without initial concepts that were spelled \n     out by a small number of extraordinary people. . . . The \n     Manhattan Project model starts with a small, diverse group of \n     great minds.\n\n  As I said to the various National Academies when we first asked for \ntheir help in the American competitiveness project in 2005:\n\n       In Washington, DC, most ideas fail for lack of the idea. We \n     need ideas from the best minds we have.\n\n  I said it then about American competitiveness, and I say it now about \nclean energy independence.\n  I addressed a meeting earlier this week of about 500 men and women \nfrom all over America who were here to encourage the Congress to fully \nfund the America COMPETES Act that we passed into law in 2007. The \nPresident has asked for an 18-percent increase in funding for the \nDepartment of Energy's Office of Science, which is the money for our \nnational laboratories. He has asked for a 13-percent increase in \nfunding for the National Science Foundation. Both of those would put us \non the road to doubling funding for the physical sciences so we can \nkeep our brain power advantage so we can keep our jobs from going \noverseas.\n  That was the recommendation of the small, diverse group of great \nminds whom we asked 3 years ago to tell us what we need to do to keep \nour brain power advantage. Most of the speakers at that meeting this \nweek were talking about the need to come persuade the Senator from New \nYork or the Senator from Tennessee or the Senator from some other State \nto fully fund the America COMPETES Act.\n  I see the Senator from New York here. He was very active in that \nlegislation, especially with a project from New York that helped focus \non better ways of teaching mathematics to young people. Almost all of \nus here have felt some sense of ownership of the America COMPETES \nlegislation: The majority leader and the minority leader were the \nprincipal sponsors, and 70 of us cosponsored it. So we saw the need for \nit. Now we need to apply even more focus and discipline on a different \ngoal, which is clean energy independence. That is why I am going to Oak \nRidge on May 9 to propose a second Manhattan Project for clean energy \nindependence.\n  I believe the work we did during the America COMPETES Act over the \nlast 3 years has important lessons for how we solve the energy \nchallenge.\n  Let's remember how America COMPETES happened. Three years ago, in May \nof 2005, a bipartisan group of us asked the National Academies to tell \nCongress in priority order the 10 most important steps we could take to \nkeep America's brain power advantage. Basically, we were asking for the \nantidote to the problems set out in Tom Friedman's book, ``The World is \nFlat.''\n  By October 2005, the academies had assembled what might be called a \n``small diverse group of great minds,'' chaired by Norm Augustine, a \nmember of the Academy of Engineering, which presented to the Congress \nand the President 20 specific recommendations in a report called \n``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.''\n  We worked with the Bush administration in a number of ``homework \nsessions'' to refine the proposals, and we considered a number of other \nvery good proposals by different competitiveness commissions.\n  Then, in January of 2006, President Bush outlined his American \nCompetitiveness Initiative to double over 10 years basic research for \nthe physical sciences and engineering, and he included money to do that \nin his budgets that he proposed 2 years ago, 1 year ago, and this year.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the \nSenate became the principal sponsors of the legislation. That didn't \nchange even when the Senate changed from Republican to Democrat.\n  Last week, I telephoned Ralph Cicerone, the president of the National \nAcademy of Sciences. I told him about my proposed May 9 Oak Ridge \nspeech. He told me about an address he made this past Monday before the \nannual meeting of the National Academy of Sciences on America's energy \nfuture. That study will be completed in 2010.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, following my remarks, \nthe remarks of Ralph Cicerone be printed in the Record from the 145th \nannual meeting of the Academy of Sciences on Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I told Dr. Cicerone that what I will be \nproposing at Oak Ridge will require more specific and quicker action \nthan what the National Academies already have underway. I hope that \nwithin the next few weeks, a bipartisan group of us from the Congress \ncould meet with the National Academies and see what concrete proposals \nwe might offer the new President and the new Congress, and that we \ncomplete that work this year.\n  Democrat Bart Gordon, a Congressman from Tennessee and chairman of \nthe Science Committee in the House of Representatives, was--along with \nSenator Bingaman, myself, and then-Congressman Sherwood Boehlert--one \nof the four original signers of the 2005 request to the National \nAcademies that led to the America COMPETES Act. Congressman Gordon will \njoin me in Oak Ridge on May 9, and he will address those who are there \nabout clean energy independence. Also there--and cohost for the \nmeeting, along with the Director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory--\nwill be Congressman Zach Wamp, a senior Member of the House \nAppropriations Committee in whose district we will be. I have talked \nthis week with our leaders in the Senate on energy, Senator Bingaman \nand Senator Domenici--both of New Mexico--who have played such a large \nrole in the America COMPETES Act over the last 3 years. I talked with \nSenator Murkowski, who likely will succeed Senator Domenici as the \nsenior Republican\n\n[[Page S3574]]\n\non the Energy Committee when Senator Domenici retires at the end of \nthis year.\n  I know this is a Presidential election year. I have no illusions \nabout the difficulty of bipartisan congressional action. But I also \nknow that gasoline is nearing $4, and that the electricity produced by \nAmerica today is not clean enough for our country. I also know that, on \nour present course, we permit other countries in the world to whom we \nare paying $500 billion a year the possibility of blackmailing us, or \nother countries, because of their ownership of oil assets. I believe \nnow is the best possible time for Members of Congress and candidates \nfor President of the United States to address the clean energy \nindependence goal.\n  Let us compete to see who can come up with the best ideas and compare \nthem with one another, knowing that in the end--especially in the \nSenate--it will take the kind of bipartisan cooperation we had with the \nAmerica COMPETES Act to get a result. After all, the people didn't \nelect us to take a vacation this year just because there is a \nPresidential election.\n  This country of ours is a remarkable place. While enduring this \neconomic slowdown, this year we will produce about 30 percent of all \nthe wealth in the world for 5 percent of those of us who live here. We \nhave 30 percent of the wealth in the world, but we are just 5 percent \nof all the people in the world.\n  Despite the ``gathering storm'' of concern about American \ncompetitiveness, no other country approaches our brain power \nadvantage--the collection of research universities we have, the \nnational laboratories we have, the private sector companies that exist \nin the United States. And this United States is still the only country \nwhere people can say with a straight face that anything is possible--\nand believe it.\n  These are precisely the ingredients America needs during the next 5 \nyears to place ourselves firmly on a path to clean energy independence \nand, in doing so, we can make our jobs more secure, help balance the \nfamily budget, make our air cleaner and our planet safer and healthier, \nand lead the world to do the same by our example.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                           Energy Challenges\n\n   (Presented to the 145th Annual Meeting of the National Academy of \n         Sciences, Ralph J. Cicerone, President, Apr. 28, 2008)\n\n       As I stand before the members of the NAS, I feel as each of \n     you would in my place--that it is a great honor and a rare \n     opportunity to address you here in our historic NAS building. \n     As you know, we are planning a major restoration of the \n     building which will be discussed further in tomorrow's \n     business meeting.\n       I want to recognize NAS Presidents-Emeritus Frank Press and \n     Bruce Alberts who are here with us today. Each of them led \n     the Academy with distinction and continues to represent us \n     well.\n       The past year has been a very busy one, reflecting the \n     importance of science and technology in contemporary society. \n     One project, the revision and updating of our 1984 and 1999 \n     booklets on science and creationism, was completed when the \n     new booklet, Science, Evolution and Creationism was released \n     in January. This project was initiated and supported by the \n     NAS Council. For this third edition, we invited the Institute \n     of Medicine to join the NAS.\n       The authoring committee is shown here. I ask each of the \n     authors who is here today to stand.\n       Today I want to use the opportunity to draw your attention \n     to a major issue of today, human demand for and usage of \n     energy, a topic that has become progressively more serious, \n     one that will take years to address and which requires \n     scientific efforts of many kinds.\n       In the past fifty or sixty years there have been other \n     transforming issues that have dominated national and \n     international attention and which required science and \n     technology for any successful outcome, but these earlier \n     cases have not been numerous. One can recall the nuclear arms \n     race, the polio outbreaks of the 1950's, and the very rapid \n     increases of human populations of the 1950's and 1960's. \n     Science made possible the cessation of nuclear weapons \n     testing through demonstrated capability to detect the \n     detonation of even relatively small weapons, while \n     computational methods enabled stockpile stewardship. \n     Similarly, through medical immunology, scientists came to \n     understand the cause of polio and created preventive \n     vaccines; and the Green Revolution made it possible to feed \n     many more people. Two other major issues in which public \n     attention was focused on science and technology were the \n     launching of early Earth-orbiting satellites (and placing a \n     man on the Moon), and the capabilities that emerged in the \n     early 1970's from molecular biology for safe laboratory DNA-\n     transfer experiments.\n       Now in 2008, we see that human demand and usage of energy \n     is a pervasive issue. The issue has multiple dimensions and \n     constraints. It is both national and worldwide. Enormous in \n     scale, it will remain serious for the foreseeable future, and \n     science and engineering are essential for progress.\n\n\n                              Main Points\n\n       My main points today are:\n       Our energy-intensive way of life, population growth and \n     worldwide economic progress combine to create large and \n     growing demand for energy.\n       Our options to meet this large demand with types of energy \n     now available to us are seriously constrained. We must assure \n     access to energy and geopolitical security, overcome the \n     financial impact of high costs, deal with climate change, \n     other environmental impacts, nuclear safety and wastes. There \n     is no simple single solution and some attractive options are \n     mutually incompatible.\n       Science and technology and scientists are essential to \n     meeting this pervasive challenge.\n\n\n                        Energy Usage and Demand\n\n       The scale of human energy usage today is large and \n     projections of future demands are even larger. Let me begin \n     by outlining current energy usage in the United States.\n       We consume 100 Quadrillion BTU (one Quad is 10\\15\\ BTU) per \n     year as a nation, or 3.3 x 10\\8\\ BTU per person annually. \n     There are many ways to disaggregate these figures. For \n     example. we can examine end usage by economic sector or by \n     function. One such cut reveals that 28 percent of U.S. energy \n     usage is for transportation (burning gasoline, diesel and jet \n     fuel) and 39 percent is used in buildings for lighting, \n     heating, cooling, appliances and office equipment.\n       What are the sources of our primary energy? For the U.S., \n     85 percent comes from the burning of fossil fuels: 23 percent \n     from natural gas, 23 percent from coal and 40 percent from \n     petroleum (using rounded numbers). Eight percent is derived \n     from nuclear power and six percent from renewable sources \n     like hydropower (3 percent), biomass (3 percent), geothermal \n     sources, wind, and solar.\n       Two key factors are liquid fuels for transportation and \n     coal burning to generate electricity. Slide 5 shows growth in \n     U. S. imports and consumption of petroleum.\n       Net imports grew from 3 million barrels per day in 1970 and \n     surpassed domestic ``production'' in 1996. Today, we import \n     approximately twelve million barrels of oil daily, most of it \n     for transportation, and we consume about six million barrels \n     of oil more each day for running our automobiles and trucks \n     than is produced (extracted, to be more precise) \n     domestically.\n       A related figure is the fraction 41 percent of primary \n     energy consumption that goes into producing electricity.\n       Annually, the U.S. consumes about 3800 billion kWh of \n     electricity, with an average instantaneous consumption rate \n     of 440 million kW, or 1.47 kW per person. Because of \n     considerable inefficiency in the conversion of primary energy \n     into electricity during generation and losses in its \n     distribution, the electrical energy received by the end user \n     is only about one-third of the primary energy invested in \n     generating it.\n       Our electricity is generated in several ways but the major \n     pathways are from coal burning (52 percent), nuclear power \n     (20 percent), natural gas (19 percent) and renewable energy \n     including hydropower (8.5 percent). While still small, \n     electricity generated from wind power grew by over 25 percent \n     compounded annually from 2001-2005.\n       Slide 7 shows world energy consumption 1970-2005 and \n     projected usage to 2030, developed & developing countries. \n     Worldwide energy consumption was about 447 quadrillion BTU in \n     2004. This figure grew from approximately 207 quadrillion BTU \n     in 1970; it doubled in 30-32 years. World average energy \n     consumption is approximately 6.2x10 \\7\\ BTU/person, or only \n     one-fifth as much as for Americans. The fraction of total \n     world energy usage from fossil-fuel sources was about 87 \n     percent in 2004, slightly higher than the corresponding U.S. \n     figure. The fraction of world electricity from nuclear power \n     was only six percent as opposed to eight percent in the U.S. \n     although it is well known that France's electricity is \n     generated primarily (70 percent) from nuclear power, and of \n     course, there are other nations that employ no nuclear power \n     at all. Recently, Germany has emerged as a world leader in \n     capturing wind energy and in the manufacturing of \n     photovoltaic cells for the direct conversion of sunlight to \n     electricity, as is Japan.\n       World energy consumption is projected to grow to \n     approximately 700 quadrillion BTU in 2030, another doubling \n     from its early 1990's value. Much of this projected growth is \n     likely to occur in developing, or emerging market countries, \n     where there is great demand for energy usage per capita to \n     grow, while slower growth is projected for mature market \n     countries like those of advanced developed countries. One \n     projection is for non-OECD countries (including China and \n     India) to increase energy usage by over three percent \n     annually, more than doubling between 2004 and 2030 while U.S. \n     energy growth is projected to be one percent annually. This \n     differential growth will continue trends observed from 1999-\n     2005 when China and India increased their energy usage by 80 \n     percent and 25 percent, respectively.\n       The dynamics and impacts of this differential growth are \n     extremely important to analyze. For example, we must \n     understand what\n\n[[Page S3575]]\n\n     is driving this increased demand (electrification, pumping \n     water for irrigation and for manufacturing and consumer uses, \n     population growth . . .). We must also anticipate impacts on \n     world prices and availability and on world geopolitics, \n     environment and climate. A recent report from the \n     InterAcademy Council is a rich source of data on growing \n     demand and strategies for satisfying it worldwide.\n\n\n                Impacts of Energy Usage and Constraints\n\n       For many years there have been concerns over the stability \n     of energy supplies or the cost of energy or the consequences \n     of too much dependence on overseas sources or over various \n     environmental impacts. Now all of these concerns are \n     operative at once and they are seen as long term as \n     opposed to temporary.\n       For example, as U.S. consumption of petroleum, mostly for \n     transportation, has grown, and costs have risen to over $100 \n     per barrel, the net flow of dollars to oil-exporting \n     countries has ballooned to between $450 to $500 billion \n     annually, as noted recently by former CIA Director James \n     Woolsey. Let me note that even at the now past price of $65 \n     per barrel, 300 million Americans send $1000 each overseas \n     for oil annually. At our NAS/NAE energy symposium on March \n     14, former Secretary of Energy and Secretary of Defense James \n     Schlesinger said that our dependence on foreign oil is \n     allowing some hostile oil-exporting countries to accumulate \n     dollars, resulting in diminished U.S. influence not only \n     toward them but also with our allies. He stated that ``we \n     cannot ensure energy security, only mitigate energy \n     insecurity''.\n       Predicting future energy costs is perilous and certainly \n     not a talent of mine. Personally, I did not predict that \n     gasoline would cost $3.5 to $4 per gallon as it is now. \n     However, there is general consensus that the era of low cost \n     energy is over, largely due to increasing demand from \n     developing countries. Thus, one can expect U.S. purchases of \n     oil to continue and world prices to remain high enough to \n     cause difficulties for poorer countries. Worldwide fleets of \n     car and trucks demand oil as does the growing commercial \n     airline sector. High costs of energy are being felt by \n     individuals, families, businesses, universities, governments, \n     and hospitals, for example. High energy costs are now \n     beginning to be blamed for rising grain costs and food \n     shortages in some countries.\n       The imperative for access to secure energy supplies prompts \n     some regions and countries to turn to coal or to nuclear \n     power. For example, the U.S., China, South Africa and India \n     have substantial domestic coal supplies. Environmental and \n     climatic impacts must be dealt with. Inadvertent emissions of \n     soot, sulfur, nitrogen oxides and mercury, historical \n     challenges which have been met in some selected regions, \n     remain major problems elsewhere and due to the scale of coal \n     usage, they are increasingly serious problems, as are \n     deleterious effects of coal mining on land surfaces and \n     ground water. In each of the last several years, a large \n     number of coal-fired power plants have been built in China; \n     total generating capacity from these plants has increased \n     annually by approximately 95 Gwatts (adding approximately the \n     entire capacity of France or Germany).\n       In recent years it has become clearer that the global \n     climate is changing in response to increased atmospheric \n     concentrations of carbon dioxide from fossil-fuel burning. \n     Current atmospheric concentration of CO2 is over \n     380 ppm, compared to a pre-industrial level of 280 ppm. \n     Climate change is being observed in elevated air and sea \n     temperatures, losses of ice, rising sea level and several \n     other variables, and it is judged mostly due to greenhouse \n     gases, including carbon dioxide, from human activities. While \n     some climate change can be accommodated, there is increasing \n     evidence and concern that dangerous changes can also occur. \n     ``Dangerous'' here is defined as irreversible changes such as \n     sea-level rise and loss of biodiversity, and generally other \n     physical variables whose rates of change exceed the rates at \n     which we can adapt to them. Large or prolonged changes in \n     regional water supplies can destabilize entire nations.\n       While it might be intuitive to guess that we could \n     stabilize worldwide atmospheric carbon dioxide amounts by \n     holding worldwide emissions constant, the natural uptake of \n     atmospheric CO2 by the global carbon cycle is only \n     about 40 percent of current emissions; this figure has been \n     derived by decades of research, much of it by NAS members. \n     Current annual emissions are nearly seven billion tons of C \n     as CO2. The eventual steady-state atmospheric \n     concentration of CO2 from current emissions would \n     be over 650 ppm. Thus, a specified carbon constraint such as \n     preventing atmospheric CO2 from rising above \n     say 450 parts per million, is difficult to satisfy: it \n     would require reducing emissions by more than four billion \n     tons (C) from current levels. Several examples show how \n     difficult it will be. Reducing emissions by just one \n     billion tons C per year would require a fleet of two \n     billion cars to achieve 60 mpg instead of 30 mpg, or \n     replacing 700 one GW coal-burning power plants with \n     nuclear plants, or replacing coal-burning plants with one \n     million 2 MWe (peak) wind turbines or 2,000 1-GWe (peak) \n     photovoltaic power plants.\n       Instead, if worldwide energy usage continues to grow as \n     projected and fossil fuels continue to supply over 80% of \n     that energy, worldwide CO2 emissions would grow to \n     over ten B tons C annually by 2030, just 22 years from now. \n     At such a rate of fossil-fuel burning, humans would inject as \n     much CO2 into the air from fossil-fuel burning \n     between 2000 and 2030 as they did between 1850 and 2000.\n       In addition to climatic change from carbon dioxide, we \n     expect the world's oceans to become acidified by the \n     CO2 added from the atmosphere. Research on the \n     biological effects of this acidification is in its early \n     stages and there are many questions surrounding the ability \n     of calcifying marine organisms to make shells, for example.\n       The view that emerges is of a carbon-constrained world. \n     Taking into account the fact that coal is relatively \n     plentiful and that its supplies are secure within several \n     large countries, and recognizing the carbon constraint gives \n     rise to the need for research on carbon capture and storage \n     (CCS) and to other means to tap into coal's energy without \n     releasing CO2 to the atmosphere and oceans.\n       Even if coal, for example with effective CCS, could be used \n     even more intensively to generate electricity, one must \n     realize that to use today's fleets of cars and trucks and \n     airplanes, one requires liquid fuels, presumably from oil. \n     While coal yields less energy per unit of CO2 \n     released, carbon constraints apply to oil and natural gas as \n     well as to coal.\n       The constraints of energy supply, dependence on foreign \n     sources and atmospheric carbon dioxide cause us to consider \n     wider usage of nuclear power. Nuclear power plants, currently \n     based on nuclear fission processes, offer several advantages \n     in that their operation does not emit carbon dioxide nor are \n     supplies of nuclear fuel thought to be seriously limited \n     physically or immediately. Widespread utilization of nuclear \n     power is limited instead by concerns over safety of operation \n     and over waste handling, storage and disposal. Strongly \n     related is the need to prevent the misappropriation of \n     nuclear wastes to produce nuclear weapons or conventional \n     bombs spiked with radioactivity (dirty bombs). In addition, \n     costs of electrical power from current nuclear plants exceed \n     those for coal and from natural gas; capital costs of nuclear \n     plants are much higher. These concerns have virtually stopped \n     the building of new and replacement nuclear power plants in \n     many countries since approximately 1980.\n       For nuclear power to satisfy large parts of current and \n     future world demand for electrical energy would require the \n     siting, construction and operation of large numbers of new \n     and replacement nuclear power plants such as a tripling or \n     quadrupling of the number of such plants now in service. \n     Local limitations on volumes and temperatures of cooling \n     water will tighten as tensions grow over water supplies and \n     heat waves intensify. Even if successful, we would not have \n     satisfied much of world demand for energy to drive \n     transportation, now supplied by petroleum, with today's fleet \n     of automobiles and trucks.\n\n\n    Agenda for Scientists, the National Academy of Sciences and the \n                       National Research Council\n\n       The constraints placed on energy choices for the United \n     States and for the world today can appear to be intractable. \n     For example, large U.S. domestic coal reserves, much of our \n     existing infrastructure and the goal of energy security all \n     argue for more dependence on coal. However, we are pushed in \n     the opposite direction by the pressing need to reduce \n     CO2 emissions to the atmosphere so as to limit \n     climate change, and by several other environmental impacts \n     including ocean acidification. In a democracy there are many \n     different voices representing people with differing values \n     and interests, such as protecting or advancing locally based \n     industries, and also with differing weighting factors for \n     addressing the various constraints.\n       All of these challenges place scientists and engineers in \n     an essential position--we can:\n       Perform research relevant to energy supplies and usage,\n       Formulate and analyze options for decisionmakers,\n       Inform the public about research and policy options,\n       Advise and help government officials and business leaders,\n       Develop scientific and engineering human resources.\n       We must address each of these needed roles with \n     complementary skills. Along with creating specialized \n     processes and strategies, we need big-picture synthesis. For \n     example, achieving increased energy efficiency can relax all \n     of these constraints but implementing this goal requires \n     great attention to detail.\n       The NAS and the NAE, working through the NRC, are \n     conducting a study, America's Energy Future, and it will be \n     published in less than a year from now. This report will \n     present objective, quantitative data and estimates of \n     contributions to our energy supply from various energy \n     technologies, including energy-efficiency technologies, along \n     with their costs. Many NAS and NAE members and other experts \n     are involved on this project. It is led by economist Harold \n     Shapiro, President-emeritus of Princeton University (and an \n     IOM member). This report will lay a foundation for much more \n     work to follow on energy research, energy-policy options and \n     worldwide cases. It is intended to provide what Benjamin \n     Franklin aptly described as ``useful knowledge'' to \n     individuals and groups in business and government and the \n     general public as they consider how to transition to the \n     energy trajectories that are needed.\n\n[[Page S3576]]\n\n       We are also beginning a new suite of studies on climate \n     change, focusing on how to benefit from and extend the \n     scientific understanding of climate change and also how to \n     mitigate it and adapt to it.\n       Scientific research, as always, offers possibilities for \n     improvements in how we extract, convert, store, distribute \n     and consume energy. Indeed, research can lead to major \n     changes which could revolutionize our current systems and \n     which could dodge some of the constraints that now bind us. \n     Opportunities for this research to create new technologies \n     with worldwide business potential are enormous.\n       There are numerous fascinating research topics in physical \n     and biological sciences which could dramatically transform \n     the energy landscape or which could at least improve our \n     options. Photovoltaic devices based on new materials to \n     convert sunlight into electricity and chemical means to \n     convert sunlight into chemical fuels offer great \n     opportunities. Photosynthesis-based designs are beginning to \n     receive some attention. Energy-storage devices with high \n     energy and power densities could enable much wider use of \n     solar, wind and nuclear energy, for example, in electric-\n     drive vehicles.\n       Alternative energy sources for transportation must match or \n     overcome a large advantage of liquid hydrocarbons; the \n     oxidizer for their combustion does not have to be carried \n     along with the fuel. A major goal is to derive petroleum \n     substitutes from plant matter other than food crops which \n     would be approximately carbon-neutral. Microbiological \n     processes enhanced by molecular biology comprise many \n     potential advanced pathways toward creating liquid biofuels \n     such as alcohols. In such advanced processes, efficient use \n     of normally recalcitrant material like plant cellulose and \n     lignins must be made. Progress from this laboratory-based \n     biological research is needed to obtain higher biofuel yields \n     which justify inputs of energy, fertilizer, water and land. \n     These input/output ratios themselves and corresponding \n     tradeoffs require research to clarify the value of this \n     option.\n       Wider usage of nuclear power to generate much larger \n     amounts of electricity could displace some fossil-fuel usage \n     but it requires safe and efficient handling of wastes which \n     in turn require secure geological and geochemical storage. \n     Similarly, economical and safe waste-to-fuel reprocessing \n     represent research and engineering challenges and \n     opportunities, and some materials problems with reactors \n     remain.\n       As has been the case for too many years, nuclear fusion \n     remains a distant but tantalizing pathway toward plentiful \n     energy, with almost no radioactive waste, but very difficult \n     problems in confining high-temperature plasmas have impeded \n     progress.\n       A host of other research frontiers must be explored, for \n     example, can carbon dioxide be effectively captured and \n     stored in geological reservoirs in amounts measured in tens \n     of billions of tons and for centuries? Can transmission lines \n     be vastly improved through superconductivity or by using \n     direct current transmission instead of AC, with better system \n     analysis and control? If so, solar and wind energy can be \n     distributed in ways to match generation and demand time \n     functions better.\n       Scientific research on climate change is essential to \n     enable us to predict how climate will change in smaller \n     geographical areas and shorter time intervals than is now \n     possible so as to guide our efforts in mitigating the changes \n     and in adapting to changes that do transpire. Economic \n     science and social phenomena must be incorporated in this \n     endeavor, and as is the case in all of the topics mentioned \n     here, computational science has become essential.\n       In deciding how to deal with the constraints placed on us \n     by U.S. and global energy usage, governments, businesses, \n     NGO's and individuals want to know what options they have. An \n     important role for us as individuals and through National \n     Research Council committees is to help to formulate and \n     analyze options that can illuminate the consequences of \n     various proposed actions. This work can consist of focused \n     analyses of specific energy sources or pathways and \n     respective technologies, or on comparisons of many \n     alternatives. Variables include physical, chemical and \n     biological principles, costs, readiness for deployment, \n     social acceptance and time frames. In many cases, those who \n     will make decisions amongst the options will be political or \n     business leaders who have little or no scientific background, \n     so scientists' communications skills will be tested. In these \n     interactions centered on formulation and analysis of options, \n     scientists must be prepared to interact with such \n     decisionmakers in iterative ways. It is likely that some \n     overall pathways to a more secure, safe and robust energy \n     strategy will involve short-term options in preparation for \n     transitions to a longer term.\n       More broadly, scientists can inform the public about \n     research prospects and goals and about policy options. The \n     pervasive nature of our challenges with energy requires wide \n     public awareness and consensus, and arriving at consensus \n     will be challenging. Whether deciding how to locate solar \n     collector arrays, nuclear power plants or wind farms or how \n     to gauge the benefits of various biofuels or automobile fuel \n     efficiency, and how to invest their own resources or public \n     funds, people must appreciate the constraints and the goals \n     to choose the best options and to avoid costly mistakes and \n     ineffective actions. Scientists who are effective \n     communicators should present public talks and/or help other \n     scientists and journalists who are even more effective. In \n     our NAS communications with the general public, we plan to \n     emphasize energy topics in several ways.\n       We depend on many structures and institutions to govern us. \n     Agencies of the U.S. Government which support science \n     research, set standards, monitor and regulate trade, products \n     and pollutants need qualified people to serve in them and \n     they need external counsel through advisory committees, for \n     example. Each of us should serve when invited, and we should \n     prepare thoroughly for each assignment. Important roles in \n     advising the government are carried out by the National \n     Research Council. State and local governments have many \n     significant energy issues in front of them so the need for \n     scientific advice is even larger. Scientists can also help \n     each other when one is called to advise.\n       Education of the current and future generations of students \n     is a high priority. All of the needs listed above require an \n     educated public to recognize our options, to understand their \n     consequences, and to exploit opportunities. Students who will \n     go on into business and government will have big roles just \n     as future scientists will. We must develop human resources, \n     both broadly and in specific scientific endeavors, from \n     microbiology and molecular biology to nuclear science and \n     engineering. Our university curricula for science and for \n     non-science students must create awareness of challenges and \n     opportunities surrounding energy usage, efficiency and \n     related research. As always, research opportunities for \n     students are especially important.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       We must change the trajectories of our energy usage and \n     energy sources. World peace, economic development for much of \n     the world, continuing prosperity for the developed countries \n     and a stable climate require us to do so. To create and \n     analyze options, and to educate and inform people about the \n     work ahead, scientists and engineers are critical.\n       There is no single action or individual technology that \n     will take us to this goal. (The glass(es) are partly filled \n     and partly empty. The baseball is just for fun!)\n       Rather we must explore all sources and pathways and \n     discover, invent and optimize in each case. While it might \n     disappoint some people that there is no single pathway to \n     success, a world in which many energy sources and solutions \n     are integral to the whole will be more stable and less \n     susceptible to disruption. Our enthusiasm and efforts must be \n     broad as we seek to discover and disseminate useful \n     knowledge.\n       A great deal of innovative and determined work is needed by \n     scientists and engineers in the years ahead. It is our \n     privilege and our responsibility to rise to these energy \n     challenges. Let's get going; there is a lot of useful \n     knowledge to be gained.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, I welcome the bipartisan support \nfor programs that will move us toward energy independence. I agree with \nmy colleague from Tennessee that we need to do a Manhattan-type \nproject, with the same type of commitment we made when putting a person \non the Moon, to become energy independent. We have the technology. We \nknow how to get it done. If we have the will, this Nation can do \nanything it wants to do.\n  I think there is a growing awareness among Members of this body, as \nwell as on the other side of the Capitol, that we need to take \nimmediate steps so this Nation can become energy independent. So I \nwelcome the comments that have been made.\n  I come to the floor because the people of Maryland and throughout the \nNation are hurting today. The most recent assault on their pocketbooks \nhas been filling up their cars with gasoline. The costs are prohibitive \nfor families--gasoline prices. Quite frankly, I think the \nadministration is doing virtually nothing to help those who are trying \nto afford energy costs today--whether it is their electricity bills in \ntheir homes, or whether it is running the family automobile, or whether \nit is a business that requires them to use an automobile. This \nadministration has done very little to help deal with the escalating \ncosts of energy. Instead, they look for additional tax breaks for oil \ncompanies, or they want to extend tax cuts for millionaires. They don't \ncome forward with energy policies that would try to make energy much \nmore affordable.\n  I believe we need to have a strong energy legislation in this \nCongress. Let me give you some of the statistics that people in my \nState of Maryland are confronting on energy costs. Electricity rates \nwent up 72 percent in 2007. Gasoline prices in Maryland are now $3.49, \non average, for regular gasoline, and $3.80 for high test. That is a \n150-percent increase since President Bush took office.\n\n[[Page S3577]]\n\n  Let me try to translate this as to how it affects the average family \nin my State. When you take a look at what household costs have gone up, \njust for gasoline for your automobile, since President Bush took \noffice, for a typical household it has increased $2,731 for the people \nof Maryland. If that household has children, it is an increase of \n$3,414 a year. If they have a teenager also operating a car, it has \ngone up over $4,000. To me, that is a shocking increase in just 7 years \non the cost of gasoline that we put into our automobiles.\n  I recently had a conversation with small business owners in Maryland. \nSixty-two percent of small business owners use a vehicle in their \nbusiness. They need automobiles. They have to fill these tanks with \ngasoline. The majority drive over 50 miles a day in their automobiles \nto operate their businesses. So the statistics show that small \nbusinesses--and all of us talk about helping small businesses--spend \nmore than their competitors that are large companies on energy costs. \nIt can cost up to three times as much for a small business person for \ntheir energy cost to deliver a product to the market than for larger \ncompanies. I am sure you are aware that small businesses don't have the \nsame availability of capital in order to buy equipment or the same \navailability of capital in order to keep their businesses afloat. Many \nsmall business owners are mortgaging their homes in order to keep their \nbusinesses going. Many are using credit cards with the highest possible \ninterest rates to keep afloat. Now they have additional energy costs. \nSo, yes, we need to take action on the energy problem.\n  I must tell you that the first thing we need is a national energy \npolicy. We have had bills that have been submitted on this floor. I \nappreciate my colleagues on both sides of the aisle coming forward in \nsupport of a national energy policy for energy independence. But if you \nremember when we voted on the renewable energy portfolio, we didn't \nseem to get the votes we needed from the Republican side of the aisle. \nIt is time to take action on a national energy policy--one that will \ntruly make this Nation energy independent--whether you call it a \nManhattan-type project or an Apollo-type project, we can do it. We can \ndo it by using less energy and by developing alternative and renewable \nenergy sources. We can do it in a way that will be good for America.\n  We should not be dependent for oil upon any country halfway around \nthe world, that disagrees with our policies. We have to eliminate our \ndependency on imported oil. We need to do that for the security of \nAmerica. Our national security should come first. If for no other \nreason, we should do it for national security. Also, let's do it for \nthe environment. I listened to my friend talk about green energy. We \nhave a chance to do that. We have a bill in the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee that Senator Boxer provided tremendous leadership on, \nalong with Senators Lieberman and Warner, that would cap our carbon \nemissions. That would energize our economy to produce green jobs and \nwould help us to become energy independent. It would reduce greenhouse \ngases and would help our environment. We need to become energy \nindependent because of our national security and because of our \nenvironment.\n  My friends who are talking about energy independence, we have a \nchance to move forward on that. Let's bring out the Lieberman-Warner \nlegislation and move it on the floor. We are trying to do that, and if \nwe had more help on the Republican side of the aisle, we could get that \ndone this year and move toward energy independence.\n  There is a third reason we need an energy policy, and that is our \neconomy. I don't need a clearer message about how important it is to be \nindependent for our economy than to fill up my tank with gasoline. Go \nto any of your neighborhood gasoline stations and look at the price. We \ndon't have control over our energy costs. If we were energy \nindependent, we would. So we need an energy policy that is good for \nthis Nation. We should not be financing other countries. That is what \nyou do every time you fill up a tank with gas--financing other \ncountries, and actually we are borrowing money to do that.\n  So we need a policy that is good for this Nation. What have the oil \ncompanies done to help us in this regard? They are doing quite well. We \nhave businesses that are hurting. We are in a recession. We are not \ndoing well in economic growth. But in the last year, the five major oil \ncompanies had profits of $103 billion, and 2008 is going to be a better \nyear than 2007 for the oil companies.\n  These are excessive profits. We need to do something about them. The \nadministration says let's continue tax breaks for the oil companies; \nlet's create some new ones. We should be using these tax breaks to \ndevelop alternative energy sources. That is what we should be doing to \nhelp the people in our communities. We should be using these tax breaks \nto generate green jobs. We can do that if we energize the American \neconomy to develop the alternative technologies that can solve our \nenergy crisis as well as our environmental challenges.\n  We need to use these tax breaks so we have less reliance on foreign \nenergy sources--alternative fuels. I wish to underscore that we need to \nget this administration, if they are really serious about trying to \nmake this Nation energy independent, to refocus the tools we are using. \nEvery time we try to do that--we try to take these tax credits and \ntarget it to the alternative energy sources rather than just giving \nthem to the oil companies--we get a veto threat from the President.\n  I can tell you, Mr. President, people in Maryland desperately need \nleadership on energy. They need immediate help. One of the suggestions \nthat has been made that I think we should move forward--again, the \nPresident said he is not going to do this--is the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. It is 95 percent filled. Let me explain to my constituents \nwhat this is about. Our Government is in the market every day buying \n70,000 gallons of oil to put in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. As a \nresult, the cost to the consumers in filling up their automobiles' \ntanks is higher. It is supply and demand. The Government is there every \nday first at the gas pumps taking 70,000 gallons of fuel that otherwise \ncould be available for consumers, and with supply and demand, the more \nfuel we have available, the lower the cost will be. This is something \nwe can do immediately to try to reduce the cost of gasoline to the \npeople of this Nation.\n  We need immediate action. We need immediate action to help the \nmiddle-income families in America and the small businesses that are \nliterally being strangled by the high cost of gasoline and the high \ncost of energy. They need immediate relief. They need an administration \nthat is going to take action to make more supply available. If the \nadministration does not, the Congress should take action to do that. \nThe American people need us to take action for immediate relief. But \nthey also understand we cannot continue decade after decade to be \ndependent on foreign energy sources. It is way past time that this \nNation become energy independent. We can get there.\n  As I hear my colleagues speak on both sides of the aisle, let's come \ntogether for the sake of our Nation, for the sake of our national \nsecurity, for the sake of our environment, for the sake of our economy, \nand let's act together to pass laws so at last America can become \nenergy independent and control its own destiny, be a good citizen of \nthe world on the environment, and do much better for the growth of our \neconomy. I am convinced we can do this if we act together in the best \ninterest of our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Charlton Heston\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, over the last few weeks, I have taken note \nof the tributes that have been made about\n\n[[Page S3578]]\n\na great American who passed away on April 5, 2008. That American is \nCharlton Heston. This Senate even joined in those tributes, and I was \npleased to cosponsor a resolution offered by my colleague, Senator Jim \nDeMint, officially honoring Mr. Heston's life and extending the \nsympathies of the Senate to the Heston family.\n  Charlton Heston's significance was more than his distinguished career \nas an actor. In his lifetime, he became undeniably an American icon. \nBut there is an aspect of his life that has not received the attention \nthat I believe it deserves--his truly admirable record of public \nservice. That is why I rise this afternoon to comment about his \ncontributions to our Nation.\n  This was not a man who only recited patriotic speeches; he put his \nwords into action and put his reputation and career on the line for the \ncauses he supported. This was especially true in an area that people \nseem to have forgotten: his work on civil rights.\n  Charlton Heston freely allowed his fame to be used to draw attention \nand support to the cause of civil rights, and he did so at a time when \nit wasn't the popular thing for Hollywood stars to do. In fact, \naccording to his autobiography, some of his associates warned him that \nhis activism could harm his career and his financial success. But he \npursued it anyway.\n  He told the story of demonstrating outside some Oklahoma City \nrestaurants that refused to serve black Americans in 1961, and while he \nmodestly acknowledged this was a small effort that ``made no more than \na ripple in the wider world''--those are his words, not mine--the \nrestaurants did change their practices, and the episode was a \nsignificant personal milestone for him.\n  His civil rights activism took him further. He was an admirer of Dr. \nMartin Luther King Jr., and wrote ``Many men who knew him better than I \nhave written about Martin Luther King. I can't match their eloquence; I \ncan confirm what they've written: He was a special man, put on Earth, I \ndo believe, to be a twentieth-century Moses for his people. Dr. King \nsought him out to discuss how to integrate certain segments of the film \nindustry. Mr. Heston was supportive but had doubts that it could be \ndone; he was surprised and impressed when Dr. King accomplished that \ngoal.\n  Later in 1963, when Martin Luther King famously marched on Washington \nCharlton Heston was not only part of the march but helped organize and \nlead a contingent from the American arts community in participating. \nTheir job was to help draw press attention to the cause but Mr. Heston \ncharacterized the role he played as essentially an ``extra'' at the \nevent. Even so, he said of the march on Washington: ``In a long life of \nactivism in support of some good causes, I'm proudest of having stood \nin the sun behind that man, that morning.''\n  I think many people fail to appreciate the importance of Mr. Heston's \ninvolvement in supporting the cause of civil rights at that particular \ntime. It was a turning point in our Nation's history. His position put \nhim at odds with many in his industry, not to mention the mainstream \nAmerica that existed in those days. It was no small thing for Charlton \nHeston to commit his energies and his name to advancing a cause that \nwas deeply controversial.\n  Today, some have forgotten what those times were like and the risk he \ntook. I would even argue that some prefer to overlook or rewrite the \nrecord of his civil rights activism because they disagree with other \ncauses he took up later in his life.\n  Maybe it just doesn't sit right with the predominately liberal \nmajority in the media and Hollywood that Mr. Heston could both march \nwith Dr. King and later publicly denounce the violent, pornographic \nlyrics of rapper Ice-T. Maybe they don't understand how the same man \nwho picketed against racism could criticize the Screen Actors Guild--an \norganization he presided over for six terms--for practicing reverse \ndiscrimination.\n  Or maybe they just don't understand the common denominator between \nhis fight for civil rights and his fight for the Second Amendment. When \nhe took the helm of the National Rifle Association for an unprecedented \nthree terms Americans' firearms rights were under attack as never \nbefore. I met with him and encouraged his participation, as others did. \nMr. Heston did participate and brought for formidable energy to the \ndefense of this fundamental civil right of the law-abiding American \ncitizen.\n  It was my great privilege to work with him in those days. I came to \nknow him as an unabashed patriot and a friend. He was amazingly modest \nabout his accomplishments when he told me about his past involvement in \npolicy and political issues, but it was from him I learned about his \nearly work on behalf of civil rights.\n  Charlton Heston is remembered by countless Americans around the world \nfor the great roles he played and the characters he created, as only he \ncould do. That legacy will live forever. As his movies are discovered \nby new audiences in the future, a new life for that memory will emerge.\n  But Americans should also be aware and celebrate and treasure another \nlegacy he left behind--his simple and quiet service to our Nation. Let \nthe record show Charlton Heston did not sit safely on the sidelines. He \nstrode boldly into the arena of public affairs and took on all the \nrisks of fighting in that arena. He worked to make this Nation a better \nplace through his activism in promoting civil rights and individual \nliberties, a legacy that will have an even more lasting impact on our \nlives and the lives of our fellow citizens.\n  Goodbye, Charlton Heston. America misses you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Farm Policy\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am going to address, very briefly, an \naction that will come before us this evening in a 2-week extension of \ncurrent farm policy that will be sought by Chairman Harkin, as they \nwork out, I understand, the final details of a new farm policy for our \ncountry.\n  As my colleagues know, over the last several weeks, I have come to \nthe floor to speak out about the urgency at hand of getting a new farm \npolicy before American agriculture as we move into the spring season \nand before the early harvest in the grain belt of our country, which \nstarts very soon in Oklahoma and northern Texas.\n  As most of my colleagues know, both the House and Senate passed new \nfarm policy last year, but because of their differences, we were simply \nnot able to work out a compromise in conference. In fact, the House \nwaited months to appoint conferees. Then the Speaker openly spoke out \nabout being unwilling to provide the tax package to finance the \nnecessary new policy.\n  I began to object. After 6 months and 4 extensions, finally, last \nweek on the floor I did object. But out of that we began to work \ntogether and worked out a compromise, and I must say to all the \nconferees on the House and the Senate side that their diligence appears \nto have paid off. In talking with my colleague and the ranking member \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Saxby Chambliss, today, \ntheir work in large part is done. It is a matter of simply putting it \nin final form, bringing it to print and, of course, then bringing the \nconference report to the floor of the House and the Senate. Apparently, \nthe White House has also signed off on that and their work is largely \ncomplete.\n  It is with that understanding that I will not object this evening to \na unanimous consent request to extend the current farm policy for \nanother 2 weeks while they work out and put to print their final \neffort.\n  Let me thank them all for the sense of urgency that has developed \nover the last 2 weeks and the work in completing it. Obviously, the \nfinance committee in the House, the House Ways and Means Committee and \nSenate Finance Committee had to bring about the necessary package. \nSenator Max Baucus and Congressman Rangel, apparently working with the \nRepublican side, have solved those problems and put the appropriate \nfinance package together.\n\n[[Page S3579]]\n\n  There are very important policies, new policies inside this farm \nbill. We are hearing for the first time, at least in my memory, a \nquestion about food shortages or at least some commodity shortages \nbecause of new demands we put on the production of American agriculture \nas it relates to the production of energy. There is no other time more \nimportant in our country to have farm policy in place and operative \nthan right now, to say to the American people we can get our work done \nin a timely fashion--and that work is now complete; to say to American \nagriculture: Here is your policy for the next 5 years, whether it is \nnutritional policy for America's poor, whether it is production policy \nfor America's farmland, whether it is conservation policy or energy \npolicy; in large part all that is embodied.\n  I thank my colleagues for the work they have done. I hope their sense \nof reality and their finishing the product and getting it before us \nmeets that timing. With that in mind, I will not object tonight to an \nextension. But I am on the floor to personally thank them for the work \nthey have accomplished in getting it completed in the next 2 weeks and \ngetting it before us as soon as possible so we can say to American \nagriculture: The work is done. Here is agricultural policy for the next \n5 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Energy Market\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I have been to the floor now a couple of \ntimes already to talk about the high price of gasoline and what is \ngoing on in the oil markets. I want to take a few minutes this evening \nand talk about this issue as it relates to the futures market and what \nis happening to the day-to-day price of gasoline.\n  I know my constituents are outraged over this price. I know they are \nfrustrated. It is impacting our economy. They want to see results. They \nwant to see us take action. I think it is very important for us to keep \ndelving into the details of what is causing this problem; that is, the \nprice of gas increasing over 100 percent in about a year's time.\n  The first thing that is important for us to remember is how dependent \nthe United States is on foreign oil; that we are, at 20 million barrels \nper day, the highest user of a country dependent on oil. And when you \nlook at other countries and where they are on this issue, you can see \nthat 20, almost 21 million barrels a day of foreign oil really means \nthe United States, given the high oil prices we are seeing in the world \nmarket, is more impacted than any other economy.\n  So that means the United States has to step up and deal with this \nissue. I am not saying other economies, such as China, Japan, and \nGermany, are not impacted, but we are five times more impacted, and \nthat is why we need to be aggressive and act on this legislation.\n  Now, we know where oil has been. In fact, I made this chart a few \ndays ago to show how oil prices have tripled since 2002. I said oil was \nat $118 a barrel. Well, that changed. It went to $120. Now I think it \nis back down maybe to $116 today. I have not seen where it has closed. \nBut that means we have seen gas go from $3.50 to $3.60. We have seen \ndiesel at $4.22.\n  The important point is that oil futures; that is, the future price of \noil, people are already purchasing oil and oil contracts into the \nfuture, and they are paying $100 or more for the next several years. \nThat means those contracts that people are purchasing in oil futures \nhelp set the price for the commodity we purchase today.\n  If people are saying: I will buy oil into many years from now, 7, 8 \nyears from now, and pay over $100 a barrel, it makes it very hard to \nhave oil purchased in the physical market for a cheaper price than \nthat.\n  Now, I have spent many hours on the Senate floor talking about supply \nand demand. The reason I have done that is because when you have a \nnormal market, you have supply and demand, it works pretty well. My \nconcern is, when you look at the statistics and the numbers, and here \nis a particular example, that world supply basically since 1988 has \nincreased 33 percent and world demand has increased in that same time \nperiod 33 percent.\n  I showed a chart the other day that basically showed these two lines \nin parallel. This is not about supply and demand. This is not about a \nmajor market disruption and thereby not having a lot of supply and \nthereby causing a shortage and an increase, a spike in price. Now, yes, \nwe have had some anomalies in the marketplace. We have had situations \nlike Katrina, but they have been small instances, nothing that would \ncause a 100-percent increase in a 1-year period of time in the price of \noil.\n  So that leads you to say simply: What is going on in this marketplace \nif it is not supply and demand, if the market is not functioning?\n  Well, one thing I know about this futures price that I described to \nyou is that we have had a lot of testimony before the Energy Committee, \nbefore the Commerce Committee. I am sure some of my colleagues with \noversight of the CFTC have had hearings.\n  But one thing we heard from a professor from the University of \nMaryland was, with those selling or buying commodities in the spot \nmarkets, they rely on the future price to judge the amount they are \ngoing to pay for the delivery of those commodities.\n  So I am reinforcing what I said earlier; that is, if people are \nalready buying future contracts, and those future contracts are saying: \nWe are definitely going to pay more than $100 a barrel for oil, That is \ngoing to affect the spot market. And the spot market is the market in \nwhich people buy the commodity today and what price they will pay.\n  So if you are sitting there thinking: How much am I going to pay for \noil, and people are going to pay over $100 a barrel for it over the \nnext several years, it is certainly going to affect the day-to-day \nprice of oil.\n  Now, why is this so important? Well, it is so important because the \nfutures market, in my mind, is out of control as it relates to the \nprice of oil. It is out of control in the sense that it is not \nregulated in the same way other futures commodities are regulated. It \nis not regulated the same way cattle futures are, for example. They \nhave reporting requirements. They have trading requirements. They have \noversight by the CFTC. They are not exchanged on an international \nexchange to which we do not have access. There is no loophole, but for \noil there is. That is the futures market, and the futures market \nimpacts the spot price market.\n  So let's look at what happened. In fact, one of the analyses that was \ndone on these hedge funds and how they are impacting the futures \nmarket--because I know a lot of people think crude oil is produced and \nan oil company either has that supply and then delivers it to its \nregional retailers throughout the United States or maybe to other \ncountries and that is how it works. But what is happening is major \ninvestors are buying that product.\n  In fact, hedge funds are taking an ever-larger bet in the futures \nmarket because it is smaller than the stock market or the bond market, \nwhich means you can have more influence. The funds are using borrowed \nmoney to maximize their bets, magnifying their impact on the energy \nmarkets and prices.\n  So this is a reporter reporting about what is happening in the \nfutures market and how hedge funds are playing this large role of \nmoving in and having an impact on what the futures price is. Now, the \nreason I mention this is because we know this is causing problems. We \nhave a very big example of a hedge fund gone wrong; that is, a hedge \nfund that was involved in rogue trading and used its power in the \nfutures markets to disrupt the market as it related to natural gas.\n\n  So many people probably read about Amaranth; they have seen it in the \npaper. But what happened is, Amaranth sold large volumes of the next \nmonth's gas delivery in the last 30 minutes of the market. So they took \na huge amount of supply and basically did what was called ``crashing \nthe close,'' basically to benefit their position.\n  Now what this did is it cost consumers $9 billion more in the cost of \nnatural gas. That is what this hedge fund did in disrupting the natural \ngas\n\n[[Page S3580]]\n\nmarkets. And, thank God, we had passed a law in 2005 saying this kind \nof activity was manipulative and it ought to be outlawed. The FERC is \nworking on enforcement penalties of $291 million against Amaranth in \nthis case.\n  But this is an example of how a hedge fund has come into the system \nand had a significant impact. Now, the Chairman of the FERC is saying \nthese futures market prices impact the physical market price, and these \nmanipulative schemes that were used like in Amaranth were designed to \nlower the prices in the futures market in order to benefit positions \nheld in the physical market.\n  It is that kind of activity that we do not have enough insight into \nin the oil markets. You are saying: Well, how do we know about this? \nThis was a natural gas market. And post-Enron we passed a law and said: \nWe need to make this clear, a bright line that this kind of market \nmanipulation is against the law.\n  We did that, and this is what the policeman on the beat, the FERC, \nhas been doing to stop bad actors. And it is a very bright line. But \nwhat we need to do now is to do the same thing with the oil markets \nbecause after the Amaranth case, after it collapsed, lo and behold, \nwhat happened? What happened? Well, the futures price dropped to the \nlowest level for that contract in 2.5 years. So, basically, after \nAmaranth got out of the situation, and throughout this period \nthereafter, the market fundamentals of supply and demand basically have \nbeen unchanged.\n  This was an investigation that was done by our Permanent Committee on \nInvestigations of the natural gas market. So once Amaranth was out of \nthe market and their activities, guess what. We saw a stabilization in \nprice. That is what we want. We want policing of the market. And that \nis why we want the FTC to do its job. We want the FTC to do the \naggressive job that FERC is now doing in policing the electricity and \nnatural gas market.\n  This body, this Congress, this President, signed into law language \nsaying that the oil markets should also have a very bright line and \nshould not tolerate market manipulation. That was signed into law last \nDecember. For the law to take effect, we need the Federal Trade \nCommission to actually implement the rule, to say how they are going to \nuse this law, and to focus on catching the bad actors.\n  I want to reiterate the things that we need to do. We need to close \nthe Enron loophole. The Enron loophole allows for online trading to be \nexempt from the regulations that other futures commodities comply with.\n  We need to require oversight of all oil futures markets. We cannot be \nheld, in the United States with that 21 million barrels of oil, to \nhaving a blind spot on how the market is being impacted because the FTC \ndoes not have any insight into bad actors who might be manipulating it \nlike Amaranth did.\n  We need the FTC to implement these new market rules. The FTC needs to \nbe clear. They need to publish these rules and implement them as soon \nas possible.\n  I believe we need the Department of Justice to step in and help \nbecause we have seen, in the Enron case, when the Department of Justice \nand the CFTC and the FERC and various agencies worked together to piece \nthis puzzle together with their authority, more enforcement mechanisms \nwere used to catch bad actors.\n  I am sure we will have time again to talk about how 28 States have \nalready implemented statutes to make price gouging illegal. I believe \nthat is some authority that we should give the President.\n  So these are the things that we should be doing to protect consumers. \nI know it might seem to some of my colleagues that the oil futures \nmarket is complex and might not be the subject of something we should \nbe dealing with on the floor of the Senate. But I will guarantee you, \nif we do not have a policeman on the beat for the oil markets, we are \ngoing to see a continuation of these incredible prices that are not \nbased on market fundamentals.\n  I know whether you are an oil company or a hedge fund or whether you \nare someone in the supply chain, no one wants manipulation. Everybody \nwants markets to function based on supply and demand and basic \nfundamentals. Everybody should be for transparency of these markets, \nand they should be for strong Federal statutes implemented by the FTC, \nand they should be in support of having a very aggressive policeman on \nthe beat to make sure we send a very strong message that these kind of \npractices will not be tolerated.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Defenders of Freedom Fellowship\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, John F. Kennedy once said:\n\n       As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the \n     highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by \n     them.\n\n  I rise today to express my gratitude to the Montanans who have served \nour country in uniform. Montana is home to over 100,000 veterans. Many \nothers gave the ultimate sacrifice in service of our Nation. Twenty-\nfour Montanans have given their lives in combat in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We owe these brave warriors a debt of gratitude that can \nnever be fully repaid, and it is an honor to call myself one of their \ncountrymen.\n  These veterans embody everything that is great about this Nation. \nThey are tough. They are smart. They work hard. No matter the task, \nthey get the job done. But the highest appreciation deserves more than \njust words. In honor of all Montanans who have served this great \nNation, I am launching the Defenders of Freedom Fellowship. The \nDefenders of Freedom Fellowship offers professional experience in the \nU.S. Senate for Montana veterans. Each fellow will work in my personal \noffice on veterans issues. The fellow will research issues and \ncorrespond with constituents, attend congressional hearings, and work \non new legislation. The fellow will gain a rare insight into how the \nAmerican Government works. The fellow will serve our Nation's veterans \nand all the people of Montana.\n  The fellowship has three goals. First, the fellowship aims to help \ninvolve more veterans in public service. A veteran's patriotism and \nlove of service is a valuable asset to any public office.\n\n  Second, the fellowship will take advantage of all the experience a \nveteran has to offer. Many of these young men and women have experience \nwell beyond their years. We have much to learn from what they have seen \nand done. We will gain a new perspective on tough problems we are \nworking to solve.\n  Last, the fellowship is a humble way to say thank you to Montana's \nveterans, humble because it is an invitation for a veteran to come to \nWashington to work. However, this fellowship can also offer a gift. \nSome fellows will find a love for public service that will last a \nlifetime. This passion for public service has propelled many to \ngreatness. It is this spirit that has inspired our Nation's greatest \nleaders.\n  I am excited about this--very excited. I am very excited about this \nfellowship and the opportunity I will have to work with some of \nMontana's veterans. To all Montana veterans and their families, I offer \nmy gratitude for your service and for your sacrifice. To the future \nDefenders of Freedom fellows, I look forward to working with you soon. \nI thank you in advance for your efforts. I am confident you will find \nyour service very rewarding.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to speak to an amendment to the \npending legislation, H.R. 2881, the FAA Reauthorization bill, which \nwould require the FAA to more effectively address flight delays that \nare caused by airline overscheduling.\n  Airlines continually schedule more flights than airports can \nphysically handle. Schedules are made to reduce operating costs and \nmaximize airline profits without regard for airport capacity. Since \nonly a certain number of flights can be accommodated within a specified \ntime period, overscheduling triggers built-in delays which can take the \nair traffic system hours to recover from. Responsible scheduling of \nflights within airport capacity limits will go a long way towards \nalleviating delays.\n\n[[Page S3581]]\n\n  Many interested parties point out that airport capacity needs to be \nexpanded to match existing schedules. This is true. We do need to \nultimately expand airport capacity to accommodate passenger demand, but \nprojects to expand capacity can take years to develop and millions of \ndollars to construct. In the nearterm, we should ensure that there is \nsome rationality to flight schedules so that passengers can trust that \ntheir flight has a reasonable chance of being accommodated.\n  This amendment, on its own, would not cap or reduce peak hour flights \nat any airport. It would simply direct the Federal Aviation \nAdministration to intervene in cases where overscheduling is causing \nsignificant delays.\n  Specifically, it would require the FAA Administrator to convene a \nmeeting of airlines to discuss voluntary flight schedule reductions at \nany airport where flights exceed the maximum hourly departure and \narrival rates set by the FAA, provided that such excess flights are \nlikely to have a significant adverse effect on the national or regional \nairspace system. In other words, if the excess flights were deemed not \nlikely to have an adverse effect, no action would be taken. If an \nagreement cannot be reached on voluntary flight schedule reductions, \nthen the Administrator, working with the affected airport, would be \nrequired to take such action as is necessary to ensure that flight \nschedule reductions are implemented. This gives the FAA and the local \nairport the flexibility to decide how best to bring their schedules \nwithin capacity. Additionally, the Administrator would be required to \nsubmit a report to Congress every 3 months on flight scheduling at the \nNation's 35 busiest airports.\n  This amendment is supported by the Airports Council International-\nNorth America as a measure that will force the FAA to more effectively \ndeal with delays. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to adopt it.\n  Mr. President, on December 19, 2007, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, FAA, ordered air traffic controllers at Philadelphia \nInternational Airport, PHL, to use new dispersal departure headings, \nsending aircraft at low altitudes over residential portions of \nPennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey.\n  These new flight paths, a component of the FAA's New York/New Jersey/\nPhiladelphia metropolitan area airspace redesign, have been met with \nenormous fury in local communities, prompting 12 lawsuits against the \nFAA. They also prompted air traffic controllers at PHL to file an \n``Unsatisfactory Condition Report,'' claiming that mandatory use of \ndispersal headings unnecessarily complicates departure procedures.\n  The FAA has always touted this project as a congestion relief \ninitiative, and it is vitally important to address airspace congestion \nin the northeast. However, they are not sending planes over residential \nareas as a relief option. According to air traffic controllers, these \ndispersal headings are being used as a primary option from 9-11AM and \n2-7PM, resulting in overflights even when there are no other planes \nwaiting to take off at PHL.\n  At an April 25, 2008, field hearing that I chaired in Philadelphia \nunder the auspices of the Transportation and Housing and Urban \nDevelopment Appropriations Subcommittee, FAA Administrator Robert \nSturgell confirmed that overflights are occurring when less than 10 \nplanes are waiting to depart at PHL.\n  This runs counter to prior commitments the FAA had made to only use \nthe headings during moderate to heavy traffic periods at PHL, when 10 \nor more aircraft were waiting to depart. The FAA has been unwilling to \nhonor its commitment by limiting use of the headings to only those \ntimes when 10 or more aircraft are waiting because they claim that \ndoing so would require them to conduct a reevaluation and analysis. I \nwould argue that a reevaluation and analysis are in order if it would \nprovide relief to the communities surrounding PHL, but I am more \ninterested in seeing to it that the FAA honors its commitments.\n  Since they have not been willing to do so on their own, this \namendment would force them to honor their commitment by prohibiting the \nuse of dispersal departure headings at PHL unless 10 or more aircraft \nare waiting to depart. It will ensure that communities are not \nfrivolously disrupted by overflights but still give air traffic \ncontrollers the option of using dispersal headings as a relief option \nwhen the airport is most congested.\n  It is important to note that the FAA is limiting overflights from \nNewark Airport to times when 10 or more aircraft are waiting, so this \nis not a policy that is unprecedented or impossible to implement. \nAccordingly, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 4585 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I withdraw my amendment No. 4585.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, to all the Senators who are on the floor, \nand those within the sound of my voice, there has been a new substitute \nfiled. The purpose of that is to eliminate the provision we have been \ndealing with all day here. I say to my colleagues, there are \ndiscussions going on as to how we can resolve that, if, in fact, we can \nresolve it.\n  I say to especially my distinguished counterpart, Senator McConnell, \nat this stage we are now ready to start the amendment process. I was \ntold early this morning that there was a Bunning amendment the minority \nwanted to offer. No problem; we just have not seen it. I think this \nbill, which is a tax bill--we do not want to tell anyone what they can \nor cannot offer--but I think it should be in keeping with what this \nbill is about. I have no problem if the Republicans want to offer one \namendment, two amendments, or lots of amendments. I have no intention \nof trying to prevent them from offering amendments to this piece of \nlegislation. But there comes a time when you have to move on, and that \nis what we are doing now.\n  I repeat: The floor is open. I do think it is appropriate--and the \nonly thing I did here is to stop random amendments from being offered. \nI do not know how I can be more suggestive of the fact I want to finish \nthis bill. I want it to be done. If there are people who want to amend \nparts of this very important bill, they should have a right to do so. I \nhave no problem with that. I do say it would be appropriate that we at \nleast see what the amendment is so we can move on, and as long as it is \nin keeping with this bill, I do not care what it does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I certainly share the view of the \nmajority leader that this is an important bill that needs to be \ncompleted. However, I do not agree that employing a parliamentary \ntechnique of filling the tree, which is what my good friend, the \nmajority leader, did, will help facilitate the completion of the bill. \nThis, of course, gives the majority leader the opportunity to basically \npick which amendments from my side will be allowed. That is the kind of \nprocedure that makes it impossible to get enough cooperation on the \nminority side to get cloture and finish the bill.\n  This process is not going to help us get the bill finished. We will \nhave to continue our discussions on both sides about the amendments we \nare going to insist be offered.\n  Hopefully, at the end of the day, after we get through the various \nprocedural moves that have been made, we can develop a regular \namendment process. I do not think there will be a huge number of \namendments, but the amendments that need to be dealt with are important \nto this side of the aisle.\n  Until that kind of procedure is agreed to or worked out in one way or \nanother, it would be difficult to get cloture and to finish the bill.\n  I see my good friend from Texas on the floor. She has been working \ndiligently on this, along with Senator Rockefeller, for quite some \ntime. She may want to offer her observations as well.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say, through the Chair to my friend, I \nwant to legislate on this bill. If someone can come up with a better \nway that we do it, I am happy to do that.\n  As we know, if this vehicle is here, standing alone, anyone can offer \nany amendment on anything. I do not think that is helpful to the \nprocess. I do not want to stop them. If there are amendments over here \nto offer, I have said once, twice--this is the third time--more power \nto you, offer them. I don't wish to stand in the way of anyone offering \nan amendment. I don't want to be dealing with the war in Iraq, abortion \nor anything else which are some things that are very difficult to deal \nwith. That is my whole purpose in doing this. I want to deal with FAA \nor anything within the realm of transportation. I hope everyone \nunderstands that. I will be happy--if somebody can figure out a \ndifferent way to do this, let me know, and I will be happy to \ncooperate.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I am greatly disappointed that we \nhave come to the time when we are not going to be able to move this \nbill because there is not an open amendment process. I have worked with \nSenator Rockefeller on the aviation bill; this is the FAA \nreauthorization. We have come to agreement on the basic bill. It is \nvery bipartisan. Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens, the chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee and the ranking member, have come to an \nagreement on the aviation portions of this bill. The distinguished \nmajority leader said we don't want to take amendments that are not \nrelevant to the bill, but, in fact, the tax package that is in the \nsubstitute that was put forward deals with many issues that are not in \nany way related to aviation, not in one instance. So we would like to \nbe able to pass a bipartisan FAA reauthorization bill.\n  We have come to agreement in the Commerce Committee on the importance \nof the bill--the passenger bill of rights, the added safety features. \nIt will modernize the air traffic control system. Yet now we have a \nbill that has no amendments allowed unless we get permission to offer \namendments, when the underlying bill has many extraneous provisions in \nit that were added by the Finance Committee. They are not relevant to \nthis bill, and they are not agreed to even by the leaders on the \nCommerce Committee whose bill this is.\n  So I am disappointed. I think it is going to stop the consideration \nof the FAA bill. If we could pare it back to FAA reauthorization, \nmodernization, then I think we would have a bipartisan step forward for \nthe consumers and passengers in this country.\n  I wish to thank my colleague, the Senator from Illinois, for working \non the pension part, which has now been taken out. I think that is an \nexcellent step in the right direction. It is very important to me. I \nwas the cosponsor of his amendment. That amendment has now virtually \nbeen adopted. But I can't walk away from the rest of the people on my \nside of the aisle who want to offer legitimate amendments and who have \nvery great concerns about the tax provisions in this bill that have \nnothing to do with aviation.\n  So I hope once we get to the point the bill doesn't move forward, \nwhich is where I think we will go, we can once again come together in a \nbipartisan spirit and have the aviation bill we have agreed to, with \nthe tax provisions that relate to aviation that we have agreed to, and \nget this bill going. There will be legitimate amendments on perimeter \nrule, on some other safety issues. Those will be relevant. But we can't \nmove forward when half our body virtually is unable to be a \nparticipant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Texas makes my case. If there is part of \nthis bill she doesn't like, whether it is tax provisions or anything \nelse, offer an amendment to try to take it out. No one is trying to \nstop her from legislating. It appears to me my friend from Texas is \nlooking for an excuse to kill this bill. If she doesn't like the tax \nprovisions in this bill, offer an amendment to strike them. No one is \nstopping her from doing that.\n  I don't think it is asking too much to say we would like to have some \nidea of what amendments are going to be offered. I don't care what they \nare if they relate to this bill. I don't know how\n\n[[Page S3583]]\n\nmany more times I need to say that. I think people, such as my friend \nfrom Texas, are looking for an excuse to deep six this bill, and that \nis what is going to happen.\n  We are at a place now where I have said if you want to offer \namendments, offer amendments, and they are saying, well, we don't want \nto offer amendments because you have said you want to look at the \namendments first.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: Wasn't the \ntree filled up so that there are no possibilities of offering \namendments?\n  Mr. REID. I have said--it is so easy. If anyone wants to offer an \namendment, we take that little tree and add her branch to it. It is \neasy to do. I am not trying to stop anyone from offering amendments to \nthis FAA bill. It is an important piece of legislation and it should be \naccomplished. But we can't stand around for days on end looking at each \nother. We have people who say they want to offer amendments. Good. Let \nthem offer amendments. I have no problem with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I will try one more time with this \nvoice. I expect I am correct in saying that filling up the tree has not \nworked except on occasions when the Republican leader agreed with the \nmajority leader on filling up the tree, and there have been a few \noccasions on which I have agreed. I do not agree this time. This is not \na process that is going to get us a bill. But we all continue to talk \nto each other, and we will hope that when the Sun comes up tomorrow, \nthere will be a process agreed to that will give us a chance to get the \nvotes we are going to have to get on this side of the aisle in order to \ncomplete a bill we would all basically like to complete.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have an idea. Why don't we have an \narrangement where the minority leader, the Republican leader, can also \nlook at amendments with me. I am not going to try to stop anyone from \noffering an amendment. He can be part of the deal. I shouldn't be the \nsole arbiter. He can work with me on these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I would observe that from the very \nbeginning of this most interesting day, my very good friend, Senator \nHutchison, who is the ranking member on the Aviation Committee, has \nsaid there is a way to pass this bill in 5 minutes and that is: One, we \ndo the amendment with respect to what my substitute amendment does; \nand, secondly, that the extraneous amendments, financial amendments \nwhich the Republicans do not like, they can put up that amendment. Now, \nthey have said nobody on their side will vote for our amendment on the \ntheory that it didn't come before they had a chance to take out the \nextraneous amendments. So I would say to my distinguished friend, \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison, offer your amendment right now, right \nnow. Offer it. You may find a more welcome audience than you think.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, it is frankly unfortunate that we are \ngetting all high bound here and wrapped up around the axle. The action \nby the majority leader, as I understand it, in effect has adopted the \nDurbin amendment, which off the top I think is regrettable. I think it \nis important that this body protect pension plans--all pension plans--\nand the effect of the substitute would be to let a certain airline off \nthe hook in providing enough protection to the plans. It has made big \npromises, but it is not fully funding the plan.\n  Second, it is a bit disturbing that things have developed this way \nbecause I had discussions with the majority leader as to how we can \nresolve the Durbin amendment, how we can resolve that issue. It was my \nhope we could continue those negotiations and discussions to possibly \ntake that issue off the table.\n  I say to my good friend from Texas and to all Members, the leader \nasked me to work with Senator Rockefeller to come up with a bill that \nmerges both the Commerce Committee bill and the Finance Committee bill. \nSenator Rockefeller and I did that. We sat down and worked out an \nagreement on the bill. It is unfortunate we are not starting with that \nagreement because it is a good-faith agreement and it also included tax \nprovisions. We have to have tax provisions to pay for our airlines, for \nthe trust fund, the airline trust fund. We have to have tax provisions \nto pay for the highway trust fund. Again, we negotiated this out, the \nchairman and I did, Senator Rockefeller and I did in good faith and we \ncame up with the measure which I think is fair.\n  Now, fairly, Senators have the right to offer amendments and should \noffer amendments. After all, this is the Senate. I think there is a way \nto work out the Durbin amendment. I made a suggestion to the majority \nleader as to how to do that, and I think it would be helpful if those \nnegotiations could continue as we unwind one of the problems we are \nfaced with. But second, I hope we can get away from the situation the \nminority leader described, which is filling up the tree which tends to \nget us stuck. The goal is not to get stuck; the goal is to seek an \nexpeditious process and to move along quickly.\n  We have been spending all afternoon doing nothing, frankly. I made a \nsuggestion as to how to deal with at least one significant part and \nthat is the Durbin amendment, and it would be my hope that, as has been \nsuggested, when the Sun rises tomorrow and we all sleep on this a \nlittle bit, cooler heads prevail, and we can find a way to get from \nhere to there. That means passing the FAA bill, which deals with issues \nSenator Hutchison has talked about and which also finances the airport \ntrust fund and the highway trust fund--that is, the plussed-up highway \ntrust fund--and also a way to resolve the Durbin amendment in a fair \nand equitable way. Because nobody is 100 percent right here. Senator \nDurbin is not 100 percent right and I am not 100 percent right. But I \ndo think there is a way to resolve this, and I hope this evening we can \nthink about it, sleep on it, and work it out.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nMontana. We have had some words today, some positive and some not so \npositive, but I hope we can follow through on this conversation and \nthis dialogue and try to see if there is common ground. I don't know if \nthere is, but I am willing to try, and I hope we can see if we can \nachieve it.\n  I offered with Senator Hutchison to have a vote earlier today and \nthat didn't happen. But at this point I hope we can find a way to reach \nan amicable solution. This pension issue is a very important issue to \nthousands and thousands of workers and to many communities that are \nserved by these airlines. We worked hard and I think had a sizable \nnumber of Senators who supported our position, but you never know until \nyou take the actual vote. I will say the underlying bill, after all \nthis conversation about the pension plans affecting five airlines--and \nthe tax provisions, which, frankly, I support--I think the tax \nprovisions in this bill are good, relative to rail bonds, to the New \nYork situation, and to the highway trust fund. I support that. I am \nhappy to support it. But we want to make sure that at the end of the \nday, the underlying bill is enacted into law. This is long overdue to \nbring modernization and safety to our skies, and I know the work that \nhas been put into it by the Senator from Texas and especially the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  So I am prepared to sit down and meet with anyone in good faith to \ntry to resolve this if we can. I hope that at the end of the day, \nthough, what the majority leader said a few minutes ago is remembered. \nHe is looking for any germane amendments relative to this bill and is \nprepared to engage a debate on both sides. He used this procedural \napproach to try to break a logjam, but he clearly is looking for a way \nto move to amendments and most importantly to pass this bill. I think \nthat was a good-faith offer, and I know he is a man of his word. So we \nare prepared to work with Senator Rockefeller and Senator Hutchison and \nall the Members to try to resolve these differences.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I appreciate what the Senator from \nMontana and the Senator from Illinois have said. I do hope we can \ncontinue to\n\n[[Page S3584]]\n\nwork on this. I know the situation, as it stands right now, would not \nbe acceptable: having a major piece of legislation that needs to be \ndebated, and we need to have the ability for the minority voice to be \nheard. I don't think that it is going to happen with this particular \nprocedure, but that doesn't mean the door is closed.\n  We do want to work on this bill because, as I have said many times, \nthe underlying bill is one I fully support. It may be that one of the \noptions would be to separate the tax part of the bill and the aviation \npart. I agree with the aviation tax part as well. Most people on our \nside of the aisle do. It is the taxes that have nothing to do with \naviation that have been put into this bill that are the problem. That \nis what is killing this bill right now. If we can come to an agreement \non the aviation taxes and the aviation bill and let the other tax \nprovisions that relate to the subway and the railway and the highway \nfund, if those can be done in a separate package and then we have the \nvotes up or down, then I think that is one option we ought to consider.\n  So right now, in this particular procedure, I think we are going \nnowhere. But we are going to continue to talk, and perhaps one of these \nother options would be doable. The pension part is so important to me. \nI have worked with Senator Durbin all day and ever since I learned the \npension part had been changed in the tax part of the package.\n  I hope we can come to a conclusion. I would like to come to a \nconclusion with the Finance Committee because I think there are some \ncompromises, perhaps, that could be made. But I know what is in the \nbill now would be very detrimental to some of the airlines in this \ncountry. I think, as a matter of fairness and equity and protection of \nemployees, that we could not accept the language that is there. That \ndoesn't mean the door isn't open to talk. But if we can do something in \na separate bill and let the aviation bill--taxes and authorization--go \nforward, I would hope that would be an option to consider.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first, I appreciate the words of the \nSenator from Illinois and the Senator from Texas and their willingness \nto work out an accommodation on the pension provision.\n  Second, I caution this body about potentially separating these bills \nbecause the revenues provided in the bill are for the airport trust \nfund. I think that is very important. Also, the revenues are provided \nfor NextGen, which is the next generation of air traffic control \ninfrastructure, as they move from analog to satellite. European \ncountries already have it. We need it here. We are behind the times. We \nneed the money to get started. So I wonder about the advisability of \nseparating those provisions.\n  Third, our highway trust fund is in deep trouble because of \ninflation, fuel costs, and construction costs going up. It is important \nthat we so-called plus-up the highway trust fund and revenues there. \nThe ways we are paying for the highway trust fund have been agreed to \nby the Commerce Committee and the Finance Committee, Senator \nRockefeller and myself. We agreed. That should not be an issue. The \nways we are paying for the highway trust fund are provisions that are \nvery meek and mild, not inflammatory at all. One is to limit fuel \nfraud. We should do that. Next, we should increase the solvency of the \nliability trust fund. That has not been opposed by anybody that I am \naware of. That is jobs. We know this country and our growth rate is not \nwhat we would like it to be, and we could work this out.\n  Again, here we are at about 7 o'clock this evening, and a lot of good \nwords have been spoken in good faith. Let's follow up and try to find a \nsolution tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I may respond briefly to the \nSenator from Montana, there is a lot of room for us to work on the \nhighway trust fund issue. Everybody wants to replenish the highway \ntrust fund. I do think there are issues with paying for it, and I think \nthere is the view that we don't have to put a tax on some sectors in \norder to make this whole, because it is stimulative, and I think we \ncould work on something that would get the highway trust fund \nreplenished but not have to then find the issue of how we pay for it--\nparticularly, one of the things is the retroactive tax version which is \na problem for some people.\n  With the highway trust fund, I think we are replenishing something we \ncan all agree is necessary. If we can come to terms on paying for it \nand in what manner it will be paid for, that is an area we would like \nto discuss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I don't know if I am closing or not. \nI want to offer this observation. I have been here virtually all day. I \nhave had plenty of rest--very little talking and very little learning. \nWhat strikes me, as this day closes, is that the people who are \nobjecting in various ways to taking a vote--there will be no votes from \nour side on this or that or whatever--are missing the whole point of \nthe bill. I support the Durbin position on pensions because it is part \nof the written law. It is not very difficult.\n  Everybody wants their own little piece to win. I have heard almost no \nconversation today--and virtually none yesterday--about the perilous \ncondition of our aviation industry, particularly the commercial \naviation industry. There isn't any sense of urgency about the large \nmatter. Maybe people have it in their hearts, but they don't choose to \nbring it out here because on the floor they want to win points or they \nhave ideological considerations that we cannot raise taxes or whatever. \nBut while we are sitting here doing nothing--and I am sure impressing \nthe American people mightily with our vigor--we have an aviation \nindustry that is on the verge of collapse.\n  I pointed out a number of times that one out of every six employees \nhas been laid off by commercial airlines. The fastest growing part of \nthe aviation industry is the general aviation industry. I have very \nstrong feelings about that, but for the sake of the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, I backed off of my solution for a fee of $25 per \nflight for a high-end private or corporate jet. I never really \nfigured out how the $25 was going to bring them to the feet of \ncatastrophe. Most of the jets that are made at the high end are sold \nelsewhere, overseas.\n\n  So I am very frustrated, as chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, \nthat we are not really talking about how to fix aviation. We are \ntalking about how to keep our turf, how you are going to get no votes \non this until I get my votes on that. None of it is about the big \npicture. It is about little things inside the bill which people choose \nto put their feet down on and then not move.\n  That is very depressing to me because I am very keenly aware that \naviation is not a subject that has a great deal of appeal broadly. Most \nof our meetings on the Commerce Committee are attended by relatively \nfew. There are relatively few on the floor of the Senate who really \nunderstand the condition of the aviation industry or the details \npertaining to its condition, the history of that condition, and what \nthe future holds.\n  I hope that, as we go through this night of cooling down, we will \nbecome reflective about what the bill is about, which is trying to give \nthe commercial aviation industry, as well as the general aviation \nindustry, a chance to survive in one case and flourish in the other \ncase.\n  I made enormous compromises with the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee--monumental, from my point of view. But so what. That is not \neven the point. The point is commercial airlines. So many of them are \nclosing down. So many of them are in chapter 11 bankruptcy, in and out \nof chapter 11. Some are headed toward chapter 7. It is a national \ncatastrophe--not to speak of our air traffic control system where we \nare at this point behind Mongolia.\n  So these things are important, and evidently others don't think so \nbecause they want to win their points to keep their positions and let \nthe aviation industry take care of itself. I have not heard anybody on \nthe floor today discussing with any passion, any coherency, or logic \nthe condition of our aviation industry. That is very disappointing to \nme.\n  So I put up that caution and say that I hope we will be a wiser group \ntomorrow and that we will reach an accommodation because if we don't, \nwe will\n\n[[Page S3585]]\n\nnot only not be the world class of aviation, we will be very far from \nit. It is not just the commercial airlines, it is the air traffic \ncontrol system. And, yes, you do have to kind of raise taxes for that. \nYou have to build a digital GPS satellite system at the same time as \nyou maintain an analog system. It will take 10 or 12 years to build \nthis modern air traffic control system which every other country in \nEurope has--Japan and probably China have it.\n  It is discouraging to me for people not to be keeping their eye on \nthe central force of this bill, which is to preserve what we need to do \nin commerce, to stay in touch with each other, to visit a dying mother, \nand do all kinds of things that are in the American way of life. Our \ndebate today has not reflected the American way of life. It has \nreflected kind of a much more parochial view than I am comfortable \nwith. But I am managing the bill, so I have to deal with that.\n  So I just close by saying that I hope tomorrow will be a brighter \nday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wasn't present on the floor when the \nmaneuvering that just took place happened that puts this Senate in a \nvery difficult position, but it gets us into a very bad and dangerous \nsituation.\n  The maneuvering of the Democratic leader and floor manager that was \njust done is not used very often in the Senate. In fact, substituting--\nputting a modification of a substitute that was agreed to by two \nseparate committees that jointly brought this to the floor is something \nthat I think is very unprecedented. This process of filling the tree so \nthat only the majority party can decide what amendments can come up is \nnot only dangerous and can keep this very important piece of \nlegislation from being passed, but it is dangerous for the whole \nprocess of the Senate's comity in getting the job done.\n  As I said, this substitute was the product of two committees--not one \ncommittee but two committees--and by the overwhelming support of people \non those committees that we needed to not only reauthorize the Federal \nAviation Administration and do everything we can to improve airport \nsafety, as well as airport facilities, but also the financing of it, to \nmake sure there is plenty of money available to get the job done.\n  On safety at the airports, we have the Commerce Committee doing their \nwork. On financing it, we have the tax-writing Finance Committee making \nsure the money is available. These two committees do their work almost \nin a unanimous way, and it comes to the Senate floor. That ought to be \na procedure that gets this bill through this body quickly, without a \nlot of controversy, and by an overwhelming vote that reflects the \ncomity that went into it and that reflects the need of the airline \nindustry, both for commerce and for the passenger.\n  These joint deals should not be taken lightly, and because one \namendment is offered that a few powerful Senators do not like, and \ntheir unwillingness to set it aside so we could work on other \namendments as we tried to work out a compromise was not accepted, they \ntake this extraordinary measure that only a manager of a bill can do to \nask to modify an amendment by taking out the provision of the bill \nwhich dealt with the Durbin amendment that was before the Senate. That \nis nothing else, just blatant political power to get around something \nthat people did not want to deal with. This was something that was \nagreed to between the two committees. That move breaches the deal.\n  What is more, the Democratic leader has backstopped the breach of the \ndeal by this procedure we call ``filling the tree'' so that only \namendments can be offered that can get unanimous consent to offer them, \nand that is very difficult to do and is only done for the sole purpose \nof keeping the issue dealing with the Durbin amendment from debate and \nfinality on the floor of the Senate.\n  All day long the floor managers could have set aside the Durbin \namendment, as I said, and moved along to other business. That is what \nthe Finance Committee does in similar situations. We have already heard \nspeakers before me say there are very real possibilities of working out \ncompromises on that amendment that the majority manager did not like.\n  Let it be clear that we could have processed other business if \nSenator Durbin would have deferred action on his amendment, and we \nwould have been moving along. We would not be in this position that is \ndangerous from two standpoints: dangerous whether or not this important \nlegislation can be passed, and dangerous from the standpoint of working \ntogether on other legislation that needs to be done in future weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brown are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to talk about the war in \nIraq, from two different vantage points. One, the first vantage point, \nis from the perspective of those who have served--some of our fighting \nmen and women who happen to be in the Reserves. I also wish to talk \nabout a victim of this war and some thoughts I have in my heart today \nabout the war and about this particular victim and what it tells about \nour country. First of all, with regard to a particular problem and then \nsome legislation I introduced to correct it.\n  We have a policy right now, which I would regard as unfair, that if \nit is fully implemented would hurt numerous Army Reserve members and \nconsequently our national security. Last year, the Army implemented a \nnew policy whereby Reserve members who were called to Active Duty for a \nperiod of time exceeding 180 days, will be given an option--an option \nof a permanent change in station assignment or a waiver request to \nreceive a significantly reduced per diem rate for the locality to which \nthey are temporarily assigned. This could tremendously disadvantage \nthose who happen to be serving in the Army Reserves.\n  While on its face it might seem harmless because it gets fairly \ntechnical, its unintended ramifications could be very costly. Reserve \nMembers from across Pennsylvania and across the country have described \nthis policy as a hardship that could potentially cause future problems \nfor retention and enlistment rates. For instance, under this new \npolicy, an Army reservist living in Philadelphia who is deployed for a \ntemporary mobilization, as short as 9 or 12 months, for example--and \nthis is an increasingly common occurrence because of the strain the war \nin Iraq has placed on our military, but this particular example means \nthat person could face the financial necessity of selling his or her \nhome if he or she is unable to afford to maintain both their primary \nresidence and their temporary housing on a reduced per diem rate. In \nother words, they are not being helped in that interim period of, say, \n9 to 12 months. This is not only a story about Pennsylvania, but it is \na story that could be replicated, unfortunately, across the country.\n  I introduced legislation yesterday entitled ``The Reserve Residence \nProtection Act of 2008,'' which would correct this fundamentally unfair \npolicy. The legislation would provide a basic allowance for housing to \ncover the costs of maintaining the primary residence of National Guard \nor Reserve members when they are mobilized outside their local area.\n  In addition, it would pay a lower second basic allowance at their \nmission location, if onbase housing is not provided. In January, when \nwe passed the fiscal year 2007 National Defense Authorization Act, we \npassed a provision providing for the second basic housing allowance to \nprotect the residence of Reserve members without dependents, but we \nleft out--it is hard to believe this but we did--this body left out \nmembers with dependents. So if you had dependents and you are in this \ndilemma, you were left out. This legislation corrects this very \nimportant oversight.\n\n[[Page S3586]]\n\n  Our Nation today is relying more than ever on National Guard and \nReserve troops to fulfill our missions around the world and especially \nto carry on the work these men and women are doing in Iraq. Without \nthese citizen soldiers placing their lives on the line to contribute to \nour national security, we could not carry out all our vital missions. \nNational Guard and Reserve members know the sacrifices they need to \nmake whether they enlist, but no Reserve members should be forced to \nchoose--as they are now, if this policy is implemented without the bill \npassing--no Reserve member should be forced to choose selling his or \nher primary residence in order to fulfill a temporary mobilization \norder or deciding not to reenlist due to this unnecessary burden. In \naddition to being unfair in the first instance, it acts as a \ndisincentive to those who might want to give even more service to their \ncountry.\n  When citizen soldiers enlist, they sign agreements to train and \ndeploy when they are called up. That is the commitment they make to us \nand to our national security. However, I do not believe, and no one in \nthis Chamber believes, that this is a one-way street or a one-way deal. \nThe Nation, at the end of this bargain, promises to acknowledge their \nunique role as citizen soldiers and to aid in the transition between \nActive and Reserve Duty.\n  I am proud to have introduced the Reserve Residence Protection Act of \n2008 because it will ensure that America is keeping its promise, \nkeeping our promise to those who serve in our National Guard and \nReserve, and we are keeping our promise to their families as well.\n  In conclusion tonight, I wish to talk about the war for a few \nmoments, from the perspective of one victim, but I think this one \nvictim tells a very dear and sad story. Today's Washington Post had a \npicture on the front above the headline. The headline read: ``U.S. Role \nDeepens in Sadr City.'' The subheadline reads, ``Fierce Battle Against \nShiite Militiamen Echoes First Years Of War.''\n  I would say this in the context of where we are today. Tomorrow is \nthe fifth anniversary of President Bush declaring, ``Mission \nAccomplished.'' That is one thing we are thinking about today and \ntomorrow--all the time that has passed, all the trauma to our country \nand to the people of Iraq since then. But also we note, in yesterday's \npress, in the month of April, as of April 29, yesterday, 44 Americans \ndied in Iraq, the highest number since September of 2007.\n  So why do I say that in the context of this story? The story, which \nis an ominous sign for what is happening in Sadr City with regard to \nour troops--and we have seen the loss of life this week. But above that \nstory is this horrific picture. I know you may not be able to see it \nfrom a distance, but many have seen it today. I will read the caption \nbefore I show the picture.\n  The caption reads: ``Ali Hussein is pulled from the rubble of his \nhome after a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad's Sadr City. The 2-year-old died \nat a hospital.''\n  The picture depicts two men, one holding this 2-year-old child above \nhis head. The 2-year-old, this child, would look like any child in \nAmerica with the kind of sandals you can connect with Velcro. He has \nshorts on and a shirt.\n  Unfortunately, I know you cannot see it from here, unfortunately for \nthis child, who later died, apparently when this picture was taken he \nis still alive, he looks at that moment, in fact, dead. His eyes are \nclosed, his mouth is open. You can see the soot or the dust from an \nexplosion covering his body. So at that moment he had not died, but he \ndied a short time after. And what does this mean? Well, it means a lot \nof things. It means this war grinds on, and that the lives of our \nsoldiers, the effect on their families, and we see other victims--we do \nnot see pictures like this very often of children dying in Iraq.\n  This is not the fault of any one person or any side of the aisle \nhere. It is something we have got to be more cognizant of, especially \nin the context of this raging debate we are having in America about our \neconomy. And it is so important that we have a debate about our \neconomy. It is so important that we focus on those who have lost their \njobs, focus on those who have been devastated by the loss of their \nhomes, focus on the increasingly difficult challenge that people have \npaying to fill their gas tank; all of the horrific and traumatic \neconomic circumstances we face.\n  But as that debate is taking place, we are still at war. We still \nhave soldiers coming home who, as Lincoln said, in his second inaugural \nwhen he spoke of ``him who has borne the battle and his widow and his \norphan.''\n  So many soldiers are coming home either maimed or coming home dead \nfor their final rest. And even victims in Iraq, young victims such as \nthis young boy, 2 years old. He lost his life in an airstrike. So \nwhether it is a 2-year-old in Sadr City who happened to be Iraqi or \nwhether it is a 2-year-old boy or girl here in America who lost their \nmother or their father in Iraq serving our country, we have to remind \nourselves that this anniversary challenges all of us to do all we can \nto bring this conflict to an end.\n  No one has a corner on the market of truth. No one knows the only way \nto do this. But we have to continue to worry about it and think about \nthis war and its victims, and we have to figure out a way to get our \ntroops out of this civil war.\n  As we do that, unfortunately, these pictures of the victims, whether \nthey are nameless and faceless, or whether they are, in fact, \nidentified, as this poor child was identified, must be reminders to all \nof us that we have a lot of unfinished business in the Senate and in \nWashington when it comes to the policy that has led to the loss of life \nwe have seen here in America.\n  In my home State of Pennsylvania, like the Presiding Officer's, Ohio, \nwe are up to 184 deaths and more than 1,200 wounded, in many cases \ngrievously, permanently, irreparably wounded.\n  So this picture reminds us that we have a lot of work to do when it \ncomes to the policy as it relates to the war in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of three young \nAmericans recently chosen by the American Automobile Association to \nreceive the School Safety Patrol Lifesaving award.\n  In 1920, the American Automobile Association, AAA, began the School \nSafety Patrol Program in order to ensure that children across the \ncountry could commute to school in a safe manner. Today over 500,000 \nyoung people participate in this program, and every year since 1949, \nthe AAA has recognized those patrollers who go above and beyond their \nduties.\n  For nearly 50 years, the AAA has given its highest School Safety \nPatrol honor, the Lifesaving Award, to those patrollers who have risked \ntheir own lives to save the life of another. Today I have the great \nhonor of recognizing three courageous patrollers who, while on duty, \nshowed the kind of clear-thinking, quick-acting skills that save lives.\n  Nicole Epstein participates in the School Safety Patrol Program at \nNorth Chevy Chase Elementary in Chevy Chase, MD, not far from where we \nstand today. In June of 2007, an 8-year-old boy watched the traffic \nlight turn to green and began to cross a busy road, unaware that a car \nmaking a right-hand turn was heading directly toward him. Nicole, \nseeing the oncoming car, stepped off the curb and grabbed the boy's \nbackpack to pull him to safety. The driver of the car must not have \nseen the boy, because the vehicle completed the turn and drove on\n\n[[Page S3587]]\n\nwith out slowing down or acknowledging the children. Through her \nbravery and quick thinking, Nicole saved this young boy from being hit \nby that car.\n  Raul Valdez, a AAA school safety patroller at West Gate Elementary in \nManassas, VA, showed great courage when he saved a young girl who ran \nout in front of an oncoming van on April 13, 2007. Following an adult \nguard's ``hold back'' instruction, Raul put his arms up to prevent \nstudents from crossing the busy area of the school drive where buses \nand daycare vans collect children. When a young girl attempted to run \nacross the drive, Raul reached for her shoulder and swiftly pulled her \nout of the way of an approaching daycare van. Thanks to Raul's \nattentiveness and his speedy reaction time, that young girl was saved \nfrom harm.\n  Clarissa Sourada is a safety patroller at Union Mill Elementary in \nClifton, VA. On a morning in February 2007, Clarissa was holding two \nchildren at the edge of a residential driveway near her post, waiting \nfor the clear to cross, when she noticed a vehicle backing towards \nthem. She alerted the children to the danger and called for them to \nmove out of the way. When one child did not heed her warning, Clarissa \npushed the child from the driveway to the sidewalk, safely out of the \npath of the car. That child's life was saved thanks to Clarissa's quick \nthinking and attentive supervision.\n  As these three exceptional young people have demonstrated, the \nparticipants in the AAA School Safety Patrol Program serve an important \nrole in ensuring that our young people get to school safely. This \nprogram has helped save countless lives, and I thank the AAA and the \nprogram volunteers for making it all possible. I know I speak for every \nMember of the Senate in expressing our gratitude for their valuable \nwork in our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/30/senate-section/article/S3587-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ONE YEAR AFTER VIRGINIA TECH\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, April 16 marked 1 year since the deadliest \nshooting rampage in our Nation's history, a tragedy that took the lives \nof 32 Virginia Tech students and faculty members and wounded 17 more. \nApril 16 was a day that forever changed the lives of many and we \nstruggle to make sense of this senseless tragedy.\n  In almost 32 States, and on at least 32 college campuses, survivors \nand family members of those killed or injured in that shooting recently \njoined students, parents, and concerned citizens to remember the lives \nlost on April 16, 2007. During remembrance events across the country, \nhundreds laid silently on the ground in groups of 32 to honor the 32 \ninnocent victims murdered at Virginia Tech. In my home State of \nMichigan, people gathered in Detroit and Kalamazoo to ring bells, read \nnames, and recite prayers, all to remember the victims of this horrible \ntragedy.\n  These commemorations also sought to remember the families and loved \nones of the more than approximately 100,000 people who are killed or \ninjured by a firearm every year in America. Hundreds joined in \nexpressing their frustrations at the glaring gaps in our Nation's gun \nlaws. In August 2007, a panel of experts, commissioned by Virginia Gov. \nTim Kaine, issued a report based upon their independent review of the \ntragedy at Virginia Tech. Among other things, the report pointed to \nweak enforcement of and gaps in regulations regarding the purchase of \nguns, as well as holes in State and Federal laws. It also emphasized \nthe critical need for improved background checks and the danger \nfirearms can present on college campuses.\n  Despite these calls from experts and outcries from the American \npeople, the Congress has yet to act to make it harder for dangerous \npeople to obtain dangerous weapons. By strengthening our background \ncheck system, closing the gun show loophole, and renewing the assault \nweapons ban we could help put an end to the type of tragedies such as \nthe one that occurred at Virginia Tech.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/30/senate-section/article/S3587-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3587-S3588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNITION OF THE SERVICE OF FORMER SENATOR WALTER ``FRITZ'' MONDALE\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a statement made by Senator Leahy at the University of \nMinnesota on April 7, 2008.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. LEAHY. Thank you Senator Klobuchar. And what a joy it \n     still is to say those two words together. Minnesota's new \n     senator already is bringing even more distinction to the seat \n     that Hubert Humphrey held. She is another star who was \n     mentored by Fritz Mondale, and she is upholding that grand \n     DFL tradition.\n       When I was asked if I could be here with you, I was more \n     than glad to clear my calendar to do it. It is a special \n     honor and a great pleasure to be here with you in recognition \n     of the service, the historical significance, and the 80th \n     anniversary year of a friend, a former colleague, and an \n     American statesman.\n       In this room we know him as ``Fritz.'' Others call him \n     Walter. When he was a halfback in high school, they called \n     him ``Crazylegs Mondale'' for some reason. He has also gone \n     by Mr. Attorney General, Senator, Mr. Vice President, Mr. \n     Ambassador, and Dad. I think I like Crazylegs best. I can't \n     wait to ask him about how that happened.\n       The history of the era of his public service has not yet \n     taken full form for the ages, but even now Fritz Mondale \n     looms large as a model and as a catalyst, in his roles in the \n     Senate and as Vice President.\n       I have been asked to focus particularly on his time in the \n     Senate.\n       Walter Mondale is sometimes described as the paradigm \n     figure of the transition between two eras--the FDR Coalition \n     up to the War in Vietnam, and the social ferment that came \n     after the war. And perhaps this is so. But to me, who Fritz \n     Mondale is, and what he stands for, are just as important as \n     when he stood there. Deep echoes resonate throughout his \n     service of the first principles of our Republic. The issues \n     he led on then are as fresh as today's news, and as enduring \n     as our founding documents.\n       Issues like the concentration and abuse of power. Or social \n     and economic justice and the consolidation of wealth in the \n     pockets and portfolios of just a few. Or the role of \n     government in protecting the little guy when powerful market \n     forces run roughshod. Or the tension between freedom and \n     security. Or the challenge of achieving energy security. Or \n     the very roles of both the Senate and the Office of the Vice \n     President in the American system. Even the question of \n     whether a woman ever could credibly assume the highest \n     office in the land. Trace any of these issues back in \n     time, and you will find Fritz Mondale at earlier decision \n     points. For example, just imagine how loose from our \n     moorings we might be right now without the guideposts of \n     the FISA law, which resulted from the investigation that \n     he, Frank Church and others launched into earlier abuses \n     of the power of government to snoop into Americans' lives.\n       Here is something to which we all can attest. Fritz Mondale \n     is a good man whose decency elevated every institution in \n     which he served. Who he is has everything to do with what he \n     achieved.\n       Clarence once said that his brother's politics were, as he \n     put it, ``an extension of our father's preaching,'' and I can \n     see that. Their father, the farmer-turned-minister, felt and \n     saw the ravages of the Great Depression on the farms and the \n     communities of the heartland. And when Fritz entered \n     politics, he did it for the right reasons, to make life \n     better for the people.\n       In the Senate we mostly chalked Fritz's personality up to \n     clean air, clean living and Norwegian genes. He was and is \n     well liked on both sides of the aisle. Fritz's dad taught him \n     that your integrity is everything, and the lesson stuck. He \n     kept his word and everyone trusted him. He was always well \n     prepared. And he surrounded himself with good and competent \n     people. He had one of the best staffs on the Hill, and it's a \n     treat to see some of those staffers sprinkled around the room \n     today.\n       I've known Fritz a long while, but you still pick up some \n     new perspectives in preparing for an occasion like this. I \n     knew he was avid about hunting and fishing in the North \n     Woods, but I hadn't known his reputation for being such a \n     good ``bull cook.''\n       I looked it up. A bull cook is the fellow stuck with doing \n     the chores around camp, cutting fuel, cleaning up and \n     cooking. But when he rings the bell in the morning, everyone \n     has to get up. I think that after being in a place like the \n     Senate where no one is able to give orders that stick, Fritz \n     likes that sense of real power when he rings that bell.\n       One side of Fritz that the public did not see as readily as \n     we did in the Senate was his sense of humor--one of the best \n     I have ever known. In many a tense moment, his sense of humor \n     often defused the tension and restored the spirit of comity \n     that is so crucial in getting things done in the Senate.\n       I wish the American people had seen more of that side of \n     Fritz Mondale. Mike Berman told Fritz's biographer Finlay \n     Lewis that the staff was always urging Fritz to loosen up in \n     public. Mike said, ``I can't count the number of lit cigars I \n     have stuffed in my pocket over the years.''\n       He loved the Senate, and the Senate loved him back. He once \n     said that he ``found his sweet spot'' in the Senate. He was a \n     quick learner and craved learning new things. He said the \n     Senate ``was like mainlining human nature.'' And it's true. \n     You pick up any day's Congressional Record, and it's like \n     America's newspaper. Whatever is happening in\n\n[[Page S3588]]\n\n     the country or the world on any given day is being talked \n     about and sometimes even acted on in the United States \n     Senate.\n       His first major legislative achievement was a 1966 law to \n     make automakers notify car owners of dangerous defects. He \n     went on to win another victory for consumers by stepping up \n     regulation of slaughterhouses that had been selling diseased \n     and putrid meat.\n       But he really came into his own in mastering the \n     legislative process with a key victory on his open housing \n     bill. Part of his success in winning a key cloture vote, \n     against great odds, was helped along by his earlier bonding \n     with a crusty earlier chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \n     James Eastland. I hasten to note that I haven't yet entered \n     into my crusty phase. Fritz knew the art of being able to \n     disagree without being disagreeable.\n       That was a heady and vibrant legislative era, and Fritz had \n     a hand in virtually every major piece of civil rights, \n     education and child care legislation that emerged from \n     Congress during that period.\n       To me, part of his Senate legacy that is the most \n     significant and timely--timely, even today--was his work on \n     and after the Senate's investigation--headed by Senator Frank \n     Church--into the abuses that led to the spying on the \n     American people by their own government. The FBI's COINTELPRO \n     operation, for instance, had spent more than two decades \n     searching in vain for communist influence in the NAACP, and \n     they had infiltrated domestic groups like organizations that \n     advocated for women's rights.\n       More than any other member of the special committee, Fritz \n     Mondale mastered the issues and dug into the research, which \n     spanned testimony from 800 witnesses and more than one \n     hundred thousand classified pages. The evidence added up, in \n     his words, to ``a road map to the destruction of American \n     democracy.'' Powerful government surveillance tools were \n     misused against the American people. There had been little \n     effective congressional oversight of these federal \n     investigative and intelligence agencies, and too little \n     judicial review.\n       Their work led to the creation of the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, and later, to the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act--the FISA law that only lately has entered \n     the public lexicon.\n       Then, as now, in the name of security, some were willing to \n     trade away the people's rights. Then, as now, some would have \n     the United States of America stoop to the level of our \n     enemies, giving them a victory over us that they could not \n     achieve on their own.\n       The parallels with today are clear and so are the lessons, \n     but Fritz freshened the bottom line for us in his address to \n     Senators not long after 9/11, as part of the Senate's leaders \n     lecture series. Even before Abu Ghraib, the disclosure of the \n     torture memos, the revelations about unlawful surveillance of \n     Americans, or White House political tampering with U.S. \n     Attorneys, this is what he said in September, 2002: ``There \n     is always the danger that our fears will overcome our faith \n     in the power of justice and accountability. Whenever we have \n     gone down that road, we have hurt the innocent and \n     embarrassed ourselves. Justice and accountability make us \n     better able to face our enemies. Justice strengthens us.'' \n     Unquote, and amen.\n       Another of Fritz Mondale's most remarkable and lasting \n     achievements in the Senate was to engineer a change in the \n     Senate's rules, to curb the abuse of filibusters in thwarting \n     the will of clear majorities of the American people. The \n     difficulty in passing the civil rights laws of the 60s had \n     gradually convinced more and more Senators that the bar for \n     cutting off debate in the Senate was set too high.\n       That might not sound difficult, but changing the way the \n     Senate operates is something akin to trying to change the \n     weather.\n       As a freshman Senator, I had a front seat and a bit part in \n     Fritz's highly organized campaign to change the cloture rule.\n       He and Republican Senator James Pearson of Kansas launched \n     the effort to change cloture from two-thirds to three-fifths. \n     Fritz preceded and followed that launch by carefully laying \n     the groundwork, enlisting Senators one by one. When it \n     finally reached the Senate Floor, the debate itself was \n     protracted. Finlay Lewis set the scene well in describing \n     part of the debate. Quoting him, ``To an uninitiated or \n     casual visitor, the proceedings must have seemed arcane, even \n     bizarre. Here was the world's greatest deliberative body \n     solemnly voting to table the Lord's Prayer. At another point, \n     the Senate became polarized over a murky motion to table a \n     motion to reconsider a vote to table an appeal of a ruling \n     that a point of order was NOT in order against a motion to \n     table another point of order against a motion to bring to a \n     vote a motion to call up a resolution that would change the \n     rules. At least, that's what it sounded like.'' Unquote.\n       Late, late one night, at about this point in the debate, \n     Fritz and Majority Leader Mike Mansfield enlisted me, a young \n     whippersnapper, to play a role. They asked me to stay on the \n     floor one night around two in the morning to take the gavel \n     as the presiding officer. They expected that a lot of tight \n     rulings were coming up. But I felt the honor of the calling \n     drain away as Mansfield explained that they needed someone \n     big who was still awake to be in the chair for those rulings. \n     Sometimes a Senator is no more than a conscious body in the \n     right place at the right time.\n       The debate went on and on and on, and so did the \n     parliamentary and coalition-building by Fritz and by his \n     opponents. Relationships and Senate comity were being tested. \n     Before they reached the breaking point, Fritz rightly knew \n     when to strike a compromise, and he worked one out with \n     Russell Long.\n       He won the change in the cloture rule, and it is not an \n     exaggeration to point out that his efforts probably saved the \n     Senate as we know it, and he did it without changing the \n     Senate's fundamental character. As difficult as it still is \n     to get things done in the Senate, without the Mondale cloture \n     rule the Senate by now would be largely unmanageable.\n       It is saddening and frustrating today to see that even the \n     Mondale rule has been abused. Filibusters are used far more \n     often than they used to be. We had to have 72 cloture votes \n     last year, and with a razor thin majority like the current \n     Democratic majority in the Senate, that usually is an \n     insurmountable hurdle. As Fritz knows and as Fritz \n     practiced, the Senate's machinery is oiled by good will \n     and self restraint, and there is less and less of that \n     around.\n       Through his public service, Fritz Mondale invested himself \n     in the belief that our democracy offers civilizing power to \n     all of us together as a community, through our representative \n     government, to give each of us, and all of us, the \n     opportunity to thrive, to make justice real, and to make the \n     economy work for all and not just for some.\n       In a time when government is compiling more and more \n     information about every American, every American deserves to \n     know what their government is doing. Checks and balances and \n     the kind of oversight that Fritz Mondale believes in and \n     practiced makes government more accountable to the people. It \n     helps make our system work as the Framers intended.\n       This is the way he put it in that address in 2002: ``What a \n     paradise we would live in if trust were never abused. But our \n     Founders knew better. They built our system on this deep \n     insight into human nature. We are not perfect. We are, all of \n     us, mixtures of the good and base, lofty and lowly, selfless \n     and selfish. We are capable of sonatas, sonnets, and \n     cathedrals. But we are also capable of greed, paranoia, and a \n     dangerous thirst for power.'' Unquote. That insight of the \n     Framers, he concluded, accounts for our unique system of \n     checks and balances.\n       The Senate at its best can be the conscience of the nation. \n     I have seen that when it happens, and I marvel in the \n     fundamental soundness and wisdom of our system every time it \n     does. But we cannot afford to put any part of the mechanism \n     on automatic pilot. It takes constant work and vigilance to \n     keep our system working as it should for the betterment of \n     our society and its people. Keeping faith with these \n     fundamentals accounts for much of the legacy of Fritz \n     Mondale.\n       It is easy for politicians to appeal to our worst instincts \n     and to our selfishness. Political leaders serve best when \n     they appeal to the best in us, to lift our sights, summon our \n     will and raise us to a higher level.\n       This year we celebrate our good fortune of knowing and \n     benefiting from Fritz Mondale's ample service to the nation, \n     and there is much to celebrate. His is the generous and \n     optimistic spirit of the reformer, and of the patriot.\n       Thank you, Fritz. And Happy Birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/30/senate-section/article/S3588-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3588-S3589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMISSION ON THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVES\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the work of the \nCommission on the National Guard and Reserves. Under the leadership of \nArnold L. Punaro, the Commission has done this Nation a great service. \nIt was my privilege as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nto include the legislation that established the Commission in the \nannual National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005.\n  On January 31, 2008, the Commission submitted its final report to the \nHouse and Senate Armed Services Committees and the Secretary of \nDefense. That report is thorough, is based on substantial and careful \nresearch and an extensive information-gathering process, and reflects \nmany hours of deliberations by the Commission's members.\n  The 12 Commissioners, between them, brought 288 total years of \nmilitary service, 186 total years of nonmilitary government service, \nand many years of private-sector experience to the task. In addition to \nChairman Punaro, the Commission's members are William L. Ball, III; Les \nBrownlee; Rhett B. Dawson; Larry K. Eckles; Patricia L. Lewis; Dan \nMcKinnon; Wade Rowley; James E. Sherrard, III; Donald L. Stockton; E. \nGordon Stump; and J. Stanton Thompson.\n  The Commission was established by Public Law 108-375, the Ronald \nReagan National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2005, as \namended by Public Law 109-163, to assess the reserve component of the \nU.S. military and to recommend changes to ensure that the National \nGuard and other reserve components are organized, trained, equipped, \ncompensated, and supported\n\n[[Page S3589]]\n\nto best meet the needs of U.S. national security.\n  The Commission's first interim report, containing initial findings \nand the description of a strategic plan to complete its work, was \ndelivered on June 5, 2006. The second interim report, delivered on \nMarch 1, 2007, was required by Public Law 109-364, the John Warner \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007, enacted on \nOctober 17, 2006. That second report examined 17 proposals contained in \nthe National Defense Enhancement and National Guard Empowerment Act, \nand included 23 recommendations covering the broad spectrum of issues \nraised by the legislation.\n  The Commission's second report was thoroughly reviewed by both \nCongress and the Department of Defense, and careful consideration was \ngiven to the Commission's recommendations that have changed, in a \nfundamental way, the Department of Defense's role for domestic \nsecurity, taking significant steps towards improvements to make the \nnation safer from man-made and natural disasters. Secretary of Defense \nGates also has taken timely and decisive action to implement those \nrecommendations not requiring legislation, and has advocated before \nCongress for those requiring legislation.\n  The final report of the Commission was constructed from 17 days of \npublic hearings, involving 115 witnesses; 52 Commission meetings; more \nthan 850 interviews; numerous site visits, forums, and panel \ndiscussions; and the detailed analysis of thousands of documents \nsupplied at the Commission's request by the military services, \ngovernment agencies, experts, and other stakeholders. It contains 6 \nmajor conclusions and 95 recommendations, supported by 163 findings. \nThis prodigious, thorough effort met the expectations of Congress.\n  In conducting its work, the Commission gathered information, analyzed \nevidence, identified significant problems facing the reserve \ncomponents, and sought to offer the best possible recommendations to \nsolve the problems identified. The Commissioners stated clearly their \nbelief that the problems identified in the report are systemic, have \nevolved over many years, and are not the product of any one official or \nadministration. Many of the Commission's recommendations to solve those \nproblems can now be implemented; however, a number of them will take \nyears to reach full implementation and will require additional work by \nCongress and the executive branch.\n  At the core of these changes is the explicit recognition of the \nevolution of the reserve components from a purely strategic force, with \nlengthy mobilization times designed to meet threats from large nation-\nstates, to an operational force. This operational reserve must be \nreadily available for emergencies at home and abroad, and more fully \nintegrated with active components. Simultaneously, this force must \nretain its own required strategic elements and capabilities.\n  The Commission concluded that there will be greater reliance on the \nreserve components as part of its operational force for missions at \nhome and abroad. Moreover, the Commission also concluded that the \nchange from the reserve components' historic Cold War posture \nnecessitates fundamental reforms to reserve components' homeland roles \nand missions, to personnel management systems, to equipping and \ntraining policies, to policies affecting families and employers, and to \nthe organizations and structures used to manage the reserves. These \nreforms are essential to ensure that this operational reserve is \nfeasible in the short term while sustainable over the long term. In \nfact, the Commission believes that the future of the all-volunteer \nforce depends upon the continued success of our implementation of \nneeded reforms to ensure that the reserve components are ready, \ncapable, and available for both operational and strategic missions.\n  In reviewing the past several decades of diverse use of the reserve \ncomponents, as an integral part of operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nthe homeland, most notably the Commission has found indisputable and \noverwhelming evidence of the need for future policymakers and the \nmilitary to break with outdated policies and processes and implement \nfundamental, thorough reforms in these areas.\n  The members of the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves \nshare this view unanimously. The Commission notes that these \nrecommendations will require the nation to reorder the priorities of \nthe Department of Defense, thereby necessitating a major restructuring \nof laws and DOD's budget. While there are some costs associated with \nthese recommendations, the Commission believes that the problems are \nserious, the need to address them is urgent, and the benefits of the \nreforms we identify more than exceed the expense of implementing them.\n  Clearly, the reserve force has proven itself to be a wise investment \nin our overall security structure and should be commended for their \nprofessional contributions to our Nation's defense. The Commission \nrecognizes that these issues are extremely complex, and that there will \nbe disagreement with some of the solutions it has proposed. That is to \nbe expected. Commission members anticipate that this report will \ngenerate lively debate among the organizations and key policymakers \nresponsible for protecting U.S. national security. With the submission \nof its last report, the Commission turns its findings, conclusions, and \nrecommendations over to the legislative and executive branches, where \nCommission members feel confident that they will be carefully \nconsidered, improved upon, and implemented.\n  The Commission has provided America a blueprint for our work on the \nNational Guard and Reserves this year and in the future. Each of its 95 \nrecommendations merits our careful consideration. The Senate Armed \nServices and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees have \nalready held hearings on the Commission's report, and we await the \nDepartment of Defense's formal response to its recommendations.\n  It is with profound admiration and gratitude that I extend our \ncollective thanks for the service that this Commission has rendered to \nour nation and to our men and women in uniform. I know my colleagues \nwill agree when I say that this Commission has made profound and \nsubstantive recommendations for reforming our National Guard and \nReserves and that we look forward to working to address the issues \nraised by the Commission's final report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/30/senate-section/article/S3589-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL E.

Mr. President, I am proud to honor a group of 94 \nWorld War II veterans from Louisiana who are traveling to Washington, \nDC, this weekend to visit the various memorials and monuments that \nrecognize the sacrifices of our Nation's invaluable service members.\n  Louisiana HonorAir, a group based in Lafayette, LA, is sponsoring \nthis Saturday's trip to the Nation' s Capital. The organization is \nhonoring each surviving World War II Louisiana veteran by giving them \nan opportunity to see the memorials dedicated to their service. On this \ntrip, the veterans will visit the World War II, Korea, Vietnam and Iwo \nJima memorials. They will also travel to Arlington National Cemetery to \nlay a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknowns.\n  This is the eighth flight Louisiana HonorAir has made to Washington, \nDC., and there will be one additional flight this spring.\n  World War II was one of America's greatest triumphs, but was also a \nconflict rife with individual sacrifice and tragedy. More than 60 \nmillion people worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, \nand more than 400,000 American service members were slain during the \nlong war. The ultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in \nEurope is a testament to the valor of American soldiers, sailors, \nairmen and marines. The years 1941 to 1945 also witnessed an \nunprecedented mobilization of domestic industry, which supplied our \nmilitary on two distant fronts.\n  In Louisiana, there remain today more than 40,000 living WWII \nveterans, and each one has a heroic tale of achieving the noble victory \nof freedom over tyranny. Veterans in this HonorAir group range in age \nfrom 79 to 91. They began their service as early as 1939, before the \nbombing of Pearl Harbor, and some members of this group served as late \nas 1976. They served in various branches of the military--37 members in \nthe Army; 17 in the Army Air Corps, including one in the Women's Air \nCorps; 28 in the Navy; 3 in the Naval Reserve; 4 in the Marines; 1 in \nthe Marine Corps Reserve; 2 in the Merchant Marines; and 2 in the U.S. \nCoast Guard.\n  Our heroes served across the globe in the Pacific, Atlantic, Asiatic \nPacific and China Burma India theaters. Others served in North Africa, \nJapan, Korea, the islands of the South Pacific and in other areas of \nEurope and stateside. Our service members battled at Iwo Jima, \nGuadalcanal, Okinawa, Saipan, Tinian and the Solomon Islands.\n  Many of these veterans earned Purple Hearts, Bronze Star Medals and \nCroix de Guerre medals. They served on famous battleships such as USS \nNorth Carolina, and they participated in the liberation of the \nPhilippines.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in honoring these 94 veterans, all \nLouisiana heroes, that we welcome to Washington this weekend and \nLouisiana HonorAir for making these trips a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/30/senate-section/article/S3590-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING TRANS-TECH INDUSTRIES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \nimmeasurable contributions of a small Maine company both to its \nindustry and community. Trans-Tech Industries is an innovative \nmanufacturer of aluminum tanks and trailers which are used to transport \nfuel and petroleum products. In addition to leading its field, Trans-\nTech has given back to the city of Brewer, ME, in countless ways.\n  Trans-Tech is a shining model for companies seeking to compete in the \ndemanding global marketplace. Founded in 1984, the company set out with \na simple goal: strengthen existing models of aluminum tanks to become \nsafer and more convenient for the operator. Trans-Tech originally began \noperations in a converted storage unit in the seaside town of Southwest \nHarbor. During its early years, Trans-Tech manufactured tanks and \ntrailers as well as aluminum boats. But company president Ken Peters \nfound it difficult to produce the number of tanks for which he had \nhoped, and he continually increased efforts to make more tanks. In \n1999, Trans-Tech finally moved to a location in Brewer's East-West \nIndustrial Park that better suited the company's needs.\n  Since relocating to Brewer, Trans-Tech's tank production has soared. \nThe company presently makes between 400 and 500 tanks each year, as \nopposed to the less than 100 it previously produced, and revenues have \nincreased threefold. Moreover, the company continues to improve and \nexpand. Besides its state-of-the-art 43,000 square foot production \nfacility, Trans-Tech added an adjacent 7,200 square foot building in \n2004, allowing it to focus on the manufacturing of specialty trailers. \nTrans-Tech was additionally able to realize its goal of developing \naircraft refuelers that range from 1,000 to 10,000 gallons each which \nare now in use at airports across the country, showing how Trans-Tech \nhas made the most of its new opportunities.\n  While Trans-Tech certainly produces high quality tanks and trailers, \nthe firm and its over 60 employees are also a good neighbor, donating \ntime and resources to many area organizations and charities. Trans-\nTech's commitment to the community is visible with its assistance to \nThe Salvation Army; the company's sponsoring a youth hockey team; and \nits major participation in the Brewer Days and Brewer Winterfest, two \nwell-attended annual community events.\n  One of Trans-Tech's most recognizable efforts is its involvement with \nthe Bangor Area Homeless Shelter. Mr. Peters serves on the shelter's \nboard of directors, and he and Trans-Tech constantly provide the \nshelter with needed supplies such as furniture and food. They even \ndonated a new air conditioner for the hot summer months. Mr. Peters \nalso serves as a board member on the Brewer Economic Development \nCorporation and he is a founding member of the Penobscot Landing \nCommittee, which is aimed at revitalizing the historic Brewer \nwaterfront. He is also the 2008 recipient of the Governor's Service \nAward as chosen by the Maine Commission for Community Service, a \nfitting acknowledgement of the devotion he and Trans-Tech have shown to \nimproving the well-being of Brewer.\n  Through its unyielding pledge to both business and community, Trans-\nTech sets a high bar for companies seeking to succeed in all facets. \nKen Peters inspires his employees, and they in turn help make Brewer a \nbetter community in which to live. He also gives back to his employees \nin numerous ways, including providing them with a raise to help them \nmanage rising gas prices. The firm's magnanimous spirit truly flows \nfrom the top, and it is something to be celebrated. I congratulate \nTrans-Tech Industries on all it does, and wish the company well in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/30/senate-section/article/S3590-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3590-S3591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL J. BARTLETT\n\n Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Michael J. \nBartlett, supervisor of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service New England \nField Office, who is retiring after four decades of exemplary public \nservice. My home State of New Hampshire, the New England region, and \nour Nation have benefitted greatly from Mike's efforts as a tireless \ndefender of our natural resources.\n  After completing military service over 37 years ago, Mike joined the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a staff biologist. Prior to his \ncurrent role, he served as a project leader in the New Jersey \nEcological Services Office, Northeast regional chief of field \noperations, and Northeast deputy assistant regional director.\n  Like any good steward, Mike has left things better than he found them \nin each of these positions. Throughout his time with the Fish and \nWildlife Service, Mike has fostered accountability, efficiency, and \nteamwork. For his accomplishments in strengthening employee-supervisor \nrelationships and improving overall employee satisfaction, Mike was \nhonored with the Fish and Wildlife Service Northeast Region's ``Invest \nin People'' award.\n  Mike's leadership and collaborative approach to natural resource \nprotection are widely respected. As Supervisor of the New England Field \nOffice, Mike has minimized the adversarial nature of his office's \nregulatory role and repeatedly brought parties together for mutually \nbeneficial outcomes. At the same time, Mike has been unwavering in his \ndedication to natural resource protection.\n  Mike was instrumental in complex and lengthy negotiations with the\n\n[[Page S3591]]\n\nMaine aquaculture industry, the Army Corps of Engineers, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and State of Maine that resulted in \nstrong protections for endangered Atlantic salmon. Additionally, under \nhis supervision, the New England Field Office has secured significant \nresource benefits by negotiating numerous settlement agreements on \ncontentious hydroelectric project license renewals. For example, a \nmitigation fund created as part of the relicensing of the Fifteen Mile \nFalls hydroelectric project on the Connecticut River has allowed the \nrestoration of 20 miles of river habitat, protection of over 25,000 \nacres of watershed lands, and fish passage improvements.\n  Under Mike's supervision, the New England Field Office has been a \nwise steward of natural resource damage assessment funds. Mike has \ninsisted that such funds be used to obtain the greatest possible \nbenefit for fish and wildlife impacted by oilspills and other \nenvironmental degradation. In Maine, settlement funds totaling $8 \nmillion were used to leverage over $100 million in additional \ninvestment to protect habitat for common loons and ducks that were \nimpacted by the North Cape oilspill in Rhode Island. The combined funds \nsecured the protection of 1.5 million acres and more than 200 lakes and \nponds that provide nesting habitat for over 125 pairs of loons and 600 \npairs of common eiders. In Massachusetts, settlement funds have been \nused to preserve endangered roseate tern colonies in Buzzards Bay, \nrestore saltmarsh and eelgrass beds, and provide herring with spawning \nhabitat on the Acushnet River.\n  Mike's emphasis on collaboration shines through in the exceptional \nwork performed by his office through the Fish and Wildlife Service \nPartners program. During Mike's tenure as supervisor of the New England \nField Office, the program has restored hundreds of miles of river \naccess and thousands of acres of wetlands in the region. In New \nHampshire, thanks to a highly successful dam removal program that Mike \nconceived and helped to create, I have witnessed improvements to our \nrivers such as the Contoocook and Souhegan. Meanwhile, the Partners \nprogram has restored coastal saltmarsh in Greenland, Newmarket, \nNewington, Hampton, Rye and North Hampton, New Hampshire. This and \nsimilar work throughout New England has enhanced landscapes and \npreserved critical habitat for Atlantic salmon, American shad, American \neel, brook trout, and freshwater mussels.\n  Mike's work has also benefitted many species including Indiana bats, \nNew England cottontail rabbits, and a variety of migratory birds such \nas piping plovers, bobolinks, eastern meadowlarks, loons, roseate \nterns, and bald eagles. His stewardship has even impacted the smallest \nof species. Mike's negotiation of an agreement with the city of \nConcord, the New Hampshire Department of Fish and Game, and private \npartners has ensured the protection of the federally endangered Karner \nblue butterfly through cooperative management of 300 acres of habitat \nat the Concord City Airport.\n  Mike plans to teach in his retirement, and this is fitting because he \nhas already been a mentor, coach, and teacher for many individuals. \nMike's dedication and his outgoing and gregarious personality, to which \ncolleagues and friends attribute much of his success, are widely \nadmired. The inspiration Mike provides for others will undoubtedly \ncontinue to be a catalyst for conservation.\n  Mike is to be commended for his extensive work on behalf of fish, \nwildlife, wetlands, and conservation in general. I am certain that \nMike's retirement will be enjoyable, as some say that his professional \nand personal attributes may be equaled only by his aquatic resource \ncollection skills with a fly rod. Mike's upcoming time for angling, \nhunting, kayaking, and relaxing with his wife, children, and \ngrandchildren, is well-deserved. I wish Mike and his family great \nsuccess in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/30/senate-section/article/S3591-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/30/senate-section/article/S3591-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/30/senate-section/article/S3591-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:27 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3490.

It is \n     estimated that approximately $70 million could be collected \n     for Arizona if federal tax refunds were subject to intercept \n     by the Internal Revenue Service; and\n       Whereas, mechanisms already are in place to intercept this \n     debt and such a plan would result in no loss to the federal \n     budget. The federal tax intercept proposal is a fair and \n     simple way to enforce debts owed without implementing a tax \n     increase.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays.\n       1.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Kansas expressing its support for the \n     National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                 Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 1624\n\n       Whereas, Homeland Security Presidential Directive Nine \n     (HSPD-9) has tasked the Secretary of the Department of \n     Homeland Security to coordinate, ``counter-measure research \n     and development of new methods for detection, prevention \n     technologies, agent characterization and dose response \n     relationships for high-consequence agents''; and\n       Whereas, at present no facilities in the United States have \n     adequate containment, security, equipment and infrastructure \n     to meet the requirements identified in HSPD-9; and\n       Whereas, to meet this need, the Department of Homeland \n     Security and its federal partners initiated plans for a \n     National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF); and\n       Whereas, the NBAF will enhance protection from both natural \n     and intentional threats by providing and integrating high-\n     biosecurity facilities, thus increasing our nation's capacity \n     to assess potential threats to both human and animal life; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Department of Homeland Security is seeking a \n     location to build the $451 million, 500,000 square foot, NBAF \n     facility; and\n       Whereas, A site on the campus of Kansas State University is \n     one of six sites actively under consideration by the \n     Department of Homeland Security as possible locations for the \n     NBAF facility; and\n       Whereas, the State of Kansas recognizes the NBAF as a \n     critical national investment and pledges its support for the \n     funding and construction of the NBAF in order to protect \n     human and animal health from both naturally occurring and \n     intentionally introduced disease threats; and\n       Whereas, Kansas is the ideal location for the NBAF. Kansas \n     is a world leader in bioscience, particularly in the areas of \n     animal health and vaccines, infectious diseases, and food \n     safety. Kansas also has in place an exceptionally well \n     qualified workforce; and\n       Whereas, in demonstration of their zealous support for \n     locating the NBAF in Kansas, Governor Kathleen Sebelius and \n     the Kansas Bioscience Authority have initiated a task force \n     to lead Kansas' bid for the NBAF. This task force consists of \n     prominent industry leaders, public officials--including the \n     entire Kansas congressional delegation--representatives from \n     the Kansas legislature, producer groups and leaders of \n     prominent academic institutions; and\n       Whereas, the State of Kansas is committed to partnering \n     with the federal government to support biosecurity. As part \n     of this commitment, Kansas--along with the federal \n     government--invested $54 million in the nation's most modern \n     biosecurity laboratory, the Biosecurity Research Institute at \n     Kansas State University: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the State of Kansas, the House \n     of Representatives concurring therein, That the Kansas \n     legislature pledges its support for Kansas State University \n     and the City of Manhattan, in their bid to have the U.S. \n     Department of Homeland Security's National Bio and Agro-\n     Defense Facility located in Kansas, and that the Legislature \n     underscores its commitment to provide any and all support \n     necessary to ensure the location of the NBAF in Kansas; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Kansas Legislature purposefully \n     encourages the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to \n     consider Kansas' demonstrated expertise and experience with \n     research, its existing facilities and security \n     infrastructure, and the human resources already in place that \n     make Kansas a natural fit for the location of this new \n     federal laboratory; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be provided to \n     President Bush and Vice President Cheney, Secretary Chertoff \n     of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Secretary \n     Schafer of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Secretary \n     Leavitt of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \n     the Kansas congressional delegation and Governor Kathleen \n     Sebelius.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-345. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging Congress to reverse funding cuts to the \n     Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 165\n\n       Whereas, the grants funded through the Byrne Justice \n     assistance Grant Program are used throughout Michigan for \n     statewide and local law enforcement efforts. The Byrne \n     program grants assist the apprehension, prosecution, \n     adjudication, detention, and rehabilitation of offenders. The \n     funding supports training, equipment, additional personnel, \n     and other measures to increase the effectiveness of law \n     enforcement and victim assistance; and\n       Whereas, the cuts in the fiscal year 2008 appropriations \n     for the Byrne program that were approved by Congress and \n     signed into law are staggering. Michigan will lose two-thirds \n     of the funding received in the previous year, down to only \n     $3.2 million. For programs such as the Office of Drug Control \n     Policy, the slashing of the funds available will cripple the \n     office and force the cancellation of many worthwhile \n     programs. The effects on other state and local programs will\n\n[[Page S3594]]\n\n     be similarly drastic. With the state's budget situation still \n     in question due to negative trends in the national economy \n     that threaten to overwhelm state efforts to restore growth, \n     we clearly cannot replace the lost federal money; and\n       Whereas, as the federal government continues to grapple wih \n     the budget and economic growth measures, there is still time \n     for Congress to correct the looming crisis in law enforcement \n     efforts in the states. We know that cuts in funding now, when \n     the economic picture is growing bleak, will make the need to \n     effective law enforcement an victim assistance more important \n     than ever. Congress must restore funding to the Byrne program \n     to fiscal year 2007 levels through a supplemental \n     appropriations act in order to prevent the curtailment or \n     cancellation of key criminal justice programs; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the United \n     States Congress to reverse cuts to the Edward Byrne Memorial \n     Justice Assistance Grant Program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-346. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to take the actions \n     necessary to ensure adequate funding for veterans' health \n     care; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 23\n\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     provides medical care to veterans who have risked their lives \n     to protect the security of the nation; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     has the largest integrated health care system in the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, the missions of the United States Department of \n     Veterans Affairs include providing health care to veterans, \n     educating and training health care personnel, conducting \n     medical research, serving as backup to the United States \n     Department of Defense, and supporting communities in times of \n     crisis; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     provides a wide range of specialized services to meet the \n     unique needs of veterans, including treatment and care for \n     spinal cord injury, blindness, traumatic brain injury, post \n     traumatic stress disorder, amputation injuries, mental health \n     issues, substance abuse, and conditions requiring long-tern \n     care; and\n       Whereas, federal discretionary funding for veterans' health \n     care is controlled by the executive branch and congress \n     through the budget and appropriations process; and\n       Whereas, the United States Governmental Accountability \n     Office report in 2005 highlighted the lack of resources and \n     staffing available to the United States Veterans \n     Administration for processing an increasing backlog of \n     veterans' claims; and\n       Whereas, discretionary funding for the United States \n     Department of Veterans Affairs lags behind both medical \n     inflation and the increased demands for services; and\n       Whereas, former United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     Anthony Principi has publicly stated that the United States \n     Department of Veterans Affairs has been struggling to provide \n     health care to the rapidly rising number of veterans who \n     require health care; and\n       Whereas, it is imperative that the members of congress make \n     funding health care for veterans a major priority. Therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     urge and request the United States Congress to ensure \n     adequate funding for veterans' health care. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the legislature does hereby express profound \n     and enduring gratitude to veterans for sacrifices made while \n     serving in the United States Armed Forces, particularly those \n     who suffer as a result of injuries sustained during military \n     service. Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the president and vice president of the United States and to \n     the members of Louisiana's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-347. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging Congress to adopt and implement \n     the recommendations of the Veterans' Disability Benefits \n     Commission; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 28\n\n       Whereas, the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission was \n     established by the Congress of the United States in Public \n     Law 108-136, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2004; \n     and\n       Whereas, between May 2005 and October 2007, the commission \n     conducted an in-depth analysis of the benefits and services \n     available to veterans, service members, their survivors, and \n     their families to compensate and provide assistance for the \n     effects of disabilities and deaths attributable to military \n     service; and\n       Whereas, the commission examined the appropriateness and \n     purpose of benefits, benefit levels and payment rates, and \n     the processes and purposes used to determine eligibility for \n     such services; and\n       Whereas, the commission reviewed past studies on these \n     subjects, the legislative history of these benefit programs, \n     and related issues that have been debated repeatedly over \n     several decades; and\n       Whereas, in federal fiscal year 2006, the Department of \n     Veterans' Affairs expended over forty billion dollars on a \n     wide array of these benefits and services for veterans, \n     service members, their survivors and their families; and\n       Whereas, the commission identified eight principles that it \n     believes should guide the development and delivery of future \n     benefits for veterans, service members, and their families; \n     and\n       Whereas, the following are those eight principles:\n       (1) Benefits should recognize the often enormous sacrifices \n     of military service as a continuing cost of war, and commend \n     military service as the highest obligation of citizenship.\n       (2) The goal of disability benefits should be \n     rehabilitation and reintegration into civilian life to the \n     maximum extent possible and preservation of the veterans' \n     dignity.\n       (3) Benefits should be uniformly based on severity of \n     service-connected disability without regard to the \n     circumstances of the disability (wartime vs. peacetime, \n     combat vs. training. or geographical location).\n       (4) Benefits and services should be provided that \n     collectively compensate for the consequence of service-\n     connected disability on the average impairment of earnings \n     capacity, the ability to engage in usual life activities, and \n     quality of life.\n       (5) Benefits and standards for determining benefits should \n     be updated or adapted frequently based on changes in the \n     economic and social impact of disability and impairment, \n     advances in medical knowledge and technology, and the \n     evolving nature of warfare and military service.\n       (6) Benefits should include access to a full range of \n     health care provided at no cost to service-disabled veterans. \n     Priority for care must be based on service connection and \n     degree of disability.\n       (7) Funding and resources to adequately meet the needs of \n     service-disabled veterans and their families must be fully \n     provided while being aware of the burden on current and \n     future generations.\n       (8) Benefits to our nation's service-disabled veterans must \n     be delivered in a consistent, fair, equitable, and timely \n     manner; and\n       Whereas, with these principles clearly in mind, the \n     commission has urged the nation to set a firm foundation upon \n     which to shape and evolve a system of appropriate, and \n     generous benefits for the disabled veterans of today and \n     tomorrow. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to adopt and implement the \n     recommendations of the Veterans' Disability Benefits \n     Commission.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 2939. A bill to expand and improve mental health care and \nreintegration programs for members of the National Guard and Reserve, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Today, I introduce the National Guard and Reserve Mental \nHealth Access Act, which provides greater access to mental health \nservices for our members of the National Guard and Reserve.\n  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are taking an excruciatingly high \ntoll on veterans and their families and the Nation obviously needs to \ngive greater priority to their mental health needs, including the \nNational Guard and the Reserve.\n  As of April 29, 2008, 31,848 servicemembers have been wounded in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. Thirty percent of our soldiers struggle with brain \ninjuries, mental illnesses, including post-traumatic stress disorder \nand depression, or a combination of these physical and mental wounds.\n\n  Earlier this month, the RAND Corporation released a report \ndocumenting the alarmingly high numbers of veterans who struggle with \nmental health problems and brain injuries. One in 5 of these brave men \nand women report mental health problems.\n  These mental health problems take various forms, including post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal tendencies and \nsubstance abuse, and they can persist for months or even years after \ntheir service. Some will never be the same again.\n  It is our duty to give our National Guard and Reserves the best \npossible treatment, whatever their injury. Mental conditions should be \ntreated with the same care and concern as physical conditions.\n  This bill calls for the implementation of the Yellow Ribbon \nReintegration Program, which provides counseling, education and family \nservices to returning members of the Guard and reservists. It \nestablishes a Joint Psychological Health Program in the National Guard \nBureau to oversee and coordinate support for Guard members with mental \nillness or brain injuries, and it creates a pilot project for providing \nnew applications of technology in tele-mental health and anti-stigma \ntreatment.\n  The National Guard and Reserve Mental Health Access Act is a three-\npart approach to targeting these mental health needs, which require \nspecialized access to care and services.\n  Our National Guard and Reserves make incredible sacrifices for our \ncountry and we owe them the very best access to care possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN:\n  S. 2940. A bill to promote green energy production, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, energy independence is no longer an option \nfor our Nation. It is an imperative. The clock is ticking. If we do not \nbreak the ties, our children and grandchildren will have to clean up \nour mess. It is not too late.\n  Today I introduced legislation to help U.S. companies and U.S. \nworkers chart a new course. This is an energy bill. It is a jobs bill. \nIt is an environment bill. It will help companies turn green energy \nresearch into green energy products. It will help workers build careers \naround green energy development and production. It will help our Nation \nbreak free of foreign oil and grow our economy by growing green energy. \nIt is an important step that, along with comprehensive climate change \nlegislation, will put our country on a path to energy independence.\n  While the first oil well in the United States was in the Presiding \nOfficer's State of Pennsylvania, just a year later oil was being \nproduced in Ohio. Before long, derricks dotted the landscape in every \ncorner of our State. My bill begins to address what Ohio and \nPennsylvania have known for years about energy.\n  The history of my State is also rich in coal. Frontiersmen discovered \nlarge deposits of coal in Tuscarawas County in the mid-1700s, long \nbefore Ohio became a State. Today, coal power is more than 90 percent \nof Ohio's electricity production.\n  Oil and coal powered this Nation through two World Wars. They helped\n\n[[Page S3597]]\n\nthe United States win the Cold War. And they made America the world's \nlargest economy. But today our economic future depends on our ability \nto move toward alternative energy development. Green energy just will \nnot restore our energy independence, it will secure our global \nleadership.\n  In my 15 months in the Senate, I have held nearly 100 roundtables \nacross Ohio learning about Ohio's capabilities and potential in leading \nthe way in the alternative energy industry. From Ralph Dahl's farm in \nnorthwest Montgomery County and the technology he has employed, to \nhigh-tech companies in Cleveland looking for financing but fearing the \nso-called valley of death, to eager entrepreneurs in Athens who are \ninstalling solar panels and wind turbines all over their part of the \nState, to the work of Stark State on fuel cells. But we haven't gone \nnearly far enough. It is only the beginning.\n  The Germans have long supported the development of solar power, and \ntoday they lead the world in that technology. Just last week, China \nannounced plans to set up trade protection laws, not to increase wind \nenergy in China but to corner the market on wind-energy-related \nproducts.\n  While we are debating whether to punch more holes in the ground to \ndrill for oil, the rest of the world is about to pass us by. But it is \nnot too late. American ingenuity and innovation can and will give our \nNation an edge over the competition. My bill creates an investment \ncorporation for that purpose lead by the best and brightest from the \nbusiness, labor, and environmental worlds. It will be charged with \nsupporting the development and commercialization of new energy \nproducts.\n  Great ideas are being left on the drawing board these days or, worse \nyet, getting produced overseas. Investments will be aimed with this \nlegislation at communities with high levels of unemployment, with \nexcess manufacturing capacity, and with brownfield industrial cleanup \nsites--communities with enormous potential and significant needs. My \nState, as is Pennsylvania, is dotted with dozens of those communities.\n  Our green energy manufacturing future should build on our great \nmanufacturing past, revitalizing flagging industries, and reenergizing \nmanufacturing hubs.\n  This bill creates the Green Redevelopment Opportunity and Workforce \nProgram that provides grants to companies a little further from \ncommercialization than those that receive loans in the Green Markets \nProgram.\n  These companies have green energy ideas that are a few years away \nfrom the market. Without these grants, they would never make it into \nproduction.\n  We cannot pick, and we should not pick, winners in the fight for the \nfuture of green energy, so we must explore as many ideas and inventions \nthat get to the market as possible.\n  My bill would also establish grant money for pilot programs for green \nenergy communities, colleges, and National Guard bases even. These \npilot programs will serve as important resources for business \ninterested in commercializing green technologies, as well as models for \nother communities that are trying to transition their economies to \ngreen energy.\n  The corporation will run a green energy internship and apprenticeship \nprogram that will help innovate green energy companies, hire new \ntalent, and help students earn valuable industry experience in this new \nindustry as it begins to take off.\n  My bill establishes a Green Energy Efficiency Grant Program that is a \ndollar-for-dollar match for energy producers, including municipal power \ncompanies and rural electric co-ops.\n  This provision helps by ending the conflict that energy producers \noften face with protecting the environment and growing their \nbusinesses. These energy producers try to encourage people to conserve, \nbut at the same time they are saying don't buy our product, which \nobviously is not a good business decision. This provision in this \nlegislation will help answer that.\n\n  By meeting these companies halfway, by matching their investment in \nenergy efficiency, the Government cannot do it all, but it can help \nthese responsible companies do right by the consumers and the \nenvironment.\n  Today, most of Ohio's oil wells are dry, coal production is literally \nonly half what it was in 1970, and Ohio's manufacturing centers from \nSteubenville to Lima, from Ravenna to Springfield, from Xenia to \nFindlay, are struggling to remain competitive. Our Nation's green \nfuture is more than using green energy or living in green houses or \nputting in green light bulbs. All those things are good, but we must \nbuild the green energy and its components in the United States. We know \ngreen energy is inevitable, but importing green energy from China and \nGermany, like we do today with oil from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, \nneed not be inevitable, and it is not in our Nation's best interests. \nWe need to end our foreign energy dependence, whether it is today, too \nmuch with Saudi Arabia, or in the future, too much with Germany.\n  The next green energy company that can change the world is out there \nwaiting to happen. It could be the National Composite Center in Dayton, \ncould be the cutting-edge fuel cell research ongoing in Mount Vernon, \nOH.\n  We can do this. If we do this right, if we wean ourselves from \nforeign oil, we can create good-paying jobs right here at home in the \nUnited States of America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 2943. A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate \nthe Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, my home State of Washington, and the \nPacific Northwest in general, is home to some of the most pristine \nnature and breathtaking scenery this country has to offer. I rise today \nto recognize a well known local treasure that puts the priceless gems \nof our region within reach. The Pacific Northwest Trail, running from \nthe Continental Divide to the Pacific Coast, is 1,200 miles long and \nranks among the most scenic trails in the world. This carefully chosen \npath runs through the Rocky Mountains, Selkirk Mountains, Pasayten \nWilderness, North Cascades, Olympic Mountains, and Wilderness Coast. \nFrom beginning to end it passes through three States, crosses three \nNational Parks, and winds through seven National Forests. This trail is \na national prize and should be recognized as such. That is why, today, \nI am introducing the Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail Act of \n2008 with my colleague from Washington State, Senator Murray.\n  The National Trails System was created in 1968 by the National Trails \nSystem Act. This act authorized a national system of trails to provide \nadditional outdoor recreation opportunities and to promote the \npreservation of access to the outdoor areas and historic resources of \nthe nation. Today there are eight National Scenic Trails that provide \nrecreation, conservation, and enjoyment of significant scenic, \nhistoric, natural, or cultural qualities. Designating the Pacific \nNorthwest Trail a National Scenic Trail will give it the proper \nrecognition, bring benefits to countless neighboring communities, and \npromote its protection, development, and maintenance.\n  Adding the Pacific Northwest Trail to the National Trail System has \ngained the support of Commissioners in Clallam, Jefferson. Island, \nSkagit, Whatcom, Okanogan, Ferry, Stevens, and Pend Oreille Counties in \nWashington and Boundary County in Idaho.

A bill to amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act \nto examine and improve the child welfare workforce, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a bill \nthat will address a pressing need in our nation's child welfare system: \nimprovements to the child welfare workforce. In 2006, the most recent \nyear for which data are available, approximately 905,000 children were \ndetermined to be victims of abuse or neglect. Whether a child needs in-\nhome support or foster care, family preservation or adoption, the child \nwelfare workforce strives to meet the individual needs of children and \nfamilies, so that safety and permanency are achieved as quickly as \npossible.\n  Unfortunately, the members of the child welfare workforce face a \nvariety of barriers to their execution of this critically important \nwork. Due to high caseloads and workloads, caseworkers have \ninsufficient time to interact with children and families, prepare \nindividualized plans, and provide services. Burnout and turnover are \nendemic to the child welfare system. The average tenure of a child \nwelfare worker is just under 2 years, with staff citing high caseloads, \na need for greater supervision, and few training opportunities as \nreasons for leaving their positions. This turnover leads to \ndiscontinuity of services, children's multiple placements in foster \ncare, longer stays of children in care, and lower rates of finding \npermanent homes for children. There is evidence that turnover is lower \namong child welfare workers holding a degree in social work than among \nthose who do not; yet, fewer than a third of child welfare workers hold \nthese degrees.\n  Turnover is also expensive. The U.S. Department of Labor has \nestimated that the cost of worker turnover is equivalent to \napproximately one-third of the worker's annual salary. Therefore, it \nmay cost agencies between $10,000 and $20,000 each time a worker leaves \nhis or her position. Additionally, costs increase when turnover leads \nto children's extended stays in foster care, as maintaining children in \nfoster care is more expensive than establishing permanency through \nreunification, adoption, or guardianship.\n  In addition to these obstacles, Federal support for training of child \nwelfare workers is restricted. Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, \nthe primary Federal source for child welfare training funds, is linked \nto an outdated income requirement. As a result, States may only access \nthese dollars on behalf of a portion of the children in their care. \nCurrently, Title IV-E funds may not be used to train child welfare \nstaff employed by contracted nonprofit child welfare agencies, a huge \nbarrier given the fact that many states rely on these agencies for \nproviding necessary services. The Title IV-E training program does not \naddress the essential role of non-child welfare professionals, such as \nsubstance abuse and domestic violence counselors, educators, and mental \nhealth providers, who work with children and families involved in the \nchild welfare system. We must improve States' access to these funds in \norder to attract and maintain a trained and committed child welfare \nworkforce.\n  Finally, Federal regulations limit the extent to which public child \nwelfare agencies can partner with educational institutions to provide \ntraining to prospective and currently employed child welfare staff. \nTraining programs implemented using Title IV-E university partnerships \nhave shown great success. States running such programs show up to 90 \npercent retention of graduates in child welfare positions, even after \ntheir employment obligation period has expired. Unfortunately, because \nregulations prohibit private institutions from providing the state \nmatch for IV-E funded university training programs, state child welfare \nagencies are limited in the university partnerships they can create. As \nsuch, regions that have ready and willing private schools of social \nwork, but few nearby public schools, are often unable to create these \nuseful programs.\n  The Child Welfare Workforce Improvement Act tackles these challenges \nhead on. This legislation calls on the National Academy of Sciences to \nconduct a study that assesses the child welfare workforce nationwide; \nmakes recommendations regarding appropriate levels of caseload, \nworkload, training, and supervision; and makes recommendations for \nlinking workforce data to data on child outcomes. The bill requires the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to devise a method for \nregularly collecting data on the child welfare workforce so that it can \nbe linked to existing databases of child outcomes.\n  Additionally, the bill amends Title IV-E so that federal funds for \ntraining can be accessed by the full breadth of professionals \nresponsible for children and families in the child welfare system. The \nlegislation eliminates the 1996 AFDC ``look-back'' for IV-E training \ndollars so that a state can access training funds based on all of its \nchildren in foster care. It removes limitations so that funds may be \nused to train staff who provide support, preservation, or reunification \nservices as well as foster care and adoption services. The bill allows \nrelated professionals access to short-term IV-E training in order to \nenhance their work with children and families in the child welfare \nsystem. Finally, the bill permits private nonprofit institutions of \nhigher education to contribute matching dollars for IV-E funded \ntraining programs. This provision will allow State child welfare \nsystems to set up university partnerships with a broader range of \nschools, thereby enhancing program quality, and helping to generate a \ncadre of professionally trained and committed child welfare workers.\n\n[[Page S3599]]\n\n  We absolutely must support the members of the child welfare workforce \nif we want high quality services for our Nation's vulnerable children \nand families. I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will join me in \nthis important effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN:\n  S. 2948. A bill to provide quality, affordable health insurance for \nsmall employers and individuals; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, earlier this week, I spoke on the Senate \nfloor about Cover the Uninsured Week and a bill I was introducing that \nwould increase access to health coverage for small businesses and self-\nemployed individuals.\n  I will formally introduce the Small Business Empowerment Act today, \nand I would like to discuss the bill in a bit more depth.\n  First, why is it necessary?\n  It is necessary because 82 percent of the uninsured are workers, and \nthe overwhelming majority work in small firms.\n  In Ohio, 99 percent of firms with more than 50 workers sponsor health \ncoverage. About 44 percent of firms with less than 50 do.\n  And small employers that do offer coverage are struggling under the \nweight of it. According to the well-respected Rand Corporation, small \nbusinesses saw the economic burden of health insurance rise by 30 \npercent between 2000 and 2005.\n  The situation is even worse for the self-employed, who must contend \nwith staggeringly high premiums for individual coverage, if, that is, \nthey can find an insurer willing to cover them.\n  In the meantime, health insurers have been living large, their \nprofits increasing by more than a third over the last 5 years. That's \nnot revenue, it's profits.\n  Middle class families are shouldering the burden of skyrocketing gas \nprices and ballooning food prices, even as the equity in their homes \nerodes and the cost of putting their children through college explodes.\n  It would be ideal if they could also afford to pay a king's ransom \nfor health insurance.\n  They can't. They shouldn't have to.\n  With those realities staring us in the face, inaction is the same as \nindifference.\n  My legislation attacks the issue of health coverage access from \nseveral directions.\n  To ensure widespread access, the bill would establish a national \ninsurance pool modeled after the successful Federal Employees Health \nBenefits program.\n  FEHB, which enables enrollees to choose from a variety of health \nplans whose rates and benefits are negotiated by the federal Office of \nPersonnel Management, has served members of Congress and federal \nemployees well for many years now.\n  Under my bill, an independent contractor would manage a program that \nlooks like FEHB, with a few modifications to accommodate the market \nsegment it would serve.\n  A few of those modifications are designed to hold down costs:\n  The bill would establish a reinsurance program to pay claims that \nfall between $5,000 and $75,000. This approach minimizes premium spikes \nand makes coverage affordable for companies regardless of the age and \nhealth of their employees.\n  The bill would also establish what is called a ``loss-ratio'' \nstandard for insurers. Basically this means that insurers would be \nrequired to spend most of their premium income on claims, and hold down \ntheir administrative costs.\n  And the bill would identify and apply strategies to ensure that \nproviders employ ``best practices'' in health care, which means that \nthey are providing the right care in the right amounts.\n  Finally, the bill would target ``price-gouging'' by drug \nmanufacturers and other manufacturers of medical products. Price \ngouging occurs in U.S. health care when a company exploits American \nconsumers by charging them dramatically higher prices than consumers in \nother wealthy nations.\n  Other modifications are designed to ensure that health coverage is \nnon-discriminatory.\n  Think about it: If you develop a mental illness like clinical \ndepression and I develop a medical illness like heart disease, why \nshould you be denied health benefits while I receive them? We both have \npaid premiums to cover health care costs and we both need health care. \nWhy is my condition more worthy of coverage than yours?\n  My bill charges a group representing providers, businesses, \nconsumers, economists, and health policy experts with rethinking health \ncare coverage to eliminate arbitrary differences in the coverage of \nequally disruptive, disabling, or dangerous health conditions.\n  The bottom-line is this. We have an opportunity to expand access to \nhealth coverage in a way that advances fundamental goals:\n  We can reach populations who can't find a home in the current \ninsurance system.\n  We stand up for American consumers who are paying ridiculous prices \nfor essential health care.\n  We can demand spending discipline on the part of insurers--they have \nchosen to play a pivotal role in the health of our nation; they can \nlive with reasonable limits on their administrative costs.\n  We can clean up duplication and random variation in the delivery of \nhealth care services; and we can end arbitrary coverage rules that turn \nhealth protection into a health care crapshoot.\n  For the sake of small employers and their employees, for the sake of \nself-employed entrepreneurs, and for the sake of every American who \ndidn't request a particular health problem and shouldn't be penalized \nfor having it, I hope Members on both sides of the aisle will support \nmy bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/30/senate-section/article/S3599-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3599-S3600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 542--DESIGNATING APRIL 2008 AS ``NATIONAL STD \n                           AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. REID (for Mrs. Clinton (for herself, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Feingold, \nand Mr. Lautenberg)) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 722, H.R. 5715.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5715) to ensure continued availability of \n     access to the Federal student loan program for students and \n     families.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with each passing day, families are \nconfronted with growing challenges stemming from our lagging economy. \nWe have had a surge of bad news, and there is almost certainly more to \ncome. People have done everything right. They have worked hard all \ntheir lives. They have been good citizens and they cared for their \ncommunities. Many have served in the military. They have bought homes \nin which to raise their families and have dutifully paid the mortgage \nevery month.\n  But now they are seeing everything they have worked for, everything \nthey have saved for and sacrificed for placed at risk. Families are \nstretched to the limit by stagnant wages and soaring prices. They have \nseen the value of their homes and retirement savings plunge. They \nwonder if they can afford to put gas in the tank in order to get to \nwork.\n  Now there is a danger that their children will be the next victims of \nthe economic crisis.\n  What started as a crisis in the housing market has spread to the \nbanks and beyond. We must draw a line there and not let the crisis in \nthe credit markets become a crisis for students struggling to pay for \ncollege and access to the American dream.\n  If we allow that to happen, we not only limit the horizon for a new \ngeneration of Americans, but we will damage the long-term economic \nhealth of America as well. More than ever, a college degree is the key \nto the door of opportunity for individual students. Sending more of our \nstudents to college is key to our international competitiveness in the \nglobal economy.\n  Yet students are facing new obstacles as they pay for their \neducation. The credit crisis in the mortgage market has rippled \nthroughout the lending industry and has begun to affect student loans.\n\n  The full scope of the problem isn't clear yet, but we cannot afford \nto wait for a full-blown crisis before we act. Students are applying \nnow for loans to cover the fall term. I am very pleased the Senate \nacted earlier today to ensure that the loans they need will be \navailable, and I look forward to prompt action by the House.\n  Already, almost 50 lenders have completely dropped out of the Federal \nprogram. Together, they make up almost 14 percent of the Federal \nstudent loan market. We need to make sure we have done everything we \ncan to protect students in case that downturn continues.\n  The first line of defense for students and families is the Direct \nLoan Program. It is insulated from the turbulence of the credit markets \nbecause the Federal Government provides the capital directly to \nstudents, without having to pay a bank or other middleman. I have urged \ncolleges across the country to sign up to participate in this program \nto protect them from any problems in the credit markets.\n  We need to take additional steps to shore up the alternative \nfederally subsidized loan program--the FFEL program--in the short term \nas an additional backstop against unacceptable disruptions in the \nfinancial aid process later this year.\n  The legislation the Senate passed today will protect students from \nthe problems in the credit markets by ensuring they will be able to \naccess federally subsidized loans.\n  First, Mr. President, it ensures that private lenders will continue \nto participate in the federally subsidized program by giving the \nSecretary of Education the authority to buy outstanding Federal loans \nin order to provide lenders with the capital needed to make new loans \nto students for the upcoming school year.\n  Second, as a backup for students who still have trouble obtaining a \nloan, the bill facilitates students' access to ``lender of last \nresort'' loans. These loans are provided to students through existing \nState-operated guaranty agencies, using capital advanced by the \nSecretary of Education.\n\n  Third, the bill assists students who rely on higher cost, non-\nfederally guaranteed loans by making additional low-cost Federal \noptions available to them and their families.\n  The bill raises Federal loan limits for undergraduate students by \n$2,000. This legislation also makes it easier for parents to take out \nlow-cost federally subsidized loans on behalf of their children through \nthe PLUS loan program. The bill ensures that parents affected by\n\n[[Page S3643]]\n\nthe current mortgage crisis can still obtain these loans, and it allows \nparents to delay repayment on these loans until after their child \ngraduates from school. This is very important--the fact that it would \ndelay repayment until after graduation. That is a major assistance to \nfamilies.\n  We are increasing the amount that will be available at the lower \nrates to college students, and we are extending the period of time that \nwill help the families in terms of the repayment schedule.\n  Finally, this bill helps students decrease student loan debt levels \nby expanding access to an existing grant program, the Academic \nCompetitiveness Grants. Under this bill, an additional 100,000 students \ncan receive up to $4,000 more a year in grant aid.\n  We need to get these safety nets in place now before we are hit with \na problem that is beyond our control. College affordability should not \nbe determined by the quarterly profits or losses of the banks.\n  The student aid system is not about banks' bottom lines. As the cost \nof college has tripled over the past 20 years, the Federal student aid \nsystem of grants and loans has made the dream of college a reality for \nmillions of students who could not otherwise afford it.\n  In 1993, less than half of all graduates had to take out college \nloans, but in 2004 nearly two-thirds had to borrow to finance their \neducation. This chart reflects that. This chart reflects the students \ntaking out the loans in 1993. Here it reflects those who took out loans \nfor 2004. Years ago, when we passed the student loan program--back in \n1965--these were effectively all grant programs; about 80 percent are \ngrants, and only 20 percent are loans. We have seen this dramatic shift \nover the period of recent years now to the loan program. That has all \nkinds of implications in terms of indebtedness to students. Too often \nmany of the students are now working one or two jobs, and they are also \ntrying to pay off their debts in the future years. This has a very \nimportant adverse impact in terms of students and their ability to \npursue careers, the careers that are lower paying, but so critical to \nour society, such as teaching, public health or social work.\n  In the 2004-2005 school year in Massachusetts, 86 percent of students \nrelied on Federal student loans. The average debt of these students was \nover $18,000. So the best way to help students and families afford \ncollege is to increase the grant aid. More aid up front means fewer \nloans and less debt on graduation day. That is why Congress acted last \nyear on our promise to raise the maximum Pell grant to $5,400 by 2012, \nan increase of $1,350 under the level at which it stagnated under this \nAdministration. As a result, students eligible for the maximum Pell \ngrant will have to borrow $6,000 less in loans over the course of their \ncollege career.\n  That is a very important relief to those families. The legislation we \nenacted last year also made Federal loans less costly for students by \ncutting the interest rates in half for undergraduates. In addition, we \nhelped students manage debt by capping monthly loan payments at 15 \npercent of their income. If they go into public service, their loans \nwould be completely forgiven as long as they stay in public service for \na period of years. All of these benefits would be meaningless if \nstudents cannot obtain the loans they need to pay for college.\n  So I thank my Senate colleagues for supporting this legislation, and \nI urge our colleagues in the House of Representatives, and the \nPresident, to act quickly so our Nation's college students don't become \nthe next victims of our slumping economy. Together we can ensure that \nthe students get the assistance they need to go to school so their \ndreams don't turn into nightmares, caused by the volatilities of our \ncredit markets.\n  Mr. President, I am very grateful to my colleague and friend, Senator \nEnzi, the ranking Republican member, and the members of our Education \nCommittee for their help and assistance during this period of time. We \nhave had hearings on this legislation. We also had field hearings on \nthis subject matter and gained a good deal of information. We have \nworked very closely with the Administration, with Secretary Spellings. \nWe are grateful to her for her involvement and help and assistance. We \nworked very closely with the House, with both Chairman Miller and Mr. \nMcKeon, the ranking minority member as well.\n  In the Senate, we have followed a longstanding tradition of trying to \nwork and find common ground in education policy to benefit students. I \nthink we have done a good job on that over a period of years.\n  This legislation, which is basically the stopgap legislation meant to \ndeal with the challenges we are facing in the credit markets and that \nstudents will face in the credit markets, will respond to that need. We \nare on alert for any additional changes that are going to be necessary \nas we move along.\n  We are going to be monitoring this very closely in the days and weeks \nahead, and we welcome ideas and suggestions and recommendations from \nstudents and from parents, as well as from all others, about how we can \nbest ensure that we will be able to make sure that the a college \neducation is going to be available to the young people in this country.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the importance of the \nEnsuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008. In a time when \nthere is great concern about turmoil in our credit markets, the action \nwe are taking today addresses an important segment of those markets. \nWhat began as a problem within the mortgage market has threatened to \ndisrupt the market that students and their parents rely on to obtain \nstudent loans. This bill is a necessary step to providing students \naccess to the loans they need for college this fall.\n  While not perfect, this bill will go a long way toward restoring the \nconfidence needed for the student loan market to work. And this is \nbeing accomplished at no cost to the Government.\n  The Secretary of Education can now take actions that will increase \nloan limits for students and provide parents with greater access to \nfederally guaranteed loans. Both provisions will decrease reliance on \nprivate loans which cost more and are becoming less available.\n  This bill demonstrates our commitment to maintaining the availability \nof loans through the Federal Family Education Loan, FFEL, program as \nwell as the Federal Direct Loan program. Currently FFEL serves 80 \npercent of postsecondary students who take out student loans, while the \nFederal Direct Loan program serves 20 percent. Both loan programs must \nremain strong.\n  With the passage of this bill, we create the means to stabilize the \ncollege loan market in the coming months. However, I realize that this \nis a short-term solution. We must preserve the long-term viability of \nthe FFEL program for the students and parents who rely on it to achieve \ntheir educational goals.\n  Additionally, in this bill we have increased grant support for Pell-\neligible students who take rigorous high school courses and major in \nscience, technology, engineering, math and critical foreign languages. \nAt a time when our economy needs more individuals with knowledge and \nskills in these areas, this bill provides low-income college students \nwith the means to be successful in these high-need, high-reward fields.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to work with Senator Kennedy on this \nbill to help students. However, the job is not yet done. We need to \nfinish our work on the comprehensive reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act as a lot has changed since it was reauthorized 10 years \nago. It is a much more competitive world today. We need a stronger, \nmore relevant system of higher education in this country to compete and \nwin in the global economy.\n  Last July we passed the Senate bill by a vote of 95-0. We are now \nworking with the House to get an agreement to the President before \nMemorial Day. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Kennedy \nto get the best bill possible for students and their families.\n  As we finish our work on the reauthorization of the Higher Education \nAct, we will continue to monitor the bill we passed today and its \nimpact on the availability of student loans to ensure that it \naccomplishes what we intended. Our students are our future and we have \nto make sure that we provide them with every opportunity to be \nsuccessful.\n\n[[Page S3644]]\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I strongly support passage of H.R. 5715, the \nEnsuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act.\n  As an original cosponsor of the Senate companion of this legislation, \nI am pleased that this bipartisan bill seeks to proactively address the \nimpact of the credit crunch on the student loan market, and ensure that \nstudents attending college this fall have sustained, uninterrupted \naccess to affordable Federal grant and loan aid.\n  In an effort to increase college access and affordability, last fall \nCongress passed the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, to provide \nover $20 billion in new student financial aid. I was glad to help write \nthis law. It increased the maximum Pell Grant by nearly $500 this year \nand to $5,400 by 2012, providing Rhode Island students with $7.8 \nmillion in additional grant aid this year and nearly $85 million over \nthe next 5 years. To help students and families borrowing for college, \nthis law also cut the interest rate on Federal loans in half for \nundergraduate students over 4 years; capped monthly payments on Federal \nstudent loans at 15 percent of a borrower's discretionary income; and \nencouraged public service by forgiving loan debt for those like nurses, \nteachers, and librarians after 10 years.\n  However, the current instability of the credit markets has raised \nconcern in my home State of Rhode Island and across the country \nregarding the availability this spring of Federal loans and how parents \nwill be able to pay tuition for their sons and daughters to attend \ncollege in the fall. Although we have not heard of a single student or \nparent unable to receive a Federal loan yet, the busy time of year for \nborrowing has only just begun as most student loan applications are not \ndue until the beginning of May. Additionally, we know that over 50 \nlenders nationwide have stopped offering federally subsidized loans.\n  As such, this bill takes important initial steps to ensuring that \nstudents and their families have the necessary financial means to \nattend and succeed in college. It provides additional grant aid \nopportunities for low-income students to reduce their reliance on \nstudent loans by directing savings generated by the bill into increased \nAcademic Competitiveness and National SMART Grants. These two grant \nprograms provided nearly 2,100 Rhode Island students with over $2.2 \nmillion in additional grant aid in 2006-07. It also reduces student \nreliance on costlier private loans by expanding the amount a student \nmay borrow through a modest raise in the Federal Stafford loan limits. \nThe bill also improves the availability of lower-interest federally \nsubsidized PLUS loans for parent borrowers by providing an option to \ndefer repayment of these loans until after their child graduates \ncollege, and ensuring that parents recently impacted by the downturn in \nthe housing market can continue to qualify for these loans.\n  The bill also takes a number of actions to provide an overall Federal \nbackstop so students do not have to borrow higher cost private loans. \nFirst, to ensure lenders have the necessary capital to make new Federal \nloans, the bill gives temporary authority to the Department of \nEducation to act as a secondary market for loans originated in the \nfederally subsidized student loan market. It also eases the process by \nwhich a guaranty agency or institution may be deemed eligible as a \nlender of last resort, ensuring the further availability of Federal \nstudent loans. And the direct loan program is on stand-by for \ninstitutions concerned that their students may experience difficulty \nfinding a Federal loan this year. Direct loans are directly originated \nby the Federal Government and as such, not subject to credit market \ninstability and fluctuation.\n  I thank Senators Kennedy and Enzi, and their staffs, for their work \nand leadership on this bill. I will continue to very closely monitor \nthis situation and explore any additional necessary options in the \ncoming weeks to ensure that the credit crunch does not prevent \ndeserving students from attending college.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Kennedy-\nEnzi amendment at the desk be agreed to, the bill as amended be read a \nthird time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid on the table \nwith no intervening action or debate, and any statements relating to \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

McCAIN, III CITIZENSHIP\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 715, S. Res 511.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 511) recognizing that John Sidney \n     McCain, III, is a natural born citizen.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we are considering a bipartisan \nresolution to express the common sense of all in this Chamber that \nSenator McCain is a ``natural born Citizen,'' as the term is used in \nthe Constitution of the United States. Last week the Judiciary \nCommittee voted unanimously to report this resolution to the Senate. I \nurge Senators to come together to pass this bipartisan resolution \nwithout delay.\n  Our Constitution contains three requirements for a person to be \neligible to be President--the person must have reached the age of 35; \nmust have resided in America for 14 years; and must be a ``natural born \nCitizen'' of the United States. Certainly there is no doubt that \nSenator McCain is of sufficient years on this Earth and in this country \ngiven that he has been serving in Washington for over 25 years. \n``However, some have raised the question whether he is a ``natural born \nCitizen'' because he was born outside of the United States.\n  John Sidney McCain, III, was born to American citizens on an American \nNaval base in the Panama Canal Zone in 1936. His father was serving in \nthe Navy at that time.\n  It is possible that at the time of our Nation's founding, the Framers \nof our Constitution could not imagine how pronounced our commitments \noverseas would become but it would make no sense to limit the careers \nof children born to military families simply because they were \nstationed overseas. Similarly, it would not make sense to punish \nchildren born to foreign service families or Ambassadors stationed \noverseas or children born overseas to American missionaries. They are \nall American citizens at the time of their birth.\n  Numerous legal scholars have looked into the purpose and intent of \nthe ``natural born Citizen'' requirement. As far as I am aware, no one \nhas discovered any reason to think that the Framers would have wanted \nto limit the rights of children born to Americans abroad or that such a \nlimited view would serve any noble purpose enshrined in our founding \ndocument. Based on the understanding of the pertinent sources of \nconstitutional meaning, it is widely believed that if someone is born \nto American citizens anywhere in the world they are natural born \ncitizens.\n  It is interesting to note that another previous Presidential \ncandidate, George Romney, was also born outside of the United States. \nHe was widely understood to be eligible to be President. Senator Barry \nGoldwater was born in a U.S territory that later became the State of \nArizona. Certainly those who voted for these two Republican candidates \nbelieved that they were eligible to assume the office of the President.\n  Because he was born to American citizens, there is no doubt in my \nmind that Senator McCain is a ``natural born Citizen''. I recently \nasked Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, a former Federal \njudge, if he had any doubts in his mind. He did not.\n  Former Solicitor General Theodore Olson and Harvard Law School \nProfessor Laurence Tribe also analyzed the issue and came to the same \nconclusion--that Senator McCain is a natural born citizen eligible to \nserve as President.\n  Our bipartisan resolution would make it clear that Senator McCain, \nborn in 1936 on an American Naval base to U.S. citizens, is a ``natural \nborn Citizen. We should act today on a bipartisan basis to erase any \ndoubt that Senator McCain is eligible to run for President because of \nhis citizenship status.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the legal analysis of Theodore Olson and \nLaurence Tribe be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 2008.\n     Re legal analysis of question whether Senator John McCain is \n         a natural born citizen eligible to hold the office of \n         President.\n     Hon.

Professor Tribe and I are in agreement that the \n     circumstances of Senator McCain's birth to American parents \n     in the Panama Canal Zone make him a natural-born citizen \n     within the meaning of the Constitution.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further \n     assistance in this matter.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Theodore B.

Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Pursuant to a request received from \n     Democratic Committee staff, I enclose for your consideration \n     a copy of my and Professor Laurence Tribe's analysis of the \n     question whether Senator John McCain is a ``natural born \n     citizen'' eligible, under Article II of the Constitution, to \n     hold the office of President of the United States. Professor \n     Tribe and I are in agreement that the circumstances of \n     Senator McCain's birth to American parents in the Panama \n     Canal Zone make him a natural born citizen within the meaning \n     of the Constitution.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further \n     assistance in this matter.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Theodore B. Olson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 19, 2008.\n       We have analyzed whether Senator John McCain is eligible \n     for the U.S. Presidency, in light of the requirement under \n     Article II of the U.S. Constitution that only ``natural born \n     Citizen[s] . . . shall be eligible to the Office of \n     President.'' U.S. Const. art. II, Sec. 1, cl. 5. We conclude \n     that Senator McCain is a ``natural born Citizen'' by virtue \n     of his birth in 1936 to U.S. citizen parents who were serving \n     their country on a U.S. military base in the Panama Canal \n     Zone. The circumstances of Senator McCain's birth satisfy the \n     original meaning and intent of the Natural Born Citizen \n     Clause, as confirmed by subsequent legal precedent and \n     historical practice.\n       The Constitution does not define the meaning of ``natural \n     born Citizen.'' The U.S. Supreme Court gives meaning to terms \n     that are not expressly defined in the Constitution by looking \n     to the context in which those terms are used; to statutes \n     enacted by the First Congress, Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. \n     783, 790-91 (1983); and to the common law at the time of the \n     Founding. United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649, 655 \n     (1898). These sources all confirm that the phrase ``natural \n     born'' includes both birth abroad to parents who were \n     citizens, and birth within a nation's territory and \n     allegiance. Thus, regardless of the sovereign status of the \n     Panama Canal Zone at the time of Senator McCain's birth, he \n     is a ``natural born'' citizen because he was born to parents \n     who were U.S. citizens.\n       Congress has recognized in successive federal statutes \n     since the Nation's Founding that children born abroad to U.S. \n     citizens are themselves U.S. citizens. 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1401(c); \n     see also Act of May 24, 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-250, Sec. 1, 48 \n     Stat. 797, 797. Indeed, the statute that the First Congress \n     enacted on this subject not only established that such \n     children are U.S. citizens, but also expressly referred to \n     them as ``natural born citizens.'' Act of Mar. 26, 1790, ch. \n     3, Sec. 1, 1 Stat. 103, 104.\n       Senator McCain's status as a ``natural born'' citizen by \n     virtue of his birth to U.S. citizen parents is consistent \n     with British statutes in force when the Constitution was \n     drafted, which undoubtedly informed the Framers' \n     understanding of the Natural Born Citizen Clause. Those \n     statutes provided, for example, that children born abroad to \n     parents who were ``natural-born Subjects'' were also \n     ``natural-born Subjects . . . to all Intents, Constructions \n     and Purposes whatsoever.'' British Nationality Act, 1730, 4 \n     Geol. 2, c. 21. The Framers substituted the word ``citizen'' \n     for ``subject'' to reflect the shift from monarchy to \n     democracy, but the Supreme Court has recognized that the two \n     terms are otherwise identical. See, e.g., Hennessy v. \n     Richardson Drug Co., 189 U.S. 25, 34-35 (1903). Thus, the \n     First Congress's statutory recognition that persons born \n     abroad to U.S. citizens were ``natural born'' citizens fully \n     conformed to British tradition, whereby citizenship conferred \n     by statute based on the circumstances of one's birth made one \n     natural born.\n       There is a second and independent basis for concluding that \n     Senator McCain is a ``natural born'' citizen within the \n     meaning of the Constitution. If the Panama Canal Zone was \n     sovereign U.S. territory at the time of Senator McCain's \n     birth, then that fact alone\n\n[[Page S3646]]\n\n     would make him a ``natural born'' citizen under the well-\n     established principle that ``natural born'' citizenship \n     includes birth within the territory and allegiance of the \n     United States. See, e.g., Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 655-66. \n     The Fourteenth Amendment expressly enshrines this connection \n     between birthplace and citizenship in the text of the \n     Constitution. U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Sec. 1 (``All persons \n     born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the \n     jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States. * * \n     * '') (emphases added). Premising ``natural born'' \n     citizenship on the character of the territory in which one \n     is born is rooted in the common-law understanding that \n     persons born within the British kingdom and under loyalty \n     to the British Crown--including most of the Framers \n     themselves, who were born in the American colonies--were \n     deemed ``natural born subjects.'' See, e.g., 1 William \n     Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 354 (Legal \n     Classics Library 1983) (1765) (``Natural-born subjects are \n     such as are born within the dominions of the crown of \n     England, that is, within the ligeance, or as it is \n     generally called, the allegiance of the king.* * * '').\n       There is substantial legal support for the proposition that \n     the Panama Canal Zone was indeed sovereign U.S. territory \n     when Senator McCain was born there in 1936. The U.S. Supreme \n     Court has explained that, ``[f]rom 1904 to 1979, the United \n     States exercised sovereignty over the Panama Canal and the \n     surrounding 10-mile-wide Panama Canal Zone.'' 0'Connor v. \n     United States, 479 U.S. 27, 28 (1986). Congress and the \n     executive branch similarly suggested that the Canal Zone was \n     subject to the sovereignty of the United States. See, e.g., \n     The President--Government of the Canal Zone, 26 Op. Att'y \n     Gen. 113, 116 (1907) (recognizing that the 1904 treaty \n     between the United States and Panama ``imposed upon the \n     United States the obligations as well as the powers of a \n     sovereign within the [Canal Zone]''); Panama Canal Act of \n     1912, Pub. L. No. 62-337, Sec. 1, 37 Stat. 560, 560 \n     (recognizing that ``the use, occupancy, or control'' of the \n     Canal Zone had been ``granted to the United States by the \n     treaty between the United States and the Republic of \n     Panama''). Thus, although Senator McCain was not born within \n     a State, there is a significant body of legal authority \n     indicating that he was nevertheless born within the sovereign \n     territory of the United States.\n       Historical practice confirms that birth on soil that is \n     under the sovereignty of the United States, but not within a \n     State, satisfies the Natural Born Citizen Clause. For \n     example, Vice President Charles Curtis was born in the \n     territory of Kansas on January 25, 1860--one year before \n     Kansas became a State. Because the Twelfth Amendment requires \n     that Vice Presidents possess the same qualifications as \n     Presidents, the service of Vice President Curtis verifies \n     that the phrase ``natural born Citizen'' includes birth \n     outside of any State but within U.S. territory. Similarly, \n     Senator Barry Goldwater was born in Arizona before its \n     statehood, yet attained the Republican Party's presidential \n     nomination in 1964. And Senator Barack Obama was born in \n     Hawaii on August 4, 1961--not long after its admission to the \n     Union on August 21, 1959. We find it inconceivable that \n     Senator Obama would have been ineligible for the Presidency \n     had he been born two years earlier.\n       Senator McCain's candidacy for the Presidency is consistent \n     not only with the accepted meaning of ``natural born \n     Citizen,'' but also with the Framers' intentions when \n     adopting that language. The Natural Born Citizen Clause was \n     added to the Constitution shortly after John Jay sent a \n     letter to George Washington expressing concern about \n     ``Foreigners'' attaining the position of Commander in Chief. \n     3 Max Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, \n     at 61 (1911). It goes without saying that the Framers did not \n     intend to exclude a person from the office of the President \n     simply because he or she was born to U.S. citizens serving in \n     the U.S. military outside of the continental United States; \n     Senator McCain is certainly not the hypothetical \n     ``Foreigner'' who John Jay and George Washington were \n     concerned might usurp the role of Commander in Chief.\n       Therefore, based on the original meaning of the \n     Constitution, the Framers' intentions, and subsequent legal \n     and historical precedent, Senator McCain's birth to parents \n     who were U.S. citizens, serving on a U.S. military base in \n     the Panama Canal Zone in 1936, makes him a ``natural born \n     Citizen'' within the meaning of the Constitution.\n                                                Laurence H. Tribe.\n                                                Theodore B. Olson.\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, as we close tonight, I want everyone within \nthe sound of my voice to understand this: We are working on a very \nimportant piece of legislation, the reauthorization of the Federal \nAviation Administration--the agency responsible for making sure \naircraft is safe and reliable.\n  Right now, we have an antiquated system. This legislation will do \nwhat has been needed for a long time to change the way we do aviation \nin this country. All the experts say it is long past due. We have had \nhard work for a\n\n[[Page S3647]]\n\nlong period of time. This bill is way overdue. Senator Rockefeller has \nworked very hard in bringing the product to the floor. It is a good \nproduct.\n  We had an issue today that came up, and Senator Rockefeller offered \nan amendment which takes away that as an issue. My friends, the \nRepublicans, obviously, want to kill this bill to add to the other list \nthey have sent to the graveyard. They are using an excuse: Well, we \ndon't have the ability to offer amendments.\n  Mr. President, I have offered them anything possible to make sure \nthey can offer all the amendments they want. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas, Mrs. Kay Bailey Hutchison, obviously does not like some of \nthe tax portions of this bill. Offer an amendment to try to take them \nout. I have offered the Republican leader: Give us a list of the \namendments you want to offer. This is very standard procedure around \nhere. No response to that.\n  It is very obvious to me this is an effort to kill this bill. Let's \nbe logical. We are on the floor. I have said: Any amendments you want \nto offer that are germane or relevant to this bill, you can do that. \nNow, that is very wide. It allows anything that relates basically to \ntransportation to be offered on this bill. But they have turned that \ndown.\n  They have broken all records for filibuster--they, the Republicans. \nOn this one, on the motion to proceed, I said on the floor earlier this \nweek, this was not their fault. We did not have the substitute Senators \nRockefeller and Baucus had worked on. It was not ready until Monday \nnight. But it was ready Tuesday morning, and they had every opportunity \nto work at that time and give us a list of amendments they wanted to \ndo. We would give them ours.\n  I was told today, when the Durbin amendment was filed, that they \nwanted to offer the next amendment. They wanted to offer it from \nSenator Bunning. No problem. We have been waiting all day for the \nlanguage of that amendment, which is probably nonexistent.\n  We have been fair. We have been reasonable. But, obviously, we are \nnow at a point where they are back to their old tricks and just killing \nthe bill. They should just tell us this rather than play the games. \nThey should say: We do not want this bill.\n  I have spoken to the Republican leader saying: If we really want to \nget this bill done, why don't I file cloture then, because no one seems \nto be wanting to offer any amendments. He said: No, it's too early. You \nhave not allowed us to offer any amendments. I say: Offer amendments.\n  So this is really, Mr. President, a typical procedure around here, \nthat the minority, wanting to maintain the status quo with air travel, \nas everything else, puts us in a position where we have no alternative \nbut to either pull the bill or file cloture, and they said they will \nnot give us the extra nine votes we need.\n  Remember, Mr. President, this bill has, for example, the Passenger \nBill of Rights in it so that when people are held up on a flight--you \nare on a runway for hours at a time--there are certain rights \npassengers have. All those things that cause so much consternation when \nyou are trying to travel on an airplane--the Passenger Bill of Rights \naddresses many of those. But with Republicans that will go down the \ntubes with everything else in this bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I know the Senator and I spoke earlier, \nand I heard his conversation on the floor earlier.\n  I would say, through the Chair, if the Republican minority came \nforward, in the morning, with a list of germane amendments to this \nbill, it is my understanding the majority leader has said we will \nentertain and consider those amendments. This is open for an amendment \nprocess, for deliberation, and for votes on this important aviation \nsafety bill. Is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I even went one step further. I said the \ndistinguished Republican leader would have the right to look at our \namendments. It would not be just me; I want him in on the deal.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I can further ask the majority leader: \nThe Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison--who has put a lot of time in \nthis, along with Senator Rockefeller--has objected to two or three \nprovisions in the bill from the Finance Committee related to \ntransportation and financing. I have said I support those provisions. \nBut if the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, wants to offer a motion \nin the morning to strike those provisions, is the majority leader \nsaying--I ask through the Chair--is the majority leader saying it is \nher right to offer that motion to strike?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Illinois, I asked \nour staff: When we close today, let's not have morning business. Let's \ngo directly to the bill. But we found that was fruitless. They did not \nwant us to go to the bill. I have said so many different times, in so \nmany different ways, that we want to finish this legislation. We want \nto work with Republicans to finish this legislation.\n  And I say to my friend, the Senator from Texas, it is my \nunderstanding, has asked other people: Why don't you offer the \namendment to strike all this stuff? For whatever reason, she does not \nwant to have her fingerprints on eliminating this amendment, obviously. \nI just think it is really too bad.\n  I want this bill to go forward. The main thing I want is to make sure \neveryone understands we Democrats want to change things. We want \nchange. We need change in a lot of different places, but one place we \nneed change is the way air traffic is handled today. And the \nRepublicans, obviously, want it to stay the same; let's keep it the \nsame; let's maintain the status quo.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I could ask the majority leader to \nyield for one other question.\n  It is my understanding, so far in this session, the Republicans have \ninitiated 68 filibusters, which is an attempt to slow down or stop the \nbusiness of the Senate. But that breaks all records in the Senate, and \nthey are on course, if they continue at this pace, to offer over 100 \nfilibusters before the end of the year, maybe even more.\n  I would like to ask the majority leader, if they continue trying to \nstop us from even bringing bills to the floor, debating them, amending \nthem, and bringing them to a vote--I would like to ask the majority \nleader how we could reach a point where we actually do change things \nfor the better, where we can see the progress that the American people \nexpect.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are things we need to do. The No. 1 \nissue in America today: gas prices. We cannot go to gas prices because \nwe are stuck on this thing that they will not let us move on, and that \nis the way it has been going since we took the majority. That is \nsomething they have had trouble getting over, that we are in the \nmajority. It is a slim majority, but it is the majority, and because of \nthat, we have the opportunity to determine what issues come to the \nfloor. The issue that was long past due was FAA reauthorization. But \nthey are stopping us from doing virtually anything that needs to be \ndone for this country.\n  I have trouble understanding why they want to continue to up the \nrecord they have already broken. They broke the 2-year filibuster \nrecord in 10 months. But now I guess they want to keep adding to their \nrecord to see how many filibusters they can conduct. And they have been \nfairly successful stopping us from passing things that the American \npeople want, such as the matter now on the floor. But energy \nlegislation--they stopped us on that. That is to go to alternative \nenergy so we do not have to use 21 million barrels of oil every day. We \nhave wanted to do things dealing with education. We have not been able \nto do that. Health care, we haven't been able to do that. Things that \nthe American people want are being stopped because of the Republicans' \nlove of the status quo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/30/senate-section/article/S3647-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
