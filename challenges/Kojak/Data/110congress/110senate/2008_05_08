Mr. President, reading the morning papers, we learned \na couple of key points about the energy proposal introduced yesterday \nby our\n\n[[Page S3936]]\n\nfriends on the other side. The most important point is that two central \nprovisions of the bill are opposed by two of their own chairmen. In \nthis morning's Albuquerque Journal, we learned that the Democratic \nchairman of the Senate Energy Committee does not like the so-called \nwindfall profit tax. He called it ``arbitrary.''\n  Now, we know this is a bad idea that does not work. The last time a \nwindfall profits tax was tried in the 1980s, it reduced domestic \nproduction and actually increased our reliance on foreign oil, just the \nopposite of a rational policy to reduce gas prices to make America more \nenergy independent.\n  In the Wall Street Journal, we learned that the senior Senator from \nNew York, the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, is raising the \nalarm about another central tenet of the Democratic energy proposal, \nthe energy futures trading provision. The Journal reports the chairman \nis saying the energy futures trading provisions, as written, would send \nthe bulk of the trading that is now done in America, and thus American \njobs, to markets overseas.\n  I agree with both of these chairmen. Two years have passed since \nCongressional Democrats said they had a ``commonsense plan'' to address \nhigh gas prices. This week Senate Democrats finally unveiled that plan, \nand their own chairmen do not seem to like parts of it. It is \npredictably high on taxes, more bureaucracy, and continued dependence \non OPEC.\n  Their proposal would do nothing to lower the price of gas. It will \nonly serve to further reduce domestic supplies and increase our \ndependency on foreign oil at a time when we are trying to make America \nmore, not less, energy independent.\n  Republicans believe we should increase our supply of American energy \nto bring gas prices down and to create American jobs. Apparently our \nfriends across the aisle believe we should continue to ask OPEC to \nincrease its supply, while opposing additional production of American \nenergy.\n  We will have an opportunity to vote on Monday on the proposal that \nthe majority of Members on my side think would make an actual \ndifference in the coming years. It is a fundamental difference of \nopinion. We can either proactively increase our domestic production or \nwe can place greater dependence on foreign suppliers and further delay \nenergy independence. Given the choice, I would rather produce more \nAmerican energy and create more American jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to respond in \nleader time in the absence of Senator Reid.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Senator Reid could not be here this \nmorning and asked me to come to the floor if a response was necessary, \nand a response is necessary.\n  There are two fundamentally different approaches when it comes to \nAmerica's energy futures between the Democratic side and the Republican \nside. The Democratic side believes that first we have to do everything \nwe can to protect consumers of America from price gouging. We know what \nis happening. We cannot go to Illinois, Arkansas, Kentucky, or Colorado \nand not run into people saying we cannot understand why gasoline prices \nare so high. We know the price of a barrel of oil has gone up to record \nhigh levels because of price manipulation by the Saudis, OPEC, and \nother countries, and the Republican approach to this totally ignores \nit. We know the oil companies across the United States last week \nreported record profits in the first quarter of this year. Since \nPresident Bush came to office, the profits of the oil companies have \nmore than quadrupled and the price of gasoline has more than doubled.\n  Does the Republican approach even address this? The answer is no. We \nhave, in the Democratic approach, a windfall profits tax, which says to \nthese oil companies: There is a limit beyond which you cannot go in \ngouging consumers and overcharging them for your products. As airlines \nare faced with bankruptcy, as truckers cannot afford to fill their rigs \non the highways, as the cost of energy is passed on to us as higher \nfood prices and the like, it is absolutely unconscionable that the oil \ncompanies continue to show record profits quarter after quarter, year \nafter year, at the expense of our economy.\n  The Democratic approach deals with that. We go to the fundamentals. \nThe windfall profits tax says to the oil companies: There is a limit to \nwhat you can take. Beyond that, the Government is going to tax you and \nmake it clear to you that raising prices is not the answer.\n  Second, we are going to stop putting more oil at high prices into the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. If there ever was a time we should not be \ntaking oil off the market, this is that time. We also provide in our \nbill for going after this OPEC coalition, the price collusion that is \ngoing on at the expense of the American economy.\n  We deal with price gouging to make sure the companies that engage in \nit know they are going to pay a heavy price for that kind of conduct. \nAnd we go after speculation, if it is excessive, to try to make sure we \nfuel any fires of speculation that might be adding to the cost of \nenergy.\n  What do the Republicans offer in return? Drilling, drilling, \ndrilling. They do not understand one fundamental fact: The United \nStates has within its grasp, in our territory and territory we control, \nonly 3 percent of the world's supply of oil--3 percent. Each year, we \nconsume 25 percent or more of oil produced. We cannot drill our way out \nof this situation.\n  We have to stop price gouging on consumers. We have to hold oil \ncompanies accountable, and I think the Republican approach does \nneither. I am looking forward to this debate. I assume that by early \nnext week we will have a vote and the American people will see where we \nstand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/08/senate-section/article/S3936-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WELCOMING THE GUEST CHAPLAIN\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, let me respond, firstly, if I can, to the \nassistant majority leader. First, it is easy to point the finger at oil \ncompanies. That is the easiest ``out,'' because everyone has this \nperception that all oil companies are doing great.\n\n[[Page S3937]]\n\n  Here is the problem you have. If you were to take all profits from \noil companies--let's forget about windfall profits; take it all, do not \nleave any at all for anything else, other than what they are putting \ninto exploration--it would amount to 28 cents a gallon.\n  If you slashed their profits in half, as they are proposing to do, \nthat would be 14 cents. Fourteen cents does not help a lot, at least my \nwife says it does not. And I think you know we are kidding ourselves. \nThere are solutions to this problem, but that is not one of them.\n  Then as far as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we are putting about \n50,000 barrels per day in there right now. If we were to halt that, \nover the course of a year it would equal less than one day of U.S. \nconsumption. That is not what I call a fix. Fourteen cents a gallon is \nnot a fix, one day of time is not a fix.\n  But there are some things we can do. We do have an amendment, \namendment No. 4720. It is by our leader, Senator McConnell, and by \nSenator Domenici. This actually was a bill. It was going to be the \nDomestic Energy Production Act of 2008, but we are offering it now as \nan amendment. This would handle a lot of the problems. First, if we had \nall of the production out there that we needed to take care of \nAmerica's needs, we still could not do anything, because we do not have \nthe refining capacity. Two years ago I introduced the Gas Price Act. I \ncould not believe it went down right on party lines. The Democrats flat \ndo not want to increase our refining capacity. This happened in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. It was actually a pretty smart \napproach to it. We were taking a lot of the closed bases and using them \nand allowing EDA grants to take place so that adjoining communities \ncould turn those into refineries, and also streamlining the process and \nall of that.\n  Well, it went right down on party lines. So this amendment we are \ngoing to be talking about is one that will do something about the \nrefinery capacity. The one we introduced, the amendment, streamlines \nthe permitting process so there would be a maximum on any new refinery \nof 360 days on a new refinery or an expansion of 180 days.\n  We have not increased our refining capacity. We have not had a new \nrefinery in 30 years. Other countries are doing it. China is doing it. \nMexico is doing it. But we are not. So that is the first thing we need \nto do, increase refining capacity.\n  Secondly, everybody hold on, because this is something I know is very \nforeign to our thinking nowadays, it is an old concept called supply \nand demand. We have a lot of demand for gas out there. We know that. We \nknow when we go to the pump. The problem is the supply. I hate to say \nit. Is there a chance? I am kind of excited that the public now has the \nattention of the high prices and realizes we are going to have to do \nsomething besides the gimmicks the assistant majority leader talked \nabout. That would be to increase our drilling capacity. We could do it \non ANWR. People talk about the fact that this is pristine wilderness. \nFirst of all, I challenge anyone to look at this area. It is not a \npristine wilderness. The main thing is, if you take that little area \nthat we have, with huge reserves, we have been trying to do something \nwith it. It compares as a postage stamp does to a football field. It is \nsuch a small amount. All the Natives there want it. All the Alaskans \nwant it. It is their land. That would be the first thing we should do \nto increase our capacity.\n  We tried this. We passed this 10 years ago. Then President Bill \nClinton vetoed it. If he had not, that would be flowing today. All the \npeople who are complaining about that are the same ones who complained \nabout the Alaska pipeline. They said it was going to kill all the \ncaribou. Go up there now during the summer months, and they have \nincreased the number of caribou up there primarily because in some \nparts of Alaska, the only shade they can find is the Alaskan pipeline. \nThey are all lined up there. So it is not a problem.\n  The other major area of production potential would be to go offshore. \nIt is interesting. One of the things in this amendment is to allow \nStates to determine what they want to happen offshore. It is \ninteresting, some of the States, such as Virginia, south of where we \nare standing right now, very much wants to. I have talked to Senator \nWarner. They are talking about allowing production offshore. Several \nother States have wanted to do that. It is a wake-up call we have right \nnow that we are going to have to do some of these things. It is \ninteresting that Canada allows offshore drilling in the Pacific, the \nAtlantic, and the Great Lakes. Cuba is also looking to expand drilling, \nwhich could occur 45 miles off parts of Florida. If this happened, they \nwould be doing it with technology that is much less environmentally \nfriendly than we have right now. So we have the possibility the Cubans \nare going to be doing something without any emission controls, without \nany environmental precautions, and we would be allowing it.\n  Another part of this amendment is to repeal section 526. This is \nsomething that should not have been in before. This was actually put in \nin the Energy bill that was passed in December of 2007. Section 526 \nprohibits Federal agencies from contracting to produce nonconventional \nalternative fuels that emit higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions \nthan conventional petroleum sources. The scope of the fuels that could \nbe prohibited is left wide open to interpretation, including fuels such \nas Canadian oil sands, E85 ethanol, the coal and natural gas-to-liquids \nfuels. This was an experiment I had something to do with, as did the \noccupant of the chair, in the Senate Armed Services Committee. We now \nhave a B-52H bomber that is actually running on gas-to-liquid fuel. So \nwe know this is something that works. We know it can help our \nsituation.\n  What I don't have time to get into because I only had 5 minutes, but \nI wish to do it later, is the ethanol mandate that came with the \nDecember of 2007 bill. Right now we know that ethanol--and quite a few \nof the far-left environmental extremists were behind this thing to \nstart with; in fact, former Senator Al Gore, Vice President Al Gore has \nstated he cast the deciding vote to allow ethanol in the first place--\nis not environmentally sound. It is expensive. It is not good on \nengines, and it is competing. In my State of Oklahoma, our livestock \npeople say we can't continue to have the biomass fuels competing with \nour feedstocks. Almost everything you see that is high priced now in \nthe grocery stores you can trace back to the ethanol mandate. One of \nthe things we will be wanting to do--and I will elaborate on it later--\nis to exercise the part of that bill that gives the EPA the opportunity \nto be involved in a waiver of the ethanol mandate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the American Energy Production Act of \n2008 is being offered as an amendment to the flood insurance \nlegislation before us today. I am an original cosponsor of the American \nEnergy Production Act.\n  The thrust of this legislation is expanding American energy supply \nthrough many different avenues. I view this amendment as an essential \nstep forward in both addressing the short-term as well as the long-term \nAmerican energy supplies. I also view this amendment as the right \npolicy to deal with today's high price of energy. America needs to \nadvance its energy policy, and this amendment deserves immediate \nconsideration.\n  There are many excellent provisions of the amendment that is before \nus. I am particularly interested in a provision to ramp up production \nof 6 billion gallons of fuel derived from coal. The provision would \nstart with a mandate of 750 million gallons of alternative coal-to-\nliquid fuels and then ramp up by a similar amount over the following 7 \nyears, beginning in year 2015. Analysts estimate this provision will \nresult in a reduction in the amount of oil America is projected to \nimport.\n  Simply put, coal is an abundant, affordable, reliable, and secure \nsource of energy. Coal can also be a clean energy source. These coal-\nto-liquid fuels would likely be used first by our military. The \nDepartment of Defense would be allowed to sign longer contracts for \nsynthetic fuels. The duration of the contracts would be expanded from \nthe current 5 years to 25 years. By doing that, this simple provision \nprovides great potential because it adds certainty to the market and \nprovides another incentive to develop coal-to-liquid facilities. In a \ntime of soaring\n\n[[Page S3938]]\n\nprices at the pump, this provision deserves serious debate, serious \nconsideration.\n  The fundamental energy issue before us is one, as we have heard from \nall speakers, of supply and demand. It is a time for Congress to take \naction, action that can have a real important impact on America's \nenergy supply.\n  America's coal is vital to our Nation's economic prosperity and our \nNation's security. Coal is a crucial part of America's energy \nportfolio. Coal provides a foundation for a competitive economy, a \nsecure future, and a prosperous information technology sector. Wise use \nof natural resources drives America's innovation and our economic \nsuccess. From the steam engines of yesterday to the superconductors of \nthe world, coal has powered this Nation. Now is the time to support the \ntechnology and development of coal to liquids. This will allow coal to \nbe an important contributor to America's transportation fuel. After \nall, coal is strategically found in States throughout the Nation, both \nin the East as well as the West.\n  The countries competing with us economically--India, China--rely \nheavily on coal. They are poised to exploit coal's many benefits. In \norder for us to sustain America's current economic leadership, we must \ncontinue to harness the vast potential of coal. Energy sources often \nface challenges. You know what they are: reliability, security, \neconomic competitiveness, ease of conversion, impacts on food supply, \nand environmental considerations. Coal provides an essential on-demand \nenergy supply in the United States, and coal is a low-cost energy \nsource. Coal has enormous potential to be converted into transportation \nfuels. At a time when America faces record prices at the pump, coal \nshould be used to produce gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel. Several \nprovisions in the American Energy Production Act of 2008 move America's \nuse of coal and domestic energy in the right direction. America's \nenergy and economic security will depend on promoting technologies that \nare related to coal. The time to act to expand America's energy \nportfolio is now.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment when it comes up for a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. May I ask how much time remains in morning business on \nour side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 15\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma and the \nSenator from Wyoming for their excellent remarks on the energy crisis. \nI want to focus attention on a couple of numbers this morning.\n  The first number is $3.65. This is the average price of a gallon of \ngasoline now for sale across America. Contrast that with the figure of \n$2.33. That shows how much the price of gasoline has gone up across the \ncountry since January 4, 2007. If we extrapolate what that means for \nthe average American family, they have seen a decrease in their \nstandard of living or an increase in their cost of living by roughly \n$1,400 a year as a result of this increase in gasoline prices.\n  Another figure I wish to mention is the figure 745. That was 745 days \nago, when Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, before she was Speaker, said that if \nshe and her fellow Democrats were given the majority, they would come \nup with a commonsense plan to reduce gas prices. That was 745 days ago. \nNotwithstanding the fact that they announced a plan yesterday--I will \ntalk about that in a minute--we are still waiting for a commonsense \nplan to bring down gas prices at the pump.\n  Here is the quote:\n\n       Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down \n     skyrocketing gas prices.\n\n  This was the Speaker of the House, April 24, 2006. As I said, we are \nstill waiting for that plan.\n  You heard both the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Wyoming \ntalk about some aspects of the legislation, the so-called Domenici \namendment, which we will vote on, on Monday, and of which I am a proud \ncosponsor. But let me focus on the plan announced by Majority Leader \nReid and the Democratic leadership yesterday. First, we will find some \nvery familiar elements to this plan rolled out by the Democratic \nleadership. It bears some remarkable resemblance to previous plans they \nhave rolled out. The No. 1 element is it produces not one single drop \nof additional oil or gas or energy, not one drop. The other \ncharacteristic it bears a remarkable resemblance to in terms of past \nproposals is that they basically suggest we tax, we litigate, and we \ninvestigate our way to greater energy independence. This is a formula \nwhich, although familiar, is one that has not shown itself effective, \nobviously, in bringing down the pain at the pump, the price of \ngasoline.\n  First, they said: We are going to investigate price gouging by the \noil and gas industry. We have seen investigations by the Federal Trade \nCommission. We have had numerous hearings that have found basically no \nsubstantiation for so-called price gouging. In fact, the cost of oil \nand gasoline has been related to unrest around the world in dangerous \nparts of the world where the supply may be in question, whether it is \nthe Middle East or elsewhere.\n  They found that the failure of Congress to remove the regulatory \nburden to construction of new refinery capacity has led to a bottleneck \nwhen it comes to refinery capacity where that oil is then transformed \ninto gasoline that we burn in our gas tanks.\n  Then, of course, there is the fact that we cannot repeal the law of \nsupply and demand, and that unless we are going to do something about \nincreasing the supply of oil, that if we fix the amount of oil \navailable worldwide because we refuse to open America's own natural \nresources in order to expand that supply, that rising demand for oil by \ncountries such as China and India--which have more than a billion \npeople each who want the kind of prosperity and enjoy the sort of \neconomic vitality the United States has--they are going to place \ngreater demands on that fixed supply of oil so they can benefit, as \nAmerica has, from having access to low-cost--relatively low-cost--\nenergy for a long, long time.\n  So price gouging is something for which we have had investigations in \nthe past. We have had hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee, on \nwhich I am proud to serve. The Federal Trade Commission has \ninvestigated it until they were blue in the face and found no real \nevidence of price gouging but, rather, a deficit of supply when it \ncomes to increasing demand as the most likely cause.\n  Now, the second element of the Democratic leadership's so-called \nenergy policy is litigation. In other words, we are going to sue the \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n  Now, I have heard some of our colleagues talk about another context: \nWe need to engage countries such as Iran and Venezuela and talk to them \ndirectly about geopolitical matters and about security matters.\n  This is the first time, really, I have heard them talk about suing \ncountries such as Iran and Venezuela and the Organization of Petroleum \nExporting Countries. The irony of it is, what are we going to sue them \nfor? We are going to sue them for, presumably, more oil or make them \nturn the spigot open even wider, ironically forcing us to become more \ndependent on imported oil from dangerous regions across the globe and \nfrom people who are not our friend--President Ahmadinejad in Iran, head \nof an Islamic extremist government on the terror watch list of the \nState Department as a state sponsor of international terrorism in the \nMiddle East; and then there is Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, somebody who \nis not our friend, somebody who harbors narcoterrorists in the FARC and \nother organizations in his country. These are the kinds of people we \nare going to continue to depend more and more on by somehow filing a \nlawsuit against them and forcing them to sell us more of their oil? How \nis that going to make us more energy independent? How is that going to \nenhance our national security and our economy?\n  Well, then there is the other answer we have heard in the Democratic \nleadership plan they proposed--this one, again, is a familiar solution, \nor I should say a nonsolution--and this has to do with the so-called \nwindfall profits tax.\n  Well, I think we ought to learn from history or else we will be \ncondemned to relive it. Over the entire 1980 to 1986 period, in which \nthe U.S. Government\n\n[[Page S3939]]\n\nhad a windfall profits tax, it, in fact, reduced domestic production \nfrom between 320 million barrels and 1,268 million barrels. That is \nalmost 5 percent of overall production. If you think about it, there is \nan easy way to understand that. If you put an increased tax on American \nproducers--because, of course, we cannot put an increased tax on OPEC, \non Venezuela, on Iran, and these state-owned oil companies--the fact \nis, we put an increased tax burden on our own domestic producers.\n  Of course, we find that the Congressional Research Service has found \nthat last time we tried a windfall profits tax, it decreased our \ndomestic oil production. Why in the world would we want to do that? How \ndoes that help increase the supply of America's natural resources, \nwhich can help ameliorate some of this pain at the pump by increasing \nsupply and thus bringing down, hopefully, the cost of a barrel of oil \nand then the refined product of gasoline?\n  Well, the last suggestion has to do with the strategic oil reserves. \nThat is a final answer, by eliminating the 70,000 barrels a day that we \nput into the strategic oil reserves. Now, I think there may be a case \nfor reducing or eliminating the 70,000 barrels of oil a day that go \ninto the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But I have to tell you, the world \nconsumes roughly 85 million barrels of oil a day--85 million barrels of \noil a day. What effect is 70,000 barrels a day that would not go into \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve, what impact would that have on \nreducing the price of oil globally or bringing down the price at the \npump? Well, my calculation is that by reducing the amount of oil going \ninto the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we could bring down gas prices \nmaybe 2 cents or 5 cents per gallon. Maybe that would be welcomed but \nhardly adequate to deal with the high gas prices we have sustained and \nare experiencing today.\n  But I want to take that one step further. If our Democratic friends \nbelieve reducing the amount of oil that goes into the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve by 70,000 barrels a day is a good idea because that \nmight reduce, although infinitesimally, the cost of gasoline, how much \nmore sense would it make to explore and develop the million-barrel-a-\nday capacity that is located in Alaska in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge? If you take the million barrels of oil a day that could be \nproduced from ANWR, then you are talking about--according to the same \ncalculation I just used on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--reducing \nthe pricing of gasoline, by an additional million-barrel supply of \nAmerican oil a day, by 85 cents to $2.14 a gallon. Now, that would be a \nreal impact, to be able to bring down the price of gasoline by 85 cents \nto $2.14 a gallon.\n  I just mentioned the ANWR reserves. But it is estimated if we were \nactually to open not only Alaska to environmentally responsible \ndevelopment of those oil and gas reserves located there and produce an \nadditional million barrels a day of oil, that if we were also to leave \nup to the States--States such as Virginia and other States, Alaska--the \noption to open their Outer Continental Shelf to oil reserves, to \nfurther production, if we were to open some of the oil shale and oil \nsands out in the West to production, we could develop another 3 million \nbarrels of oil capacity right here in America without having to depend \nmore and more on foreign sources of oil.\n  If you take the same argument our friends have offered on the impact \nof reducing deposits of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and that \nthat would actually have an impact on price, how much more would it \nhave a beneficial impact on lowering the price if, in fact, we were to \nopen up America's natural resources here at home?\n  We will have an important vote on Monday where the so-called Domenici \namendment--which I am proud to join--will be offered for a vote, where \nthe Senate can go on record in showing where they stand when it comes \nto this effort to help bring down the price at the pump, which Speaker \nPelosi announced 745 days ago. The highlights, as I have already \nmentioned, of that bill are opening portions of the Outer Continental \nShelf, as we have the Gulf of Mexico 300 miles offshore from the State \nof Texas. I tell you, you cannot even see the drilling activity out \nthere 300 miles offshore. Indeed, the drilling activity could occur in \nthe Outer Continental Shelf beyond the horizon in a way that is not \neven visible to people on shore.\n  I mentioned the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Tapping into that \noil and gas, which we know is there, would immediately produce--once it \nis done--huge volumes of oil that could help relieve our dependence on \nimported oil.\n  We know that building additional refineries would help relieve some \nof that bottleneck when it comes to refining the oil into gasoline. Of \ncourse, 70 percent of the price of gasoline is the price of oil, but \nanother part of it is the burden we put on the permitting process for \nthe construction of new refineries or expanding refinery capacity.\n  My colleague from Wyoming talked about coal, and I agree with him \nthat we ought to use good, old-fashioned American ingenuity in our \nresearch and scientific ability to figure out, how do we use this \ncoal--we are the ``Saudi Arabia'' of coal--how do we use it in a way \nthat is compatible with a good environment? The technology has already \nbeen demonstrated, things such as coal-to-liquids technology, coal \ngasification, which can capture the carbon, deal with the environmental \nconcerns, and yet provide us access to energy which can help drive our \neconomy and help make us less dependent on imported oil and gas from \nother parts of the world.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle will come forward with additional ideas. I have explained how the \nproposals they have made would have no impact, would provide no supply \nbut would really just rehash old, tired themes which have been shown \nnot to work in the past. But I think the debate is an important one, \nand I look forward to continuing it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/08/senate-section/article/S3939-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3939-S3946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to honor and celebrate Israel's \n60th anniversary. On a sad note, this is the first year that we honor \nIsrael's anniversary without my friend and former colleague, \nCongressman Tom Lantos, former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee. Mr. Lantos was the only Holocaust survivor to ever serve in \nCongress, and his recent passing has left a hollow void for all of us.\n  Mr. President, on April 22 of this year, the Senate unanimously \nadopted a resolution expressing our unwavering commitment to the \nsovereign and independent State of Israel.\n  Sixty years after its founding, we now witness a strong nation, a \nsteadfast ally and strategic partner of the United States, a dynamic \ndemocracy with a thriving economic, political, cultural, and \nintellectual life, that survives despite the heavy costs of war, \nterrorism, and unjustified diplomatic and economic boycotts.\n  We now witness an innovative nation which has developed some of the \nleading universities in the world and produced eight recipients of the \nNobel prize.\n  We now witness a compassionate nation, which regularly sends \nhumanitarian aid, search-and-rescue teams, mobile hospitals, and other \nemergency supplies to help victims of disasters around the world and \nwhich has taken in millions of Jews from countries around the world, \noften fleeing those countries and persecution. These accomplishments \nhave followed one of the most tragic events in human civilization: the \nslaughter of more than 6 million European Jews during the Holocaust.\n\n  We are reminded that, as I have said many times before on this floor, \nthe events of the Holocaust are not distant and are not buried in the \npast. Today, those who survived the camps live to tell us their story, \nthe stories of their families and their lives before the Holocaust. \nTheir children and grandchildren are here with us too. They are living \ntestimony to the strength, the courage, and optimism of their parents \nand grandparents. But in their hearts and in their souls they feel the \npain and suffering of those who raised them. In them, too, the past is \npresent.\n  Echoes from that tragedy still rattle our world in other ways. Every \ntime a hateful slogan is spray-painted on a\n\n[[Page S3940]]\n\nwall, every time a bigoted joke spreads like wildfire on the Internet, \nevery time a synagogue somewhere in the world has to station armed \nguards outside so its members can pray in peace, and every time a \nterrorist Qassam rocket attack from Gaza shatters a pane of glass at a \nfamily's home or a school, we feel the dark shadows of history falling \nupon our time.\n  It is a harsh reality that 60 years after its founding, the nation of \nIsrael continues to face mounting threats to its way of life and its \nexistence. Sixty years after the establishment of a homeland for the \nJewish people, antisemitism is very much alive.\n  So those who speak against the sovereignty of Israel or threaten its \nobliteration or who believe that antisemitism is an attack that need \nnot be answered, do not recognize the consequences of history. In fact, \nan attack against anyone simply because of race or religion is \nultimately the beginning of the unraveling of civilization. So it is in \nour common interests to raise our voices against antisemitism.\n  By honoring and commemorating the 60th anniversary of Israel, we do \nmore than congratulate a nation. We take a stand against hatred and \ndiscrimination everywhere. We recognize a triumph over fear and \nachievement of industriousness, a victory of hope. We express our \nsincere confidence that despite the challenges its people have faced, \ndespite the threats to their very existence, Israel has and it shall \novercome.\n  Israel and the Jewish people have held many commemorations and events \nover the past week. Yesterday was a day to remember those who gave \ntheir lives to protect the State of Israel and others who have fallen \nvictim to attacks from its enemies. Today is a day to celebrate the \nnation's 60 years of life. It is a day for celebration and for strong \naction.\n  On this day, we pause to commemorate all of those who have \ncontributed to make Israel such a strong nation, and we pledge to \ncontinue to strengthen our bonds of close friendship and cooperation so \nthat as proud as this nation's history is, the future will be even \nbrighter still.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for his powerful \nand eloquent words. I am privileged now to stand to join him in giving \nhonor and celebrating the 60th anniversary of the founding of the \nmodern State of Israel, which is a day truly to celebrate.\n  The 20th century witnessed unprecedented horrors inflicted by man \nagainst his fellow man, from the trenches of World War I to the gulag \narchipelago of the Soviet Union to the killing fields of Cambodia and \nRwanda and, of course, the genocide perpetrated by Nazi Germany against \nthe Jews of Europe.\n  Against these acts of bloodshed and repression and violence, the \ncreation of the modern State of Israel in 1948 stands as a counterpoint \nin human history, a soaring act of hope and faith in our capacity as \nhuman beings to rise from the ashes of despair and to rebuild and \nrestore that which for so long had seemed hopelessly lost.\n  The modern history of the State of Israel goes back 60 years, but of \ncourse the history of Israel goes back more than 4,000 years ago to the \nfirst words that God spoke to Abraham as recorded in Genesis 1:21:\n\n       Now get thee unto the land that I will show thee, and I \n     will make thee a great Nation.\n\n  That was the covenant that God made with Abraham and which God \nrepeated to Isaac, to Jacob, and then to Moses who, with God's help, \ndelivered the children of Israel out of bondage in Egypt to Mount Sinai \nwhere they received the Ten Commandments, their national statement of \npurpose and destiny, and then after 40 years in the wilderness, \nreturned to the land that God had promised--the land of Israel.\n  It was there in the land of Israel more than 3,000 years ago that \nKing David entered Jerusalem and declared it to be the capital of the \nJewish people. And it was there in Jerusalem that David's son Solomon \nbuilt a holy temple to house the Ark of the Covenant and the Ten \nCommandments. Thus in one place was established both the political \ncapital of the Jewish people and the religious center of that people's \nfaith.\n  It was also there almost 2,600 years ago on a dark day in history \nthat the temple that Solomon built was destroyed. The Jewish people \nwere forced into exile, returning just 40 years later to their homeland \nto rebuild the temple. It was during the time of the second temple \nunder Roman rule that Jesus of Nazareth lived, preached, taught, and \nhealed the Jews of Israel. But the temple was to be destroyed once \nmore, and most, if not all, of the Jews were forced to flee the land.\n  For nearly two millennia, the Jewish people in the Diaspora prayed \nevery day that they could return to the promised land. For almost 1,900 \nyears, the State of Israel was thus carried in the hearts of millions \nof these Jewish exiles, and even more millions of Christians who prayed \nsome of those same prayers for Zion's restoration, particularly here in \nAmerica.\n  That collective yearning gave rise to a new political movement at the \nend of the 19th century--the modern Zionist movement. It was led by \nTheodore Herzl and a small band of followers, Jewish and Christian, \nthroughout the world. Many people said those early Zionists of the \nmodern era were naive dreamers, but Herzl replied: ``If you will it, it \nis no dream.'' If you will it, it is no dream. Will it they did, and \nwork for it they did. In 1948, 60 years ago this month, their dream \nbecame a reality.\n\n  The story of Israel's rebirth is inextricably bound up in the story \nof another extraordinary principal, purposeful nation with its own \nspecial sense of destiny, and that is, of course, our own beloved \ncountry--the United States of America.\n  From the earliest days of our Nation's history, there has been a link \nbetween the promise of America and the promise of Israel. The early \nsettlers to America in fact believed they were founding here a new \nJerusalem. The first minister to step foot at Plymouth Rock uttered \nwords from the prophet Jeremiah. Many of our Nation's Founding Fathers \nwere themselves Zionists. The President of the Continental Congress, \nElias Boudinot, predicted that the mighty power of God would someday \nreturn the Jews to their beloved land. And John Adams wrote:\n\n       I really wish to see the Jews again in Judea as an \n     independent Nation.\n\n  When the modern State of Israel declared its independence 60 years \nago this month, it was officially and most significantly recognized a \nmere 11 minutes later by a great American President, Harry S. Truman.\n  Americans and Israelis alike are the children of freedom. We are both \ndevoted to our democratic ideals, our culture of economic opportunity, \nand our political pluralism. These are the principles we cherish and \nthe principles that define not just who we are but who we aspire to be. \nI think it is the main reason, when our two nations look at each other, \nwe so often see the best of ourselves. It is also why succeeding \nPresidents of both parties since Harry Truman have given such steadfast \nsupport to the State of Israel.\n  I have often said as Presidents come and go, some seem more \nsupportive of Israel, some somewhat less. The current President \nobviously is one of those who has most steadfastly and significantly \nsupported Israel. But over the long term, the great guarantor of the \nU.S.-Israel relationship has been the bipartisan, pro-Israel majorities \nin both Houses of Congress.\n  Throughout her brief history, Israel has also courageously faced \nenemies who have threatened her existence. Today we once again see the \nrise of such threats to Israel, including some that are existential. \nThose threats come from the same Islamist extremists and terrorists who \nthreaten America today and against whom we are fighting the global war \non terrorism. History has taught us that we cannot ignore or appease \nthese dangers, so let's never forget that Israel is a living symbol for \nthe ideals we as Americans treasure--the ideals of freedom and human \ndignity.\n  It is sometimes said that nations do not have permanent friends, only \npermanent interests. But I believe the United States of America has a \npermanent interest in our permanent friendship with the State of Israel \nbecause that friendship is based on eternal values. We pledge today on \nthe day of this\n\n[[Page S3941]]\n\n60th anniversary of the modern State of Israel, and we pray with God's \nhelp that those eternal values and permanent friendships will sustain \nthese two great democratic nations eternally.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate and to \ncelebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the modern State of \nIsrael. I wish to commend my colleagues from Connecticut and New \nJersey, Senators Menendez and Lieberman, on their statements this \nmorning.\n  Since its independence in 1948, Israel's promotion of democratic \nvalues has helped forge a thriving society and a bastion of freedom in \na region where that value is sadly all too scarce. The vision of a \npermanent homeland for the Jewish people was centuries in the making \nand was finally achieved in May of 1948. From its outset, Israel has \nfaced a myriad of challenges which it has navigated successfully \nagainst all odds. A small state with few natural resources and residing \nin a region decidedly unfriendly to its very existence, the odds \nagainst Israel have always been high. Yet the nation of Israel has \nendured.\n  Today, Israel is known for a vibrant, high-tech economy. It \nsuccessfully accommodates a significant Arab population inside its \nborders, allowing Arab representatives to serve in the Knesset. It has \nachieved broad universal recognition and has forged peace with previous \nenemies, including Egypt and Jordan. This will to surmount adversity \ntime and time again comes from the tenacious spirit of its people and \nrepresents the very reason we are able to celebrate their anniversary \ntoday.\n  I was fortunate enough to visit Israel in November of 2005 and meet \nwith various people who make up the mosaic of that great nation. Today \nI want to share with my colleagues two indelible experiences.\n  First, I toured a semiconductor plant, the Vishay plant near Tel \nAviv, a plant whose base company is located in Chester County, PA. What \nmade this plant so special outside of its Pennsylvania ties was that it \nwas started by a Holocaust survivor, Dr. Felix Zandman, and his son \nMark who led us on the tour.\n  We not only observed the factory processes and equipment but also, \nand more importantly, the resiliency, I should say, of this brave \nfamily. Dr. Zandman experienced the most horrific fate imaginable to \nman. Yet out of his experience, he was able to pick up the pieces of \nhis life, begin participating in his community again, and to become a \nvery successful businessman, who now contributes to the global economy. \nTo me, his story reflects the strength and courage embodied in the \nJewish people.\n  The next experience occurred while attending a Saturday dinner in \nJerusalem after the end of the Sabbath. I was at the home of Rabbi \nDaniel Gordis, who is well known in the United States. He went to \nIsrael from the United States. The rabbi had a 19-year-old daughter at \nthat time who was serving in the military. At dinner, Rabbi Gordis told \nus the story about going very early in the morning to wake up his \ndaughter to take her back to where she was stationed in the army, only \nto notice that, while she was soundly sleeping in her bed, next to her \nautomatic weapon was her Curious George stuffed animal from her \nchildhood. As the father of four daughters, I will never forget that \nimage--the image of a young Jewish woman, bravely serving her country, \nbut not that far removed from her own childhood. Rabbi Daniel Gordis, \nlike so many parents in Israel, was feeling the emotion, the human \nemotion of love for his daughter and, at the same time, love for his \ncountry. There is no better example of the profound sacrifices of the \nJewish people and what they have given to build and preserve the state \nof Israel. The story of Rabbi Daniel Gordis and his daughter is \nIsrael's story.\n  I was reminded, when I was there, of a passage from Scripture. We \nwent by a school, and this part of scripture was inscribed on the \nschool, which, in many ways, represented the bright promise and future \nof Israel. It is taken from the prophet Zechariah, chapter 8, and I \nwill quote it briefly. This is the prophet predicting thousands of \nyears into the future at that time:\n\n       There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets \n     of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for \n     every age.\n       And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls \n     playing in the streets thereof.\n\n  That prophecy of long ago has indeed come to pass for the great state \nof Israel. So today, and every day, when we celebrate their bold \nentrepreneurial spirit, a strong sense of community, a commitment to \nnational service and, obviously, a commitment to liberty, all these \nvalues, combined with the democratic ideal that permeates their \nsociety, all these make Israel what it is today and demonstrates why it \nis such a strong ally of the United States of America. Our two nations \nshare a deep and unshakable bond, and that alliance, I believe, will \nendure for the next 60 years, and for all of our tomorrows, as it has \nfor the previous six decades.\n  As the world community continues to deal with conflicts in the \nregion, the Jewish people must know that the United States will always \nextend our assistance to our indispensable ally as it moves forward on \nthe road toward peace and stability.\n  Once again, I extend my warmest congratulations to the state of \nIsrael on its 60th anniversary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague Senator \nCasey for his comments about the state of Israel. He has captured the \nspecial nature of Israel, which one gets when they have an opportunity \nto visit the country and see the faces of the people of Israel and what \nthey have been able to accomplish in a relatively short period of time, \nin a very small country.\n  Today, we in the Senate pause to celebrate Israel's 60th anniversary. \nTo the strongest ally of the United States in the Middle East, we wish \nIsrael continued success.\n  There is good reason that Israel is our strongest ally in the Middle \nEast. It is a nation that has been built upon democratic principles, a \ntrusted ally in our war against terror. It shares our values in a \ncritically important part of the world to the United States.\n  President Lyndon Johnson said, ``The U.S. and Israel share many \ncommon objectives, chief of which is the building of a better world in \nwhich every nation can develop its resources, and develop them in \nfreedom and peace.''\n  Israel today is a vibrant oasis of democracy in a region of the world \nreplete with secular and religious dictators.\n  For 60 years, there have been near constant military and terrorist \nthreats, economic boycotts, and diplomatic hostility. Yet it still \nstands as a thriving, pluralistic democracy, with the rule of law, and \nan independent judiciary that works to protect freedom of speech, \nassociation, religion, a free press, and fair and open elections.\n  Israel has become not only a regional power but international leader \nin agriculture, health, science, medicine, high tech, and security. It \nhas used that expertise to reach out and help so many other countries \nin the world deal with its challenges. Although it is a very small \ncountry, eight of its citizens have been acknowledged as Nobel \nlaureates. In homeland security, it has helped the United States in \ndealing with our war against terror in the post-9/11 era.\n  Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion Airport is a model for airport security. Our \nNation has benefited by learning how the Israelis protected their \nairports, and we are using many of those procedures here in the United \nStates to protect our own citizens.\n  I can tell you how the Israelis have helped Maryland deal with \nhomeland security issues. They have come and looked at one of our urban \nhospitals to make sure we take every precaution to protect the citizens \nof Maryland.\n  Israel is a safe haven for Jews--from the Soviet Union, to Ethiopia, \nor any country where Jews are threatened. As David Ben-Gurion said 60 \nyears ago, ``The land of Israel was the birth place of the Jewish \npeople. Here their spiritual, religious, and political identity was \nshaped. Here they first attained statehood, created cultural values of \nnational and universal significance and gave the world the eternal Book \nof Books.''\n\n[[Page S3942]]\n\n  Ben-Gurion went on to say that the State of Israel ``will be based on \nfreedom, justice, and peace, as envisioned by the prophets of Israel; \nit will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all \nof its inhabitants, irrespective of religion, race, or sex; it will \nguarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and \nculture; it will safeguard the holy places of all religions.''\n  Since its first days as a modern state, it has sought peace with its \nArab neighbors. During the declaration of independence, Israel stated:\n\n       We extend our hand to all neighboring states and their \n     peoples in an offer of peace and good neighborliness and \n     appeal to them to establish bonds of cooperation and mutual \n     help with its sovereign Jewish people settled in its own \n     lands. The state of Israel is prepared to do its share in a \n     common effort for the advancement of the entire Middle East.\n\n  It has had success, with the help of the United States, as peace \nagreements were entered into with Egypt and Jordan. But to those who \ncontinue to challenge Israel's sovereignty and security, let me caution \nthem with the words of President John F. Kennedy when he said:\n\n       Israel was not created in order to disappear. Israel will \n     endure and flourish. It is the child of hope and the hope of \n     the brave. It can neither be broken by adversity nor \n     demoralized by success. It carries the shield of democracy \n     and it honors the sword of freedom.\n\n  On the 60th anniversary of the state of Israel, we wish it continued \nsuccess and peace, as the bond between our two countries continues to \nstrengthen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, 60 years ago, on May 8--or May 14, under \nour western calendar--Israel declared its independence. On this special \nday, when Jews and Christians, heads of state, and others around the \nworld celebrate the founding of Israel, I rise for a few minutes to \nreaffirm our Nation's commitment to Israel's security and the pursuit \nof a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n  That is one of the reasons I cosponsored the resolution recognizing \nIsrael's 60th birthday, and reaffirming the close ties between our \ncountry and Israel, a nation I have been privileged to visit as a \nCongressman, as a Governor, as a Senator, and maybe most importantly as \na father with a teenage son.\n  Current events threaten to overshadow the importance, though, of this \nindependence day: Prime Minister Omert is again being investigated. \nAnother round of peace talks appears to have stalled once more. Hamas \ncontinues to launch Qassam rockets at Sderot and other towns near Gaza. \nSuicide bombings continue. Hezbollah has increased military capability, \nwith support from Syria and Iran. The leaders of Iran--the most active \nstate sponsor of terrorism in the world--continue to call for Israel's \ndestruction, while denying that the Holocaust ever occurred.\n  These are enormous, complex challenges. But after 7 wars in only 60 \nyears, Israel somehow has achieved remarkable--some would say \nmiraculous--success, all the while having to fight for its existence \nalmost every single day.\n  Today is the day to express our fundamental pride in a number of \ntheir successes. For example, Israel's population today is 7.3 million \npeople, more than 9 times the 800,000 who lived there in 1948. Since \nits founding, over 3 million immigrants have been successfully \nabsorbed.\n  While Israel is the world capital of Torah learning, it is among the \nworld's leaders in high-tech, medical, and scientific advances. In \n1948, there were only two universities; today there are eight. On a per \ncapita basis, Israel's GDP places it in the top tier of all nations. \nDemocratic institutions flourish there. Both Jews and Arabs serve in \nIsrael's Parliament, the Kennesset. Additionally, Israel has an \nindependent, effective judiciary and a free press.\n  So today I rise to join many of my colleagues in reaffirming the \ncommitment of the United States to Israel's security.\n  For the people of Israel, to its citizens, our message is simple and \nclear: We will continue to stand in solidarity with you. We are proud \nof what you have become.\n  As I said earlier, I have had the privilege of visiting Israel a \nnumber of times--when I served in the House, as a Governor leading a \ntrade delegation, as a Member of the Senate, and perhaps the most \nspecial and memorable visit for me was with my teenage son, roughly 3 \nyears ago. We were in Israel on Easter weekend. We actually had the \nprivilege of being on Golgotha, where Christ was believed to have been \ncrucified, and we were there on Easter Sunday. We were privileged to be \nat the tomb where Christ's body was believed to have been lain, and we \nplaced our hands there on Easter Sunday. What an unforgettable memory. \nI had the privilege of meeting Prime Minister Shamir, Ehud Barak, Ariel \nSharon, Netanyahu, and Shimon Peres, among others. I will never forget \nbeing at the home of the U.S. Ambassador to Israel on July 4, roughly \n10 years ago--being there and meeting what seemed like half of the \nleadership of Israel, and any number of prominent Israeli citizens as \nour guests that day celebrating our independence, our Nation's \nbirthday.\n  Today, some 10 years later, as we prepare to celebrate Israel's \nbirthday with the Israelis and people all over the world, I want to \nclose with the words of Israeli President Shimon Peres spoken only a \nfew days ago. I know the Presiding Officer has met Shimon Peres before \nin the number of roles he has played. I have been fortunate to do that \nas well. I have never met anyone who has a greater gift with the \nEnglish language than this man.\n  I want to share these words he said a couple days ago:\n\n       Over the past 60 years, we have something that previous \n     generations of Jews, those who were trampled in the pogroms \n     and who were burned in the crematoria, did not have. The \n     soldiers who fell created a miracle unparalleled in history: \n     the miracle of the state of Israel. . . . For 60 years, they \n     fought in seven wars that were forced upon us, and that we \n     won. They enabled us to establish an exemplary society, to be \n     trailblazers in the world in . . . agriculture, medicine and \n     defense, to be a peace-seeking people, a democratic state, \n     and a state that seeks justice.\n\n  To that I would only add, may it be so for a millennium or more.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I join my colleagues who have come to \nthe floor today to recognize and salute the 60th anniversary of the \nfounding of the modern state of Israel.\n  Today is a great milestone for the people of Israel--and for all \nAmericans. Ever since President Truman recognized Israel minutes after \nits birth on May 14, 1948, the United States and Israel have enjoyed a \nfriendship based on values rooted in democracy and mutual strategic \ngoals.\n  Israel's survival and success are a remarkable testimony to the \nvision that inspired its creation six decades ago and to the Israeli \npeople who have made that vision a reality .\n  On this day of celebration, we must reflect on the course charted by \nthe great leaders over the last six decades that have made this \nmilestone possible. Though the journey has not always been along a \nstraight and smooth path, each step along the way has been paved with \nthe two fundamental and complementary tenets of the Israeli nation: \nresilience and faith.``\n  The existence of Israel across these six decades--the way it has \ngrown and flourished--has provided security and opportunity for its \ncitizens. It has strengthened and enhanced Jewish life around the \nworld. And it has been a beacon of democracy that makes the entire \nworld a safer, more hopeful place.\n  I had the honor of traveling to Israel 2 years ago and seeing first-\nhand the strength and vitality of the country. I still remember the \nwarm welcome I received from the Israeli people, as well as the courage \nand pride they bring to everyday life. I was honored to meet with Prime \nMinister Ariel Sharon just a few weeks before his tragic stroke, and I \nwill value forever the lessons I learned from our conversation.\n  Today, America's and Israel's interests in the Middle East and around \nthe world have never been more closely aligned. Our common values and \nobjectives continue to drive us to meet the challenges we face, and to \npursue opportunities for greater peace and prosperity.\n\n[[Page S3943]]\n\n  We are in the midst of turbulent times, with. instability threatening \nto spread across the Middle East. But the people of Israel must know \nthat wherever forces of intolerance gather to endanger their safety or \nsecurity, the United States will stand beside them in defying and \ndefeating these foes.\n  By continuing to support Israel, we support stability and democracy \nand we can make further progress toward peace in the region.\n  I ask that my colleagues join with me in congratulating and \ncelebrating with the people of Israel on the 60th anniversary of the \nfounding of their nation, and that we renew our commitment to ensuring \nthat we will continue to celebrate each successive anniversary for \ndecades to come.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, Israel's first Prime Minister \nDavid Ben-Gurion, on May 14, 1948, proclaimed the establishment of the \nstate of Israel, and 60 years later now, we celebrate this momentous \ntime in Israel's history. I congratulate, along with all of the other \nSenators, Israel on its 60th anniversary, and the close relationship \nthe United States and Israel have. It serves as an important purpose of \npromoting peace in the Middle East.\n  Helping Israel achieve peace with its neighbors while maintaining its \nsecurity strengthens both of our strategic interests. We must do \neverything we can to end the bloodshed and bring the parties together. \nWe must resume those positive measures.\n  We must, as the Good Book says: Come, let us reason together. Most of \nus out here support two states living side by side in peace and \nsecurity for both. That was outlined by the President in a speech on \nJune 24, 6 years ago.\n  To achieve that, the Palestinians need to reform their institutions \nand cease those continued terrorist activities against all the \ninnocents. Continued engagement by our country is required to help us \nget to that goal of peace in the Middle East. I look forward to the \ncontinued cooperation of Israel and the United States toward that goal. \nMy hearty congratulations to Israel on its 60th anniversary.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the State of Israel \non the 60th anniversary of its independence.\n  The story of the tribes of Judea began, as we know, in the Old \nTestament. The Israelites fled from Pharaoh's slavery, wandering for 40 \nyears in the desert before coming to their land. It is a familiar \nnarrative--and not only to those who study Scripture--for those early \ntrials of the Jewish people bespoke an awe-inspiring destiny, both \nglorious and tragic. No other people on earth have survived and \nprospered in the face of so much hardship. The Jewish community has \nbeen contemporaries of the Assyrians and Babylon, Crusaders and Rome, \nthe Hapsburgs and the Soviet Kremlin. They have faced injustice, \npersecution, expropriation, pogroms, and genocide; and they have \npersevered.\n  The return of the Jews to the Holy Land is perhaps the greatest \nhistorical event of our time. The Jewish community emerged from the \ngreatest tragedy the Diaspora had ever known, and in its aftermath \nbuilt the greatest triumph. The authors of that triumph encompass the \nwhole of the early Israeli community. The great David Ben-Gurion \ndeclared Israel a state but he could not have without the thousands of \nbrave Israelis willing to fight for it. Chaim Weizman secured \ninternational support for Israel but he could not have without the \nhundreds of thousands of Jews willing to immigrate to the Holy Land. \nAnd of all these heroes, the famous and the anonymous, none have given \nmore than the 22,437 Israeli soldiers who have fallen in battle since \n1860. It is no coincidence in Israel that Independence Day is preceded \nby Remembrance Day, to honor the fallen Zahal warriors. On this 60th \nanniversary of Israel's independence, I know that wherever they are, \nthose sons and daughters of Judea are proud indeed.\n  I am also proud that America has stood with Israel in her times of \nneed. It is only fitting that the two great democratic nations forged \nby immigrants and pioneers be close allies, in the ongoing struggle \nagainst the forces of fanaticism. For Israel, this fight is as familiar \nas existence; for America, it is an old enemy in a new guise. During my \ntime in the Senate, I have worked tirelessly to strengthen the bond \nbetween our two countries. I believe the bonds our two countries share \nare as everlasting as they are many-layered. Together, they will ensure \nthat Israel faces down the next threat, and the one after that, and \nafter that, and so on until her 120th anniversary, when I pray there \nwill at last be peace.\n  The past three have been littered with many enemies, from Titus to \nthe Nazis, each with their own dream of destroying the Jews. Some came \nperilously close. But today we know that the destruction of the Second \nTemple, and the Inquisition, and the pogroms, and the Holocaust were \nnot in fact the end of the story. The legend did not end. In 1948, the \nnew chapter of the tribes of Israel began, always glorious and always \ntragic, animating the pages of history until the final chapter of Man.\n  May Israel ever be with us, and us ever by her side.\n  Mr. WYDEN. It is a great honor to come to the floor in celebration of \nthe 60th anniversary of the establishment of the State of Israel. The \ncreation of an independent Israeli State was truly one of the most \nsignificant events of the 20th century. Following the horrific events \nof the Holocaust, the founding of the State of Israel symbolized a \nrecognition of the right and the need of the Jewish people to have a \nhomeland--a place of sanctuary and security after the senseless \nannihilation of 6 million Jews. The Holocaust was not the first or the \nlast genocide. It was the culmination of centuries during which Jews \nwere ostracized, persecuted, and purged from country after country. The \nJewish people struggled to maintain their heritage, their traditions, \nand did so in the midst of other cultures, after the fall of Jerusalem \nand enslavement by many other societies.\n  For over 2000 years, Jews faced discrimination, including \nrestrictions of their rights, religious practices, and even \nprofessional occupation. Yet even as Jews were able to prosper and \nestablish themselves as an integral part of society in Europe, this \nprogress was wiped out by the Nazi regime. Thousands upon thousands of \nJewish families, including my own, were uprooted from their homes and \nforced to flee for their lives for no other reason than the fact that \nthey were Jewish. Not all of our family was able to get out. We lost \nfamily at Krystalnacht. We lost family at Theresienstadt. My family \ncame to this country knowing they were coming to the best and freest \nplace on Earth. But not all were able to come here. Many European Jews \nwere not allowed entry into other countries, including the land that is \nnow Israel.\n  Upon the conclusion of World War II, the United States joined with \nother countries in the United Nations to recognize the right and need \nof the Jewish people to have the security of being able to live in \ntheir own state. The United States was, in fact, the very first country \nto recognize the State of Israel on May 14, 1948. After thousands of \nyears, Jews had established in their historic homeland a sovereign \ncountry of their own, Israel. Yet Israel is much more than a sanctuary \nfor the Jewish people. Israel's importance transcends the Jewish \nreligion. Israel is a place of enormous historic significance. It is a \nsacred land not only for Jews but for Christians and Muslims as well. \nAll three of the world's major monotheistic faiths honor Jerusalem and \nother surrounding sites as holy places that hold unique importance to \nthe development of their religions. Israel has worked to protect the \ninterests and rights not just of Jews but those of all faiths.\n  The Israeli Government provides access to historic and religiously \nsignificant sites and allows clergy, scholars, historian, \narcheologists, and others to pursue their studies of this very \nhistoric, very special land. Israel is also of enormous importance to \nour country. Israel is America's strongest and most reliable ally in \nthe Middle East. In a region that has been plagued by instability but \nis of enormous strategic significance, Israel is a stable democracy and \na stalwart ally.\n  As a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, I follow these \nissues closely and would say from the Camp David accords to the current \npeace talks, Israel has consistently demonstrated a willingness to work\n\n[[Page S3944]]\n\nalong with the United States to engage its neighbors in difficult \nnegotiations. Despite constant attacks and threats to its very \nexistence, Israel has given up land and made very significant \nconciliatory offers in the interest of achieving lasting peace and \nstability in the Middle East.\n  Finally, beyond the religious, historic, cultural, diplomatic, and \nstrategic significance, it is important to recognize the impact Israel \nhas had at the human level for its citizens and for people around the \nglobe. Israel has established a thriving economy, a world-class \neducation system, and has advanced scientific and technological \ninnovation on numerous fronts. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota \nand I have talked many times about the issue of health care. It is \nstriking to see the Israelis in such an innovative, focused kind of way \nlook to health care improvements that are going to be of great use, not \njust to the people of Israel but to many around the world. In 60 years, \nIsrael has truly established itself as a global leader and a vital \npartner in the international community.\n  It is a great honor to be able to stand today on the Senate floor to \nrecognize the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel. I look forward \nto continuing the close and indispensable partnership between our \ncountry and Israel. Today I wish the people of Israel the greatest \nsuccess, the greatest happiness, and especially peace for the next 60 \nyears and beyond.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, a birthday is an occasion that allows a \nfamily to focus on one of its members and celebrate what is unique and \nspecial about that person. It is time to reflect on major challenges \nmet and major fulfillments achieved. The same is true when we celebrate \nthe birth of a nation, or perhaps more appropriately today, its \nrebirth.\n  The modern State of Israel is 60 years old today. But the idea of \nIsrael was born at the dawn of recorded history. Students of the Bible \nknow that Israel was originally a person--the father of 12 children who \nbecame the Twelve Tribes. Israel became a nation as the progeny of \nthose patriarchs grew in population of more than 1 million. And Israel \nhas become a revered concept, a union of spiritual ideas that has \nbenefited many cultures far from the Middle East.\n  That is what our second President, John Adams, meant when he wrote:\n\n       The Hebrews have done more to civilize man than any other \n     nation. If I were an atheist and believed blind eternal fate, \n     I should still believe that fate had ordained the Jews to be \n     the most essential instrument for civilizing the nations.\n\n  We in the United States have enjoyed that civilizing influence. Much \nof what we believe and assert in our founding documents was drawn from \nancient Jewish roots. The belief in individuals having ultimate value \nis because they are made in the likeness and image of God; respect of \nthe rule of law as the foundation of a just society, not just the power \nof men; and a commitment to the cause of liberation because the rights \nof the people are an inalienable gift from their Creator.\n  So this celebration is not just a milestone for the Jewish people but \nfor all humanity. It is a celebration of the perseverance and faith of \nthe Jewish people, those who have resisted oppression for thousands of \nyears. The story of Israel is a passionate history of the capacity of \nhuman beings to remain true to ideals, to overcome the longest odds, to \nrealize a dream in the midst of those who wish to deny it.\n  Over a century ago, Theodore Herzl put into writing his vision for a \nfree Jewish state. His immortal words: ``If you will it, it is no \nlegend,'' personified the deep faith of the Jewish people and their \nheritage and their role on this planet. Both the United States and \nIsrael were founded on the hope and promise of being ``a light unto \nnations,'' and this is a principle that defines us and binds us \ntogether.\n  For this reason, I believe the anniversary of the State of Israel \nencompasses much more than the rebirth of a nation. As a person of \nJewish heritage and a public servant, this milestone has special \nsignificance for me. It reminds me not just of the added sense of \nresponsibility to work for justice and peace, but of the lesson to \nnever give up in my pursuit of those ideals, no matter the size of the \nobstacle.\n  But in Israel's existence, there is also a lesson of what we are \ncalled to pursue. The Jewish people have withstood much persecution \nthrough the years and endured some of the most horrific crimes against \nhumanity that the world has ever seen. It is our responsibility to \nremind the world what humanity is capable of if we do not remain \nvigilant and fight ignorance and injustice wherever it emerges.\n  Even today, after 60 years of independence and 7 wars fought to \npreserve it, Israel continues to face grave threats. Iran and its \nregional proxies--Hamas and Hezbollah--continue not only to reject a \npeaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, but also to undermine \nthe very existence of Israel as a democratic and Jewish State.\n  The Iranian President continues to blatantly deny the Holocaust of \nthe Jewish people while vowing to create another one. Iran's pursuit of \na nuclear weapon is very real and must not be allowed to succeed. A \nnuclear Iran would dramatically alter the fragile balance in that \nvolatile region and would pose an existential threat to the State of \nIsrael.\n  In 1948, the United States under President Harry Truman made an \nunconditional commitment to the State of Israel. That commitment was \nnot based on the price of gas, economic policy, or partisan politics. \nIt was a moral covenant made in response to generations of mistreatment \nof the Jewish people and a desire for them to have a secure homeland \nfounded upon democratic principles. We believed then, as we do now, \nthat democracy is, in Lincoln's words, ``the last best hope of Earth.'' \nFrom such a commitment there is no out. To deny our support of Israel \nwould be to deny everything America holds sacred and vital. We not only \nhave to hold to our commitment, but we must use our influence around \nthe world to encourage other nations to move in that direction.\n  This commitment dictates that we remain vigilant and watchful over \nthese Iranian threats. I expect the United States to lead the way and \nuse its influence over other countries that may undermine these \nnonproliferation efforts. For this reason I was very disappointed by \nthe administration's insistence in signing a nuclear cooperation \nagreement with Russia. I have written, along with Senator Bayh, a \nletter to the President signed by 32 Senators from both parties in \nwhich we state that taken together, Russia's opposition to effective \nU.N. sanctions against Iran's nuclear weapons program, its ongoing \nassistance to Iran's ballistic missile programs, its exports of fuel to \nIran's Bushehr reactor, and its increasingly abrasive foreign policy, \nall give us cause for concern without finalizing such an agreement.\n  Submitting a 123 agreement with Russia to Congress at this time could \nseverely undermine our policy with respect to Iran at a critical \njuncture. Iran's testing of advanced centrifuges could significantly \nreduce the time it would take to reduce highly enriched uranium for a \nnuclear weapon. We urged the President not to send the agreement to \nCongress until Russia has ended support for Iran's ballistic missile \nprogram and stopped providing advanced conventional weapons and \nassistance to Iran's nuclear fuel cycle program. Russia must also \ncooperate with us to increase meaningful economic pressure on Iran to \nend its defiance of the United Nations Security Council's mandatory \nresolutions to suspend its enrichment of uranium.\n  Improving our commercial ties to Russia may be a national interest. \nIt may be good economically for the United States and for Russia, but \npreventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is a national interest \nof greater importance on which we cannot compromise.\n  When I reflect on Israel at 60, I am excited about Israel's future, \ndespite the ever-present challenges. As David Ben-Gurion said in the \nearly days of the modern Israeli nation, ``Around here, if you don't \nbelieve in miracles, you're not a realist.''\n  The Jewish people truly understand this concept, as there are many \nmiracles that have come together to preserve the Jewish people \nthroughout history, including the one that brought the modern State of \nIsrael into existence. The anniversary of this miracle should be a \njoyous one, and the fact that Israel has now stood firm for 60 years \nshould be celebrated.\n\n[[Page S3945]]\n\n  America should thank God for the heritage of freedom Israel has given \nus. On this day, America should reaffirm its resolve to protect and \nsustain the place and the people who have given us so much. The gift \nIsrael needs from us on its birthday is our gratitude, to be sure, but \nalso our renewed, unshakable commitment to keeping those ancient dreams \nand ideals that we share alive.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is an honor to come to the floor today to \ncelebrate Yom HaAtzmaut, Israel's 60th Independence Day.\n  Today, on its 60th birthday, we recognize that Israel remains an \nisland of openness. Its success belongs to all the Israeli people and \nis more lasting than anything that ever happened on a battlefield.\n  With politics that are open and vibrant, markets that are free and \nfair, and laws that hold for weak and strong alike, for six decades, \nAmerica has been a good friend to Israel. Indeed, it only took us but \n11 minutes to recognize this new state, this new ally, in May 1948.\n  This is a matter imbued with great personal meaning to me, Mr. \nPresident. As my colleagues are aware, my father, Tom Dodd, spent over \na year as executive trial counsel in one of the most remarkable court \ncases the world has ever seen--the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war \ncriminals. He stood face-to-face with men who committed the most \nterrible atrocities imaginable. Indeed, they were so horrible many were \nconvinced they had could not have taken place--that is, until my father \nset out meticulously proving that they had.\n  It would have been impossible to be unchanged through that \nconfrontation with evil, and my father was no different. I know how \noften he spoke of it to me. And I think it was impossible for anyone to \ngo through the Nuremberg Trials without wondering, at some point or \nanother:\n  What if those 6 million had someplace to go; what if there had been a \ncountry to take them in--no questions asked; what if there had been a \nnation willing to stand up for them when no one else did?\n  Only 2 years after my father came back from Nuremberg, 60 years ago \ntoday, that nation was born. So in a small way, I share some of my past \nwith Israel, because my father had his part in the events that proved--\nat the price of tremendous pain--the necessity of a Jewish state. My \nfather learned that necessity, and I learned it through him. In the \nyears since, nothing has dampened the force of that lesson. How could I \nforget?\n  For nearly 60 years America and Israel have been two nations that can \nlook across the gulf of history and space and language, and still see, \nin each other, themselves. That enduring bond is what we celebrate \ntoday, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to speak on the 60th \nanniversary of the founding of the State of Israel, and to congratulate \nthe Israeli people on this historic occasion.\n  It is also an appropriate occasion to note the close and unwavering \nfriendship our two countries have enjoyed over the past 60 years.\n  President Harry Truman formally recognized Israel just 11 minutes \nafter the new country's independence proclamation. Eleven minutes. That \nis perhaps the fastest that anything has ever occurred in this city.\n  Fast doesn't necessarily mean easy, though, and President Truman was \nunder a great deal of pressure, including from his own State \nDepartment, not to support the creation of a Jewish state.\n  But Harry Truman did the right and courageous thing, and for the past \n60 years, Israel has been one of America's closest friends and allies\n  That friendship has persevered, in part because of our dedication to \nmany common values.\n  Israel has a strong and vibrant democratic tradition, and a \nprosperous and innovative free-market economy.\n  In fact, Israel's economy grew faster last year than that of the \nUnited States, Europe, the U.K. or Japan. Such growth stems in part \nfrom more than 3,000 hi-tech companies now operating in Israel.\n  And, I believe, Israel is committed to achieving peace with its \nneighbors. But peace requires security, and the United States still has \na very important role to play to make both of these a reality.\n  The late Congressman Tom Lantos--whom we lost at the beginning of \nthis year--understood this perhaps better than anyone.\n  As the only Holocaust survivor ever elected to the Congress, Tom knew \nwhat Israel's existence meant for Jews the world over, and no one \nadvocated more strongly than he did for continued U.S. support for \nIsrael.\n  The fact that the Israeli foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, spoke at his \nmemorial service here in the Capitol speaks not only to Tom Lantos's \npersonal commitment to Israel, but also to the broader commitment of \nIsrael and the United States to each other as nations and as people.\n  It is a commitment that we must not abandon.\n  The United States must remain engaged diplomatically to ensure that \nthe process begun last fall in Annapolis, the most recent in a string \nof U.S.-led Middle East peace initiatives stretching back over 30 \nyears, continues to move forward.\n  We must work with other countries and the United Nations to prevent \nIran from gaining the ability to develop nuclear weapons that could \nthreaten Israel's security.\n  We must provide appropriate assistance to the Palestinian Authority \nto enable it to secure its own territory and strengthen its democratic \ninstitutions.\n  And we must find a way to stop weapons from making their way into the \nGaza Strip and the hands of those who seek to do Israel harm.\n  Such continued U.S. engagement is imperative if there is any hope for \nlong-term peace between Israel and its neighbors.\n  But hope is the foundation on which Israel was built.\n  It is what enabled people of so many backgrounds and languages to \nspeak with a common voice.\n  It is what enabled them to bring water to a desert and grow crops \nwhere there had only been sand.\n  It is what continues to lead the Israeli people forward, 60 years \nafter its founding.\n  I share that hope for a brighter future--for Israel, for the United \nStates, and for our enduring friendship.\n  Congratulations to Israel on its 60th birthday.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to mark the 60th \nanniversary of the founding of the modern State of Israel. On this \nmomentous occasion, we celebrate a vibrant nation that has thrived \nsince its founding in 1948 under the most difficult circumstances. \nFounded in the aftermath of the Holocaust as a home for Jews around the \nworld, Israel continues to be a beacon and a rare outpost of freedom \nand democracy in a region that knows too little of either. As we take \nthe time to acknowledge the importance of this anniversary, we should \nalso remember those who lost their lives in the fighting that coincided \nwith the birth of this nation. Few, if any, nations have had such \ndifficult births and have overcome such tremendous challenges.\n  As we celebrate the anniversary of one of our strongest allies, the \nstruggle for peace and stability throughout the Middle East continues. \nPeacemaking in this region is no easy task, but we need to nurture the \nprogress developed during the Annapolis Summit and keep working toward \na two-state solution that resolves the decades of turmoil Israel and \nits neighbors have endured. I am hopeful that through a continuing \ndialogue and diligent efforts, we will see a breakthrough that improves \ntrust and cooperation between all actors and provides a framework for a \nlasting peace.\n  The United States and Israel have a unique relationship that both \nAmericans and Israelis cherish. Today, we should celebrate that \nrelationship, which is as strong and deep as ever.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in recognizing \nIsrael's Independence Day--the day Jewish people around the world \nrejoiced after generations of political and religious persecution. \nExactly 11 minutes after Israel's first Prime Minister, David-Ben \nGurion, announced the nation's independence, the United States became \nthe first nation in the world to recognize it.\n  Since that time, Israel and the United States have forged a \nfriendship based on shared ideals and common values--a commitment to \npolitical and\n\n[[Page S3946]]\n\nreligious freedom, the rule of law, democratic governance, and the \npreservation of individual rights. During my first official trip abroad \nas Senator, I traveled to Israel and saw firsthand the sacrifices \nIsraeli people make to protect these principles. This visit helped me \nbetter understand the urgent need for sustainable peace in the Middle \nEast and Israel's vulnerability within the region.\n  The United States shares Israel's desire to protect their thriving \ndemocracy, and we honor our commitment by supporting security efforts \nin Israel. Since 1948, Israel has been a reliable and steadfast ally to \nthe United States, and our support helps to ensure the security of its \nterritory and citizens. A strong and healthy relationship with Israel \nis critical to the endurance of democracy in the greater Middle East \nand the United States will continue to stand with Israel to ensure its \nsurvival, peace and prosperity.\n  I extend my greetings to all those taking part in celebrations to \nmark this historic week for Israel. In my home State of Florida, the \nhome to thousands of individuals of Jewish descent, today is especially \nimportant. It marks the day a permanent home was established for a \npeople who suffered tremendously for generations because of their \nethnicity and religious beliefs.\n  So during this momentous time, I offer the people of Israel and its \nmany friends around the world my best wishes and the hope for continued \nprosperity.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the 2000 year search for a Jewish homeland \nconcluded on May 14, 1948, with the declaration of an independent State \nof Israel. But, the birth of Israel on that day was far from easy. \nPrime Minister David Ben-Gurion made his first radio broadcast the \nfollowing day from an air raid shelter as the precarious new nation \ncame under attack.\n  Even as a war was being launched against their young nation, Israel's \nfounding father took the time to remind the first citizens of Israel \nwhat had been accomplished and what it would take to defend their \ndream. Ben-Gurion said, ``whatever we have achieved is the result of \nthe efforts of earlier generations no less than our own. It is also the \nresult of an unwavering fidelity to our precious heritage, the heritage \nof a small nation that has suffered much, but at the same time has won \nfor itself a special place in the history of mankind because of its \nspirit, faith, and vision.''\n  The United States has played a critical role in the development of \nIsrael over the past 60 years. President Harry S. Truman, the first \nhead of state to grant Israel diplomatic recognition, expressed its \nspecial place in the hearts of Americans as he declared, ``I had faith \nin Israel before it was established, and I have faith in it now. I \nbelieve it has a glorious future before it--not just another sovereign \nnation, but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.'' \nThis special partnership which began with Israel's creation has been \nrepeatedly tested since 1948. The United States has been steadfast in \nour commitment to helping the people of Israel develop their own \neconomy and secure their own peace. We have helped give them the time \nthat their founding fathers knew was needed to secure their future.\n  A decade ago, in celebration of Israel's 50th anniversary, I traveled \nthere for an international conference of Jewish legislators from around \nthe world. In our discussions, I saw then that the philosophy that was \nembraced by Ben-Gurion and other visionary leaders helped Israel become \na dynamic democracy with a thriving economy. In the decade since that \nconference, Israel has come within a few breaths of a peace agreement \nand also experienced episode after episode of violence carried out \nagainst its civilians. Still, Israel's faith and fortitude remain as \nstrong today as they were when the dream was realized six decades ago.\n  In recognition of Israel's remarkable history, I was pleased to be a \ncosponsor of S. Res. 522, which the Senate unanimously passed late last \nmonth. The resolution acknowledges the 60th anniversary of the founding \nof the State of Israel and reaffirms the bonds of friendship and \ncooperation between the United States and Israel. This is a fitting \ntribute to Israel's past, and we all hope that our nations' mutual \ngoodwill augurs well for future positive and peaceful developments in \nIsrael, in the Middle East and around the world.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today joining my colleagues in \ncongratulating our friends in Israel as they celebrate the 60th \nanniversary of their independence and modern-day founding.\n  Sixty years ago, Missouri's own President Harry S. Truman signed the \ntelegram making the United States the first Nation on the Earth to \nrecognize officially the State of Israel. Since that time, Israel and \nthe United States have stood side by side on many issues and have \nshared common bonds and values that unite us still today.\n  I daresay that no country has faced such adversity and strife during \nsuch a short period of time. Our staunchest ally in the region has \npersevered against enemy invasions, random terror attacks, and saber \nrattling throughout its short existence and has grown stronger as a \nresult.\n  As a Member of this body, I have been proud to support joint U.S. and \nIsraeli programs aimed at strengthening our mutual defense and \ncooperation. We are engaged in a war against a common enemy that seeks \nto further its agenda through suicide bombings, the targeting of \ninnocents, and the destruction of the civilized world. The United \nStates and Israel recognize that without freedom, respect for human \nrights, and liberty, we are lost.\n  Today, I congratulate and offer my sincere thanks to the people of \nIsrael for being our ally during trying times and a friend upon whom we \ncan always count.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, may I inquire what is the business before \nthe Senate?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/08/senate-section/article/S3946-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 2284, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2284) to amend the National Flood Insurance Act \n     of 1968, to restore the financial solvency of the flood \n     insurance fund, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Dodd/Shelby amendment No. 4707, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       McConnell amendment No. 4720 (to the text of the bill \n     proposed to be stricken by amendment No. 4707), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Allard amendment No. 4721 (to amendment No. 4720), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Landrieu/Nelson (FL) modified amendment No. 4706 (to \n     amendment No. 4707), to improve the Office of the Flood \n     Insurance Advocate.\n       Nelson (FL) amendment No. 4709 (to amendment No. 4707), to \n     establish a National Catastrophe Risks Consortium and a \n     National Homeowners' Insurance Stabilization Program.\n       DeMint amendment No. 4711 (to amendment No. 4707), to \n     require the Director to conduct a study on the impact, \n     effectiveness, and feasibility of amending section 1361 of \n     the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to include widely \n     used and nationally recognized building codes as part of the \n     flood plain management criteria developed under such section.\n       DeMint modified amendment No. 4710 (to amendment No. 4707), \n     to end the premium subsidy for any property purchased after \n     the date of enactment of this act.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to inform my colleagues we are open \nfor business. I know there are amendments that Members have they would \nlike to be considered. I am more than happy, with my colleague, the \nranking member, Senator Shelby, to try to consider those amendments and \ndeal with them expeditiously.\n  Last evening, we entered a unanimous consent agreement which requires \nthat all amendments be offered,\n\n[[Page S3947]]\n\ndebated, and voted on by the close of business today. The close of \nbusiness today can occur any time between now and midnight. I suspect \nmost Members, knowing there may not be any votes tomorrow--I forget \nexactly what the leader said about that. I think there is a possibility \nof no votes tomorrow depending on the schedule and agenda. If that is \nthe case, if we deal with these amendments between now and the early \npart of the afternoon, we can complete the business of this bill until \nnext week when we will have votes on energy issues before final passage \nof the flood insurance bill.\n  Again, I am willing and anxious to consider the amendments. I know \nseveral people have amendments. They offered some of them last evening \nand debated them to some degree. So we are prepared to enter into a \nlittle more debate and get to some votes. My idea is, to satisfy the \nconvenience of Members, to try to consider three or four of these \namendments and then hold a period of 45 minutes or so to vote on three \nor four items at a time rather than bring Members over every half hour \nfor a 15-minute vote. We will try to deal with several amendments and \nthen have a period of voting before considering the second tranche of \nissues.\n  I know Senator Shelby is in the vicinity. We are here to entertain \nthese proposals.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. What is the pending business of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 4710 to S. 2284.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4716 to Amendment No. 4707\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that amendment be set aside and \namendment 4716 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4716 to amendment No. 4707.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require persons located in flood prone areas to hold flood \n  insurance as a condition for receiving federal disaster assistance)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DISASTER ASSISTANCE.\n\n       No person shall be eligible to receive disaster assistance \n     under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) or the Small Business \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.) relating to damage to a property \n     located in a 100-year floodplain caused by flooding, unless \n     prior to such flooding that person purchased and maintained \n     flood insurance for that property under the national flood \n     insurance program established under chapter I of the National \n     Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4011 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. COBURN. First of all, let me compliment the chairman and ranking \nmember on this bill. They have made some tremendous strides in trying \nto fix this program. The one thing we have not done is we have not \nasked people in this country, who are in flood-prone areas, to actually \nbe responsible. We are going to get about $17 billion and charge it to \nour grandkids because we have to get rid of some debt because the \ninsurance program had not done in the past what we intended it to do. I \nbelieve you have fairly well fixed that for the future--my hope is that \nyou have. I am not convinced of that yet.\n  What this amendment does is requires FEMA and the Small Business \nAdministration to withhold any Federal flood disaster payments and \nassistance to people who have not purchased flood insurance. These are \npeople who reside in a 100-year flood plain zone, meaning that \ncatastrophic flooding is expected to occur once every 100 years. These \nare known as special flood hazard areas.\n  Owners of properties in these flood-prone areas are already required \nby law to have flood insurance. Yet what we have seen is, time and time \nagain, they do not have it. So, in effect, even though there is a \nrequirement for flood insurance to be there, they do not have it, so \nthe cost, in terms of disasters, goes up for the Federal Government.\n  The whole purpose behind this bill in the first place, when it was \nfirst initiated, was to lessen the cost of the American taxpayer in \nterms of disasters so owners of properties in these flood-prone areas \nare required by law to purchase flood insurance if they have a \nfederally backed loan. This amendment would simply ensure that the law \nis enforced.\n  I know this is a hard amendment because what we think about is what \nabout those bad actors, what about those who do not--what we are doing \nto them. But actually we ought to think in the positive, that if, in \nfact, you are supposed to have flood insurance and you do not, how do \nwe ever force everybody to do that unless there is a consequence? The \nconsequence ought to be, if you did not follow the rules of purchasing \nflood insurance when you lived in a 100-year flood plain zone, a high-\nrisk area, then you are asking the rest of the taxpayers not only to \nrebuild your home but to also give you the benefit of not paying a \npremium on flood insurance. Those people in those areas are actually \ntaking advantage of the rest of the American taxpayers if, in fact, \nthey do not follow the law.\n  So this is simply saying: OK, here is the law. You have a federally \nbacked mortgage. Your mortgagor is supposed to require that--as a \nmatter of fact, it was fixed in 1994, I believe, that if you do not, \nthey would. What we have seen in the last disasters is the owner did \nnot, and the mortgage backer did not. Consequently, we had a large \nnumber of people who had no flood insurance.\n  Now, all this amendment says is, OK, we are putting you on notice \nright now, if you have a federally backed mortgage and you are in a \nflood plain zone and you do not have flood insurance, you do not get \nthe disaster relief. You do not get the grant. You do not get what \neverybody who follows the rules gets.\n  The problem with not accepting this amendment is we will undermine \nthe rest of the flood insurance program, the very good work that the \nchairman and ranking member did on this bill, because if there is no \nconsequence to not following the law, not buying insurance, why will \nanybody buy the insurance? In other words, if we are still going to \npony up the money, what is the incentive to get them to do that? I know \nthe chairman and the ranking member are concerned about that.\n  Some statistics are real important. On the repetitive loss \nproperties, what we know is that 1 percent of the properties in this \ncountry over the last 15 years account for about 34 percent of all of \nthe expenditures. In other words, they have been damaged time and time \nagain. And the chairman and the ranking member have done a good job in \nterms of addressing how we fix that in the outyears. But when one-third \nof the money goes for 1 percent of the homes, something is very wrong.\n  All this amendment is designed to do is to bring them forward so we \nlessen this amount. More than 50,000 of these repetitive loss \nproperties have flood coverage right now but 61,000 do not; 61,000 of \nthe repetitive loss properties have no flood insurance right now.\n  So how do we make them do it? Where is the teeth to make them do it, \nother than to know that next time, unless they have flood insurance, \nthey are not going to get the benefit the rest of the American \ntaxpayers get in terms of helping them out of a jam. Ultimately, what \nthis does is it incentivizes us to have people take risks that would \nnot otherwise take risks because they know we have their back. All this \namendment says is, be an adult; participate in carrying some of the \nrisk.\n  So when over 50 percent of the repetitive loss properties have no \nflood insurance, I would like to know how we are going to get them to \nget it under this bill if there is no teeth to make them do it.\n  Now, I have every intention, as I have spoken to the chairman and the \nranking member, of withdrawing this amendment. But my hope would be \nthat in conference you would address this incentive issue because I \nbelieve right now there is a large incentive not\n\n[[Page S3948]]\n\nto insure their property because we have their back and there is no \nhard penalty to do that.\n  If in fact I have a home and it is one of the repetitive loss \nproperties and I do not buy flood insurance, we have a hurricane or a \nstorm and it is damaged and I know I can still get it fixed, why am I \ngoing to buy the flood insurance? Especially, let's say, I do not have \na loan on it. Let's say I am down there. I am in a very high risk area. \nI do not have any loan on it and, to me, I know if I get a flood, no \nproblem; the Government is going to back me up.\n  So what we are doing is sending a signal to the people basically who \nhave no mortgage: The rest of the American people are going to insure \nyou for your flood. And I do not think that is right.\n  I will ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment. I think the \namendment would markedly strengthen what this bill is trying to \naccomplish. My hope would be that in conference, if you do not like my \nlanguage, you at least put something into the bill that will have some \nteeth that forces good behavior and forces those who own the properties \nto actually have some responsibility for the properties. I am not \nagainst us helping to create an insurance market. I am not sure this is \nthe best way to do it. But we have certainly made big strides to \nimprove the bill.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 4716 Withdrawn\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4716) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to respond to the Senator from \nOklahoma and commend him for his efforts in this area.\n  What Senator Dodd and I and other Members, including the Presiding \nOfficer at the moment, who is involved in banking issues and insurance, \nand so forth, know is that this flood insurance program is bankrupt, as \ndoes the Senator from Oklahoma. It is not working. And what we are \ntrying to do is move it toward an actuarially sound basis.\n  The Senator's suggestion is something I think we ought to consider as \nwe move along down the road because we want to make sure nobody beats \nthe system. In other words, the more people who are involved in the \nflood insurance program, proper mapping is going to mean lower premiums \nto everybody. And the problem, in the long run, as we have \ncatastrophes, tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes--well, in this case \nfloods and water--that the insurance would take care of it rather than \nthinking, as the Senator from Oklahoma says: Well, I do not have to \ninsure you; the Government, the taxpayer, the people will take care of \nme in the end.\n  I think that is what we are trying to prevent. I think the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma has a very good point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in response to Senator Coburn's earlier \ncomments, I thank him for his courtesy in withdrawing the amendment. He \nis raising a very legitimate issue about how we get greater compliance, \nas Senator Shelby pointed out, and achieve greater actuarial soundness \nin a program that is in desperate need of that.\n  The bill does something else. In fact, we voted on it last evening. I \nbelieve Senator Landrieu and Senator Dorgan offered an amendment that \nwould have stripped out the mandatory requirements of people being \nrequired to pay premiums if they live in these high-risk areas. That \namendment was defeated pretty soundly here. It is less than a dollar a \nday, about $316, I think, to a maximum of $350 a year under our bill \nfor about 350,000 dollars' worth of coverage: $250,000 for the \nproperty, $100,000 for contents.\n  The House bill actually goes out a bit higher. Senator Vitter wanted \nto raise that number. Senator Shelby and I opposed that amendment. I am \nnot unsympathetic to Senator Vitter's suggestion in certain high-cost \nareas that $250,000 ought to be a bit higher.\n  But the point Senator Coburn is making is that we want to get people \nhere to contribute. We have 25 percent of the claims that are coming \nfrom these risky areas where only 1 percent of policies are actually \nbeing paid. So one out of every four dollars that is going out for \ncoverage under the flood insurance program is in these areas, and yet \nless than 1 percent of the premiums are being paid out of those areas.\n\n  So, clearly, if you are going to be actuarially sound, you get that \nmany claims out of that area, you have to get more compliance. How do \nyou do that? Our bill does not go as far as Senator Coburn's does, but \nin our bill we require, as we do under a lot of similar areas, that the \nbanks be required to collect these premiums, in fact, even hold them in \nescrow so we have a better assurance that we are going to get a lot \nmore compliance with that approach.\n  But I am certainly sympathetic to the goals of ensuring that we get \nas much compliance as possible, and how you do that is a legitimate \ndebate. I appreciate his raising the issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dodd. I think when you \nfixed this in 1994 or 1997 is when you required the banks on the \nmortgage to have a notice and pay it and then add to it. But it \nobviously was not enough teeth to get us up to where we need to be. So \nI think we need something stronger than that.\n  Overall--and this is no reflection on the good work that has been \ndone on this bill but we have to ask ourselves--we are talking about \n$30 billion with this bill. That is going to actually go against the \nTreasury. We are going to have $17 billion that we are going to kiss \noff. We are going to say the people who are living in these flood-prone \nareas, because their insurance did not truly reflect--we did not have \nit spread broadly enough, $17 billion of it we cannot pay back, so we \nare going to forgive that.\n  Well, what does forgiving that mean? What that means is we are going \nto take the money from the Treasury, we are not going to charge it to \nthe National Flood Insurance Program, but someone is going to have to \npay that off. And who is going to pay that off? It is going to be our \nkids. And there is almost $9 billion in interest that is going to be \nnot paid off, so we are going to charge that to our kids. Then there is \nanother $3 billion still, I understand, to come from the Katrina-Rita-\nrelated storms in terms of payments that are also going out.\n  So what we are going to have is $30 billion, because the program was \nnot actuarially sound in the past, that now we are saying to our kids \nand grandkids we are going to make actuarially sound, and they are \ngoing to pay.\n  So what we are doing with this bill--and, again, it is not an \nindictment. You made a lot of headway, but there has to be another way \nto fix this rather than charge it to our kids. So when you take this \n$30 billion, on top of the 10 we have now and the $74 trillion that is \ncoming, we have a significant debt in terms of being fair to the next \ngeneration. This bill underlies and forgives all the debt to the \nTreasury, and it translates into roughly $30.2 billion. That is how \npoorly the program worked in the past.\n  Again, I think we have made major improvements to the bill. But I \nbelieve it is important enough for us to vote on whether we want to \nsend another $30 billion toward our kids rather than make people who \nhave homes in flood-prone areas who are getting the benefit from it pay \nfor a portion of the cost.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that the substitute amendment \nviolates section 201 of S. Con. Res 21 of the 110th Congress and ask \nfor the yeas and nays associated with that, according to however the \nchairman would like to schedule votes.\n  I know he will make a motion to waive the point of order. That is \nexpected. But I would like to have a vote on that, if I could.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor the consideration of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n\n[[Page S3949]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act with respect to the Coburn budget point of order \noccur at 12 noon today, with 2 minutes of debate prior to the vote \nequally divided and controlled by myself and Senator Coburn or our \ndesignees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would like to make one more point. Politics is \npolitics, but in the realm of politics the long term is what is getting \nready to happen in this country because we are on an unsustainable \ncourse. I believe we have to be guardians for the future. And I believe \nin waiving the pay-go rules we are not doing that; that we are not a \nguardian for the future.\n  If you think about $30 billion, you are asking every person in this \ncountry this year to pay an extra $100 because this program was not \nfunded and arranged properly.\n  What we also ought to consider is making sure we never do this again. \nAnd I would hope that when and if this budget point of order is waived \nthe chairman and ranking member will put something in the bill that \nprohibits us from going back and ever waiving debt for this program \nagain.\n  He wants it actuarially sound, I know that. I know the ranking member \nwants it actuarially sound. But it is truly unfair, when we spend \n$28,500 per household at the Federal Government level and the median \nincome in this country is $42,000 and we are already spending 70 \npercent of that at the Federal Government level and a third of it we \nare not paying for, we are borrowing from our children, to add on \nanother $30 billion. What we are talking about is opportunity. We don't \nwant to be tough enough now to not take opportunity away from our kids. \nSo the choice is, can we have what we want now and it not hurt our \nchildren. The fact is, we can't. We are hurting our kids when we \nborrow, when we forgive this money. What we should be charging this \nmoney to is to the people who have benefited from the coverage. That is \nwho ought to be paying for it. That is who got the flood insurance at a \nfalsely low rate. My hope is that we think long term, not short term. I \nknow you have done that to a great extent in the bill. But my hope is \nthat somehow when you are in conference, that you might put some type \nof prohibition of ever waiving the debt again, to force the program to \nalways be actuarially sound. If we could do that, we would not ever get \nto this point again. I know the chairman doesn't want us to get to \nwhere we are waiving this debt again, which will force the flood \ninsurance program to be on the same footing as every other insurance \ncompany.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member for taking two of my \namendments, one a study on reinsurance. The reinsurance we have right \nnow is the American taxpayer. That is who is going to do the \nreinsurance this time of $30 billion. I am appreciative that they \nconsidered this and accepted it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. Let me underscore the \npoint that, some 23 years ago, I was a new Member of this institution \nsitting in that last chair over in the corner, and I offered a pay-as-\nyou-go budget. I think I got 24 votes in 1983 or 1984. I have strong \nfeelings about whether we will be accountable and whether we pay for \nwhat we want to do. My colleague from Oklahoma certainly raises a point \nI have raised for as long as I have been here and tried legislatively \nto insist upon some accountability in how we do things. With this \nprogram, obviously the problem we are in is by attaching these \nadditional costs onto the premium cost today, we make it prohibitive \nfor a lot of people. So we were faced with a choice which was not one I \nwould have preferred. But we have ourselves in a position in this \ncountry today where we are spending almost that amount of money every \nmonth on the conflict in Iraq, and we are not paying for it, something \nHarry Truman would not have tolerated. In the war in Korea, he said we \nwould go to Korea provided the American taxpayer was willing to pay for \nit.\n  Every 8 weeks we are accumulating a debt and passing it on to my 3-\nyear-old. The Senator knows I have young children. Every 8 weeks we are \nasking my daughter to assume the financial responsibility of this \nconflict. In addition to this program, we are trying to make a \ndifference in people's lives, where they may lose their homes and their \nlife's possessions. That is certainly one I would like to see us \naccount for, but we are facing a situation today where I have to try \nand move this along. But I would hope that on a whole host of these \nissues, where we are talking about deficit financing or financing \nthings without paying for them, that we would apply the same standards \nso we have this kind of uniformity to our concerns. And certainly, the \n$2 billion every week, the $12 billion every month, the $24 to $30 \nbillion every 2 months is another example of what happens when we ask \nthe American taxpayer in the future to assume a responsibility. It is a \nlegitimate point the Senator raises. I identify with it. In my tenure, \nI have tried to do something about it. Hopefully, we have done that, \nSenator Shelby and I.\n  I appreciate his kind comments about our effort in this bill to put \nthis program on the kind of footing that never causes us to come back \nhere again under similar circumstances and make a similar request for \nexcusing a responsibility that FEMA had to borrow from the Federal \nGovernment to meet that $17 billion worth of obligations after the \nstorms of 2005, which devastated a good part of the country.\n  At the appropriate time, we will have a vote on the Senator's motion. \nIn the meantime, we have some other amendments that I think are coming. \nI know Senator Nelson and Senator DeMint and others have some \namendments. I am happy to consider those as soon as they come over.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I want the record to show I voted against the last \nsupplemental because it was not paid for. No. 2, it had $27 billion of \nextraneous spending that was not paid for either that was offered by \nthe Appropriations Committee. It has to start somewhere. I am OK with \nit starting with me. I don't earmark anything back to Oklahoma. I look \nat every appropriations bill and see if it is wise. So consequently, I \nvote for few appropriations bills because they are not wise, with the \nwaste that is in the Federal Government.\n  One final point. According to GAO, IGs, and the Congressional \nResearch Service, we have $300 billion of waste a year in the Federal \nGovernment. The Congress didn't do anything about it. We have plenty of \nways to pay for the war, pay for this, and do other things, if we do \nthe hard work of oversight and make the hard choices about prioritizing \nwhat is important. But we find that very difficult to do as a body. I \nam worried that we find that because we are not thinking long term. We \nare thinking short term.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I made this point about an hour ago. We all \nare familiar with what happens toward the end of the week here. I know \nMembers are asking me what time we will be adjourning. That is a \nleadership decision, obviously. But we are required now, under the \nunanimous consent agreement of last evening, that all amendments will \nbe considered by the close of business today. As I pointed out earlier, \nthat close of business could occur at any point between now and \nmidnight. But I suspect most Members are making plans to probably head \nback to their respective States for Mother's Day weekend sometime late \nthis afternoon or early evening. If you have amendments on this bill, I \nurge you to come to the floor and offer them. Coming over at 3 o'clock, \nthere is no guarantee that you are going to have the opportunity to \nmake the case on behalf of the proposal, to the extent you would like.\n\n[[Page S3950]]\n\n  I urge Members on both sides to come to the floor. I appreciate the \nfact that last evening several did make their case, and we are \nscheduling votes for early this afternoon on those matters. In the \nmeantime, I would like to line up other votes on these matters so we \ncould conclude work on this bill at a reasonable hour this afternoon \nthat would allow Members to meet their travel obligations. In the \nabsence of that, we may be here until very late this evening, which I \nknow will throw a monkey wrench into people's plans. We are here. We \nhave been here. We will be here. But we have been in a quorum call \nwaiting for Members to come over with their ideas. Coming around 4 or 5 \nthis afternoon and wondering whether we are going to leave 15 minutes \nlater is not going to happen. I urge Members now to be here and make \ntheir case or let us know that you don't intend to offer the amendment, \nin which case we can clear the decks and get to the few votes we have \nremaining and move on. One way or the other, we are happy to accept.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 4709 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw amendment No. 4709.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4707\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the motion to waive.\n  Who seeks time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I should begin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me first of all say on this motion by \nour colleague from Oklahoma that Senator Shelby and I, and I believe \nmost of us here, don't have a philosophical disagreement. I think we \nall appreciate the fact that we have ourselves in a situation where we \nhave massive deficits that are growing by the hour. We have seen it in \na number of areas. This is one in which we are actually forgiving a \ndebt. Obviously, to do so, it is going to require at some point for us \nto pay for this debt and obligation. Senator Coburn says we ought to be \ndoing that under the pay-go rules. As someone who has over the years \nauthored, in fact, legislation requiring pay-as-you-go proposals, I am \nvery sympathetic to this idea. I would like to see us apply it more \nuniformly in many ways.\n  Senator Shelby and I are doing our best to take this program, which \nis absolutely critical, and to put it on a sound actuarial footing and, \nby doing so, move us forward. We can't do that if we don't have an \nexcuse, if you will, on this debt that is out there today. We have \nraised the cost of premiums to a prohibitive level.\n  So I am moving to waive this point of order the Senator from Oklahoma \nis making, with the full understanding that it is a legitimate point he \nis making. But if we are going to succeed with this program and get it \ndone, we can't do otherwise. We will be stuck with a program that will \nbe far too costly.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to support us on the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a great choice. We can prove to \nthe American people we either really care about the budget or not. This \nviolates pay-go rules. We shouldn't send $30 billion to our grandkids. \nWe ought to take it from some of the excess we have today.\n  I agree Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby have done a good job on this, \nbut I don't think our grandchildren ought to pay because we designed a \nprogram in 1977 and modified it in 1994 and it still doesn't work and \nthen have them pay $40 billion. We ought to enforce the pay-go rules, \nand we ought to come up with another way to pay for this money.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the point of order under section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21 against \nthe Dodd substitute amendment.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton) \nand the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain) and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4734\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and I call up amendment No. 4715, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4715, as modified, to amendment 4707.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, we have a window here. I see Senator Thune \nand he has the possibility of offering his amendment. I think Senator \nBoxer wants to express herself on that. She may be on her way over. If \nmy colleague from South Dakota is prepared to offer his amendment, or \ntalk about it, that would be helpful. Anybody else who has amendments \nwho would like to offer them--I see the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Connecticut, how \nmany amendments are remaining on this bill, based on what he knows at \nthis time?\n  Mr. DODD. I am glad the Senator clarified that. We have about five or \nsix, based on what I know. There will be five or six votes at the most, \nas of now.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am still trying to determine whether I can successfully \noffer an amendment. I know I have a right to offer it, but whether it \nis successful----\n  Mr. DODD. That is the Senator's problem.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make a point again to the Senator \nfrom Connecticut and see if there is any mutual understanding on these \nissues.\n  To use one example, we had a city that was completely evacuated in my \nState by a flood 10 years ago--actually 11 years ago now. It was the \nlargest evacuation of any city since the Civil War. A city of 50,000 \nwas completely evacuated because of a flood. In the middle of that \nflood, there was a fire in downtown Grand Forks, ND. A city that was \nflooded and evacuated was on fire.\n  In the intervening 10 years, there has been a flood protection plan, \na very expensive one, $416 million, built to protect that city. The \nresidents of that city, I believe, paid 45 percent of the cost of that \nflood protection plan.\n  As I read title VII--I believe it is on page 9 of the legislation--\nwhat is being said now is this city that has a 250-year flood plan, \nthat is to protect against a 250-year flood, will be told: By the way, \nyou residents, yes, you paid a lot of money for flood protection. It is \nblue ribbon, first rate, first class protection against a 250-year \nflood, but we have now decided you have to ante up $1 a day to buy \nflood insurance.\n  They are going to ask the question: What is this flood protection we \npaid for? We were told this was blue-ribbon flood protection. I know \nyou have a 250-year flood protection levee; now we want you to buy \nflood insurance.\n  Is there anything in the legislation that allows FEMA to look at this \nsituation, here is a levee that gives 100-year protection, here is a \nlevee that gives 250-year protection, and here is one that doesn't give \nany at all? We have different kinds of insurance. Would FEMA be allowed \nto take a look at a new state-of-the-art, blue-ribbon, 250-year flood \nprotection device and say those folks don't need to buy flood \ninsurance, they just paid a substantial portion of the cost of a \nsignificant new flood protection device?\n  I ask the Senator from Connecticut, what is his intention with \nrespect to that provision of the law?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from North \nDakota. I am familiar with the community. As my colleague will recall, \nat his invitation, I gave the commencement address at the University of \nNorth Dakota a few years ago and arrived a day or so early. I had an \nopportunity to visit the mayor and actually see the city that went \nthrough that remarkable devastation of flood and fire, simultaneously, \nin fact, and the rather remarkable recovery and great spirit that \nexists in that community.\n  Here is what we are doing. There are those who believe if you have \nany kind of a dike, dam or levee, that you should not have to pay for \nflood insurance. We cannot tolerate that in a sense. We have 130 dams, \nlevees, and dikes that are at great risk of one kind or another in \nthese residual risk areas. About 25 percent all the claims against the \nflood insurance program come out of these residual risk areas, not the \ncoastline. Clearly, having dikes, levees, and dams help.\n  The fact is, the reason there is a dike, levee or dam is because it \nis in a residual risk area. Anything made by man or nature, there is no \nguarantee in perpetuity it is going to survive, even the 250 years \nabout which we talked. What better example than Louisiana. We spent \nmillions of dollars on a system down there that didn't work, \nultimately. The idea of having someone pay a maximum of $350,000 worth \nof insurance--actually, the average cost is $316 a year. Less than a \ndollar a day for this kind of coverage is something we feel is \ndispersing that risk, bringing the cost in for the program.\n  Let me say to my colleague from North Dakota, he makes an interesting \npoint. We are, in fact, in discussions with the other members of the \ncommittee on this very point, where you might be able to prorate, it \nseems to me, some of these costs based on the quality of that dam, dike \nor levee. I cannot subscribe to the notion of eliminating it \naltogether, but certainly when you have a state-of-the-art facility, \nthen as a result of that, there is less of a risk. There still is risk. \nSo you may bring down the cost of that risk.\n  We are negotiating about doing that as a way to recognize those kinds \nof contributions. So there would be some prorating.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand the notion of residual risk, and I think the \nSenator from Connecticut will agree those residual risks are different \nin different circumstances. I am not suggesting if you are behind a \nlevee, wherever that levee is, you shouldn't have to buy flood \ninsurance. But I am suggesting if you exhausted yourself and your \ncommunity and your region producing a state-of-the-art flood control \nplan and spent a lot of money doing so, including your own money, and \nyou are now told you have a 250-year protection, that when somebody \nfrom FEMA comes in and says, it doesn't matter a bit, it is irrelevant \nyou built that, it\n\n[[Page S3952]]\n\ndoesn't matter, you are going to be required to purchase what our \nfriends from the committee have now enacted--if my colleague from \nConnecticut is saying this legislation either will or, as we might want \nto change it, could allow FEMA to take a look at that brand new 250-\nyear flood protection plan and say, in this circumstance you have \nminimal requirements----\n  Mr. DODD. I think it is a very good idea and suggestion and one about \nwhich I have not had a chance to get into a long conversation with \nSenator Shelby. I like the concept, the idea.\n  Remember this. The insurance program, putting aside whether you think \nthe cost is high or low, without the insurance program, and if things \ndon't work and you lose your home, there is no program of Federal \ndisaster relief that rebuilds your home.\n  What the insurance program does for $316 a year is it gives you a \nchance to rebuild your home and the contents you lose. There is no \ndisaster relief program the Senator from North Dakota and I have been a \npart of that provides that kind of assistance to homeowners affected by \nnatural disaster.\n\n  This insurance program has great value to these people who live in \nthese areas. It is a cost but actually has a value. I think the numbers \nought to be higher than $350,000. I live in a higher cost area. So a \n$250,000 home in my State is less than the median cost of a home. I \nwould like to see those values go up again. I presume in North Dakota \n$250,000 may be more a median cost of a home.\n  The idea that you are going to get for that $316 a year $350,000 back \nto rebuild that home of yours has value. I think prorating, based on \nthe condition of dikes and levees, makes good sense. We will try to \nwork on it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We don't have a problem with the merit and value of flood \ninsurance. I think the program makes sense. We have an agreement, as it \nis currently written, and I hope we can perhaps modify it in a \nmanagers' amendment. On page 9, section 7, it appears to me FEMA would \nbe required to come in and say: Ah ha, you are behind that levee; \ntherefore, you must purchase this insurance. I hope what the Senator \nfrom Connecticut intends with this is that it be risk based because \nthere will clearly be a different risk attached to someone who has a \nbrand new levee system that they exhausted themselves paying for over \nthe last 10 years. It is all done. They cut the ribbon, they \ncelebrated, they had the town band out, in fact, but they are told by \nFEMA: That is not a factor.\n  Mr. DODD. I think we are on the same page.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let's see if we can craft something between now and the \nend of the day. I would not offer the amendment; the Senator from \nConnecticut will offer it, and it represents our combined views about \nthis issue.\n  I appreciate my colleague having this colloquy.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. It is a very good suggestion; once \nagain, a very good suggestion.\n  The door is open for business. If anyone has amendments, we would \nlike to have Members come over and offer the amendment. In the \nmeantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, I withhold.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for 5 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Oil and Gas Prices\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to make a point. I don't know yet \nif there is a markup this afternoon of the Appropriations full \ncommittee. If there is, I am intending to offer a couple amendments to \nthat markup. I wish to describe one amendment that I plan to offer, and \nthat relates to dealing with oil and gas prices.\n  The price of oil is way beyond that which is justifiable by simple \nsupply and demand conditions. It is bouncing around like a yo-yo up \naround $120 and as much as $124 a barrel of oil. There is no \njustification in the supply and demand of oil for that price. It is \ndamaging to the economy, and it hurts a series of industries in this \ncountry. The airline industry and trucking industry are just two \nexamples. It hurts every American as they pull up to the gas pump to \nfigure out where they are going to get the money to pay for the \ngasoline price.\n  What is happening? At the moment, a couple of things are happening.\n  One, we have an unbelievable bubble of speculation in the futures \nmarket. I have people say to me: That is not true. It is true. It is \nhard to justify the current price of oil given the physical elements of \nthe market today. What we have is people entering the commodities \nfutures market that have no interest in buying oil. They buy oil and \nsell it. They never take possession of it. They buy what they will \nnever get from people who never had it. They are making money on both \nsides of the transaction because they are waging. To put it plainly, \nthey are gambling. That is speculation. We have an orgy of speculation \non the futures market.\n  We had people testify in the Senate and House that it adds $20 to $30 \nto a barrel of oil. Should we sit back and watch a bubble develop and \nsay, ``Whatever the consequences, that is fine?'' The answer is no, of \ncourse, we should not. Buy stock on margin and it will cost you a 50-\npercent margin requirement. If you want to buy oil on margin in the \nfutures market for crude oil, then you pay 5 to 7 percent.\n  We have hedge funds neck deep in the futures market. We have \ninvestment banks neck deep in the futures market. Are they are oil \nexperts? Do they want to own oil? No, they want to speculate on oil and \nmake money.\n  The fact is, it is damaging this country's economy. We ought to wring \nthat speculation out of those commodity markets. We ought to be \nincreasing margin requirements. I know it is hard to do, but we ought \nto do that. When we see this kind of speculation damaging our country \nby driving up oil prices and driving up gasoline prices, we ought to do \nsomething about it.\n  Second, we are now putting oil underground right now. We are taking \nsweet light crude oil off the Gulf of Mexico and sticking it \nunderground in something called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I \nthink it is fine to have the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if we run into \ntrouble. It is nice to have an oil reserve. Yet, that reserve is 97 \npercent full. Still, this administration is taking up to 70,000 barrels \na day, every single day, and sticking it underground.\n  They say it doesn't affect the price. Of course, it affects the \nprice. We had testimony before the Energy Committee that because it is \na much more valuable subset of oil, called sweet light crude, that it \nhas as much as a 10-percent impact on the price of oil and gasoline. \nSo, of course, it affects the price.\n\n  I think it is nuts for this country to be taking $124 barrel of oil \nand saying let's stick that underground and save it for a rainy day. I \ntell you what, it is a rainy day these days when you have to pay this \nprice at the pump. It is a rainy day these days when you see four, five \nairlines go belly up because they cannot afford the fuel. It is a rainy \nday these days when truckers say that we have to park the truck because \nwe can't afford the fuel. An entire industry is at risk.\n  The fact is, we have to do something about it. I mentioned two \nthings, both of which are tangible and real and both of which are \ncausing this increase, at least a significant part, in my judgment, in \nthe increase in the ramp-up of the price of oil and gasoline.\n  The President believes that there is not much anybody can do in the \nnear term. This is not a time to wring our hands, mop our brow, gnash \nour teeth and say there is not much anybody can do. This is a time for \nus to try to figure out what is happening and try to respond to it. It \nis doing great damage to our economy.\n  In the longer term, I believe that there are things we need to do. We \nare unbelievably dependent on overseas oil. We are unbelievably \ndependent on Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq and Venezuela. Sixty percent of \nour oil comes from offshore. As I described before and others have, we \nstick straws in this planet and suck oil out of the planet. Every day \nwe suck out 85 million barrels of oil. One-fourth of that has to be \nused in this country.\n  Let me say that again. The appetite of oil is this: One-fourth of all \nthe oil we pull out of the planet every day is used in this little \nplace called the United States of America. Sixty percent we get from \noutside our country. Seventy percent of it is used by vehicles. We have \na lot to do.\n\n[[Page S3953]]\n\n  After 32 years, we finally mandated an increase of 10 miles per \ngallon in 10 years on a range of vehicles. We also need to produce \nmore. I and three others in this Chamber got the law changed to allow \nus to go into lease 181 in the Gulf of Mexico and finally produce more \noil and gas. Frankly, we ought to open up more of the Gulf of Mexico. \nThat is the greatest potential reserve on the Outer Continental Shelf. \nI and three others introduced the legislation and got it passed and \nopened up lease 181. If you look at the Gulf of Mexico, California, and \nAlaska, and the East Coast, the greatest potential reserves are in the \nGulf of Mexico.\n  We need to conserve more and produce more. We need greater efficiency \nfor all we use, and we especially need to move into renewables.\n  I understand we have to do all of that. At the moment and in the \nshort run, we have to take specific steps that will put downward \npressure on prices. John Maynard Keynes said, ``In the long we are all \ndead.'' That is an economist talking. We can talk about the long run \nhere, but let's also talk about the short run right now.\n  What can we do to address something that most Americans understand is \na very serious problem? The issue is price of gasoline? I am just \nsaying this, and there are those who disagree with me. Look at the \ncommodities market and look at this orgy of speculation. This is a \nbubble. Wouldn't it be nice if someone had looked at that bubble as it \nbuilt with respect to home mortgages and home prices? We have seen a \nlot of bubbles. We have seen the tech bubble. We have seen the bubble \nin home prices. Every bubble bursts. This one will. But in the \nmeantime, how many additional casualties will we see on the side of the \nroad? Look at what's happening with American families, American \nbusiness, American industries. How many casualties? The big integrated \noil companies go to the bank with a ``permagrin.'' They can't stop \nsmiling because they are depositing our money in their bank accounts. \nBut it is not only the big integrated oil companies, it is the OPEC \ncountries. They are going to the bank everyday with our money because \nwe recycle this money to provide for a bank account for the Saudis and \nothers just like we do for the major integrated companies.\n  I do not think there is any justification for this price. This \nCongress is prepared to act. Senator Reid and others have joined \ntogether, and I am a part of it to deal with this issue of putting oil \nunderground. We are going to stop it in its tracks. I introduced a \nbipartisan bill a couple of months ago to suspension the filling of the \nSPR. Our entire caucus is also behind the proposition. We believe it's \ntime to begin to wring this speculation out of the futures markets and \nstop this insidious rise in oil prices.\n  While we need to move beyond oil, right now we still need oil. There \nis no question about that. We need to find more, and we need to use \nless, to the extent we can. That means more production and more \nconservation. In the meantime, when markets do not work and people are \ndoing things that have no common sense at all, such as putting oil \nunderground when oil is $120 a barrel, then this Congress has a \nresponsibility to act. We need to get things straight. Let's set things \nright; let's stand up here on the side of the American consumer and on \nthe side of American businesses who need this energy.\n  One final point: In yesterday's The Wall Street Journal, they wrote \none of those editorials that must make those folks grin like Cheshire \ncats as they sit there with their gray suits on, behind horn-rimmed \nglasses, deciding what to write next in the Wall Street Journal about \nthe Senate. Did you see what those folks did in the Senate--Dorgan, \nSchumer, and others? What they did is said we should put pressure on \nthe Saudis because the Saudis want to buy precision weapons for their \nown security from us. We should say that maybe they need to be \nproducing more oil. Of course, the Wall Street Journal had an \napoplectic seizure over that.\n  Here are the points. The Saudis are producing 800,000 barrels a day \nless than they did 2 years ago. It is not lost on them what this is \ndoing to price. It is not lost on them, or it should not be, what this \nis doing to our country. They are pumping 800,000 barrels a day less \nthan they did 2 years ago and then they say to this administration we \nwish to buy sophisticated weapons from the United States because we \nhave our strategic military concerns in our region. Maybe we say to the \nSaudis: The United States has strategic concerns in our country as \nwell. Why are you pumping 800,000 barrels a day less when you could be \nputting more oil on the world market? Partnerships work both ways.\n  I am very concerned about arming the Middle East. I am going to speak \nabout that at some point later. But our point to the Saudis and the \npoint in the Middle East was simple. If you are pumping 800,000 barrels \na day less per day and then demand weapons from the U.S. without \nreciprocating then it's not going to work.\n  That is a long statement to say it is time for us to act. Senator \nReid, Senator Klobuchar, other Members and I have decided we are not \ngoing to sit here like potted plants. When something is happening in \nthe futures market and when something is happening to take oil off the \nsupply to put it in the SPR, then we have a responsibility to act. I \nintend to be a significant part of that.\n  If we have the markup in the Senate Appropriations Committee this \nafternoon, I intend to offer a couple amendments at that appropriations \nmarkup. Unfortunately, I understand it may well be canceled this \nafternoon.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank Senator Dorgan for his leadership in this \narea. He was ahead of this. Before the crisis got to the pocketbooks of \nAmericans, he was predicting what has happened. He has been proactive \nabout this.\n  But can the Senator talk about the strategic reserve, the petroleum \nreserve? I know there is some bipartisan support for doing this, is \nthat correct, for stopping putting our oil there?\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is the case. I have introduced legislation here in the \nSenate. Fifty-one Democratic Senators, including Senator Obama and \nSenator Clinton, signed a letter to the President saying stop sticking \noil underground for the rest of 2008. Also, a couple of weeks ago our \nRepublican colleague, Senator Hutchison, led on a letter to the White \nHouse saying, yes, we agree. We ought to stop sticking oil underground \nat this time. There were 15 Republicans who sent that letter. Further, \nSenator McCain said it was nuts to stick oil in the SPR while on the \ncampaign trail. When you add that up, that is 67 people in the Senate. \nThat is a veto-proof majority.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. How much is it expected to save? Is there an immediate \nimpact we might expect in savings per gallon?\n  Mr. DORGAN. There are several views on that, but we know it is a lot \nmore than zero like the Administration assumes. We don't know exactly \nwhat the savings would be. We do know this: If today 70,000 barrels, \nespecially the sweet light crude--which is the most valuable subset of \noil--were put back into this marketplace, then people have testified in \nthe Senate that it could impact as much as 10 percent of the price of \noil and gasoline.\n  We know it would impact the price. Some say 70,000 barrels is not \nvery much given what is used in a day. It is true, 70,000 barrels is \nnot all that much, but this is sweet light crude which is very \ndifferent. We had an economist named Dr. Verleger testify before the \nEnergy Committee and make that very point.\n  This is a more important point. There are plenty of Members of the \nSenate who have now joined on this.\n  I was just informed the markup starting at 2 this afternoon has been \ncanceled. This is where I was going to offer this amendment, so the \namendment I expect to be able to offer will now wait until next week. \nWe will get this done. We cannot sit around and allow things to happen. \nWe have to make things happen, good things happen for this country and \nfor the economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            RENEWABLE ENERGY\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am going to speak on another topic\n\n[[Page S3954]]\n\nwhich is somewhat related to Israel's 60th anniversary. It is about \nenergy security and climate change and the potential economic value to \nour country. The way it is related to Israel is this. As we look at the \nfact that we spend $600,000 a minute on foreign oil, much of that money \ngoing to countries that we might not want to be doing business with if \nwe had a choice, Israel, like our country, is very interested in \ndeveloping alternative energy. If we can cut our dependence on foreign \noil, we will enhance our own security as well as Israel's security.\n  Last winter I visited the new headquarters of Great River Energy, one \nof the biggest electric co-ops in Minnesota, to talk about renewable \nenergy.\n  Great River is building a new energy-efficient office complex in the \nsuburb of Maple Grove, MN. But what I remember best about that day is \nthe huge wind turbine that towers over the building, and the way its \nblades were rotating in the January winds. This is literally in the \nmiddle of a suburban shopping mall.\n  It might seem odd that a company would put up a wind turbine in the \nsuburbs of Minneapolis--in fact, it has become a landmark for the \ncommuters who drive past each morning and evening.\n  It might seem even more odd that an electric utility would erect that \nsymbol of green energy in front of its new headquarters.\n  But what Great River understands--and what that wind turbine \nsymbolizes--is that clean, alternative energy represents a huge \nopportunity for our country.\n  Great River is not alone among utility companies that can see the \ngreen future before us. Xcel Energy, based in the Twin Cities and in \nColorado, already gets more than 10 percent of its power from wind. It \nhas pledged to generate 30 percent of its electricity from renewable \nsources by 2025 and reduce its carbon emissions by more than 20 percent \nover the next 12 years. In fact, Xcel was supportive of our state \nlegislature which put in place one of the most aggressive renewable \nstandards in the country.\n  Xcel's CEO, Dick Kelly, recently said that Xcel intends ``to push it \nto the max. But it would be nice to have a policy at the federal level, \na national policy, so we all know what the rules are.''\n  As we prepare to debate the landmark climate-change legislation that \nwill come before us in a few weeks, I hope we keep these two examples \nin mind.\n  Because here is what they show us: Global climate change represents a \nworld of challenges. But it also represents a universe of \nopportunities--for American business to develop new products and \ntechnologies, for consumers to save money on their energy bills, for \nAmerica to achieve greater energy security and independence.\n  First, there is opportunity for consumers.\n  The National Academy of Sciences has estimated that American \nmotorists were able to cut their gasoline consumption by almost 15 \npercent annually as a result of the last fuel-economy standards that \nCongress enacted in 1975--standards that also reduced the emission of \ngreenhouse gases. The new CAFE standards that we adopted in December \nwill not only further slow the emission of greenhouse gases--but they \nwill also save the average consumer as much as $1,000 a year at the gas \npump.\n\n  We are developing the technology to take these efficiencies even \nfurther and they make savings at the pump even greater. The \nopportunities lie not only in producing cheaper and renewable sources \nof fuel, including cellulosic ethanol, the next generation of ethanol \nbut in making our vehicles more efficient. Increased efficiency is \nperhaps our greatest opportunity to stretch a family's energy dollar--\n$4-a-gallon stretches a lot further when it will take your car 50 miles \ninstead of 25. The next generation of hybrid cars, as well as the \ndevelopment of cars powered by other renewable sources such as \nelectricity or hydrogen, open a new world of opportunity for the \nAmerican consumer; an opportunity for innovative American companies to \nbe at the forefront; an opportunity to reduce our environmental impact \nwhile reducing our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Then there is electricity. If every American household replaced just \none light bulb with a compact fluorescent bulb, the country would save \n$600 million in annual energy costs, the nation would save enough \nenergy to light more than 3 million homes for a year--and we would \nprevent greenhouse gas pollution equivalent to the emissions of more \nthan 800,000 cars,\n  There is also opportunity for business.\n  The Safeway grocery chain decided recently to install solar panels on \n23 of its supermarkets to provide energy for heating, cooling and \nelectricity.\n  They estimate that they will cut their electricity costs by 20 \npercent and that they will remove 12.6 million pounds of carbon \nemissions every year.\n  General Electric, one of the biggest corporations in the world, has \nmoved aggressively into what it calls ``green products'' such as \nenergy-efficient appliances and components for wind turbines. Its sales \nof green products have doubled since 2005 to $12 billion, and the \ncompany aims for $20 billion of green products sales by 2010. This is \nour ``building a fridge to the next century.''\n  In my home State, the State of Minnesota, in the town of Starbuck, \nthere is a small company called Solar Skies. There are just 10 \nemployees at Solar Skies, but those 10 people decided to take a risk, \nto leave their jobs, and to go to work for a place that makes solar \npanels. Those employees are devoted to the idea that we can create a \nnew energy future for all of us. They believe in their work and are now \nreaping the benefits of the opportunity created by this new energy \neconomy. When I visited them, they actually had me jump up and down on \nthe solar panels to show that they could withstand hail damage; I am \nsure they would welcome the Presiding Officer from the great State of \nMontana to do that as well.\n  Clearly, the people at Solar Skies are not the only ones to \nunderstand the opportunity. If you look at the leading indicator of \nAmerican investment, venture capital, you will find that it reached \n$2.9 billion of investments in green technologies last year, up 78 \npercent from a year earlier.\n  Clean technology is not only the fastest growing portion of the \nventure capital market, it is now the third largest category, behind \nonly biotech and computer software.\n  So today we have to ask ourselves, Does the United States want to be \na leader in creating the new green technologies and the new green \nindustries of the future or are we going to sit back and watch the \nopportunities pass us by? I am determined that we will be a leader.\n  As you know, this is my third speech on climate change every week up \nthrough the debate. The first was an overview, and the second one was \nabout leadership and the need to push this country forward, to be a \nworld leader on this climate change issue and on technology. Today, we \nare talking about the possibilities of new jobs for this country, for \nour country as a whole.\n  This is also an opportunity to create an energy-secure future, to \nfree our country from its dependence on foreign oil. We spend literally \n$41 million every hour on imported oil, and much of the money simply \ngoes back to countries that are not our friends.\n  The Council on Foreign Relations recently studied this question, and \nthey said:\n\n       America's dependence on imported energy increases its \n     strategic vulnerability and constrains its ability to pursue \n     foreign policy and national security objectives. The lack of \n     sustained attention to energy issues is undercutting U.S. \n     foreign policy and U.S. national security.\n\n  But the report also concluded that a determined conservation effort \ncould:\n\n       Unleash remarkable forces for innovation in this country. \n     Entrepreneurs are seeking new ideas for products and services \n     such as batteries, advanced oil and gas exploration and \n     production techniques and biofuels.\n\n  By reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases through conservation \nand new technology, we can reduce our use of imported oil and leave our \ncountry in a stronger international position. This is not only wishful \nthinking. It has worked before. Conservation initiatives enacted after \nthe first OPEC oil embargo reduced the oil intensity of our economy, \nsaving our country the equivalent of 15 million barrels of oil\n\n[[Page S3955]]\n\nper day. Today, a comprehensive policy to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, including higher fuel standards for cars and trucks, \ndevelopment of clean alternative sources of energy, and better energy \nefficiency standards for buildings, can do this.\n  Look at the Chevy Volt. Two years from now, the Chevy Volt will be \navailable for purchase. You can plug your car in, you go 30 miles, and \nthen it transitions over to fuel. In other words, if you are driving \nthrough Montana or Minnesota and it is 10 below zero, you are done with \nyour 30 miles, and it is not going to stop, it transitions over to \nfuel, and hopefully that will be alternative fuel.\n  We can cut our oil consumption by as much as 35 percent by 2030--more \nthan offsetting the oil we import from OPEC today--just by putting in \nplace these higher fuel economy standards for cars and developing clean \nalternative sources of energy and better energy efficiency standards \nfor our buildings.\n  A study last year by the McKinsey Global Institute concluded that \nprojected electricity consumption in American homes in 2020 can be \nreduced by more than one-third if high-efficiency measures were adopted \nnationwide, including lightbulbs, water heaters, kitchen appliances, \nroom-insulation materials, and standby power. But here is what is \ninteresting. The report warned that market forces alone, even with \nhigher energy prices, would not be sufficient to make the most of these \nenergy-efficient technologies. What is required is leadership from \nWashington, leadership from this Chamber, leadership from the White \nHouse, a new national strategy to wean the country from fossil fuels, \nto reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases, and to set the stage for \nthis new energy economy.\n  This is the heart of the climate change legislation that will come \nbefore us in the next few weeks: a strategy to cap and reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions, then use a cap-and-trade system so that the \nprivate sector achieves these reductions in the most efficient way \npossible. The market is ready, but it needs leadership from us.\n  Last year, Minnesota's own Tom Friedman had a cover story in the New \nYork Times Magazine, ``The Power of Green.'' It should be required \nreading for anyone who cares not only about the future of our \nenvironment but also our economic future and our future national \nsecurity.\n  In the article, Tom Friedman asks: How do our kids compete in a \nflatter world? How do they thrive in a warmer world? How do they \nsurvive in a more dangerous world?\n  The answer is, in making the most of the economic and technological \nopportunities to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and the \ngreenhouse gas pollution that comes from it, we do better.\n  Friedman said that clean energy technology is going to be the next \ngreat global industry. He went on to propose the Green New Deal, one in \nwhich the Government's role is not funding projects, as in the original \nNew Deal, but seeding basic research, providing loan guarantees where \nneeded, and setting standards and incentives and taxes that will spawn \nall kinds of new technologies.\n  We are trying to do that right now with the wind tax credit, the \nrenewable tax credit, for geothermal and for solar and other kinds of \nrenewable energy. I believe this is not all about cutting back or \nhunkering down, it is about seizing opportunity.\n  In his words:\n\n       It's about creating a new cornucopia of abundance for the \n     next generation by inventing a whole new industry. It's about \n     getting our best brains out of hedge funds and into \n     innovations that will not only give us the clean-power \n     industrial assets to preserve our American dream, but also \n     give us the technologies that billions of others need to \n     realize their own dreams without destroying the planet.\n       It is about making America safer by breaking our addiction \n     to a fuel that is powering regimes deeply hostile to our \n     values. And, finally, it is about making America the global \n     environmental leader, instead of a laggard.\n\n  Oponents of the Lieberman-Warner climate change bill say we cannot do \nthis because it will somehow cripple our economy. I say we cannot \nafford not to enact climate change legislation because global warming \nwill cripple our economy.\n  A recent economic study commissioned by the Pew Center on Global \nClimate Change concludes that, under at least one scenario, higher \ntemperatures could cut more than $100 billion off American economic \noutput over the next century, largely because of damage to agriculture, \nforestry, and commercial fishing.\n  Now, look at this. The temperature in the last 100 years is up 1 \ndegree. That does not sound like much until you realize it has gone up \nonly 5 degrees since the height of the ice age. Our EPA, using data, \nwell-founded scientific data, projects that temperatures in the next \ncentury will go up 3 to 8 degrees.\n  So this idea that we can lose $100 billion off American economic \noutput over the next century is not some farflung idea, it is based on \nscientific research. Unless we can confront this problem and confront \nit now, those costs will simply go higher and higher. We will also miss \nthe opportunity for new jobs, for new products and technologies, new \nconsumer savings, and a more responsible climate change policy. It is a \nbig challenge. But meeting challenges is what our country does best. \nJust look at history.\n  When the space race began with the launch of sputnik in October 1957, \nAmerican citizens listened with indignation and fear as the first \nmanmade satellite, a Soviet satellite, beeped its way around the Earth. \nYet it inspired our Nation and its universities to make a historic \ninvestment in math and science education. Within a decade, our country \ntripled the number of science and engineering Ph.D.s--tripled them.\n  In 1961, President Kennedy issued a challenge to our Nation: Put a \nman on the Moon by the end of the decade. We answered the call. On July \n20, 1969, what seemed impossible became reality when Neil Armstrong \ntook that giant leap for mankind.\n  But the space program was not only a success because we put a man on \nthe Moon before the Soviets, it also spurred countless other \ninnovations in industry. I love saying this in front of our pages \nbecause I think they were not born when this happened. To them, this is \ncommonplace, but back then we did not have these things. This is what \nit has spurred. It spurred industries and innovations such as weather \nsatellites, solar technology, digital wristwatches, ultrasound \nmachines, laser surgery, infrared medical thermometers, programmable \npacemakers, satellite TV broadcasts, high-density batteries, high-speed \nlong distance telephone service, automatic insulin pumps, CAT scans, \nradiation-blocking sunglasses, GPS devices, and the little chocolate \nspace sticks my family would take when we went on camping trips in the \n1970s. That all came out because we had a President who said we have a \nnational goal, we are all part of the same Nation, and we are going to \nreach the goal. We can do the same thing with climate change and energy \nindependence.\n  Today, it is not a Russian satellite streaming across our skies that \nshould galvanize our Nation into action. It is the multiplying \nsmokestacks in China, it is the receding glaciers in Greenland and \nAntarctica, and it is the rapidly rising global temperatures, and it is \nbeing leapfrogged by countries like Brazil that are now fuel \nindependent because their Government put in place a policy for \nalternative biofuels.\n  But just as sputnik sparked a new age of prosperity and opportunity, \nthese trends can lead to opportunities for the strengthening of our \neconomy and renewing our leadership in the world. In doing so, we will \ncreate a better economy for the next generation by developing whole new \nindustries, which will not only help us preserve our American \nleadership in the world but will also help to deploy technologies \nbillions of others need to realize their own dreams without destroying \nthe planet.\n  I believe we have the responsibility to confront a grave threat to \nour environment and our health. I believe we have the opportunity to do \na great service to the people of this country. I believe that before us \nnow we have the opportunity to make our economy stronger and more \nefficient. But it is rare that we have the opportunity to accomplish \nall three at once, to accomplish so many good things in one bold \nstroke. This rare opportunity will come before us in a few weeks when \nwe take up the landmark Lieberman-Warner bill to address the challenge \nof\n\n[[Page S3956]]\n\nglobal climate change. We must seize that opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m. today, the \nSenate resume the DeMint amendment No. 4710, as modified, and that \nthere be 20 minutes of debate prior to a vote with respect to the \namendment, with 15 minutes under the control of Senator DeMint and 5 \nminutes under the control of Senator Dodd or his designee; that no \namendment be in order to the amendment prior to the vote, and that upon \nthe use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Presiding Officer and the Parliamentarian.\n\n\n                                 Trade\n\n  Mr. President, for the last year, 15 months, 16 months, or so, as I \nhave traveled throughout my home State of Ohio, I have held 95 or so \nroundtables with small business owners, entrepreneurs, workers, \ncommunity leaders, family farmers, educators, and everywhere I go I \nhear variations of the same story--about plants that have closed and \nleft for Mexico or China, and workers, often in their fifties and \nsixties, who have few alternatives.\n  Manufacturing has been devastated over the past 5 years. Ohio has \nlost upwards of 200,000 manufacturing jobs since 2001, and this \nadministration has been largely indifferent.\n  One of these roundtables was held in Tiffin, OH, a small \nmanufacturing city of about 20,000 people, an hour or so from Toledo. A \ncompany well known, American Standard, a company that makes plumbing \nequipment, was bought out by an investment banking firm from Boston in \nNovember. In December, they notified the workers they were going to \nshut down the plant and move its production elsewhere.\n  A couple hundred workers lost their jobs, many of them lost big \nchunks of their pension, and some of them lost their health care. Yet \nthe investors who came in and bought American Standard did, of course, \nvery well.\n  Today, Ohio and its neighbors feel this problem of plant shutdowns, \nwhat it means not just to the workers and their families, but what it \nmeans to the communities as it relates to police protection and fire \nprotection and teachers, as these communities are badly hurt, \nparticularly smaller cities, and they simply cannot afford to hire as \nmany police and firemen and teachers.\n  Ohio and its neighbors feel this problem most acutely, but it is the \nNation's problem. Our economy cannot prosper unless we make and sell \ngoods as well as services. Yet for the past several years, much of our \nNation's greatest engineering prowess has not gone to Toledo or Dayton \nor Youngstown but, instead, to Wall Street.\n  Unfortunately, traditional manufacturing has declined as a share of \nour economy, while the manufacture of financial products has become \nincreasingly important.\n  When I was elected to Congress in 1992, our trade deficit was $38 \nbillion--$38 billion a decade and a half ago. Today, it exceeds $800 \nbillion. With oil reaching $121 per barrel, and perhaps higher soon, \nthe trade deficit will likely only increase in the years ahead.\n  Leading up to the Ohio Presidential primary in March, the media \nfocused on NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. In Ohio, \nwhen we talk about NAFTA, we mean our overall trade policy, be it with \nMexico and Canada, or China, or Central America. But the media, of \ncourse, hears only the word ``protectionism.'' When you think about it, \nthat is a pretty interesting choice of words. On the one side you have \nproponents of free trade, while on the other side you have what many \npapers label as ``protectionists.''\n  Those of us in favor of fair trade are, indeed, trying to protect \nwhat we believe is important. We would like to protect the labor \nstandards our country has fought so hard to establish over many \ndecades. We would like to help our trading partners, the developing \nworld, to improve their labor standards. We would like to protect \nconsumers in this country from defective and even dangerous products. \nWe would like to protect our children from toys covered with lead paint \nand our hospital patients from tainted blood products. We would like to \nprotect the ability of our manufacturers to compete against foreign \ncompanies without having to overcome trade barriers such as currency \nmanipulation.\n  So, yes, there are things I would like to protect. But so-called free \ntraders are interested in protecting their interests, as well. They \nwould like to protect their beef from imports. They would like to \nprotect pharmaceutical companies, as they do. They would like to \nprotect financial services. In fact, trade agreements of recent years \nbasically are chock full of protections--protections for the financial \nservice industries, protections for the pharmaceutical industry, \nprotections for big oil.\n  In fact, NAFTA--what I hold in my hand is not the actual NAFTA trade \nagreement but NAFTA was about this size. NAFTA contained hundreds of \npages of protections--protections in areas that go way beyond tariffs \non goods. It is similar with the Colombia trade agreement; it is also \nabout this size. If they were free-trade agreements, you could have \nwritten them on about this many pages: five, six pages. All you would \nneed is a tariff schedule--a schedule of tariffs we were going to \nreduce or eliminate. But, instead, NAFTA and the Colombia Free Trade \nAgreement and these others are this big. Do you know why?\n  It is not just the tariff schedules. They also have protections for \nthe drug industries, protections for the banks, protections for the oil \nindustry, protections for all kinds of corporate interests in every one \nof these trade agreements. That is why when we talk about protections, \nlet's be fair. Yes, to be sure, I want to protect workers. I want to \nprotect communities such as Tiffin, OH. I want to protect Sandusky and \nprotect Lorain and protect Springfield and protect Zanesville. I want \nto make sure those communities are not devastated by these trade \nagreements that have all kinds of protections for the largest corporate \ninterests but very little for the environment, even less for workers, \nand even less still to protect our food supply and our toy supply for \nour children.\n  We need to recast this debate. Those of us who want to change the \nrules are not protectionists, in spite of what every elitist newspaper \nfrom the New York Times to the Los Angeles Times and everything in \nbetween likes to say. Those of us who want to enforce trade laws and \ndefend against bumping Chinese steel products are not protectionists. \nThose who want safe ingredients in pharmaceuticals we import are not \nprotectionists. Those who want to make sure our children's toys coming \nfrom China--after our toy companies outsource jobs, push the Chinese \nsubcontractors to cut costs. They cut costs by putting lead-based paint \non toys because it is cheaper, it is easier to apply, it is shinier, it \ndries faster. Yet then these products, these toys come into the United \nStates, and the Bush administration has weakened consumer protection \nlaws and cut the number of inspectors so, because of this trade policy, \nthis protectionist, protect-industry-at-all-costs trade policy, we have \nthese tainted toys entering the bedrooms of too many of our children.\n  Trade is not just about exchanging goods between countries. Trade, \nwhen done right, is about lifting workers in the United States and \nlifting workers abroad out of poverty. It is about creating new \nindustry. It is about creating new business. It is about creating new \njobs. It is about ensuring strong and thriving economies for all \nparties involved.\n  Fair trade products--for example, coffee, tea, bananas, flowers--\nproducts once relegated to specialty shelves in health food stores have \nnow found their way into mainstream America.\n  Costco and McDonalds have begun to promote fair trade. That is fair \ntrade\n\n[[Page S3957]]\n\nwhere workers share in some of the profits they produce for their \nemployers. They know it means quality products and good business sense \nat home. In the coffee fields of Nicaragua, fair trade products mean a \nbright future for tens of thousands of young girls--girls who often \nwould not have been able to go to school, but they are able to because \ntheir parents--coffee farmers in the case of Nicaragua--are making an \nincome that gives them enough, sometimes more than $1 a pound, as \nopposed to coffee that is not fair trade where maybe they get only half \nthat. The kids of those workers do not get to go to school.\n  Fair trade products mean that farmers in developing nations earn two \nto three times more for their products, and those children, as I said, \ncan get an education.\n  Fair trade products mean workers on flower farms across Latin America \nwill be free from poisonous pesticides that cause death and birth \ndefects.\n  Fair trade products mean that workers in developing nations will earn \nmore and be able to buy more from us--the whole point of trade. That \nmeans, obviously, increased exports for U.S. businesses.\n  Fair trade means trade--and more of it--but with a very different set \nof rules, not this kind of protectionism to protect the drug companies \nand the oil industry and the insurance industry and the financial \nservices, but trade agreements with a different set of rules that help \nlift up people, both in the developing world and in this country.\n  Proponents of the same failed trade policies of the last 15 years \nneed to stop selling the trade deal with Colombia, for example, as a \npath to a stronger economy.\n  NAFTA sent 19 million more Mexicans below the poverty line. Today, \nthere are 19 million more Mexicans living below the poverty line than \nin 1993, since NAFTA. CAFTA has failed--the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement--to create the thriving middle class in Central America that \nproponents promised.\n  The Colombia Free Trade Agreement, as written, will produce the same \nresults: more poverty abroad, more lost U.S. jobs, more small \nbusinesses in this country closing up shop.\n  The first President Bush said each billion dollars--listen to this--\neach billion dollars of our trade surplus or deficit translates into \n13,000 jobs. A billion-dollar trade surplus creates 13,000 jobs. A \nbillion-dollar trade deficit costs 13,000 jobs. That is what the first \nPresident Bush said. That was back when the trade deficit was $20 \nbillion, $30 billion, $40 billion. Again, think about that: 13,000 jobs \nfor a billion-dollar trade deficit or surplus.\n  Today, the trade deficit exceeds $800 billion. Just do the math. The \ncost in jobs of this enormous increase in our trade deficit is \nstaggering.\n  It is not surprising that voters in my State see bad trade deals as a \nmajor factor in the destruction of our manufacturing base. They know \nour economy and they know their interests are undermined by that \nexploding trade deficit. They know Ohio's problems are Colorado's \nproblems and Montana's problems and Massachusetts' problems. They know \nfor the past three decades the historical link between rising \nproductivity and rising wages has been severed.\n  For most of my life--well, half of my life; the first 25 or 30 years \nof my life--in this country, when workers were more productive, their \nwages went up. If I had a chart, you could see that. We could map \nproductivity, and we could map wages. In this country, for decades and \ndecades and decades, this created the middle class. This is what made \nus a successful economy and a successful democratic capitalist \ncountry--that productivity and wages would almost be parallel.\n  Today, particularly in the last decade, that connection has \nabsolutely been severed. That has been the problem in many ways with \nour economy. Wages have been flat, profits have been up, executive \nsalaries have exploded, and the middle class has struggled mightily.\n  Our country has entered a period where income inequality is at the \nhighest level in 70 years. Now is the time to be asking the right \nquestions. It is time to end the name calling and have a real debate \nabout trade. We are at a critical juncture in our Nation's history. It \nserves both sides of the trade debate to remember that U.S. trade \npolicy is a tool. It is not a fairy godmother. It should not be used to \ntemporarily pump up well-connected industries--as trade policy often \nis; hence, all the protections--nor should it be used to tamp down \ncompetitive forces.\n  Our trade policy must promote competition, build on the progress our \nNation has made, and promote our Nation's economic and strategic \nobjectives rather than flouting them.\n  Ultimately, it will be ingenuity and sweat equity--we know that--that \nenables our country to thrive in the global marketplace. Like every \ncountry, we will have to work harder and smarter to win every contract \nand every sale. But it is the role of governments to ensure the rules \nfor that contest are fair and that the interests of everyone--not just \nthose we protect in our trade agreements--to ensure that everyone has a \nstake and everyone is served by our trade policy.\n  Our Government has not done that. Our trade deficit has ballooned, \nour manufacturing sector is faltering, and real wages are falling. The \nlast thing we need is more business as usual. No more NAFTAs, no more \nCAFTAs, no more Colombia trade agreements. Business as usual has not \nworked. The status quo is not working. Again, 15\\1/2\\ years ago, the \ntrade deficit was $38 billion; today, it is $800 billion.\n  We need to decide what our economic goals will be and how we achieve \nthem. If we do not, we will wake up to find we have left a sorry legacy \nto our Nation, to our communities, and to our children.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Supplemental Appropriations\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly--not about the bill \nthat is pending but about a bill that is somewhere in one of the \nhallways around here, which is the supplemental that is necessary in \norder to fund our troops in the field. That bill was supposed to be \nmarked up today in the Appropriations Committee, but, regrettably, for \nreasons which are not totally clear to me but which are reasonably \napparent--which is that the House has not yet gotten its procedures in \norder--the bill was not marked up, the markup was canceled. It was \nsupposed to start at 2 o'clock.\n  I certainly hope we will mark up this bill. It is very important this \nbill be subject to regular order. It is a very significant bill, \nobviously, because it involves funding for our troops in the field. It \nis significant also because a lot of other matters which are extraneous \nto the issue of fighting the war and giving our troops the resources \nthey need have been added to it on the House side, and even more, as it \nappears, maybe even being added on the Senate side. Thus, the Senate \nought to have the right to work its will on the bill in the regular \norder, which includes a committee hearing where the various issues are \naired and amendments can be made. Then when it gets to the floor, it \nshould also be subject to amendments so the minority, especially, can \nhave some input on the bill. Otherwise, the minority gets written out \nof the process, which is not constructive to the institution, and it \ncertainly means we would have to defend our rights and probably oppose \nthe bill on those procedural grounds that we have an obligation--that \nwe as a minority basically have the sacred right of making a decision \nas to when amendments are to be offered or at least what amendments \nshould be voted on.\n  Relative to a major piece of legislation such as this, we as the \nminority should have the right to amend it. If we decide not to amend \nit, that is our choice, obviously. But parts of this bill clearly need \nto be subject to amendment, and the minority has a right to be heard on \nthat in the Senate, especially because that is the essence of the \ninstitution. The minority has the ability to participate in the process \nthrough the amendment process and through the filibuster process.\n\n[[Page S3958]]\n\n  So I wish to speak to some of the amendments I would have offered had \nwe met today which I happen to think are very appropriate to this bill \nand which are in the area of jurisdiction for which I have primary \nresponsibility. I am the ranking member on the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee which is the committee that deals with foreign relations, \nwith the State Department, and with funding foreign activities. There \nare some very important issues which need to be addressed in this bill \nthat are not addressed. This bill has a significant amount of money in \nit that will flow through the State Department which deals specifically \nwith Iraq, with Afghanistan, and to some extent with other issues such \nas Mexico.\n  The first amendment I would have offered would have been language to \ncorrect what is an inconceivable bureaucratic snafu, in my opinion. \nThat is the fact that Nelson Mandela--certainly one of the greatest \nleaders of the 20th century, who epitomized the movement for freedom \nand for equality in Africa but really for the world generally--is not \nallowed in the United States unless he gets a special waiver from the \nSecretary of State which allows him to come into the United States \nbecause of the fact that he was a member of the African National \nCongress and is a member of the African National Congress, having been \nthe head of South Africa as that party rules there; and that party, due \nto the history of that party, has been caught in the bureaucratic \nframework of our laws and is designated as a potential terrorist \norganization, which is really ridiculous on its face.\n  The fact that Nelson Mandela cannot come into the United States \nbecause the organization he led, which delivered freedom and equality \nin South Africa, has gotten this designation due to its prior activity, \nit would be like saying the head of the Likud Party, which a number of \nPrime Ministers of Israel come from, because it at one time was an \nactivist organization confronting British rule in Palestine at the \ntime, the head of the Likud Party would not be allowed in the United \nStates but would have to receive special exemption. It makes no sense.\n  So this language, which the Secretary of State totally supports and \nthe Secretary of State is equally outraged by, would have to be \nchanged. So working with the State Department, we have this language \ntogether, and we will go over it.\n  I understand at 2 o'clock we go into debate on the DeMint amendment, \nand I will be happy to yield the floor as soon as somebody arrives and \nwishes to debate. But I ask unanimous consent to be able to continue \nuntil such individual arrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. The second amendment I would have offered would address \nthe issue of the war on terror and our involvement with Iraq relative \nto the State of Jordan, which unfortunately has found itself incurring \ndramatic costs as a result of the overflow of the events in Iraq. \nMassive amounts of refugees are coming into Jordan. It has put an \nextraordinary burden on that country, a tremendous ally and friend of \nthe United States.\n  So I believe we have an obligation as a nation--since we created this \nproblem for Jordan in many ways by the activity in Iraq--to support \nJordan as it tries to address the issues of the refugees. We cannot \nhelp them with the physical activity of the refugees there, but we can \ngive them resources. I was going to increase funding to Jordan to \naccomplish that. I know Senator Inouye is also very interested in this \nissue.\n  In addition, money being spent by the State Department in Iraq on \nbehalf of reconstruction should be significantly limited; but more \nimportant than that, any new money we spend for reconstruction through \nState Department accounts should be matched one-to-one by the \nGovernment of Iraq. I find it inconceivable for a government that runs \na $30 billion or $40 billion surplus, on the issue of oil revenues, not \nbe asked to pony up or at least match what the American taxpayers are \nspending there relative to resources to promote reconstruction in Iraq. \nSo I was going to offer that amendment.\n  I see the Senator from South Carolina is here. I understand this time \nis correctly his. At this point, I will yield the floor. First, I also \nintended to offer an amendment in markup today which would have put a \nconsular office in Tibet. I think it is critical to have a consular \noffice there as the Tibetan people deal with the situation occurring \nthere relative to the Chinese Government crackdown.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4710\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 20 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 4170, \noffered by the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I wish to talk about my amendment that \nwill be voted on in about 15 or 20 minutes. It is amendment No. 4710. \nIt is an amendment to the National Flood Insurance Program bill we are \nconsidering today.\n  The whole purpose of the flood insurance bill is to improve the \nprogram, make it more actuarially sound, make it more financially \nsustainable over many years. Obviously, we have had huge problems with \nthe program. Yet it is very important to people all around the country, \nparticularly those in coastal areas.\n  One of the goals of this reform bill is to make the rates fairer and \nto phase out a number of the subsidies that we have allowed under the \ncurrent program.\n  The current program allows up to a 65-percent subsidy on properties \nthat were purchased before we developed these flood maps. In other \nwords, there were many properties purchased years ago when people did \nnot know they were purchasing a home in a flood area. For that reason, \nwe basically grandfathered these homes in and allowed them lower rates \nin the flood insurance program than those who bought homes after we had \ndesignated those flood areas.\n  The bill addresses some of those properties by phasing out the \nsubsidies of nonprimary residences--those that are rental properties, \nsecond homes, and even those with severe repetitive losses. We take \nabout 475,000 properties that were pre-FIRM, as we call it, or preflood \nmap, and phase those out. There are 700,000 permanent residences we do \nnot address in the bill.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to bring all the properties, \nbasically, into the same plan, and not to force some to pay higher \npremiums so we can give subsidies to these 700,000 homes. My bill \ndoesn't affect the rates or the subsidies of any current property \nowner. My amendment does address new owners, if those properties are \nsold after this bill passes. In other words, we continue the subsidies \nof current property owners, except for those already addressed in the \nbill. But if those properties are sold, clearly, the new owner would \nknow they are buying in a flood zone, so the rationale to continue \nsubsidies up to 65 percent does not exist.\n  I remind my colleagues that if we allow inequities to continue, where \nsome are getting subsidies and some are not, then some residents--and \none might be sitting next to another--are going to have a higher \nproperty value because it will get lower flood insurance rates \nindefinitely, no matter how many times it is sold.\n  My amendment, again, I think would improve the sustainability of the \nprogram. I encourage the ranking member to consider this. I know there \nhave been agreements not to add or support any amendments. But I think \nthis captures a lot of the intent of the whole bill to make the program \nsustainable and fairer, and actually my amendment would return about \n$550 million in additional premium revenues to the plan over the next \n10 years. So this is, again, designed to make the program fairer.\n  I encourage my colleagues to look at this amendment. It is not a \npartisan amendment in any way. It will make the program better and \nfairer and it will bring everybody into the same status once properties \nare sold.\n  With that, I will reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3959]]\n\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, in a moment I will ask unanimous consent \nto withdraw my amendment, but I wish to have a little discussion on the \nfloor with the chairman and ranking member because for the most part, \nwe agree on a lot of the principles in the bill, and they would like \nthe latitude to work some of this out in conference.\n  My goal is to have a more sustainable, fairer program. The idea is \nnot to raise the price of current premium payers or to raise the price \nof real estate. I want to ask my colleagues if they would consider some \nof the principles of bringing all policies eventually into some \nactuarial equity.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, he raises a very \ngood point. In fact, I had a discussion with Senator Dorgan on a \nsimilar issue, but the same point of an equity interest involving the \ncost of premiums where you have a very well-built levee and should the \npremium be the same as one with a 50-year-old levee--that is a \nlegitimate point, it seems to me.\n  We talked earlier with Senator Vitter about costs and values. We \ndisagree with him on that issue, but he makes a case, as the Senator \nfrom South Carolina does, that we need to strike this balance well so \nwe are not locking in permanent costs, and not also falsely \ncontributing to a rise in the cost of real estate in a time when we are \ndealing with oversupply and trying to move properties.\n  I am sympathetic with what my colleague is trying to achieve. There \nis an equity interest he has identified that I think has legitimacy. \nThe question is, How do we satisfy that in a actuarially sound program?\n  I commend him for the idea. I am grateful to him for withdrawing the \namendment. It gives us a chance to work on it and examine it in a way \nthat will hopefully satisfy him. I cannot promise him this, obviously, \nbecause the Senator from Alabama and I have to deal with the House. I \ncome with an open mind to the equity issue he raises with his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from South Carolina \nfor bringing up his amendment. I think it is something we should \nconsider in conference. Senator Dodd had a colloquy about it on the \nside on the floor a few minutes ago.\n  At the end of the day, what we are interested in is a more \nactuarially sound flood insurance program, one that will make more \nsense after a lot of mapping goes on around the country that will \nbroaden the program and not perpetuate subsidy over and over for four \nor five sales or four or five generations where property is sold.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is on the right track. I assure him I \nwant to pursue this in conference.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 4710 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember. I trust their judgment to work this issue out in conference. I \nthink the bill has made a lot of progress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Darfur\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the anniversary of \none global tragedy and to call attention to another, a tragedy that is \noccurring even at this moment.\n  Fourteen years ago this week, the world stood by as 800,000 Rwandans \nwere brutally murdered, largely along ethnic lines, in only 100 days. \nDespite early warning signs and pleas for greater international \nattention, we did little more as a nation than watch as this act of \ngenocide was allowed to continue.\n  Canadian GEN Romeo Dallaire at the time was commander of a small U.N. \npeacekeeping force in Rwanda when the genocide began. He desperately \ntried to get the United Nations to approve a more robust force to end \nthe killings. Despite his efforts, the Security Council voted instead \nto cut back the United Nations' force. Nearly 2,500 troops were \nreplaced with 450 poorly trained and poorly equipped soldiers. We all \nknow the tragic result. Today the world looks back in shame at the \ninaction in Rwanda. We all failed.\n  In 1998, President Clinton visited Rwanda and spoke to those who lost \nloved ones in those horrible times. President Clinton said:\n\n       We in the United States and the world community did not do \n     as much as we could have and should have done to try to limit \n     what occurred in Rwanda in 1994.\n\n  President Clinton's decision to visit Rwanda was an honorable one. It \nwas the right choice. His words were inspiring in their honesty and \naccuracy, but his words were also an important reminder that the world \ncannot allow such a tragedy to occur again.\n  President Bush visited Rwanda in January and toured the Kigali \nMemorial Center, which I have also visited, where 250,000 Rwandans are \nburied in mass graves. President Bush said he hoped the world would \n``once and for all'' work to halt the genocide in Darfur.\n  President Bush will soon be leaving office--less than a year from \nnow. I fear that unless his administration acts, and acts quickly, we \nwill once again fail to stop a genocide in its tragic march. If we want \nto send a message to the world that the United States will not turn a \nblind eye to genocide, now is the time to act in Darfur.\n  Violence began in Darfur 5 years ago. Since that time, I have come to \nthe floor many times to talk about it.\n  In 2004, the House of Representatives unanimously adopted a \nresolution calling on President Bush to call the atrocities in Darfur \nby their rightful name: a genocide. The resolution also urged the \nPresident to consider multilateral--even unilateral--intervention. That \nresolution passed nearly 4 years ago, in July 2004--4 years ago.\n  A few months later, Secretary of State Colin Powell said:\n\n       [G]enocide has been committed in Darfur and that the \n     government of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear responsibility and \n     the genocide may still be occurring.\n\n  In June 2005, President Bush said he agreed with Secretary of State \nPowell's determination that what was happening in Darfur was in fact a \ngenocide.\n  Two years later, President Bush spoke at the Holocaust Museum here in \nWashington and said that ``genocide is the only word for what is \nhappening in Darfur.'' He went on to say `` . . . we have a moral \nobligation to stop it.''\n  Many things have been said by many influential people over the years, \nbut little action has taken place. Five years after this declaration of \ngenocide, where do we stand? What have we done? As many as 400,000 \nresidents of Darfur have been killed, others brutally raped and \ntortured, entire villages torched, creating a refugee crisis that has \nforced more than 2 million Darfuris to flee their homes.\n  This photo is almost surreal. As often described, people who have \nflown over the Darfur region say it looks as if people have put \ncigarettes out--the types of burns that you see. The burns, of course, \nrepresent huts in villages that have been destroyed. This is a part of \nSudan after the Sudanese Government and allied militia forces recently \nburned a village.\n  Hundreds of thousands of women and children live in refugee camps in \nDarfur and Chad. I don't think this photo does justice to the camp, but \nwhat appear to be tiny white dots are, in fact, small tents, a sea of \nsmall tents. There are 90,000 people who live in the Kalma refugee camp \nin Darfur--no grass, no trees, 10 reported rapes every single day. The \npeople in camps like this one in Kalma are dependent on us, the entire \ninternational community, for the basics--food, water, and shelter. It \nis nothing short of a humanitarian catastrophe.\n  The U.N. Security Council voted last summer in favor of a historic \n26,000-member U.N.-African Union joint peacekeeping force. Last summer, \nthey voted for it. That brought a glimmer of hope across the world that \nfinally\n\n[[Page S3960]]\n\nthere was going to be a global response to this terrible situation.\n  Today, almost a year later, only a third of those peacekeepers have \nbeen deployed--a third. Only a third of this peacekeeping force is on \nthe ground while the Sudanese Government continues to thumb its nose at \nthe international community and its forces continue to attack villages \nin Darfur. Humanitarian and U.N. relief workers face ongoing violence \nand harassment.\n  This photo is of a grieving mother whose children were killed in \nDarfur. Hers is one of the thousands--hundreds of thousands of tragic \nstories. She said her three children had been burned alive in this \nregion's violence. Just the other day, Sudanese forces were reported to \nhave bombed a primary school in the north Darfur village of Shegeg \nKaro, killing at least seven little children.\n  After so many years, after so much violence and human suffering, \nafter so many calls for action, what is holding up the deployment of \npeacekeepers?\n  It may be hard to believe, but one significant problem is a shortage \nof helicopters--hard to imagine, a shortage of helicopters, as the \nkilling, looting, pillaging, raping, and displacement continues. This \ntragic genocide has been raging for 5 years while we have just stood by \nand watched. Yet the world's most powerful nations cannot manage to dig \nup a handful of helicopters. How can that be? Are all our helicopters \ntied up in Iraq and Afghanistan? Are they all in the shop? Is there \ntruly not one NATO ally that will spare a few helicopters? How about \nasking the Russians? They are already helping in south Sudan and Chad. \nThe Russian Ambassador visited my office recently and told me he is \nopen to exploring helping Darfur. It is hard to imagine that the United \nStates would be asking other countries to be supplying helicopters, but \nat the risk of allowing this genocide to continue, we ought to do that.\n  This tragedy is of historic proportion, and it is our chance to step \nin and show the world we really care. But what it takes is Presidential \nleadership--not in 6 months, not in a year, but now.\n  I know some of my colleagues in the Senate, ones on the floor here--\nSenator Biden has raised this issue personally with President Bush. \nQuite simply, I want to put this in the most simple terms because I \nsaid it directly to the President himself and to Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice: If you are not going to do anything before you leave \noffice to stop the genocide in Darfur, then spend a few minutes writing \nyour speech so that a year or two from now, when you visit that \nterrible place, you can say: We could have done more; I wish we would \nhave.\n  That is what it has come down to. This administration and Congress \nwill either act soon or, sadly, this genocide will have occurred on our \nwatch.\n  A few years ago, President Clinton faced the reality of his failure \nto act in Rwanda. He called it ``my great, great regret in \ninternational affairs.'' President Bush, this is your chance. Either do \nsomething or face a similar script and a similar speech in years to \ncome, expressing your regret that you, on your watch, did not stop the \ngenocide in Darfur.\n  We cannot allow ourselves to have to look back years from now to say \nthat happened. We have a moral responsibility as a leader in the world \nto speak out and act to save these people.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 4734 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Ensign \namendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before my friend leaves the floor, I \nexpress my appreciation to my colleague Senator Ensign. This is an \nissue that needs more work. We have spoken to the two managers of the \nbill. They are going to try to help us. This is an issue important to \nNevada and we think other places. But I wanted to express my \nappreciation to Senator Ensign, who did most of the work on this issue.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me also ask unanimous consent that I \nbe allowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thank the chairman because of the \nactivity we are involved in on the floor with the legislation that he \nis shepherding at this moment.\n\n\n                             NUCLEAR ENERGY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, the reason I am speaking at this moment \non the floor is that an event happened this week in Bonneville County, \nID, in southeastern Idaho, that I think is significant not only to this \nNation but ultimately to the world. A global nuclear service company \nselected that area of our country in my State to site a $2 billion \nuranium enrichment facility on a 400-acre farm west of Idaho Falls on \nHighway 20, a location that is very near the birthplace of global \nnuclear power and the nuclear industry. In 1951, the first light bulb \nwas lit by nuclear power in Arco, ID. Of course, while that is a little \nknown historical fact, the actual reactor itself is now a national \nhistoric location, so designated by the late President Lyndon Johnson a \ngood number of years ago. Since that time forward, over 50 prototypes \nof nuclear reactors have been designed at the Idaho Nuclear Laboratory \nand our first nuclear plant for a submarine. In fact, I often \nlaughingly say that out in a big bathtub in the middle of the high \ndeserts of Idaho is a nuclear sub and that many who train to operate \nour nuclear Navy trained in Idaho. It was because of that significance \nand the relationship that Areva, this global company, could have with \nour national laboratory facilities that they sited this nuclear service \ncompany there and their enrichment plant.\n  Areva, the company, will employ, at a peak during construction, \nnearly 1,000 workers over an 8-year period. When operational, the plant \nwill employ some 250 full-time workers, with a total annual salary of \napproximately $15 million. The plant will provide over $5 billion to \nthe local economy of southeastern Idaho over the next 30 years.\n  The enrichment plant could be the first of many nuclear partnerships \nthat Areva will have in the United States and with Idaho. The next \ngeneration nuclear plant being designed at the Idaho lab right now \nallows and puts Areva into an alliance relationship. UniStar, which \nsome who track the nuclear industry know about, is looking at an \nopportunity in Idaho, and Areva and Constellation and other major \nenergy companies of the world are involved in that. My colleagues have \nheard us talk about NGNP which, of course, is a nuclear global energy \npartnership. Once again, Areva is a part of that.\n  Over the last year, I, my staff, and the Idaho congressional \ndelegation have worked with Areva. Because they showed interest in \nsiting in Idaho or Washington or Ohio or New Mexico or Texas, we began \nto work with them to show them what Idaho had to offer, not only in a \nrelationship with our national lab but a phenomenally talented \nworkforce that is capable of doing the kind of work they need done. We \nworked very closely with the office of Gov. Butch Otter. As a result of \nthose relationships, we began to work with the Idaho legislature to \nprovide an economic incentives package for this kind of development. We \nalso worked with\n\n[[Page S3961]]\n\nthe Idaho Department of Commerce and Industry, with the city of Idaho \nFalls, ID, which has always had a very positive working relationship \nwith the National Nuclear Laboratory that is located just miles from \nthat city. Those are the kinds of partnerships the State of Idaho, the \nCity of Idaho Falls, the Governor, the Idaho legislature, and the Idaho \ncongressional delegation were able to put together that finally brought \nAreva to recognize the tremendous opportunity that rests in siting a \nworld-class facility such as this in our State.\n  I mentioned a moment ago and got unanimous consent that Colin Jones \nbe allowed on the floor if he chose. Colin is a fellow from the Idaho \nNational Lab and he worked in a very close relationship with this \ncompany to make sure they had all the answers when they needed them to \nmake this happen.\n  Now, why is all this significant? Right now, we are talking about \nclimate change. We are talking about trying to rebuild an industry in \nour country and for the world that we nearly lost, and that is the \nnuclear industry. For 20 years, this country, for some reason, grew \nvery fearful of the idea that we might advance generation of \nelectricity by new nuclear plants, and we literally stopped. In so \nstopping it, we nearly lost the industry itself and the ability of the \nindustry to build new nuclear reactors, tied with generating facilities \nfor electrical purposes. Along came the growing concern of climate \nchange and the emission of greenhouse gases and other environmental \nconcerns that caused us, in many instances, to stop producing energy in \nthe traditional ways we had produced it.\n  Nearly 60 percent of the energy in this country is produced by coal-\nfired generation facilities. Many of those today are emitters of \nCO2, and there are some who believe it is the concentration \nof CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere that may be causing an \nincreased or an accelerated rate of warming of our globe.\n  While we are trying to make those changes, the rest of the world \nrushes headlong. In fact, China is a perfect example of bringing at \nleast one new coal-fired plant on line per week to supply its growing \nenergy and economic needs. We had always been criticized for being the \nlarger emitter of greenhouse gas because we were 25 percent of the \nworld economy. Now, China, a country that we didn't think would become \nthe larger emitter for several years, this last June measured as the \nlargest greenhouse gas-polluting Nation in the world.\n  My point is quite simple. The need for new environmental and clean \nenergy technology today is absolutely critical, and building the \ninfrastructure that can supply us with abundant energy is even more \nimportant.\n  If our country is going to continue to grow, it has to have an \nabundant supply of all sources of energy. We have seen what happened \njust in the last several months as we have watched prices of gas at the \npump go up to the level they are today, the shudder that has gone out \nfrom the consuming public, and the political reaction in Washington as \nwe chase ourselves in circles trying to find an excuse to blame \nsomebody for the inaction of the Congress over the last 20 years in the \narea of production and refinement and the overall development of energy \nitself.\n  The reason Areva's decision to site a facility not just in Idaho but \nin this country--a uranium enrichment plant--is a process that is key \ntoward building the fuel to supply a nuclear reactor because that one \ntechnology that is available today beyond wind, beyond solar, to supply \nclean energy to the market is nuclear. While Sun is intermittent and \nsolar is intermittent, nuclear reactors supply a strong base load of \nelectricity to the American grid.\n  While we struggle with the technologies for clean coal, while we look \nto build other technologies, the one we can build today in a very \ndemanding energy market is nuclear. Yet in a nuclear conference in \nChicago just this week Excelon and other companies that are major \nutilities said because of this whole new demand the price of building a \nnuclear reactor has doubled from maybe $4 billion per single plant to \nnow $8 billion or $9 billion.\n  This is the bottom line: The cost of energy is going to continue to \ngo up until we bring online the technologies and the infrastructure to \nsupply those technologies to continue to build an abundant energy \nsupply for our country. So that is why I came to the floor today to \ntalk about what got announced in Idaho this Tuesday, and that was a \nworld-class, $2 billion uranium enrichment plant by the Areva company \nand International Utilities.\n  I am proud of my State and all of the people in my State for the work \nthey have done to accomplish this. I compliment them all and wanted \nthem to be a part of the Congressional Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 4 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to Durbin amendment No. \n4715, as modified; that upon the use or yielding back of the time, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the Durbin amendment, with no \namendment in order to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise to speak today in favor of S. \n2284, legislation that would reform and modernize the National Flood \nInsurance Program, NFIP. Congress created NFIP in 1968 in the wake of a \nseries of terrible hurricanes, the worst of which was Hurricane Betsy, \na storm that devastated New Orleans in 1965. After observing the ad hoc \nnature of disaster relief efforts, all of which came at taxpayer \nexpense, Congress saw an urgent need for a better way to handle the \nrisks and losses associated with flood damage.\n  NFIP, which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, FEMA, provided insurance to individuals living in flood-prone \nareas who weren't able to get private insurance. But it did much more. \nIt required mapping to identify areas at risk for flooding and \ncommunity floodplain mitigation and management measures to help prevent \nflood damage in the future.\n  The program has been important in my State of Maryland. According to \nthe 2005 report of the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, Maryland \nis the third most vulnerable State in the Nation to flooding. More than \n12 percent of land is designated under NFIP as a special flood hazard \narea. An estimated 68,000 Maryland homes and buildings are located \nwithin the flood plain, representing nearly $8 billion in assessed \nvalue. Nearly 64,000 Marylanders held NFIP policies as of February \n2007, and in the hurricane seasons from 2002 to 2006, a span that \nincluded Hurricane Isabel, insured flood losses in Maryland totaled \napproximately $177 million.\n  The program appeared to work well for many years. The revenues \nbrought in through insurance premiums covered payments made to \nindividuals in the wake of flooding disasters. Today, the NFIP has been \nreported to save taxpayers over $1 billion annually in flood losses \nthat, without the program, would be paid by the taxpayers in the form \nof emergency disaster relief. But the 2005 hurricane season, which \nbrought Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, created a need on an \nentirely new scale, a scale that not only overwhelmed the program but \nexposed serious flaws in its design.\n  To pay out the estimated $19 billion in NFIP claims, the program had \nto borrow almost $18 billion from the U.S. Treasury. Government-\nsubsidized premiums for certain policyholders, outdated flood insurance \nrate maps, and other program weaknesses undermined NFIP's ability to \nmeet the demands created in the 2005 season. Those flaws have also \ncreated false incentives over the years, encouraging developers and \nhomeowners to build and then rebuild in flood-prone and environmentally \nsensitive areas.\n  With the 2008 hurricane season less than a month away, we have to fix \nthe program's flaws and put it back on sound financial footing. S. 2284 \ndoes just that, and I want to applaud Senators Dodd and Shelby and my \nother colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee for their excellent \nwork.\n  First and foremost, S. 2284 restores the program's solvency by \nforgiving FEMA's debt to the Treasury. FEMA isn't able to repay it; the \ninterest alone is approximately $900 million annually, equal to almost \n40 percent of annual premium income. In order to keep rates affordable, \nwe have to accept that loss and turn our attention to improving the \nprogram so it is better able to pay claims in the future.\n  S. 2284 takes several steps to make sure that the program's revenues \nwill be sufficient to meet those future needs. The legislation moves \nseveral types of homeowners, who previously received subsidized rates, \ntoward premiums that match their actual risk of flooding. It expands \nthe categories of people who need to buy flood insurance to better \nreflect the categories of people actually at high risk. It includes \nprovisions to encourage more homeowners, even those outside the highest \nrisk areas, to buy insurance.\n  S. 2284 takes steps to ensure we know who is at high risk. It \nauthorizes more money for FEMA to update and digitize the Nation's \nflood hazard maps. Most FEMA maps contain 30-year old data. Think of \nthat. How many of us live in houses or even neighborhoods that were \nbuilt in the last 30 years? Homeowners and officials can't make good \ndecisions about risk and development based on such woefully outdated \ninformation.\n  At present, FEMA's map modernization program updates old maps by \nputting them in digital form without changing any of the information. \nSo if you live in a house or on a street that only came into existence \nin the past 30 years or so, you wouldn't be on the old map or the new \n``updated'' map. Maryland officials, to their credit, were among a \nhandful of State and local officials nationwide who realized that mere \ndigitization alone isn't enough, and they contributed their own time \nand data to update the content, as well. Those maps will all be \ncompleted over the next 5 years. I am proud of my State's emergency \nmanagement officials for showing that initiative, and I am glad that \nthis bill makes substantive improvement to flood plain maps the norm \nrather than the exception.\n  One of the biggest lessons we Marylanders learned in the wake of \nHurricane Isabel in 2003 was that people didn't have good information \nabout flood insurance. Some people who should have had insurance \ndidn't. Some who had it didn't understand it, had too little coverage, \nor too much coverage.\n  S. 2284 will improve consumer education. It takes steps to ensure \nthat all homeowners at high risk of flood damage participate in the \nprogram and that more homeowners know about the flood risks to their \nproperty and about the insurance options available to them. It requires \nevery person who buys a home in an area of elevated flood risk to learn \nabout that risk at their settlement and be given an opportunity to \npurchase insurance. It places the burden on lenders to make sure all \npeople who need to have insurance actually get it. It would provide \ngrant money to communities to conduct educational and outreach \nactivities to encourage people to purchase flood insurance and learn \nwhat steps they can take to mitigate against flood damage. Last but not \nleast, S. 2284 creates an Office of the Flood Insurance Advocate to \nassist policyholders with any problems they have with their NFIP \nclaims.\n  Rates that reflect risk, better flood plain maps, more expansive \nparticipation, and better information: these changes will make the \nprogram self-sufficient once again. But even more important, by \nproviding homeowners, communities, developers, and emergency management \nand planning officials with accurate information about flood risk and \nits associated costs, S. 2284 reverses some of the program's false \nincentives to build and live in disaster-prone areas.\n\n[[Page S3966]]\n\n  When hurricane season starts this year, it will bring greater risk to \nmany States, Maryland included. An April 2007 Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change report found that global warming will result in more \nflooding through more intense hurricanes, reduced snow pack, and sea \nlevel rise. We are experiencing those changes today in Maryland.\n  We have over 4,000 miles of coastline, more than the State of \nCalifornia, and historic tide-gauge records show sea levels have risen \none foot within Maryland's coastal waters over the last century. Due in \npart to naturally occurring regional land subsidence, Maryland is \ncurrently experiencing sea level rise at a rate nearly double the \nworldwide average. Thirteen charted islands and large expanses of those \ncritical tidal wetlands in the Chesapeake Bay have already disappeared.\n  These changes make us more vulnerable to storm surges. Allstate \nInsurance, one of our largest insurers, announced this past year that \nit would stop writing new homeowners' policies in coastal areas of my \nState. The reason they won't give insurance to homeowners in coastal \nareas is because they say a warmer Atlantic Ocean will lead to more and \nstronger hurricanes hitting the Northeast.\n  It is critical that we shore up the National Insurance Flood Program \nso that it is ready to support Marylanders and all Americans in times \nof need. S. 2284 does that without increasing incentives to build in \ndisaster-prone areas or destroy environmentally sensitive areas. That \nis a tough line to navigate, but this bill does it well. I am proud to \noffer my support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/08/senate-section/article/S3966-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I recently returned from a trip around \nWyoming. The focus of my trip was the need for change in our health \ncare system. I have spoken about that issue on the floor of the Senate \non a number of occasions, and while improving our Nation's health care \nsystem is essential, here today to speak on another issue of great \nimportance to my constituents. That issue relates to our Nation's \nenergy security. We have debated measures to tax one type of energy to \nprovide tax incentives for other industries. We have debated, without \nsuccess, the idea of opening up more of America to energy production \nand the Senate will eventually take up legislation related to climate \nchange.\n  As we have had those debates, we have seen gas prices rise to record \nlevels. We have passed a ``renewable fuels mandate'' that looks less \nencouraging with every new study that is released, and we have sent \nmore and more money to countries that do not support our ideals of \nfreedom and democracy.\n  Because of that, it is my intention here today to inject a little \nreality, a little common sense into the energy debate. I want us to \ntake a realistic look at how we get there from here. The ``there'' is \nan America that produces more clean, renewable energy than we can \npossibly consume. The ``here'' and now is an America that is largely \ndependent on foreign governments for the energy we need, the energy we \ncan't do without--the energy that is the lifeblood of our economy; the \nenergy that makes our way of life possible. Where we find ourselves now \nis the hole that the failed planning of the past and realistic ideology \nhas put us in. We have got to get out. We have got to get out for the \nsake of our children and for the sake of Americans who are struggling \nto pay their bills today.\n  For the most part, we can all agree on where we want to go. We want \nmore clean energy. We want to import less foreign oil. We want improved \nenergy efficiency. We can also agree that where we are is not \nacceptable. Its the road we travel, the pathway we take to a better \nfuture that we have been arguing about for decades. The arguments I \nhave seen over the past dozen years or more center not on economic \nhealth of our Nation but on environmental health. OK. That is fine with \nme. We can talk about hydrogen fuel cells, solar panels and wind \nturbines and we should. All these energy sources and many other \nrenewables are going to be a part of the solution, but overnight, they \ncannot replace the fuel sources we use today. The technology is not \nthere. The infrastructure is not there, and the will of the American \npeople to switch to different, more expensive fuel sources is not \nthere. It is one thing to say, yes, let's go green, but it's another \nthing to pull the green out of your wallet to pay for it. Technology \ntakes time to commercialize. Infrastructure takes time to build and the \nattitudes and willingness of many Americans to embrace a new energy \nmarket, a market that could be more expensive, will take time to occur.\n\n  What do we do until we get there? What do we do with the energy \nsources we have now? We make them better. We use them more efficiently. \nWe make them clean. We make them green. And what is America's most \nreadily accessible energy source that we already have the \ninfrastructure in place to use? What is the 800-pound gorilla in the \nroom that unfortunately so many of our political leaders are ignoring \nor worse yet, persecuting? It's coal.\n  When you turn on your computer, when you flick that light switch or \nturn on the television, it's probably powered by coal. Most of the \nenergy we use to recycle the aluminum cans you put in the special bin \non the curb, the glass, the metal, the plastic, well it comes from \ncoal. And if you had an electric car now and wanted to plug it in to \nrecharge, that energy would likely come from coal. Coal supplies more \nthan 50 percent of our Nation's electricity and we have enough of it to \nlast us for more than 225 maybe 500 years. Coal is what is going to \npave the way to a completely renewable energy future. But its not going \nto be the coal you are picturing in your head right now. It's not going \nto be the black lump that Santa gives to ill-behaved kids on his list. \nIt's not the dirty, dusty coal of Dickens' Victorian London. No, what I \nam talking about is plentiful clean coal that we use our ingenuity and \nour resources to turn into green coal.\n  You are worried about climate change and support the use of clean-\nburning natural gas. Good. Then you should support the projects \nunderway right now that will convert coal into that natural gas or \ncarbon sequestration of 50 percent of the carbon from coal, which makes \ncoal just as ``clean'' as natural gas. We are developing technology to \nefficiently and cost-effectively convert coal into low carbon, low \nsulfur diesel, and to convert coal into low carbon gasoline so we can \ncancel those trips to Saudi Arabia where we have our hands out begging \nthem to increase production of oil. Look, tomorrow we are not going to \nbe able to jump into our hover car that is powered by common household \ntrash. We need to develop what we have right now alongside the fuels of \nthe future. Instead of running from coal, we should invest in its \nabundance, in its power and its potential. Instead of running from \ncoal, America needs to run on coal, green coal.\n  George Washington Carver is one of my heroes for what he did with the \npeanut. He found over 300 ways that American farmers could use the \npeanut, including as soap, facial cream, shampoo and even ink. What we \nneed now is a George Washington Carver of coal--and I believe several \nare out there right now ready to invent. They just need a little bit \nmore encouragement instead of the ``can't do'' attitude that I hear \nfrom some opponents of coal.\n  Over the next few months, as we debate energy issues in the Senate, I \nwill be talking with my colleagues about the need to develop the energy \nsources we will use in the future, some of which must be cleaner, more \nefficient versions of the energy sources we use today. We need all the \nenergy we can get to power America, and I look forward to working on \nthat solution.\n  I have been paying attention to what China is doing. They have \nfigured out that the future power of the world is in energy, and they \nare buying it up anywhere they can. They are even buying U.S. coal.\n\n[[Page S3967]]\n\n  But I wish to speak today in a little more detail on an issue that is \naffecting everyone in the Nation, and that issue is the rising price of \ngasoline and diesel fuel. The rising prices are disproportionately \naffecting my constituents in Wyoming, who are oftentimes forced to \ndrive long distances to get to and from work, and then all over the \ncountry I am hearing from truckers, usually small company truckers who \nhave a fixed contract to deliver a product and no fuel escalation \nclause. I expect, from a financial literacy situation, that they have \nlearned something about that, but they are still tied into those and \nthey are going broke doing what they agreed to do because of the cost \nof fuel. They are visiting with all of us.\n  The Senate needs to take up action, and there is an amendment before \nus that will help all Americans.\n  With Americans hurting, we need to do something--anything to reduce \ngasoline prices. But, instead of working on solutions for one of the \nsingle most important issues confronting the American people, the \nmajority sticks its fingers in its ears and loudly sings campaign \nrhetoric chorus and verse. Last week, as oil shot up above $115 per \nbarrel, we held one vote. We did not vote on Tuesday, Wednesday, \nThursday or Friday. This week, we were out of session on Monday. This \nis not the way we should legislate when Americans cannot afford to fill \nup their tanks. We need to do something about energy and we need to do \nit now.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Domestic Energy Production Act of \n2008 that was recently introduced by Senator Domenici. The legislation \nincludes a number of important provisions that will have a positive \neffect on our Nation's energy situation. Some provisions are designed \nto help hard working consumers today. Other provisions have a long term \nimpact that will make it so that we are not as dependent on oil barons \nin the Middle East and foreign dictators to get our energy.\n  There are a number of good provisions in this bill that will make a \ndifference. The bill allows for the development of domestic energy \nsources that are currently off limits. A major reason we are seeing \nhigh prices is the lack of domestic energy supplies in the face of \ngrowing energy demands. It allows for responsible energy production in \nthe Outer Continental Shelf and for limited, environmentally safe \nenergy production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Allowing for \nthis production will help us to lessen our imports of energy. What we \nproduce in the United States we do not have to send money to other \ncountries for.\n  The bill addresses the need to build new refineries. There is not \nenough refining capacity in the United States to handle the demand that \nwe have. Yet our policies are so onerous that there has not been a new \nrefinery built in the United States in more than 30 years. This needs \nto change, and the only way it will change is if we act to make the \nprocess for permitting a refinery more reasonable.\n  The bill addresses the need to fairly compensate States that allow \nfor energy production to occur on their lands by repealing a provision \nto withhold 2 percent of the revenue States receive to pay for \n``administrative costs.'' This provision is particularly harmful to \nWyoming and must be repealed immediately. The Federal Government's \nactions toward the Sates regarding mineral royalties are the actions of \na bully and a thief. I am standing up to this bully. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me. Your State could be bullied next. Don't forget \nthat.\n  This bill also addresses our Nation's need to find alternatives to \noil by promoting coal to diesel fuel. Coal is our Nation's most \nabundant energy source and can be made into low sulfur diesel through a \nprocess that has been in existence for years. We need to build coal to \ndiesel plants in the United States in order to increase our energy \nsecurity and this bill has provisions to promote this important and \nmuch needed policy.\n  Any one of provisions I have mentioned will help our Nation's energy \nsituation and we need to act now. If the majority doesn't like every \npart of it, that is fine. Let's get in there and pass the parts we can \nagree on. Let's change the parts we can't agree on. Let's throw some of \nthe parts out. I was working on an 80 percent rule, figuring we can \nusually agree on 80 percent of anything and if we concentrate on the 80 \npercent, we can get it done and leave the other 20 percent to the \npundits. But we need to get out there and pass the parts we agree on. \nWe need to get something done.\n\n  There will be plenty of credit to go around. Congress cannot sit back \nand do nothing as American pocketbooks are bleeding. Right now, the \ncredit for that has to go to the majority.\n  I hope all my colleagues join me in supporting the Domestic Energy \nProduction Act of 2008, even though we do not get to vote on it \ntomorrow and we don't get to vote on it Monday. We are not going to get \nto vote on it until Tuesday. But we ought to be making some difference \nby Tuesday.\n  Like I say, we can revise it, we can change it, we can throw parts \nout, but we have got to do something. America is complaining about the \nprice of gas. I understand that. I look forward to seeing everyone next \nweek to make a difference for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                           Offshore Drilling\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, next Tuesday--not Monday but \nTuesday--we are going to have a series of votes and ultimately get to \nthe final vote on the flood insurance bill. And miraculously, out of \nthe air comes a couple of energy packages side by side that we are \ngoing to be voting on.\n  It is very interesting that in one of those energy packages, that \nbeing offered by the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, it will \nhave a provision for drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. Now, we \nhave gone through this drill about drilling several times, the last of \nwhich, I want to remind the Senate, when the pro drilling for oil \nforces wanted an additional 2 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico, \nwhich would go east in the eastern Gulf of Mexico headed straight \ntoward Tampa, FL, we worked out something that would satisfy all of the \nparties; that they would not have 2 million acres but they would have 8 \nmillion acres--8 million acres, not 2 million acres. But it would be \nfurther to the south, not to the east and, therefore, would not harm \nthe interests of Florida or the U.S. military.\n  I remind my colleagues that the U.S. military's largest testing and \ntraining area in the world is almost the entire Gulf of Mexico off of \nFlorida. It is the pilot training for the new F-22 out of Tindale Air \nForce Base in Panama City. They have to have wide areas with which to \ndo dog fighting, not at submach but at 1.5 mach, and the turning radius \nat 1.5 mach is extraordinary. When are you doing this with live fire \nexercises, you can imagine that you do not want anything down there on \nthe surface of the water. By the way, that is also why all of the new \nF-35s, the new joint strike fighter pilot training, when that fighter \nis developed, will also be in that area.\n  It is also the reason the Navy now sends its squadrons down to the \nKey West Naval Air Station at Boca Chica, because when they lift off \nthe runway at Boca Chica, in 2 minutes they are over restricted air \nspace where they can do their pilot training. But it is also the area \nwhere we are testing some of our most sophisticated weapons systems, \nmany of which are with live ordnance, and you simply cannot have oil \nrigs down there on the surface of the water where you are doing all of \nthis in furtherance of the training and the testing in order to have \nthe best military in the world.\n  Yet it is coming back. It is coming back again. Now this time it is a \nlittle easier for us because we etched it into law as to that \nadditional lease area for drilling in the Gulf, and you have got to \nchange the law. Until the last time, it had always been under a \nPresidential moratorium. So it will be more difficult for them to have \nto change this. But I bring this up because the attitude is tunnel \nvision about drill, drill, drill.\n  That is not how we are going to solve the problem. I mean, are we not \ngoing to wake up with $120 per barrel oil prices and, who knows, with \nthe tight world oil market, if it is not going to keep going up?\n  And why is it at $120? We have had testimony here in the Senate from \noil executives who say the typical supply-demand on the world market \nought to\n\n[[Page S3968]]\n\nhave the price of oil at $55 per barrel. If that testimony is accurate, \nwhy the difference then between $55 and $120?\n  I think part of the answer to that question is, you look at history. \nYou see these spikes whenever there is an unsettling condition in the \nworld. You saw that in the early 1970s in the oil embargo. You saw that \nagain in the late 1970s with the Iranian capture of the American \nEmbassy people and holding them hostage. You saw it again at the \nbeginning of the 1990s with the first gulf war, when Saddam Hussein had \nmoved on Kuwait. You have seen it again in this decade with the Iraq \nsituation, and you see it now with the jitters about what is happening \nin the Middle East.\n  You see it also in the unsettling relationship we now have with the \nPresident of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, who bombastically keeps \nthreatening to cut off oil. Now, that is a hollow promise because we \nhave the refineries that have to process his grade of crude. But over \ntime he could change. Nevertheless, it unsettles the markets.\n  By the way, we get 14 percent of our oil daily, our daily consumption \nof oil, from Venezuela.\n  You see it also with regard to Nigeria. Mark my word. Nigeria is an \naccident waiting to happen with regard to the 12 percent of our daily \nconsumption of oil that comes from Nigeria. And already the battery, \nthe thievery, the kidnappings, all of that being done by criminal \nthugs, that is one threat. But I recall for the Senate the fact that in \nnorthern Nigeria, al-Qaida is ascending. So that is certainly one \nreason for the difference between what some people have testified that \nthe supply and demand would have oil at $55, and instead it is at $120.\n  But there is another reason. That is the speculation on oil futures \nand bidding the price up that gets us to this point.\n  Now, I am giving all of this background to say, well, what do we do? \nIs the answer the tunnel vision or myopic vision of drill, drill, \ndrill, or do we do what we know we have to do? And the question is, \nwhere is most of our oil consumed? It is in transportation. Where in \ntransportation is most of the oil consumed? It is in our personal \nvehicles.\n  So why do we not get serious, as we had our first inkling that we \nare, by having more conservation with greater miles per gallon? We \npassed in this Senate 35 miles per gallon phased in all the way out \nuntil 2015.\n  In Japan today, they are running around in their cars at 50 miles per \ngallon. In Europe today, they have got an average of 43 miles per \ngallon. Why cannot America summon the political will to say we are \ngoing to do something different than what we have been doing in the \npast, and we are going to try to wean ourselves from dependence on \nforeign oil which makes up 60 percent of our daily consumption. If we \nhad the political will, we could do it. And, of course, if we had the \npolitical will, we could not only do the miles per gallon, we would put \nthe money into the research and development to ultimately get to \ncellulosic ethanol so we would not be making ethanol from what we need \nto eat, and instead we would be making it from fiber, from that which \nwe throw away. If we summon the political will, we would get serious \nabout conservation measures and renewable fuels such as wind and solar, \nall the more than we are now. We would get serious about a major R \neffort and pouring the money into it in order to start developing the \nengine of the future that does not depend on any kind of petrol, such \nas hydrogen, or perfecting these batteries so we can have an all-\nelectric vehicle. That is what we would be doing if we summoned the \npolitical will. At the end of the day, that is what we are going to \nhave to do. It is going to have to be the new President who does it.\n  On this subject I will close by saying, America has a historical \ntendency to drag its feet until we are abruptly shoved up against the \nwall and we have to do something, and you see this throughout our two \ncenturies of history.\n  There was at a time, for example, during the Korean war, the Soviets \nhad the high ground. Their MiGs could fly higher than our jets. Again \nin 1958 they had the high ground, because they put up the first \nsatellite, Sputnik. Again in 1961 they had the high ground, when they \nput up Yuri Gagarin, the first human to orbit the Earth.\n  We did not even have a vehicle that was powerful enough until 10 \nmonths later when we put John Glenn in that flimsy Atlas that had a 20-\npercent chance of failure, and finally got up.\n  Again, they had the high ground when they rendezvoused, the first \ntime in space, with two spacecraft. They beat us to that. But then \nAmerica summoned the political will when the President said: We are \ngoing to the Moon in 9 years and return. And we did. And we have the \nhigh ground now.\n  Now it is another complete subject--I will not get into it--about how \nwe could be losing that high ground with NASA, because NASA is not \ngetting enough resources for all of the things it is trying to do and, \ntherefore, it is not going to have a chance to achieve and keep that \nhigh ground if we do not. But I will save that one for next week.\n\n\n                       Israel's 60th Anniversary\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, many of us have come to the floor, \ncertainly this past week--all this year--talking about increasing \nenergy prices. There has been a lot of commentary about whom to blame. \nWhat do we do, how do we reduce the price of oil, how do we address the \npredicament we are in as a nation that is so very heavily dependent on \nenergy for our economic strength? I have certainly done my share of \ntalking about the need to increase domestic production of oil and gas, \nparticularly in the State of Alaska. We believe we have great \nopportunities up there and can be doing more to address it. What we \nhaven't had an opportunity to bring up in the debate is the potential \nfor a vast reservoir of energy that is available to the United States \nin the Arctic, in the far north, and the fact that we could lose out to \nother nations if we are not more proactive in asserting our claims to \nthese resources.\n  I have been on the floor many times talking about the Arctic Coastal \nPlain and the potential in ANWR. We believe there is anywhere between \n10 to 16 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil, the largest \nremaining onshore petroleum field in North America. But even further to \nthe north, beyond ANWR, off the coast of Alaska and beyond, this is \nwhere we believe an unquantifiable amount of resource may lie. It is \nestimated that the Arctic may hold 25 percent of the entire world's \nundiscovered oil and gas resources. It is enormous. That number is \nbased on a 2000 assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey. In that \nsurvey, they only looked at a few of the Arctic basins. There is going \nto be a more detailed survey that will be out. The survey is currently \nunderway. The projection is that the amount of 25 percent could be \nlower--that, in fact, the amount of oil and gas in the Arctic region \ncould go significantly higher.\n  What is the problem with this situation? The fact is, we believe the \npotential in the Arctic under the ice may be enormous, but we have no \nlegal claim as a nation to most of this oil or gas, unless the United \nStates becomes a party to the convention on the law of the sea. I can \ntell you, if we are not willing to claim it, if we do not step up to \nclaim it, others certainly will.\n\n  We had before the Foreign Relations Committee the Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea. It was before us. We have had several hearings on it. \nIt was reported favorably out of the committee on October 31 of last \nyear by a committee vote of 17 to 4.\n  For those who are not familiar with the Law of the Sea Treaty, it \nallows, among other things, coastal states to exert sovereign rights to \nall living and nonliving resources within its exclusive economic zone \nout to 200 nautical\n\n[[Page S3969]]\n\nmiles from its shores. Essentially, it is the Outer Continental Shelf. \nBut, in addition, a nation can exert claim to an extended Outer \nContinental Shelf if it can show that its continental shelf extends \nbeyond the 200-mile limit.\n  So last year, the Coast Guard Cutter Healy went up north beyond \nAlaska, up into the Arctic Ocean, to do a mapping of the ocean floor \nthere, to determine where the extent of that continental shelf may \nextend.\n  Behind me I have a map or chart of the Arctic Ocean that was mapped \nby the Coast Guard Cutter Healy during this last season of exploration. \nWhat the expedition showed us was that the United States could \npotentially lay claim to an area about the size of the State of \nCalifornia as part of our extended continental shelf. But we cannot do \nthat without being a party to the Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n  So to make it a little more real to the situation--and I know it is \ndifficult to see the map--but what you have here is Alaska. It is \nupside down, but Alaska is at the top of the world, so we felt it \nshould be located at this angle. Here is the State of Alaska, the \nCanadian border, all of Canada, Greenland, Norway, and then Russia up \nthrough here. The red dotted line indicates the limits of the permanent \nice that you have. So much of what you see in the lighter area is \ncontinental shelf.\n  What you have with this line--that kind of follows in a very jagged \nway Russia--this is Russia's continental shelf claim. So they are \nessentially laying claim to this area from the Chukchi Sea, the East \nSiberian Sea, and down through here.\n  Norway has its extended continental shelf claim. Here is Norway. They \nhave made a claim that their Outer Continental Shelf should allow them \naccess to the resources up to this green line.\n  Well, what we have here with the yellow line is the Russian extended \ncontinental shelf area. So through their mapping, or their \ndetermination, they believe--the Russians believe--they could \npotentially lay claim to all of this area in to the coast of Russia.\n  Where it gets a little complicated is looking at the coastline of \nAlaska, recognizing that we have claim to 200 miles off the coast of \nAlaska, but with the mapping the Coast Guard Cutter Healy has brought \nback, it demonstrates we can potentially add an additional 100 miles \noffshore from our existing 200 miles of exclusive economic zone, \ntheoretically putting Alaska's claim--and, therefore, the United \nStates's claim--to an area that would be potentially on this side of \nthe Canadian border and coming down through the Chukchi Sea, clearly \noverlapping where the Russians have submitted that they would have the \npotential for a claim.\n  So you need to kind of appreciate the dynamics you have here. We have \nmapping that indicates the U.S. continental shelf could extend out \ndramatically. When you talk about a mass, an area the size of the State \nof California, you would say that is hugely significant to us as a \nnation in terms of our potential for additional resource.\n  Now, I have shown you the lines on this map. There are some who \nobject to ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty and express \nconcerns about sovereignty. But for those who are concerned about \nsovereignty, I would suggest that if we are not party to the Convention \non the Law of the Sea, there is a good chance Russia's claim to the \nArctic--which I have shown you, following this yellow line, which is \nsubstantial; it is about 45 percent of the Arctic Ocean--could be \nrecognized cutting into what we believe to be our extended continental \nshelf.\n  Now, let's talk a little bit about the potential for the resources up \nthere. It is estimated the area that Russia claims as its Arctic Ocean \nshelf--so this area in through here, as shown on the map--could hold \n580 billion barrels of oil equivalent. And 90 billion of those barrels \ncould be in the Chukchi Sea and the East Siberian Sea, so close in to \nthe State of Alaska. That is 90 billion barrels of oil we have the \npotential to stake a claim to as well, but only, again, if we are party \nto the Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n  Now, some would take a look at this map and say: Well, Russia is not \ngoing to be able to get that. We all saw the cover of Time magazine \nlast year when Russia took a little submarine down and basically \nplanted a flag on the bottom of the seabed, staking claim. It got \npeople's attention. I think folks looked at that and said: Well, they \ndon't have any claim to that ocean seabed. On what do they base that? \nSo you look at this map and say: There is no reason Russia has any \ngreater claim to 45 percent of the Arctic Ocean anymore than the United \nStates or Canada, so it is not going to happen.\n  But for those who would doubt Russia might have success with their \nclaim, I would ask you to look at what has happened. Right now, you \nhave a handful--probably, seven or eight--different nations that have \nsubmitted to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf \ntheir requests for extended continental shelf claim.\n  Russia submitted their claim back in 2001. Brazil is out there, and \nthey submitted their claim in 2004. Australia submitted a claim in \n2004, Ireland in 2005, New Zealand in 2006. You also have a joint \nsubmission by France, Ireland, Spain, and the United Kingdom that came \nabout in 2006. Norway submitted their claim--that is going out this \nfar, as shown on the map--in 2006. France has submitted a claim last \nyear, as well as Mexico.\n  On April 21 of this year, the Commission on the Limits of the \nContinental Shelf confirmed that Australia's claim to an additional 2.5 \nmillion square kilometers of continental shelf beyond its existing \nexclusive economic zone was valid and has moved forward to allow for \nthat extended claim.\n  Now, Australia's claim, again, was submitted in 2004. So the \nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf is actually moving on \nthese submissions. The claim Australia made--and, again, Australia is \nan island nation, so they clearly have a great deal they can say lies \noff their continental shelf area, but 2.5 million square kilometers of \ncontinental shelf has now been added to their jurisdiction. This is an \narea approximately five times the State of France. Now, for those of us \nwho are thinking a little bit closer to home, that is three times the \nsize of the State of Texas. So, again, the jurisdiction that has been \nextended to the nation of Australia, because of their claim to \nadditional Outer Continental Shelf areas, is significant.\n  Martin Ferguson, who is Australia's Minister for Resources and \nEnergy, noted that the Commission's findings ``demonstrates that \nAustralia's effective engagement in law of the sea matters delivers \nresults.''\n  Now, I mentioned nine submissions that have been submitted for \nextended continental shelf claims. All of these have been made since \nDecember of 2001, including Russia's claim to half the Arctic and the \nresources it holds. We see that Australia's claims have been accepted. \nI believe it is only a matter of time before other claims are accepted \nas well.\n  I believe--I believe very strongly--it is in the best interests of \nthe United States to be able to submit our claims. We have the mapping. \nWe can establish the extension of the shelf, again, to a considerable \narea--the size of the State of California. I believe it is incumbent \nupon us to assert our authority in this area and to have a seat at the \ntable in determining the validity of the claims of the other nations.\n  If we think Russia should not be able to extend their jurisdiction \nout--as they have requested, with this pretty impressive yellow line--\nto 45 percent of the Arctic Ocean, we want to be able to sit at the \ntable and say why we believe they should not have the ability to make \nthat claim. Well, if we are not a party to the treaty, we are not \nsitting at the table, and we cannot contest the validity of the claims \nof other nations.\n  We have the opportunity to stake a claim to an area of the seabed \nthat we believe--we believe very strongly--likely contains billions of \nbarrels of oil. We have the research to demonstrate that the seabed is \npart of our extended continental shelf. But we cannot claim ownership \nof these resources without being a party to the Convention on the Law \nof the Sea.\n  There are plenty of other reasons why we should ratify this treaty--\nwhether it is to ensure that our Navy has the ability to freely \nnavigate in international waters; or to provide our maritime industries \nwith the legal certainty they need to carry out their activities.\n  I believe, again, very strongly, the ratification of the convention \nis a\n\n[[Page S3970]]\n\nmust. But I think we need to recognize that as we are kind of sitting \nback on this at this point in time, other nations are moving forward. \nThey are making their claims to greater areas of the ocean and to its \nseabed. I do not think we should be left behind as a nation and lose \nout on significant potential energy reserves at a time when we all know \nthat energy is at an incredible premium.\n  I will make the same statement I made in committee when we had the \ndiscussion on the Convention on the Law of the Sea. I urge my \ncolleagues to support ratification of the Convention on the Law of the \nSea and urge the Senate leadership to bring the treaty to the floor for \na vote. With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from South \nCarolina is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/08/senate-section/article/S3970-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HEALTH CARE OPTIONS\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, we have many important issues in front of \nus. We have been talking a lot about energy this week, including the \nhigh cost of gasoline and problems with ethanol mandates and potential \nproblems with the cost of electricity. As we look at ways to reduce \npollution, certainly energy is important. We have also been dealing \nwith flood insurance. There is no shortage of issues. But we know as we \ntalk to our constituents around the country that at the top of their \nlist of priorities is health insurance and health care and the ability \nto afford the policies that are out there.\n  We have differences of opinion in the Senate as to how to deal with \nthe uninsured in our country today. There is one philosophy that \nbelieves the government needs to be more involved; we need to expand \ngovernment control of health care. There is another philosophy of which \nI am a part which believes that our job in the Senate and in the \nCongress and in the Federal Government is to make freedom work for \neveryone, and that includes people having the freedom to own their own \nhealth insurance. We believe when people do not work for a company that \noffers health insurance, they should have guaranteed access to \naffordable health insurance policies that they can take from job to \njob. I am encouraged that Senator McCain is on the side of freedom of \nchoice and individual ownership of plans.\n  We know if we are going to make individual plans work, we need to \naddress the high cost of insurance. We know that is the biggest \nimpediment to getting coverage when that coverage is not offered \nthrough an employer. In fact, nearly two-thirds of the uninsured are \nthe working poor, and they cite the high cost of insurance as the \nprimary barrier to accessing health coverage. We can talk about the \nuninsured, and we can talk about the high cost of insurance, but we \nneed to address the real causes of the high cost of insurance. We know \nif we look at the policies, if we talk to those who offer the \npolicies--the insurance companies--we know that mandates, government \nmandates on those policies have a lot to do with the high cost of \ninsurance.\n  States have passed more than 1,900 benefit mandates requiring \ninsurance companies to cover everything from wigs to infertility \ntreatments to acupuncturists to massage therapists. These may all be \nlegitimate needs, but they are not legitimate mandates on insurance \npolicies. When people are looking for a policy that meets their needs \nthat they can afford, we cannot continue as governments--both State and \nFederal--to mandate that every policy cover every possible problem when \nindividuals do not need those mandates to buy the policies they want. \nThese mandates increase the cost of health insurance. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, for every 1 percent increase in the cost \nof health insurance, 300,000 people lose their coverage.\n  A few States are getting the message that mandates make health \ninsurance more expensive. There are at least 10 States that provide for \nmandate-lite policies which allow individuals to purchase a policy with \nfewer mandates and so are more tailored to their individual needs and \nfinancial situation. There are now at least 30 States that require a \nmandate's cost to be assessed before it is implemented. These States \nare getting the message. Mandates are pricing individuals out of the \ninsurance market.\n  I have introduced legislation that addresses these growing problems. \nIn December, Congressman John Shadegg of Arizona joined me in \nintroducing the Health Care Choice Act. This legislation is important \nbecause it will allow consumers to shop for health insurance the same \nway they do for other insurance products. They can shop on line, by \nmail, over the phone, or in consultation with an insurance agent in \ntheir hometown.\n  Specifically, the bill would let insurers licensed in one State sell \nto individuals in the other 49 States. Most people are surprised that \nyou can't do that now because in every other product category we can \nbuy products not only in every State but all over the world. But with \nhealth insurance, we have taken a different tact, a tact that has made \nhealth insurance much more expensive because we allow a few insurance \ncompanies to monopolize the market in 50 individual States.\n  What we need is a national market for health insurance. Consumers \nwill no longer be limited to picking only those policies that meet \ntheir State regulations and mandated benefits. Instead, they can \nexamine the wide array of insurance policies qualified in one State and \noffered for sale in multiple States. This way, consumers can choose a \npolicy that best suits their needs and their budget without regard to \nState boundaries. It makes a lot of common sense. Individuals looking \nfor basic health insurance coverage can opt for a policy with a few \nbenefits they need, and such a policy will be more affordable.\n  On the other hand, consumers who have an interest in a particular \nbenefit such as infertility treatments will be able to purchase a \npolicy that includes that benefit. Equally important, it creates \nincentives for insurance companies to offer innovative and customized \ninsurance products, and it will reduce the number of Americans who have \nsought but have been unable to afford insurance coverage.\n  I am thrilled that Senator John McCain has made this legislation one \nof the cornerstones of his health insurance platform because health \ninsurance coverage should not be dictated by State or Federal \nlegislators. Families sitting around their kitchen tables should decide \nwhat their health insurance plan should cover. I believe Senator \nMcCain's plan to address the gross health care inequity in the Tax Code \nand to harness the power of the marketplace through the interstate \ncompetition of insurance products, through that, Americans will be able \nto find affordable health insurance that offers more choice and better \ncoverage. We know this is true.\n  As we talk to insurance companies, if they were allowed to offer \nproducts for all 50 States under one set of regulations, or under 50 if \nthey choose, if they are able to have a larger pool of members, they \ncan spread the risk and lower the rates.\n  The Health Care Choice Act is a commonsense way to let freedom work \nfor every American, to let the free enterprise system work in health \ninsurance as it does in almost every other area of our lives. I \nencourage my colleagues to consider the Health Care Choice Act and to \nmove away from this idea that more government control, more government \nmandates is actually going to help us get more Americans insured.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in these last days our sympathies have \nbeen stirred by the shocking images of suffering and loss that have \ncome from Burma. Last week's cyclone was one of the most devastating in \nmemory. The damage to Burma's infrastructure, to its cities and towns \nand villages, is staggering.\n  The human toll won't be known for weeks. As many as 100,000 are \nthought to be dead. Thousands more are unaccounted for and injured. And \nthose who survived face grave challenges. By all accounts, potable \nwater and food are scarce, increasing the threat of disease. And \nshelter is hard to find.\n  This kind of suffering tests our powers of comprehension. But the \nextent of the damage, combined with the already primitive economic \nconditions imposed by the Burmese regime and the regime's sluggish \nresponse to the storm, means this suffering will be far greater than it \notherwise might have been and will last far longer than it otherwise \nwould.\n  We have heard reports that little or no notice was given to the \npeople about the severity of the storm. And while the U.S. and other \ndonors have expressed a clear willingness to assist, the Burmese regime \nhas continued to resist allowing outside donors, such as the U.S., in.\n  The U.S. has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to help the \nvictims of natural disasters. Our generous response to the 2004; \ntsunami is a tribute to generosity and compassion of Americans, as was \nour response to the flooding of Bangladesh in the early 1990s. We \nresponded generously to the 1990 earthquake in the Philippines, an act \nof kindness that was met with deep gratitude. The U.S. has helped this \nregion of the world again and again, and now we stand willing to help \nthe people of Burma.\n  Precious time has been, and continues to be, wasted. Why? Because \nrather than focusing on preparations for the storm, the political \nleaders in Burma were focused on a sham constitutional referendum \nscheduled for this Saturday. While all of the energies of government \nwere needed to prepare for relief efforts, the regime was thinking of \nsolidifying its control over the country. Its only concession to the \ncritics--as the extent of the dead, the missing, and the injured became \nknown--was an agreement to postpone the referendum in certain parts of \nthe country.\n  This is not the first time the Burmese regime has put the political \nrisks of letting in outsiders over urgent humanitarian needs. In 2004, \nthe same junta rejected foreign aid after the tsunami. The only \ndifference this time is that the devastation to Burma and the Burmese \npeople is on a much larger scale.\n  If Saturday's referendum were legitimate, its timing would be merely \nirresponsible and crass. Yet everything about this Saturday's \nreferendum is a farce. The process leading up to it has been marked by \noppressive measures that, of course, are not typically associated with \nfree and open political debate. It's a crime, for instance, to \ncriticize the document.\n  The substance of the constitution is also profoundly antidemocratic. \nIt prohibits Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the party that won Burma's \nlast free and democratic election, from holding high office. Former \npolitical prisoners and activists could find themselves unable to run \nfor Parliament. And the Burmese military would control key ministries \nand hold a quarter of the seats in the national legislature.\n  This is not a constitution. This is a fig leaf to place over the \njunta's oppressive rule.\n  The people of Burma are already suffering from the tragedy of a \nterrible natural disaster. Now they are being forced to participate in \na farce. Last week's cyclone revealed more than nature's power and \nlife's fragility. It revealed, once again, the inhumanity of Burmese \njunta--not only in its disregard for the people suffering from the \nstorm, but also in its callous insistence that, in the midst of so much \nsuffering, a sham constitutional referendum validating its authority go \nforward.\n  This is a time of great sadness in Burma. It is also a time of \nrenewed outrage at the oppressive regime that controls it. On occasion, \nthe leaders of such regimes reveal their warped minds to the world. \nThis is such a time. It's my hope the world will take notice.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to address the terrible toll \ntaken by the recent cyclone in Burma.\n  It is unimaginable to me that the people of Burma, already struggling \nunder the weight of tyranny, could be expected to bear further \nhardship. The daily trudge for existence faced by the Burmese is heart-\nwrenching; and yet now their suffering has increased. On Saturday, May \n3, their country was struck by a horrible cyclone, an unfortunately \ncommon occurrence in Southeast Asia. U.S. diplomats estimate the death \ntoll from this storm could be as high as 100,000, victims of a 120 mph \nwind and a storm surge that has obliterated entire villages. The United \nNations estimates that hundreds of thousands of people have been left \nwithout basic necessities such as food, potable water, and shelter.\n  The Burmese military regime has compounded this crisis through \npolitical repression, economic mismanagement, and xenophobia. But the \ntragedy of Burma's government cannot and should not blind us to the \nhuman suffering inflicted by this most recent disaster. The \ninternational community must take immediate steps to alleviate some of \nthe worst deprivations of this humanitarian crisis. To this end, I am \nproud and humbled that two of our own Oregon institutions are leading \nthe effort in bringing comfort to the afflicted. Northwest Medical \nTeams and Mercy Corps are closely engaged in collecting humanitarian \ndonations and cooperating with local partners to help the survivors in \nBurma. I urge the government in Burma to accept the foreign assistance \noffered by these groups and others around the world.\n  I know I speak for all Oregonians--and indeed all Americans--when I \nsay that our hearts go out to the survivors of this storm. We stand \nready to help, and I sincerely thank all those who are donating their \ntime and resources to help those stricken by this terrible disaster.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/08/senate-section/article/S3971-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3971-S3972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Sergeant Glen E. Martinez\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Marine \nSgt Glen Martinez and to share my deep sadness at the loss of one of \nour Nation's finest young men. Sergeant Martinez was on his second tour \nin Iraq, working to restore peace and security to Al Anbar province, \nwhen a roadside bomb tore through his vehicle, killing him and three \nother marines. He was 31 years old.7\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with Sergeant Martinez's wife Melissa, \nhis parents Ron and Carol, his sister Lori, and her children Alexis and \nSpencer, his grandparents Isaac and Viola Martinez and Willard and \nNorma Martin, and all his friends and family. My heart also goes out to \nthe community\n\n[[Page S3972]]\n\nof Monte Vista, CO, a small town in the San Luis Valley not far from my \nfamily's ranch. The close-knit community, where everyone is a neighbor, \nhas lost a favorite son.\n  There was nothing, it seemed, that Glen Martinez couldn't do. In high \nschool, he was a top student, a gifted musician, and a star athlete. He \nwas the quarterback of the Monte Vista football team, competed for the \nState championship in wrestling, and led his baseball team. With \ncollege scholarship offers to choose from in all three sports, Glen \naccepted an academic and baseball scholarship at Ottawa University in \nOttawa, KS. He graduated with a degree in mathematics in 2000, but \ncontinued his studies at Westwood College and then at the University of \nColorado, in Boulder, where he took up a master's program in land \nsurveying.\n  At each step, Glen earned honors, awards, and the admiration of those \nhe met. He is remembered for his contagious smile, boundless energy, \nand a heart committed to service. In 2004, while living in Boulder, \nGlen determined he had an obligation to serve his country, and that he \ncould contribute most by enlisting in the Marines. By donning the \nuniform, he joined a proud family tradition of service and followed in \nthe footsteps of both his grandfathers, who served in World War II, and \nhis father Ron, who was in the Air Force during the Vietnam war.\n  In the Marines, Glen quickly became a leader among those he served. \nHe was a member of Combat Logistics Battalion-1, Combat Logistics \nRegiment-1, 1st Marine Logistics Group, out of Camp Pendleton. He rose \nrapidly to the rank of sergeant and, as with everything he did, earned \nrecognition and awards for the quality of his service. He served with \nhis wife Sgt Melissa Martinez, whom he met while training at Camp \nPendleton. When Glen was killed, they were both in Al Anbar province, \nas part of an effort to keep the lid on the violence that once made the \narea among the most dangerous in Iraq.\n  It is hard to measure all that inspired Sergeant Martinez's service. \nHe had a deep-rooted pride for his country and his community. He sensed \nan obligation to offer his talents to a cause greater than his own. And \nhe was determined to rise to every challenge presented.\n  He shared what so many of our nation's great servicemembers and great \nleaders share--the sense, as President Woodrow Wilson described it, \nthat ``the fortunes of a nation are confided to us.''\n  As World War I raged in Europe, President Wilson told the 1916 class \nat Annapolis that meeting this ``special obligation'' is perilous and \ndifficult, but it also carries the highest reward: the honor and \naffection of their fellow citizens.\n  ``You are going to live your lives under the most stimulating \ncompulsion that any man can feel,'' President Wilson told the \ngraduates, ``the sense, not of private duty merely, but of public duty \nalso. And then if you perform that duty, there is a reward awaiting you \nwhich is superior to any other reward in the world. That is the \naffectionate remembrance of your fellow men--their honor, their \naffection. No man could wish for more than that or find anything higher \nthan that to strive for. . . . I wish you Godspeed, and remind you that \nyours is the honor of the United States.''\n  Sergeant Martinez answered the call of his country with the dignity \nand honor President Woodrow Wilson extolled. Loved and respected by \nthose with whom he served, his optimism and leadership could lift and \ninspire even in the most difficult circumstances. He was an \nirrepressible spirit and an extraordinary professional.\n  Sgt Glen Martinez's achievements in life are matched only by the \ndepth of his sacrifice--and the void he leaves behind. To Glen's family \nand friends, I know no words that can ease the pain you feel. I hope \nthat in time you will find consolation in your pride in Glen's service \nand in the knowledge that his country and his community are eternally \ngrateful for all that he gave. He has honored the United States, and \nthe United States will always honor him.\n\n\n                      Specialist Ronald J. Tucker\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today to honor the life and service of \nArmy Specialist Ronald J. Tucker, of Fountain, CO. Specialist Tucker \nwas killed in Baghdad last week, at the age of 21, when a bomb exploded \nnear his patrol. He was assigned to 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry \nRegiment, 4th Infantry Division, out of Fort Hood, TX.\n  Specialist Tucker grew up in the Pikes Peak region of Colorado and \nwas a graduate of Fountain-Fort Carson High School. He was a hard-\nworking, smart, good-humored young man with hopes of serving his \ncountry. In school, he devoted himself to his studies, but shared \nlaughs and jokes with friends and teachers.\n  Ronald joined the Army just a few days after his 2005 graduation from \nhigh school. He trained to be a mortarman and, in 2006, was assigned to \nFort Hood. He deployed earlier this year and was serving as an indirect \nfire infantryman in a unit that was working to calm the violence that \nhas escalated in Baghdad over the last several weeks. Specialist Tucker \nworked tirelessly, courageously, and professionally to help bring calm \nto streets teeming with ethnic violence and to allow the Iraqi people \nto hope again.\n  Specialist Tucker followed in the footsteps of so many American \nsoldiers who have honored their country with their service, and who \nGeneral Douglas MacArthur regaled in a 1962 address to West Point \nsoldiers for their selfless sacrifices and for their unflinching \ndevotion to the protection of our Nation. ``Duty, honor, country,'' \nMacArthur told the young soldiers, ``Those three hallowed words \nreverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will \nbe.''\n  These three words have been the creed of generation after generation \nof American soldiers. They help us understand the courage and fortitude \nof men like Ronald Tucker, who deployed thousands of miles from his \nfamily, lived in constant peril, and shouldered the responsibility for \nkeeping other soldiers safe while securing a brighter future for Iraqi \ncitizens.\n  Duty, honor, country. ``The code which those words perpetuate,'' said \nGeneral MacArthur, ``embraces the highest moral law and will stand the \ntest of any ethics or philosophies ever promulgated for the things that \nare right and its restraints are from the things that are wrong. The \nsoldier, above all other men, is required to practice the greatest act \nof religious training--sacrifice . . . However hard the incidents of \nwar may be, the soldier who is called upon to offer and to give his \nlife for his country is the noblest development of mankind.''\n  Specialist Ronald Tucker embodied this creed: He donned the soldier's \nuniform at his first opportunity, he bravely entered the battlefield, \nand he offered and gave his life in service to his country. His is a \ndebt we cannot repay.\n  To Ronald's mother Susan, his stepfather David, and to all his family \nand friends, I know no words that can ease the pain you are feeling. I \nhope that in time, however, the joy Ronald brought to all who knew him \nand your pride in his service will provide comfort and consolation. His \ncountry will always honor his sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/08/senate-section/article/S3972-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3972-S3973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate violent crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  On the night of April 4, 2008, a 17-year-old Black man was traveling \nby bus from Wilmington, DE, to New Castle, DE, when three White men \nengaged him in a physical altercation. David and Lloyd Walker, 27 and \n23 years old respectively, were identified by witnesses and arrested, \nbut their accomplice, known only as ``Ritchie,'' is still at large. \nAccording to police, the three men began to argue with the young man \nwhen he complained that they were bumping into him. When the 17-year-\nold man got off the bus, the three men followed and attacked him, \nyelling racial slurs and threatening to kill him. Police say David \nWalker stabbed the teen five times in the back, puncturing one of his \nlungs and inflicting more stab wounds on his forearm.\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\nThe three men fled the scene immediately after the stabbing. Both David \nand Lloyd Walker were charged with first-degree assault, possession of \na deadly weapon during a felony, felony hate crime, and conspiracy.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws \nintended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would \nbetter equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by \nproviding the resources necessary to adequately investigate and \nprosecute violent crimes. I believe that by passing this legislation \nand changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/08/senate-section/article/S3973-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WILD SKY WILDERNESS ACT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate a tremendous and \nhard-fought victory. Today, a week after this Congress approved it \noverwhelmingly, President Bush signed the public lands bill that \nincludes my Wild Sky Wilderness Act. And I couldn't be more thrilled.\n  The path to creating the first wilderness in Washington State in more \nthan 20 years has been long and sometimes rocky. But with the \nPresident's signature today, we have finally reached the top. Let me \ntell you, Mr. President, it feels great!\n  This wilderness designation means that over 106,000 acres of rolling \nhills, rushing rivers, and low-elevation forest in the Mt. Baker-\nSnoqualmie National Forest will be preserved for generations to enjoy. \nThe bill has been the result of years of hard work by literally dozens \nof people in my home State of Washington who have been as passionate \nand excited about this bill as I have been. I could not be more proud \nof their hard work and enthusiasm. Even when progress seemed \nimpossible, they never lost sight of their goal. They always believed \nthat preserving this incredible land was possible. And this beautiful \nnew wilderness is their reward.\n  When I spoke on the floor after the Wild Sky bill passed this body, I \npromised to return once it was signed and thank the many people who \nhave worked so hard with me over the years to make the Wild Sky \nWilderness a reality. So I want to begin by thanking Congressman Rick \nLarsen. Nine years have passed since the first maps proposing this \nwilderness were unfurled at a meeting in my Seattle office. I have been \nworking with Congressman Larsen in the House for more than 7 years on \nthe legislation. And I couldn't have asked for a better partner.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Bingaman and his staff--especially \nDavid Brooks and Bob Simon--for their help and unwavering support of \nWild Sky throughout the years. I would like to thank Senator Maria \nCantwell and Congressman Jay Inslee for their work in steering Wild Sky \nthrough their committees. And thank you to all of the cosponsors from \nthe Washington delegation.\n  Above all, I want to thank all of the people in Washington State who \nworked tirelessly to turn their vision into legislation and--finally \ninto law. The following individuals have spent countless hours to make \nthe Wild Sky Wilderness Area a reality: Mike Town, Tom Uniack, Larry \nRomans, Mark Lawler, Harry Romberg, Norm Winn, Don Parks, Charlie \nRaines, Jon Owen, John Leary, Michael Carroll, Rick McGuire, Bill and \nSue Cross, Bob Hubbard, Conway Leovy, Mark Heckert, Kem Hunter, Aaron \nReardon, Peter Jackson, Michelle Ackerman, Jennifer Ekstrom, Doug \nScott, Bill Arthur, Doug Walker, Nalani Askov, Dave Sommers, Jennifer \nStephens, and Cynthia Wilkerson; as well as Shannon Harps and Karen \nFant, whose memories will live on through Wild Sky.\n  And last but not least, I would like to thank the staff members who \nhave also put their hearts and souls into this bill: John Engber, Karen \nWaters, Doug Clapp, Jaime Shimek, Jeff Bjornstad, Evan Schatz, Alex \nGlass, Pete Weissman, Matt McAlvanah, Rick Desimone, Rachelle Hein, \nChristy Gullion, Carrie Desmond, Jennifer Talhelm, Rita Beal, Shawn \nBills, Jill McKinnie, Christian Gunter, Louis Lauter, Michael Dabbs, \nKim Johnston, Brandon Hall, Amanda Mahnke, Charla Neuman, Abby \nLevenshus, Tracy Nagelbush, Amit Ronen, and Joel Merkel.\n  Those of us who live in the Northwest are truly blessed to live so \nclose to such breathtaking natural beauty. The people of Washington \nState have a great respect for our amazing natural heritage and \nmillions of people spend their weekends hiking, camping, hunting, \nfishing, and rock-climbing in our many parks and wild lands.\n  The Wild Sky area is already a popular destination being enjoyed by \nhundreds of people from across western Washington.

Mr. President, Mark Twain once said: ``20 years \nfrom now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't \ndo, than by the things you did do.'' Well, Mr. Twain had not met \nMargaret Aitken, the woman I wish to acknowledge today.\n  Margaret is the youngest of eight children--a born negotiator, \nadvocate, and spirited woman who has dedicated her professional career \nto excellence in public service. She has served the people of Delaware \nand the U.S. Senate with distinction.\n  She began her career in the Senate as a press secretary on my staff \nat the young age of 27. She came to us with impeccable credentials from \nthe county executive's team and the Department of Education. Her work \nethic and energy are surpassed only by her keen wit and disarming use \nof humor.\n  Margaret's sense of justice is embedded in her character--a byproduct \nof her strong faith and commitment to family. Her professional \nconstituency was well served by her 15 years in the public domain. \nHowever, Margaret recently decided that there was one constituency that \nneeded her most of all. In August, she and her husband Chris became the \nproud parents of Ronan William Haggerty, and Margaret is now a full-\ntime mom.\n  She understood the wisdom and the sentiment in Mark Twain's words and \nso--she will not be disappointed in hindsight. Margaret, a wordsmith \nherself, also took George Bernard Shaw to heart: ``Perhaps the greatest \nsocial service that can be rendered by anyone to this country and to \nmankind is to bring up a family.''\n  And so I say to you Margaret--bring up that family--in the image and \nlikeness of the best hopes and expectations for a better world. Thank \nyou for your service, goodness, loyalty, honor, and courage. You are a \nforce unto yourself, and you are very appreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/08/senate-section/article/S3973-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3973-S3974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO VALORIA LOVELAND\n\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Valoria \nLoveland, who recently stepped down from her position as the director \nof the Washington State Department of Agriculture. Ms. Loveland has \nworked in Washington State and local governments for the past 44 years, \nand she has recently retired to some well-deserved relaxation in her \nhome of Pasco, WA.\n  Ms. Loveland's career in government began at the Franklin County \nCourthouse, where she worked before and while she was the county's \ntreasurer. In 1992, she was elected to the State senate, where she \nswiftly rose to become the chair of the Ways and Means Committee, and \nthe most powerful woman in the Washington State Legislature. After 8 \nyears in the senate, and a brief 2-year break from government, Valoria \nwas appointed director of the Washington State Department of \nAgriculture, where she served for the last 6 years. In her time as \ndirector, Washington's agricultural exports have risen to record highs, \nin large part, thanks to her leadership. Her multiple trips to China, \nJapan, and Mexico have extended numerous opportunities to Washington \nState growers, and I thank her for working towards opening those \nmarkets.\n\n[[Page S3974]]\n\n  Throughout her career, Valoria Loveland has been known for her \nability to get things done and solve problems. Never one to shy away \nfrom tough issues, her straightforward manner and tireless work ethic \nhave earned her the respect of many.\n  Ms. Loveland's leadership will be sorely missed in Washington State, \nwhich has benefitted greatly from her years of service. I wish her \nwell, and thank her for her dedication to the State of \nWashington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/08/senate-section/article/S3974-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO CHIEF MASTER SERGEANT GLENN FREEMAN\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I wish to praise CMSgt Glenn \nFreeman, U.S. Air Force, Retired, of Omaha, who was honored on April 26 \nby the National Guard Association of Nebraska with the Distinguished \nService Award. Chief Freeman has worked in my Omaha office as senior \naide for military and veterans affairs, assisting servicemembers and \ntheir families, for the past 11 years. He is receiving the award in \nrecognition of his dedicated service to the Nebraska National Guard.\n  Glenn has served the State of Nebraska and our country in a manner \nthat deserves high recognition and our deepest respect. He is a friend \nand has been invaluable to my office. Over the last 11 years, Glenn has \nhelped thousands of Nebraska's military families with casework and \nveterans issues. Glenn is an American role model.\n  Chief Freeman, originally from Washington, DC, served in the Air \nForce for 30 years, retiring in 1985. His decorations include the \nBronze Star Medal, three Meritorious Service Medals, four Air Force \nCommendation medals, and the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with \nCombat V, Valor--Device. Chief Freeman served tours in Vietnam, \nThailand, Guam, Newfoundland, Korea, Japan, and the Republic of the \nPhilippines.\n  Prior to joining my staff, Chief Freeman was hospital service \ncoordinator for disabled American veterans. As a senior aide to me, he \ncontinues to work closely with veterans service organizations while \nassisting veterans and military families across Nebraska.\n  Chief Freeman has served as president of the Omaha Chapter Freedoms \nFoundation at Valley Forge, a non-profit organization which seeks to \npreserve American ideals and principles by helping students become \nresponsible and active citizens. He has additionally served on the \nOmaha Civil Rights Advisory Committee and as chairman of the Douglas \nCounty Republican Party and the Republican Forum. He delivers college \nlectures across Nebraska as a recognized scholar on the American \npolitical process and the U.S. Constitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/08/senate-section/article/S3974-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN RECOGNITION OF DANNY WOODHEAD\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to \na young Nebraskan who recently became a member of the New York Jets, \nafter completing a remarkable 4-year run into the National Collegiate \nAthletic Association, NCAA, record books as the all-time leading rusher \nat any level of college football.\n  Danny Woodhead, a senior tailback for Chadron State College in \nNebraska, completed his college football career with 7,962 yards \nrushing to top the previous all-division record by more than 600 yards.\n  It is not the only NCAA record set by this native son from North \nPlatte, NE. During the 2006 season, Danny set the single-season record \nfor rushing for all NCAA divisions as he rushed for 2,756 yards on 344 \ncarries. He became the first player in NCAA history to ever rush for \nmore than 2,700 yards in a season.\n  Danny Woodhead also ranks second in the Nation in career all-purpose \nyardage, with 9,479 yards. His 109 career touchdowns tie the NCAA \nrecord, and his 654 career points rank him second.\n  For his outstanding football achievements, Danny Woodhead was awarded \nthe Harlon Hill Trophy for the second year in a row. Similar to the \nHeisman, the Harlon Hill Trophy is given annually to the college \nfootball player of the year in NCAA Division II.\n  The State of Nebraska has a storied college football tradition; but \nno one has ever witnessed a running back compile the prodigious \nstatistics that Danny Woodhead, a math education major, did during his \ncareer with the Eagles. Although he played for a small college in a \nrural state, his abilities caught the attention of the sporting world.\n  The people of Nebraska are proud of Danny Woodhead and his remarkable \nachievements, and we look forward to watching him pursue his dreams in \nfootball and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/08/senate-section/article/S3974-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/08/senate-section/article/S3974-4", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.

A bill to require accurate and reasonable disclosure of the \nterms and conditions of prepaid telephone calling cards and services, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, prepaid telephone calling cards\n\n[[Page S3977]]\n\nare used by many Americans to stay in touch with loved ones around the \ncountry and throughout the world. Unfortunately, some providers and \ndistributors of these cards are scamming consumers--by imposing \nundisclosed junk fees, charging exorbitant rates, and selling cards \nthat expire shortly after consumers start using them.\n  Over the past couple of years, a number of State Attorneys General \nand the Federal Trade Commission have opened investigations and found \nthat a number of providers and distributors are engaging in unfair and \ndeceptive business practices. These practices include charging \ncustomers for calls where they receive busy signals, imposing weekly \n``maintenance fees'' that may take away up to 20 percent of the card's \noverall value, and billing for calls in 3-minute increments.\n  As a result of these investigations, some companies have been fined \nor have entered into consent decrees forbidding them from engaging in \nsome deceptive practices. In addition, some states--including Florida--\nhave imposed certain regulatory requirements on prepaid calling card \nproviders and distributors. To date, however, neither the Federal \nCommunications Commission nor the Federal Trade Commission has taken \nany action to impose up-front nationwide consumer protection \nrequirements on this industry. This lack of Federal standards allows \nmany of these unscrupulous operators to move from State to State, and \ncreate new ``shell companies'' to escape consumer protection \nregulations. This is wrong, and I think we need to fix this situation.\n  That is why I rise today to introduce the Prepaid Calling Card \nConsumer Protection Act of 2008.\n  The Prepaid Calling Card Consumer Protection Act of 2008 requires the \nFederal Trade Commission to draft comprehensive rules requiring all \nprepaid telephone calling card providers and distributors to disclose \nthe rates and fees associated with their calling cards upfront, at the \npoint of sale. It also requires providers who market their cards in \nlanguages other than English to disclose rates and fees in that \nlanguage as well. Furthermore, the legislation requires providers to \nhonor the cards for at least a year after the time the card is first \nused.\n  To enforce these disclosure requirements, the bill gives the Federal \nTrade Commission, State Attorneys General, and State consumer \nprotection advocates the ability to sue the fraudsters who violate \nthese requirements in Federal court. In addition, the law expressly \npreserves additional state consumer protection requirements--such as \nstate utility commission certification or bonding requirements.\n  I invite my colleagues to join with Senators Snowe, Kerry, Martinez \nand myself in supporting the Prepaid Calling Card Consumer Protection \nAct of 2008. We should waste no time in ensuring that military \nservicemembers, seniors, immigrants and other Americans using these \nprepaid telephone calling cards are protected from bad actors in the \nmarketplace.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2998\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to include \nFederally recognized tribal organizations in certain grant programs of \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs for the several States and \nterritories, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I proudly introduce, along with my \ngood friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii, Senator \nDaniel Inouye, the Native American Veterans Access Act. This measure \nwould provide equitable veterans' services to Native Americans by \nallowing tribal governments to apply for veterans' program grants \ncurrently limited to States, and in some cases, even U.S. Territories.\n  Native veterans have a long history of honorable and extraordinary \nservice in our national defense. From the American Indians who served \nalongside General George Washington, to Nainoa Hoe, a Native Hawaiian \nsoldier who was killed on patrol in Iraq while carrying the battle flag \nhis father held in Vietnam, native veterans have served bravely and \nhonorably.\n  Unfortunately, too often our Nation's track record in serving native \nveterans does not match their service. Especially in the case of native \nveterans who return to their ancestral homelands, reservation \ncommunities, or tribal villages, many native veterans are \ngeographically and culturally disconnected from the services provided \nby State and Federal veterans' programs.\n  Part of the problem is that veterans' programs are not always \ndesigned with native veterans in mind. For example, while the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and Department of Labor operate several \nexemplary veterans' grant programs for State governments, most of these \nprograms are not open to tribal governments. The bill I am introducing \ntoday would address this issue, by giving tribal governments access to \nmany of these important programs.\n  First, my bill would provide access to VA's two nursing home grants, \nwhich help local governments construct veterans' nursing homes and pay \nfor nursing home care, adult day care, domiciliary care, and hospital \ncare. It is important that tribal governments be included in these \ngrants, given the expected rise in the number of older native veterans. \nThe U.S. Census projects that while the overall number of older \nveterans will decrease by 10 percent by 2020, during that same period \nthe number of older native veterans will increase by 60 percent. This \nexpected boom in older native veterans makes it important that we give \ntribal governments the same opportunities we already provide State \ngovernments to care for their elder veterans.\n  My bill would also give the Secretary of Labor discretion to include \ntribal governments in Veterans Employment and Training programs and \ngrants. Veterans' employment services are much needed among native \nveterans, and in Indian Country. Census data indicates that American \nIndian and Alaska Native veterans are twice as likely as other veterans \nto be unemployed. For those veterans living on-reservation, the labor \nmarket is shamefully dismal: a recently published report from the \nBureau of Indian Affairs found on-reservation unemployment to be 49 \npercent. That unemployment rate is twice as high as national \nunemployment was during the worst year of the Great Depression. Surely \nit is not too much to ask that tribal governments in these \ncircumstances be considered for the veterans' employment programs \nStates and U.S. Territories already have access to.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting these measures, as we \nwork towards parity in access and benefits for Native American \nveterans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Recrod, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3000\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 555\n\n       Whereas the Congressional Club was organized in 1908 by 25 \n     women who were influential in Washington's official life and \n     who wanted to establish a nonsectarian and nonpolitical group \n     that would promote friendship and cordiality in public life;\n       Whereas those women founded the Club to bring the wives of \n     Members of Congress together in a hospitable and compatible \n     environment in the Nation's Capital;\n       Whereas the Congressional Club was officially established \n     in 1908 by a unanimous vote in both the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives and is the only club in the world to be \n     founded by an Act of Congress;\n       Whereas the Act entitled ``An Act to incorporate the \n     Congressional Club'' (35 Stat. 476, chapter 226) was signed \n     by President Theodore Roosevelt on May 30, 1908;\n       Whereas the Congressional Club's founding was secured by \n     womanly wiles and feminine determination in the enactment of \n     that Act unanimously on May 28, 1908, in order to overcome \n     the opposition of Representative John Sharp Williams of \n     Mississippi, who opposed all women's organizations;\n       Whereas, when Representative Williams was called out of the \n     chamber by Mrs. Williams, the good-mannered representative \n     obliged and withdrew his opposition and request for a \n     recorded vote, saying, ``upon this particular bill there will \n     not be a roll call, because it would cause a great deal of \n     domestic unhappiness in Washington if there were'';\n       Whereas the first Congressional Clubhouse was at 1432 K \n     Street Northwest in Washington, District of Columbia, and \n     opened on December 11, 1908, with a reception for President-\n     elect and Mrs. William Taft;\n       Whereas, after Mrs. John B. Henderson of Missouri donated \n     land on the corner of New Hampshire Avenue and U Street \n     Northwest, the cornerstone of the current Clubhouse was laid \n     at that location on May 21, 1914;\n       Whereas that Clubhouse was built by George Totten in the \n     Beaux Arts style and is listed on the National Register of \n     Historic Places;\n       Whereas the mortgage on the Clubhouse was paid for by the \n     sales of the Club's cookbook and the mortgage document was \n     burned by Mrs. Bess Truman in a silver bowl on the 40th \n     anniversary of the Club's founding;\n       Whereas the Congressional Club has remained a good neighbor \n     on the U Street corridor for more than 90 years, encouraging \n     the revitalization of the area during a time of socioeconomic \n     challenges and leading the way in upkeep and maintenance of \n     historic property;\n       Whereas the Congressional Club honors and supports the \n     people in its neighborhood by inviting the local police and \n     fire departments to the Clubhouse for lunch and delivering \n     trays of Member-made cookies and candies to them during the \n     holidays, by hosting an annual Senior Citizens Appreciation \n     Day luncheon for residents of a neighborhood nursing home, \n     and by hosting an annual holiday brunch for neighborhood \n     children each December that includes a festive meal, gifts, \n     and a visit from Santa Claus;\n       Whereas the Congressional Club has hosted the annual First \n     Lady's Luncheon every spring since 1912 and annually donates \n     tens of thousands of dollars to charities in the name of the \n     First Lady;\n       Whereas, among its many charitable recipients, the \n     Congressional Club has chosen mentoring programs, United \n     National Indian Tribal Youth, literacy programs, the White \n     House library, youth dance troupes, domestic shelters, and \n     child care centers;\n       Whereas the Congressional Club members, upon the suggestion \n     of Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, have been encouraged to become \n     discussion leaders on national security in their home States, \n     from the trials of World War II to the threats of terrorism;\n       Whereas the Congressional Club extends the hand of \n     friendship and goodwill globally by hosting an annual \n     diplomatic reception to entertain the spouses of ambassadors \n     to the United States;\n       Whereas the Congressional Club is solely supported by \n     membership dues and the sale of cookbooks and has never \n     received any Federal funding;\n       Whereas the 14 editions of the Congressional Club cookbook, \n     first published in 1928, reflect the life and times of the \n     United States with recipes and signatures of Members of \n     Congress, First Ladies, Ambassadors, and members of the Club;\n       Whereas the Congressional Club membership has expanded to \n     include spouses and daughters of Representatives, Senators, \n     Supreme Court Justices, and Cabinet members;\n       Whereas 7 members of the Congressional Club have become \n     First Lady: Mrs. Florence Harding, Mrs. Lou Hoover, Mrs. Bess \n     Truman, Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy, Mrs. Patricia Nixon, Mrs. \n     Betty Ford, and Mrs. Barbara Bush;\n       Whereas several members of the Congressional Club have been \n     elected to Congress, including Mrs. Jo Ann Emerson, Mrs. Lois \n     Capps, and Mrs. Mary Bono, and former presidents of the \n     Congressional Club Mrs. Lindy Boggs and Mrs. Doris Matsui;\n       Whereas leading figures in politics, the arts, and the \n     media have visited the Clubhouse throughout the past 100 \n     years;\n       Whereas the Congressional Club is home to the First Lady's \n     gown display, a museum with replica inaugural and ball gowns \n     of the First Ladies from Mrs. Mary Todd Lincoln to Mrs. Laura \n     Bush;\n       Whereas the Congressional Club is charged with receiving \n     the Presidential couple, honoring the Vice President and \n     spouse, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and \n     spouse, and the Chief Justice and spouse, and providing the \n     orientation for spouses of new Members of Congress; and\n       Whereas the Congressional Club will celebrate its 100th \n     anniversary with festivities and ceremonies during 2008 that \n     include the ringing of the official bells of the United \n     States Congress, a Founder's Day program, a birthday cake at \n     the First Lady's Luncheon, an anniversary postage stamp and \n     cancellation stamp, a 100-year pin and pendant designed by \n     former president Lois Breaux, and invitations to President \n     and Mrs. Bush, Speaker and Mr. Pelosi, and Chief Justice and \n     Mrs. Roberts to visit and celebrate 100 years of public \n     service, civility, and growth at the Congressional Club: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 100th anniversary of the founding of the \n     Congressional Club;\n       (2) acknowledges the contributions of political spouses to \n     public life in the United States and around the world through \n     the Congressional Club for the past 100 years;\n       (3) honors the past and present membership of the \n     Congressional Club; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States--\n       (A) to strive for greater friendship, civility, and \n     generosity in order to heighten public service, elevate the \n     culture, and enrich humanity;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 729, S. Res. \n537.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 537) commemorating and acknowledging \n     the dedication and sacrifice made by the men and women who \n     have lost their lives while serving as law enforcement \n     officers.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate Judiciary Committee \nunanimously reported S. Res. 537 to the Senate floor. In recognition of \nthose officers who lost their lives in 2007, the full Senate has now \npassed this resolution. I thank Senators Specter, Kennedy, Durbin, \nKohl, Feinstein, Schumer, Hatch, Whitehouse, Biden, Cardin, and Baucus \nfor joining me in sponsoring this resolution. And I thank the full \nSenate for showing its strong support and appreciation of America's law \nenforcement officers by unanimously passing this resolution. It is \nsomething in which we can all take pride.\n  Last year, in 2007, 181 law enforcement officers died while serving \nin the line of duty. That is a regrettable and significant increase \nfrom just 1 year earlier. Tragically, it is the most line-of-duty \ndeaths since 2001 and the losses from September 11 of that year. The \nmagnitude of this loss should remove any doubts in Congress that it is \nnecessary to give these men and women everything they need to stay \nsafe, and to do their jobs as effectively as they can.\n  Currently, more than 900,000 men and women who guard our communities \ndo so at great risk. Since the first recorded police death in 1792, \nthere have been more than 18,200 law enforcement officers who have made \nthe ultimate sacrifice. There is lots of talk about the war on crime. \nOur law enforcement officers are all too often the casualties in that \neffort, and the officers who lost their lives in 2007 are a stark \nreminder that we must not let up in our support of those who work day-\nin and day-out in the service of their communities and fellow citizens.\n  I also take this opportunity to recognize that the names of 358 \nfallen officers will be added to the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial on May 13 during a candlelight vigil that will be held in \ntheir honor. These are officers from the past and present whose memory \nwill be preserved at the memorial, ensuring that their bravery and \nsacrifice will not be forgotten.\n  National Peace Officers Memorial Day provides the people of the \nUnited States, in their communities, in their State capitals, and in \nthe Nation's Capital, with the opportunity to honor and reflect on the \nextraordinary service and sacrifice given year after year by those \nmembers of our police forces. More than 20,000 peace officers are \nexpected to gather in Washington in the days leading up to May 15, to \njoin with the families of their fallen comrades. It is right that the \nSenate show its respect on this occasion, and I thank all Senators for \njoining me in honoring their service and their memory by approving this \nbipartisan resolution.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be\n\n[[Page S3985]]\n\nagreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate, and that any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 537) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 556, which was submitted \nearlier today by Senator Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 556) congratulating charter schools \n     and their students, parents, teachers, and administrators \n     across the United States for their ongoing contributions to \n     education, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am pleased today to rise in honor of \nNational Charter School week. The role of charter schools has become \nincreasingly important as these institutions have become one of the \nfastest-growing innovative forces in education policy. In the past 4 \nyears, 1,600 new charter schools opened and 500,000 additional public \nschool students chose to enroll in charter schools. In the fall of \n2007, 350 new public charter schools opened and an additional 115,000 \npublic school students enrolled in these schools. Nationwide in 40 \nStates and Washington, DC, over 4,300 public charter schools enroll \nmore than 1.2 million public school students.\n  As many of you know, I have been a longtime advocate of charter \nschools, which not only help to better educate students, but can also \nhelp to build stronger, more prosperous cities. As incubators of \ninnovation in education, public charter schools are an indispensable \ncomponent of our Nation's educational landscape.\n  Back home in New Orleans, in the aftermath of the catastrophic \ndevastation from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita came an opportunity to \nrecreate a public school system through bold innovation and community \ninvolvement. The educational entrepreneurship of public charter schools \nhas been integral to the city's recovery. They are inspiring positive \nchanges throughout the system, as other schools work to cultivate the \nsame benefits. Our hope is that all public schools in New Orleans will \nenjoy the same entrepreneurship, independence, and community \ninvolvement that the public charter schools have fostered.\n  Public charter schools were the first schools to open after the storm \nand they have since thrived. Today more than 57 percent of the city's \npublic school students attend public charter schools, and more than \nhalf of our public schools are independently chartered, the highest \npercentage in the country.\n  Moreover, public charter schools are gaining momentum and support \naround the Nation. The recently released 2008 Public Charter School \nDashboard included a national opinion poll that found that more than \nthree out of four voters favor giving parents more options when \nchoosing a public school for their children.\n  As we celebrate National Charter Schools Week with this resolution, \nit is my sincere hope that Congress will commit to supporting the \ngrowth of charter schools as critical tools for closing the achievement \ngap.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements relating to the resolution be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 556) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 556\n\n       Whereas charter schools deliver high-quality education and \n     challenge all students to reach their potential;\n       Whereas charter schools provide thousands of families with \n     diverse and innovative educational options for their \n     children;\n       Whereas charter schools are public schools authorized by a \n     designated public entity that are responding to the needs of \n     our communities, families, and students and promoting the \n     principles of quality, choice, and innovation;\n       Whereas, in exchange for the flexibility and autonomy given \n     to charter schools, they are held accountable by their \n     sponsors for improving student achievement and for their \n     financial and other operations;\n       Whereas 40 States and the District of Columbia have passed \n     laws authorizing charter schools;\n       Whereas more than 4,300 charter schools are now operating \n     in 40 States and the District of Columbia, serving more than \n     1,200,000 students;\n       Whereas, over the last 14 years, Congress has provided over \n     $2,237,256,000 in support to the charter school movement \n     through facilities financing assistance and grants for \n     planning, startup, implementation, and dissemination;\n       Whereas many charter schools improve their students' \n     achievement and stimulate improvement in traditional public \n     schools;\n       Whereas charter schools must meet the student achievement \n     accountability requirements under the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 in the same manner as \n     traditional public schools, and often set higher and \n     additional individual goals to ensure that they are of high \n     quality and truly accountable to the public;\n       Whereas charter schools give parents new freedom to choose \n     their public schools, routinely measure parental satisfaction \n     levels, and must prove their ongoing success to parents, \n     policymakers, and their communities;\n       Whereas over 50 percent of charter schools report having a \n     waiting list, and the total number of students on all such \n     waiting lists is enough to fill over 1,100 average-sized \n     charter schools;\n       Whereas charter schools nationwide serve a higher \n     percentage of low-income and minority students than the \n     traditional public school system;\n       Whereas charter schools have enjoyed broad bipartisan \n     support from the President, Congress, State Governors and \n     legislatures, educators, and parents across the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas the 9th annual National Charter Schools Week, to be \n     held May 5 through May 9, 2008, is an event sponsored by \n     charter schools and grassroots charter school organizations \n     across the United States to recognize the significant \n     impacts, achievements, and innovations of charter schools: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges and commends charter schools and their \n     students, parents, teachers, and administrators across the \n     United States for their ongoing contributions to education, \n     especially their impressive results closing America's \n     persistent achievement gap, and improving and strengthening \n     our public school system.\n       (2) supports the ideas and goals of the 9th annual National \n     Charter Schools Week; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to conduct \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities to \n     demonstrate support for charter schools during this week\n\n[[Page S3986]]\n\n     long celebration in communities throughout the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/08/senate-section/article/S3986-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         NOMINATION DISCHARGED\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.
