Under the previous order, the \nSenate shall resume consideration of the following measures en bloc, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 5) to amend the Public Health Service Act to \n     provide for human embryonic stem cell research.\n       A bill (S. 30) to intensify research to derive human \n     pluripotent stem cell lines.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there is \nnow 90 minutes of debate under the control of the Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Harkin, or his designee; 45 minutes under the control of the \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Coleman, and the Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nIsakson, and 45 minutes under the control of the Senator from Kansas, \nMr. Brownback.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, before I yield the floor to my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts, I just want to again bring people up to speed as to \nwhere we are in this debate. We will debate the two bills again today, \nS. 5 and S. 30, all day. We will have two votes later today at a time \nto be determined by the leaders but I think right prior to 6 p.m, the \nfirst vote occurring on S. 5, an up-or-down vote without amendments, \nand after that would be an up-or-down vote on S. 30, without \namendments.\n\n[[Page S4320]]\n\n  I intend to take some time this morning, after the Senator from \nMassachusetts speaks, again to outline the differences in the two \nbills, why S. 5 is a preferable bill and why that should be the bill we \npass and send to the President for his signature and to point out that \nS. 5 is truly the compromise bill.\n  I want everyone to know that. There was some talk that S. 30 should \nbe the compromise. Let me point out for clarity that last year we \npassed the stem cell research bill. There was another bill offered on \nthe floor at the same time called the Specter-Santorum bill. That bill \nwas supported by the Bush administration. Both bills passed, but the \nSpecter-Santorum bill never made it through the House, and therefore \nthe President was given the stem cell research bill. He vetoed it. He \nexercised the only veto of his administration to veto the stem cell \nbill.\n  In order to reach out a hand of compromise to the White House, we \nthen incorporated in our bill, S. 5, today, the Specter-Santorum bill \nof last year, which is part of S. 5. So it seems to me we have gone \nhalfway at least in reaching out to the White House to provide a \ncompromise situation. Now the White House says they want to compromise \nfurther. They want something else. You can keep this up until there is \nnothing left of the stem cell bill.\n  I wish to make it very clear that we have compromised. We have come \nhalfway. We incorporated the bill the President supported last year, so \nS. 5 really is the compromise measure we are sending to the President.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes or whatever time he requires to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I again thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Iowa, Senator Harkin, for his steadfast leadership in this \nextraordinarily important issue. We are full of hope this afternoon \nabout the votes here in the Senate. I welcome just a few moments to \nexpress my own views about where I think we are and what I think the \nissues really are before the Senate.\n  For years, many of us have fought the same battle, the battle to give \nthose suffering or injured every ethical option for new cures. For \nthose speaking on the Senate floor, perhaps little changes from one \nyear's debate to the next. We still speak of hope. We still speak of \ndreams denied when those hopes are dashed. We still speak of our belief \nthat medical research should be valued.\n  But for those who listen to our debate, a year can make all the \ndifference in the world. For a young man or woman bravely serving their \ncountry, a year can make the difference between vigorous active service \nand life in a wheelchair or a brain injury from a war wound. For \nsomeone fighting the long and lonely battle against Alzheimer's \ndisease, a year can make the memory of a beloved spouse or child a \nlittle fainter, a little more distant. For a patient battling against \nthe tremors of Parkinson's disease, a year can mean more and more life \nactivities fade out of reach.\n  If overturning the administration's unwarranted restrictions on stem \ncell research brings just one breakthrough, just one of the many that \nour best scientists believe are possible, that breakthrough can mean \nall the difference in the world for the patients who benefit. They \ncannot wait another year, or another day, for the help stem cell \nresearch can bring, and we should not wait in aiding them. We must take \naction here and now to end these unnecessary and harmful restrictions \non lifesaving research.\n  Continuing the administration's restrictions means the gap between \nwhat scientists could do and what they are allowed to do grows even \nwider.\n  Continuing the restrictions means our Nation's best scientists will \ngo on having to waste precious time on pointless redtape and \nbureaucratic obstacles, time that should be spent on the search for new \ncures.\n  Continuing the restrictions means having to tell the patients who are \ncounting on the promise of stem cell research: Wait just a little \nlonger, dream just a little less, hope just a little more faintly.\n  The Senate must act, just as the House has already, to unlock the \npotential of stem cell research.\n  When the Congress has approved this needed legislation, we must turn \nour attention to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and urge the President of the \nUnited States not to veto the legislation that gives so much hope to so \nmany.\n  Mr. President, just an extraordinary statement and comment from the \nNation's leading scientist, Dr. Zerhouni, who is the head of the \nNational Institutes of Health:\n\n       From my standpoint as NIH director, it is in the best \n     interest of our scientists, our science, and our country that \n     we find ways and the nation finds a way to allow the science \n     to go full speed across adult and embryonic stem cells \n     equally.\n\n  This is the statement of the head of the National Institutes of \nHealth, an extraordinary scientist and researcher himself. It couldn't \nbe said more clearly and more compellingly.\n  Finally, to remind ourselves what this really is all about--because \nit is basically about individuals--here are two extraordinary soldiers \nwho served in Iraq. James Crossby, Winthrop, MA, is now in a wheelchair \nbecause of a damaged spinal column--others could have similar \nsituations from their own States--and Sgt Jason Wittling, Marine Corps, \ninjured in Karbala, again with spinal cord injuries. And that is one of \nthe areas where there is such great hope.\n  Finally, one of the most moving letters I have received in the time I \nhave been in the Senate was on this issue, from Lauren Stanford, from \nPlymouth, MA--15 years old. She wrote just after watching the President \nof the United States speak on this issue when he set up the regime on \nwhich we have all commented, which limits the great possibilities we \nhave talked about during the course of this debate. This is what she \nsaid:\n\n       That night--\n\n  Referring to the night the President talked--\n\n     President Bush talked about protecting the innocent. I \n     wondered then: what about me? I am truly innocent in this \n     situation. I did nothing to bring my diabetes on; there is \n     nothing I can do to make it any better. All I can do is hope \n     for a research breakthrough and keep living the difficult, \n     demanding life of a child with diabetes until that \n     breakthrough comes. How, I asked my parents, is it more \n     important to throw discarded embryos into the trash than it \n     is to let them be used to hopefully save my life--and to give \n     me back a life where I don't have to accept a constant, \n     almost insane level of hourly medical intervention as \n     ``normal''? How could my nation do this to me?\n\n  That is the issue which Lauren Stanford has put before the Senate. \nHopefully she will get an overwhelming, bipartisan answer this \nafternoon when the roll is called.\n  I yield the remainder of my time..\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. How much time do we have remaining on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Eighty minutes.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Iowa for \nhis leadership. I know he and many others in this Chamber have spent a \ngreat deal of time putting together a piece of legislation that is very \nimportant. I commend all of them.\n  There are times on the floor of the Senate where we are engaged in \ncertain kinds of debates that cause folks to exhibit some temper and \nsome concern and anxiety and impatience. This is one of those issues, \nhowever, that people feel very differently about. We will have people \ncome to the floor on this issue of stem cell research who feel very \nstrongly on both sides.\n  I respect all of those views. I respect everyone who comes to this \nfloor with a position on this issue. But let me say, the position, as I \nsee it, is a position that deals with life and death. This is very \nimportant. We deal with some issues on the floor of the Senate that are \nnot so important, some that are very important. This ranks way up there \nin importance.\n  This is about life or death. It is about science, and it is about \ninquiry. It is about the search for unlocking the mysteries of what \ncauses some of the dreaded diseases here on Earth and how we find cures \nfor these dreaded diseases.\n  I chair a subcommittee that funds the science programs in our \ncountry,\n\n[[Page S4321]]\n\nespecially the science programs that have to do with, for example, \nenergy and other related matters. I think science is fascinating. In my \nsubcommittee, we had testimony a while ago about studying termites. We \nare studying the digestive system of termites because we are trying to \nunderstand why it is when a termite eats wood, the termite's digestive \nsystem produces hydrogen. How is it that a termite eats wood and \nproduces hydrogen? Again, what an interesting scientific inquiry.\n  Well, we are engaged in scientific research in a whole range of \nissues. Especially important are the areas of scientific inquiry in \nthis area of health. What is it that causes these terrible diseases? \nWhat kinds of approaches might give us a chance to cure some of these \ndreaded diseases?\n  Well, one of those issues is the issue of stem cell research. The \nlanguage almost sounds like a foreign language in some of these \ndiscussions: somatic cell nuclear transfer, in vitro fertilization \nclinic, stem cell research. Those are not terms people use every day in \ntheir discussions, and yet the method of using those terms in this \ndiscussion is about life or death. It is about continuing scientific \ninquiry to try to unlock the mysteries of some of the most terrible \ndiseases suffered by mankind.\n  We passed a piece of legislation last July that moved in this \ndirection, and the President decided to veto it. Legislation that we \nhoped would perhaps give us an opportunity for treatment for things \nsuch as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS, \nAlzheimer's, birth defects, and spinal cord injuries.\n  We do not know, we cannot come to the floor of the Senate, we are not \nscientists to describe: Here is exactly what will happen as a result of \nthis scientific inquiry. But we do know there are at least indications \nof great hope through this scientific inquiry. So the Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act, S. 5, which we now have on the floor of the \nSenate, would allow researchers to pursue all kinds of promising stem \ncell research, including embryonic stem cell research that is federally \nfunded.\n  This legislation is controversial. The legislation deals, however, \nonly with embryos that were created for fertility purposes in in vitro \nfertilization clinics that would otherwise be thrown away.\n  Now, in vitro is a relatively new term. It has been around for about \n25 years. There are more than 1 million children walking this planet of \nours who were born as a result of in vitro fertilization. We had \ntestimony before one of my committees, the Commerce Committee, in which \na witness said: None of them should have been born. None of these human \nbeings are worthy. They should not have been born. He disagrees with in \nvitro fertilization. It is his right to do that. I do not support that.\n  I think the wonder of life of having 1 million people, 1 million \npeople who once were babies born to people, to couples who were not \nable to have children, is a wonderful gift. What a wonderful gift.\n  In vitro has been around for a quarter of a century. Because of the \nnature of the treatment, the infertility treatment in this process, \nmore embryos are created than will ever be used. Rather than throwing \nthese embryos in the waste, as hospital waste, or just waste from an in \nvitro clinic, it is much more life affirming, I think, to use them to \nbetter understand how we might treat devastating diseases such as \ndiabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, and more.\n  I think Senator Jack Danforth, former Senator Jack Danforth, said it \nbest. He is a colleague who served here with us in the Senate. He said \nthis: It is not evident to many of us that cells in a petri dish are \nequivalent to identifiable people suffering from terrible diseases. I \nam and have always been pro-life. But the only explanation for \nlegislators comparing cells in a petri dish to babies in the womb is \nthe extension of religious doctrine into statutory law.\n  That is from former Senator Jack Danforth. What a profound statement. \nDo you equate the cells in a petri dish with someone suffering the \nravages of Parkinson's disease or ALS? I do not think so. But that \nsuggests somehow that those who oppose this legislation make that \nequation.\n  This legislation is not suggesting that anyone create an embryo for \nthe purpose of research. It is saying those embryos that are about to \nbe discarded, thrown away, thousands of them, because many more are \nproduced than are to be used in in vitro clinics, rather than simply \nthrowing them away, how about--with the consent of those from whom the \nembryos came--how about using them for a life-affirming purpose, for \nthe needed research into unlocking the mysteries of these devastating \ndiseases?\n  There are about 400,000 embryos frozen in these clinics. It is \nestimated 8,000 to 11,000 are scheduled to be discarded. It is \ninteresting to me that no one has come to the floor of the Senate--that \nI am aware of--saying: Shut down these in vitro clinics. Shut them \ndown. And, by the way, if someone tries to throw away an embryo, as \nthey do every day, if they try to throw one away, have someone arrest \nthem because you are throwing away a human being. It is, of course, not \na human being. It has the potential to become a human being if it is \nimplanted in a woman's uterus and grown to term. But it will not be \nimplanted in a uterus. In fact, it will be discarded in a wastebasket.\n  The question my colleagues asks with S. 5 is: With consent, should \nthat embryo, rather than simply be discarded, not be able to be used \nfor this critically important research?\n\n  There are not enough stem cell lines available. We know that. My \ncolleagues have made that case. The President authorized some stem cell \nlines, but the authorized lines were never enough, and, in fact, they \nwere contaminated, and it is just a plain fact that we are, at this \npoint, interrupting the scientific inquiry. We are interrupting the \nopportunity to search for a cure for these diseases.\n  The embryos we are discussing on the floor of the Senate are going to \nbe destroyed. That is certain. These embryos are going to be destroyed. \nCould they, should they be used to search for the cure for these dread \ndiseases? I believe the answer is yes.\n  In my last campaign for the Senate, a curious commercial was run \nagainst me by my opponent. He ran a commercial which is a description \nof some who feel very strongly in opposition to this kind of \nlegislation. Because I support stem cell research very strongly, my \nopponent ran a commercial of a man sitting around the fire, a kind of a \ncampfire with about six or eight young children around him.\n  The commercial, I suppose, was meant to be humorous but about a \nserious subject. A young child, with eyes very big reflected in the \nglow of the fire, around that fireplace, said to the camp leader: Tell \nus a story. Tell us a scary story.\n  The man said: Well, there is a man named Byron--referring to me, I \nguess--a man named Byron. He has a plan. His plan is to implant into a \nmommy's uterus an egg that is fertilized, to become a fetus, so that \nthey can harvest it during that pregnancy to use it for body parts \nlater.\n  Little children around that campfire had eyes the size of dinner \nplates, from that scary story. Of course, that was a complete \nperversion of anything that remotely related to the truth, had no \nrelationship to any of these issues.\n  No one is talking about implanting something in a uterus for the \npurpose of growing a fetus, for the purpose of harvesting body parts. \nThat kind of unbelievable lie permeates all too often this discussion. \nThat is not what this discussion is about.\n  Those of us in this Chamber--and there are many of us who have sat in \nthe front row of a funeral--in my case of a daughter--and asked \nourselves: Was there anything, was there anything more we could have \ndone?\n  Is there anything that could have been done to prevent this disease? \nThe answer, if we prevent this kind of research, the answer for \neveryone will be, yes, there is something we could have done. We could \nhave continued the scientific inquiry and research, with carefully \nconstructed guidelines, to see if we could unlock the mysteries of \nthese diseases.\n  Let me show a picture of a young girl named Camille. In fact, I just \nsaw Camille last month. This young girl has been very near death. She \nsuffers from juvenile diabetes, the particularly acute condition of \njuvenile diabetes. That is Camille in the middle. I saw her mother last \nweek in North Dakota. Camille was in Washington, DC, about\n\n[[Page S4322]]\n\na month ago with her mother. I have known Camille for a long time, this \nyoung girl holding the clarinet in her middle school band. She has had \na tough life and has lived on the edge, suffering a very significant \ndisease, one that has cost too many, too many Americans, and especially \ntoo many young Americans, their lives.\n  But there are so many opportunities for research and for potential \ntreatment. Let me give you a couple of examples. I was on an airplane \none day with one of the researchers at NIH. The researchers at NIH do \nunbelievable work. He told me of the use of stem cells among a group of \nmice that had induced heart attacks, severe, debilitating heart \nattacks. They used stem cells to inject back into the heart muscle of \nthose mice, and in a matter of a couple of weeks, a substantial \npercentage of those mice showed no evidence of having had a heart \nattack. A substantial portion had complete recovery.\n  Let me give you a couple of other examples. Researchers at Johns \nHopkins report paralyzed rats have partially regained the use of \npreviously immobile hind legs in studies in which scientists injected \nthe rodents with stem cells from mice embryos.\n  As to potential to treat ALS, University of Wisconsin-Madison \nscientists have turned stem cells into nerve cells carrying messages \nbetween the body to the brain, offering possibilities for repairing \ndamage caused by ALS.\n  Embryonic stem cell researchers at UCLA, AIDS Institute, were able to \ncoax human embryonic stem cells into becoming mature immune T cells. I \nam not a scientist. All I can tell you is this: When we look, when we \nsearch, when we inquire, when we use America's best minds and research \nusing good ethical guidelines, important guidelines, valuable \nguidelines, for scientific inquiry, we then find ways to unlock these \nmysteries. It is pretty unbelievable what we have done in a relatively \nshort period of time.\n  We have a polio vaccine. We have cured smallpox. If you go to the \nhospital these days and take a look at the wondrous machines and the \nwonderful treatments and all of the things that we are doing, all of \nthat is a matter of experimentation and developing experience from that \nexperimentation.\n  The fact is, embryonic stem cell research has very broad and very \nstrong bipartisan support. That bipartisan support is evident in the \nSenate. We have had Senators on both sides of the political aisle stand \nup in strong support of this legislation.\n  Now, let me use a chart that my colleague, Senator Kennedy, just used \nbecause I believe it is so important.\n  Dr. Zerhouni, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, \nsays--this is President Bush's own NIH Director: From my standpoint, it \nis clear today that American science will be better served, and the \nNation will be better served, if we let our scientists have access to \nmore stem cell lines.\n  That is from the President's own appointee to head the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  I know in political life, there are a lot of labels, pro-life, pro-\nchoice, pro-this, pro-that, anti-that. Let me observe, it is not, as \nsome have suggested, a pro-life position to diminish or shut off \ncritically needed research that will give people who have Parkinson's \ndisease, diabetes, Lou Gehrig's disease, cardiovascular disease, \ncancer, any number of the things that kill so many Americans, it is not \npro-life to diminish, restrict, or shut down research that gives people \nan opportunity for hope that there might be a cure for these diseases \nthrough this scientific inquiry and research. I recognize this is \ncontroversial. I respect someone who comes to the floor and says: \nSenator Dorgan, you are wrong about this. I respect that. This is not \nan easy issue. It is difficult for a lot of Members. I have not found \nit particularly difficult for me, because I believe those of us who \nhave seen the ravages--and that should be most everybody in this \nChamber--of these diseases to our loved ones, to friends, to so many \nAmericans, this country would want us to do everything possible to give \nthe tools to the best scientific minds and the best people in the \nmedical field possible to unlock the mysteries of these diseases and \nfind the cures. That is what this debate has been long about.\n  This debate, however, is even narrower than many we have had on this \nsubject. This is about a single issue--can we use embryos that are \notherwise going to be discarded from in vitro fertilization clinics, \nthat are otherwise simply going to become waste and destroyed, today, \ntomorrow, next week, next month, all year long, can we use, with the \npermission of the donors, those embryos for the scientific inquiry \nnecessary for the extension of life and the curing of these dread \ndiseases? Can we do that? The answer clearly ought to be yes, a loud, \nresounding yes coming from this Chamber.\n  My colleague Senator Harkin has been at this a long time. I have \nspoken on this a good number of times on the floor of the Senate \nmyself. But it is not only Senator Harkin; he is joined in a piece of \nlegislation on a bipartisan basis by some very significant voices in \nthe Senate, saying: Let's do this. Let's do this for this country. All \nof those who are suffering from these dread diseases deserve our help. \nThey certainly don't deserve a Government that says: By the way, we \nunderstand your suffering, but we would prefer to choose to destroy and \ndiscard embryos from an in vitro fertilization clinic rather than \nextend the scientific research that might find a cure for what is \nkilling you. That is not an acceptable answer from this Senate.\n  I thank Senator Harkin for the time. I thank the many colleagues who \nhave spoken in favor of this legislation and offer the fervent hope--\nand I believe it exists--that we can pass this legislation with a very \nsubstantial margin within the next 24 hours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for \na very eloquent statement about what this is all about. I thank him for \nthat. I thank him for his strong support of S. 5, our legislation to \nbasically do what he encapsulated by saying this is about saving lives. \nThat is what it is all about.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the previous order be modified to \nprovide that the vote on passage of S. 5 occur at 5:55 p.m., that the \nRepublican leader be recognized at 5:25 p.m., with the other provisions \nremaining in order; provided further, that the additional 10 minutes be \nequally divided between Senators Harkin and Coleman, Isakson, and \nSenator Brownback, or their designees.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Coleman, who has worked countless hours on \nthis very important subject.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, as I listened to my distinguished \ncolleague from North Dakota, there is so much we agree on. What we \nagree on is we want to move science forward. We want to provide hope to \nthose who are suffering from diseases and conditions with the \npossibility of stem cell research. The issue is a matter of Federal \nfunding. What do we put Federal dollars into? Should there be any moral \nquestions that are raised before we make that decision to put Federal \ndollars into something? That is a legitimate issue to discuss in the \nSenate. It is a reflection of the reality that in this country there is \nsubstantial disagreement about what is appropriate use of Federal \ndollars. This is not about shutting off research. It is not about \nstopping research. It is not about a lack of research going on. We \nstill lead the world in embryonic stem cell research. With forty \npercent of all the publications that are offered in this country, 85 \npercent of the dollars from what we have provided, both embryonic and \nadult stem cell research, we are leading the world. That includes both \nFederal dollars and substantial private dollars.\n  When this issue arose early on, President Clinton had his own \nbioethics commission. They concluded the derivation of stem cells from \nembryos remaining following infertility treatments is justifiable only \nif no less morally problematic alternatives are available for advancing \nthe research.\n  The reality is, we have reached a point where there are available \nalternatives, and we have an opportunity to\n\n[[Page S4323]]\n\npursue them. There is a political reality as well; that is, that S. 5 \nwill pass. The President has said he is going to veto it because of his \nconcern on Federal funding for the destruction of human embryos. As a \nresult, from January 1 of this year, there is going to be no more \nresearch going into embryonic stem cell research tomorrow than there is \ntoday, unless we pass S. 30.\n\n  S. 5 is going to be vetoed. If you care about making more than a \npolitical statement but actually talking to the parents of kids with \njuvenile diabetes or adults with Parkinson's, whatever, the reality is, \nif you care about more than $132 million going into human embryonic \nstem cell research, you have to support S. 30. That is the political \nreality.\n  What S. 30 offers, in addition, is the opportunity to have a greater \nsense of national unity on this issue, to get beyond the culture wars, \nto get beyond the political division. That is what the research should \nbe about.\n  Senator Isakson has talked about dead embryo research. I hope the \ndescription was clear enough. There was some confusion from some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of this issue. Let me explain a little \nbiology 101. The issue here is, can we produce pluripotent cells--\nembryonic cells are pluripotent--the capacity for the cell to give rise \nto many other different types of cells. There are adult stem cells out \nof bone marrow, out of blood type. Now we are looking at placental and \nembryonic. But there appears to be, and science will tell you, the \nability of embryonic pluripotent cells.\n  The difference here is between pluripotent and totipotent, the \nability to form an embryo, the beginning of life. Senator Isakson has \ntalked about dead embryo research where the embryos have the ability to \nform pluripotent cells, those cells that have the capacity to \ndifferentiate into other types of cells. That is an opportunity without \ncrossing a moral line. All of America can come together and say: This \nis a good thing, putting money into stem cell research and not dividing \nthe Nation.\n  There is the process called alternate nuclear transfer. This is a \nprocess that if you look at natural fertilization, you get the sperm \nand the fertilized egg. You get an embryo. Under SCNT--that is the way \nDolly the sheep was produced, a type of cloning--you get the egg cell. \nYou take some adult genetic material with all the DNA, and you put that \nin an enucleated egg where the center is cut out. You get that \nfertilized egg and, boom, you get an embryo. Science is telling us \ntoday that you can, with all the natural nuclear transfer, with a range \nof things, what you can do is, you can take that egg, you can enucleate \nit, cut out the center, put in adult material. But before you transfer \nit, you turn off a little code. In the end, you don't get an embryo but \nyou get this intercell mass then that has the capacity of pluripotency, \nnot an embryo but the ability to differentiate cell types and all of \nthe elasticity and the hope and possibility you get from embryonic stem \ncell research without crossing a moral line.\n  Is that what we should be doing? This is not shutting off science. \nSome have said this is a diversion. Certainly it is not a diversion in \nthe practical sense, because right now there will be, if S. 5 passes, \nno additional funding for embryonic stem cell research. But if S. 30 \npasses, we can open the world to these possibilities and additional \nFederal dollars. The reality is, with S. 5 there are questions that are \nunanswered. I was just talking about those lines that are in vitro \nfertilization that some say could be thrown away. What is to stop \npeople from simply producing more, knowing the research money is going \nto be there? The reality is, those cells that are in those IVF clinics \nhave limited genetic lines. If you are of a certain minority or other \ngroups, you are not as represented in those as you are in the \npopulation. But if we look at things such as alternate nuclear \ntransfer, you can have an unending supply of genetic material so you \ncan deal with specific gene types and deal with specific illnesses.\n  S. 30 also includes a provision to set up a stem cell bank for \namniotic and placental stem cells, the idea that we could have 100,000 \ntissue samples and, by virtue of that, cover all the genetic types \nthere are, which you do not get with what we have now under S. 5.\n  The bottom line in all of this is, there is a debate in this country, \nbut it is not over moving the science forward. The debate is not over \nwhether there should be hope. There is hope. It is important to \nunderstand some of the realities, the reality of what we are talking \nabout today. Yesterday one of my colleagues, the Senator from Iowa, was \ntalking about some of the work being done with dead embryos, perhaps \nsome of the work being done with alternate nuclear transfer, and saying \nthis could take a decade. The reality is the work being done today in \nembryonic stem cell research at best may take decades. So the question \nthen ultimately is, can we as a nation decide on a process that does \nrespect a moral line, that does say: We are not going to provide \nFederal funding for the destruction of a human embryo, but because we \nhave the possibility, we should explore the possibility of doing \nresearch that provides for pluripotency without totipotency, without \nthe creation of an embryo.\n  We are going to have more difficult questions as we move forward. As \nwe look at the issue of stem cell research, one of the realities we are \nlooking at is, if they haven't developed enough, what about the idea of \ndeveloping limbs and other things. Should we let the embryo grow \nlonger? Where do you draw that line? There is a whole range of other \nissues we are going to have to be debating as we kind of move along \nthis process with the great advances of scientists. For those of us who \nsupport S. 30, what we are saying is we have a path, we have an \nopportunity to do it with a sense of unity, with a sense of where we \nprovide a moral line, a line, by the way, that has been part of our \nstatutes for a long time. We don't provide Federal funding for the \ndestruction of human embryos. That is what this is about. It is not \nabout size. The reality about size is that you could fit some of these \non the head of a pin. But it is about that basic moral line which has \nbeen part of our law for a long time.\n\n  So this approach we have in S. 5 is an approach that is pro-science \nand pro-research and pro-hope. It is the only practical one that in the \nend, if it passes, will result in more funding for embryonic stem cell \nresearch tomorrow than we have today.\n  My fear is what happened last year will happen this year. This body \npassed both a version of S. 5 as well as a version that provided for \nsome alternatives. It was the Specter-Santorum bill. S. 30 provides for \nmore than that bill. It will provide for, in fact, new dollars going to \nresearch that isn't funded today.\n  What the House chose to say is it is all or nothing. If you don't \npass the S. 5 version, the Castle bill, then we are not going to even \nput in any funding. We are not going to do anything. We are not going \nto allow any alternatives to be pursued. That would be a shame. As I \nused to tell our kids, it is akin to cutting off your nose to spite \nyour face. That would be a shame.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--wherever they stand \non this issue they can be comfortable supporting S. 30; they can be \ncomfortable supporting a bill that provides for the moral line but at \nthe same time opens up the opportunity for additional research. I urge \nits support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes. I wish to \ncommend Senator Coleman and Senator Dorgan for the two speeches that \nhave preceded my remarks because both of them eloquently expressed what \nis, in fact, the case; that is, that everybody in this Chamber, \nincluding the distinguished Senator from Iowa and myself, wants more \nhope for Americans who suffer. Both bills offer a path to do that. We \nmay have our differences on those paths but no difference in the hope \nthat it offers. I commend Senator Coleman for his very articulate \nexplanation of that.\n  I join with the Senator from Iowa, I think, in encouraging our \ncolleagues who may be listening, we have some time this morning that \ncan be filled. If we have Members who want to come to the floor and \nspeak, they should contact the cloakroom and let us know, from both \nparties and from both sides of every issue, because we want to fill \nevery minute.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S4324]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I concur with my friend from Georgia in \nthat if people want to speak, they should come over now. We have a list \nof speakers, and I think Senator Isakson does, too, for later on in the \nday. I can only say to Senators, as the clock ticks, your time is going \nto get squeezed more and more. So that if you are scheduled to speak \nfor, say, 10 minutes this afternoon, you may get squeezed to 3 minutes \nor 2 minutes or 1 minute. So if you would like to have your say about \nthis embryonic stem cell bill, I would say now would be the time to \ncome over. I say to all the Senators who may be in their offices right \nnow, call the cloakrooms, and we will make the time available right \nnow.\n  Mr. President, what is the situation, might I ask, right now with the \ntime existing?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa has 58 \nminutes, the Senator from Georgia has 33 minutes, and the Senator from \nKansas has 45 minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. It is my understanding, if the Senator from Iowa will \nyield, that the Senator from Kansas is in the cloakroom and about to \ntake a significant portion of that. That is my understanding. That \nwould be a significant portion of his time, not yours and mine.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the debate, \nand a good one, we are having on a very important topic. The \ndifferences in this debate remind me, though, of a proverb that says \nthere is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of \ndeath. Unfortunately, if we research on young human life, it puts that \nyoung human life to death and at the same time does not produce the \nresults for cures that we had hoped would be taking place.\n  I respect my colleagues who are on another side of this issue who \nfeel as though we should research on young human life. I do not feel \nthat is right or ethical. I will discuss that aspect here today with \nsome of the time I have, and I also wish to discuss the exciting \nbreaking developments that are taking place even today on the adult \nstem cell area that continues to produce treatments for humans.\n  I ask unanimous consent to enter into the Record after my statement \nan article from the Chicago Tribune online edition.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. It is dated today. It is about the latest diabetes \ntreatments that have been taking place. A report came out from \nNorthwestern University in the Chicago area about a new diabetes \ntreatment developed at Northwestern University which has allowed some \npatients to stop taking insulin for more than 2 years. They have raised \nquestions about this process. It was done in Brazil rather than in the \nUnited States. Thirteen of the fifteen patients in this adult stem cell \nstudy went off insulin for at least 6 months, as they note, prompting \ncautious excitement from some researchers who have seen the results. \nDr. Gordon C. Weir, a diabetes researcher and head of a transplantation \nprogram at Harvard's Medical School, Joslin Diabetes Center, said this:\n\n       Their results look better than anything I have seen so far.\n\n  What an exciting development in the adult stem cell research area and \nfield.\n  Questions have been raised about this trial and some of it taking \nplace in Brazil. I have raised questions such as why is it we are \nseeing these breakthroughs taking place and we are having patients from \nthe United States go to Bangkok, go to Portugal, and these treatments \nare being developed in Brazil rather than in the United States. I \nbelieve if we would put our funding here that we are using in the \nembryonic field, the $613 million that has produced no human treatments \nto date but has produced a lot of tumors in live animals, if we would \nput that in the adult field where we are getting results--we have \ninvested in the adult field, but what if that $613 million were in the \nadult field today? Would these breakthroughs be happening here instead \nof Brazil, or by U.S. researchers in Brazil? Why aren't they being done \nin the United States? I hope my colleagues will look at that issue.\n  There is another point I wish to raise with my colleagues at this \npoint in time. Let's presume they are successful in embryonic stem cell \nresearch. Let's presume, in a decade or 20 years, they are successful \nwith embryonic stem cell research. That is going to lead to the \nnecessity of us moving forward with human cloning because in the \ndevelopment of this technology, embryonic stem cell technology, if you \nare using an embryo and the genetic material doesn't match up, there is \ngoing to be rejection by my body or by some body. That is going to \nhappen. That is going to take place. So we are going to have to move \ninto human cloning. We are going to have to harvest women's eggs, \ndevelop human clones to develop the correct type of embryonic stem \ncells to use in an individual so that there will be a genetic match. I \nthink we ought to talk about that, if we continue in the progression we \nare on.\n  I acknowledge that human cloning is not specifically addressed in S. \n5, the embryonic stem cell bill. However, if embryonic stem cells can \never overcome their tumor-forming tendency--and that is a huge if--and \nthey are used in humans, human cloning will be used in order to avoid \nimmune rejection problems. Therefore, as is hopefully evident, the \nissue of human cloning needs to be raised.\n  To this end, I recently introduced the bipartisan Brownback-Landrieu \nHuman Cloning Prohibition Act, which we introduced before the break \nwith 26 other Senators who are cosponsoring this legislation.\n  This legislation would reaffirm that the United States places \ntremendous value on the dignity of each and every human person: from \nthe young human embryo to vulnerable women who would be coerced into \ndonating their eggs, at potentially great risk to their health. The \nlegislation would make clear that the cloning of human persons is not \nsomething we as a society will accept.\n  The Brownback-Landrieu Human Cloning Prohibition Act has been \nendorsed by the President of the United States. It will bring the \nUnited States into conformity with the United Nations, whose General \nAssembly called on all member states ``to prohibit all forms of human \ncloning.'' It did not say we can do therapeutic but not reproductive. \nIt said ``all forms of human cloning'' by a strong 84-to-34 margin vote \nin the U.N.\n  The problem with cloning human beings is that it violates human \ndignity on all sorts of levels. Cloning transgresses our heritage's \nmost sacred values about what is good and true and beautiful. Western \ncivilization indeed is built on the tenet that every human life has a \nmeasurable value. Human beings are ends in themselves. It is wrong to \nuse any person as a means to an end. Upon this principle our laws are \nfounded, and without it, laws have little basis. Human cloning--for \nwhatever purpose--is wrong because it turns humans into commodities or \nspare parts.\n  In recent debate, human cloning has been referred to as ``therapeutic \ncloning,'' ``research cloning'' or simply SCNT. These are presented as \ncontrasts to ``reproductive cloning.'' It should be noted that \n``therapeutic,'' ``research,'' and ``reproductive'' are merely \nadjectives to describe what is done with the cloned human. SCNT, or \nsomatic cell nuclear transfer, is the scientific description of the \ncloning process.\n  A CRS report for Congress notes:\n\n       A human embryo produced via cloning involves the process \n     called somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). In SCNT, the \n     nucleus of an egg is removed and replaced by the nucleus from \n     a mature body cell, such as a skin cell. In cloning, the \n     embryo is created without sexual reproduction: There is no \n     joining of egg and sperm.\n\n  Stem cell pioneer James Thomson has said:\n\n       If you create an embryo by SCNT cloning and you give it to \n     somebody who didn't know where it came from, there would be \n     no test you would do on that embryo to say where it came \n     from. It is what it is. If you try to define it away, you are \n     being disingenuous.\n\n  With ``reproductive'' and ``therapeutic'' cloning, human beings are \nturned into commodities or spare parts to be dissected in the \nlaboratory, with the claim that someday they may be\n\n[[Page S4325]]\n\nadministered to other humans to provide a treatment. Treatments are \ncertainly praiseworthy but not at the expense of the destruction of \nother members of the human family. We all want to treat people as \npeople, and people should be treated as people. I want to find a cure \nfor cancer. However, it is wrong to turn humans into a means to an end.\n  It is also wrong to exploit women for their eggs. Here I want to \ndevelop this thought about what will take place if human embryonic stem \ncell research is developed, is successful. We have to develop clones \nthat meet the genetic type of the individual seeking the treatment. You \nare going to have to get eggs from somewhere and you are going to have \nto get these from people--from women. Also, it is wrong to exploit \nwomen for their eggs, and that is the other side of the human cloning \nstory. SCNT cloning, as proposed by proponents of the technique, would \nrequire millions of human eggs. In all likelihood, poor and \ndisadvantaged women would be particularly vulnerable to exploitation \nvia financial incentives for donation. This is troubling because \nretrieving such eggs violates the dignity of a woman and may cause \nserious harm to her health.\n  The Brownback-Landrieu Human Cloning Prohibition Act is the only \neffective ban on human cloning. Any other ban is one that is allowing \ntherapeutic cloning and even encouraging it but certainly not banning \nhuman cloning. Others would regulate what could be done with the human \nclones, normally requiring its destruction, but they do nothing to \nprevent the process of human cloning, which violates human dignity on \nmany levels. We should take a stand against turning young human beings \ninto commodities. We should not destroy human life for research \npurposes.\n  I will not be voting for cloning today, and I will continue to look \nfor an opportunity to bring this legislation forward as an amendment to \nother bills. Again, I point out to my colleagues that is the route we \nare on with this--to promote human cloning so there will be genetic \nmatches in the human embryonic stem cell procedures. I do not believe \nthat is the path we should follow.\n  I want to address some of the thoughts several colleagues have \nbrought up about what it is we are doing. Human embryos are being \ndestroyed for research purposes and for stem cells. Some have referred \nto this as ``potential life,'' which strikes me as a bit like the \ndebate we had on the issue of slavery, where we deemed a person three-\nfifths of a person at one point in time. That is a complete legal \nfiction. You are either a person or you are not. You are either life or \nyou are not life. It is not potential life. Nowhere in the scientific \nliterature is there a description of potential life. The embryo is a \nspecies at that stage of development in the life cycle. That is the \nscientific definition and information--the embryo is a species at that \nstage of development in the life cycle. We all have a life cycle. The \nembryo is the species at that stage. That is common sense. The embryo \nstage is a development stage, but it remains human life, not potential \nhuman life. It is alive and it is a life.\n  The embryo would continue along the life cycle continuum if we were \nnot interfering in its normal development by keeping it in a freezer \nand destroying it for experiments. I think it is important that we not \nengage in wishful thinking or trying to define this away. A human \nembryo is a human life. We should not say it is a potential life. That \nis not a definition for what human life is. I noted in the debate \nearlier--I want to make this point at this time--that it appears as if \nat the current research rate it would take 100 or more human eggs per \ncloned embryo--100 you are going to have to harvest from young women to \nget this process to move forward with human cloning.\n  Mr. President, I will reserve the remainder of my time at this point. \nI yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Apr. 11, 2007]\n\n                      Hope, Risk in Diabetes Trial\n\n                           (By Jeremy Manier)\n\n       A new diabetes treatment developed at Northwestern \n     University has allowed some patients to stop taking insulin \n     for more than two years, but it also has spurred ethical \n     objections from researchers who say the trial put Brazilian \n     children at unnecessary risk.\n       Thirteen of the 15 patients in a stem-cell study went off \n     insulin for at least six months, prompting cautious \n     excitement from some researchers who have seen the results, \n     to be published Wednesday in the Journal of the American \n     Medical Association. All of the patients had the less common \n     form of diabetes called early-onset, or Type 1 diabetes, \n     which normally requires close blood-glucose monitoring and \n     long-term use of insulin injections.\n       The new approach, designed by Dr. Richard Burt of \n     Northwestern, enlists a patient's own stem cells in an effort \n     to halt the immune system's destruction of insulin-producing \n     ``beta'' cells in the pancreas--the root cause of Type 1 \n     diabetes.\n       Burt drafted the protocol, and doctors at the University of \n     Sao Paulo in Brazil carried it out. The patients, some as \n     young as 14, got intense drug treatment that wiped out their \n     immune systems. They then received injections of their own \n     blood stem cells in hopes of renewing the immune system \n     without the trait that makes it target beta cells.\n       ``Their results look better than anything I've seen so \n     far,'' said Dr. Gordon C. Weir, a diabetes researcher and \n     head of a transplantation program at Harvard Medical School's \n     Joslin Diabetes Center.\n       Though small in scale, the study is significant as the \n     first attempt to treat diabetes using a ``cell-based'' \n     therapy, researchers said. Such treatments may become more \n     common as scientists look beyond insulin and try approaches \n     using adult stem cells or embryonic stem cells, which could \n     directly replace the tissue damaged in diabetes. Type 1 \n     diabetes accounts for 5 to 10 percent of the 21 million \n     diabetes cases in the U.S.; the rest suffer from Type 2 \n     diabetes, which is linked with obesity.\n       ``These are promising results that suggest we should go \n     further,'' said Burt, a specialist in immunesuppression \n     therapy.\n       Yet some experts doubted the protocol could have been \n     approved in this country. Weir, like several other scientists \n     reached for this report, said the risks of Burt's technique \n     are high enough that he probably would not have approved the \n     experiment if he had been responsible for reviewing it.\n       The problem is this: Although early-onset diabetes can have \n     dire long-term effects such as blindness and heart disease, \n     many patients succeed in managing their condition with \n     insulin and lead normal lives for decades. That makes it \n     harder to justify the risks of stem cell transplantation, \n     which Burt has used before on diseases with few other \n     treatment options, such as lupus or multiple sclerosis.\n       The immune suppression used in stem-cell transplants can \n     cause infections and even death. None of the patients in the \n     Brazilian study died, though one had severe pneumonia that \n     required supplementary oxygen.\n       Several experts said the risks could have made it difficult \n     to get the study past American institutional review boards--\n     groups responsible for ensuring that research is safe and \n     ethical.\n       ``This is an incredibly invasive therapy to be tried on \n     children without knowing if anyone will benefit from it,'' \n     said Dr. Lainie Ross, associate director of the University of \n     Chicago's MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics.\n       Ross said she would not have authorized such a study unless \n     it enrolled only adults. She said research ethics guidelines \n     state that risky experimental therapies should not be used on \n     children unless it's impossible to test them on adult \n     subjects--and in this case, adult diabetes patients were \n     available.\n       In fact, Burt said his original protocol included a cutoff \n     age of 18, but a Brazilian review board changed it to allow \n     younger patients in the study. Ages of the subjects ranged \n     from 14 to 31, with eight participants younger than 18.\n       Burt said the study was done in Brazil not to avoid the \n     need for an American review board, but because he couldn't \n     find an American diabetes expert interested in pursuing his \n     idea. He said Northwestern review board officials told him \n     his collaboration with the Brazilian team was fine so long as \n     he was not directly involved in patient care. The Juvenile \n     Diabetes Research Foundation cautiously embraced the \n     technique while pointing out the need for further study. A \n     statement from the group said that in the trial, ``the immune \n     system was apparently reset or retrained, and after the \n     procedure, the symptoms of diabetes were reversed.''\n       But the statement also noted that because of the risks, \n     ``it is not clear whether this trial would be approved in the \n     U.S.''\n       One weakness of the study was its lack of a control group, \n     said Dr. Mark Anderson of the University of California at San \n     Francisco's Diabetes Center. Without that, it's impossible to \n     quantify how much improvement the therapy offered. One \n     scientist interested in taking the next step is Dr. Jay \n     Skyler of the University of Miami, who wrote an accompanying \n     editorial in JAMA.\n       ``I don't think [this study] would have gotten approval at \n     our institution out of the box.'' Skyler said. ``But now that \n     it's worked I would be championing it. I want to be one of \n     the sites that's doing it.''\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4326]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and the distinguished \nmanager. I thank him also for his leadership on this issue, which has \nbeen long and steady.\n  Last summer, I had the privilege of coming to the floor to speak on \nthis issue, accompanied by a summer intern from my office, a college \nstudent from Massachusetts named Beth Colby. Beth was paralyzed from \nthe chest down in a car accident when she was 14 years old. She came to \nWashington, like so many women, and so many young folks, period, to \nlearn about Government. She also came here with a determination to try \nto fight for the scientific research that holds untold promise for her \nand for tens of millions of Americans. She wanted to be, as she put it \nto me in asking to come to the floor during the debate on stem cell \nresearch, a face Senators can see so they can see what they are voting \nfor.\n  The truth is there are people like that in every single community in \nour country. They are all hoping to benefit one day from lifesaving \nstem cell therapy. Grandparents with Parkinson's disease have that \nhope. Soldiers coming back from Iraq who are crippled by a roadside \nbomb have that hope. Children who, decades from now, will suffer from a \ndisease we are not aware of yet, or that we know well, hope stem cell \nresearch might be able to cure them.\n  Since we first heard about stem cell research several years ago, the \ncountry has been on a journey together. We have discussed it. A lot of \nfolks have sat around their kitchen tables and in their living rooms \nand have talked about stem cell research. Everybody has debated it. We \nhave learned a lot more about the promise and the peril of stem cell \nresearch. At first, our natural reaction was to temper our excitement \nwith a well-founded fear that this technology perhaps posed \ninsurmountable ethical hurdles. The President himself deliberated. He \nappointed a task force. He studied and debated the fine points with \nteams of bioethicists. He reached what he felt was a reasonable \ncompromise. In August of 2001, he announced to the American people that \nFederal funds would be used only for research on a few lines of stem \ncells that were already harvested. Back then, he said stem cells \n``offer both great promise and great peril. I have decided we must \nproceed with great care.''\n  That was the President speaking. Since then, America's understanding \nof this issue has evolved. We have learned that the lines available for \nresearch are far less useful than we had initially hoped. We learned \nthe technology is as promising as we dreamed it might be. We have come \nto understand that embracing stem cell research does not condemn us to \nthe slippery slope of human cloning.\n  Since the President's decision, stem cell research funded by the \nprivate sector and by the States has gone ahead across the country. But \nit has gone ahead slower than many of us might like in the absence of \ncrucial Federal funding--fast enough to fill the pages of major medical \njournals with exciting new discoveries. But this research has taken \nplace on a large enough scale at our most important educational \nresearch institutions to be able to tell us it addresses our major \nfears. What in the summer of 2001 might have seemed a well-founded \nsuspicion has completely proven to be unfounded. As Newt Gingrich told \nme yesterday, after reversing himself and acknowledging the threat \nposed by global warming is both urgent and real, serious legislators \nchange their stances over time. That is permissible. That is the \nproduct of thinking, the product of additional information and \nadditional input.\n  Look at the Senate. Republicans such as John McCain, former majority \nleader Bill Frist, the Senator from Utah, Orrin Hatch, who is on the \nfloor now, have looked carefully at the scientific facts and have \nsearched their own consciousness. They have all reached the same \nconclusion: Opposing stem cell research is the opposite of a pro-life \npolicy.\n  Last summer, 63 Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, and 235 \nHouse Members voted in favor of stem cell research. That was a \nresponsible bill, a consensus bill. It was designed specifically to \naddress the concerns of lawmakers who are worried about the bioethics--\nand appropriately worried, I might add. It is difficult to get 63 \nSenators to agree on anything more controversial than the sort of \nstandard fare of America, and it is especially difficult on a \npolarizing, emotionally charged issue. But we came together as a \nSenate. We hammered out our differences and they came together in the \nHouse, and we arrived at a smart, thoughtful, sensitive piece of \nlegislation that reflected a consensus and respected our collective \nconscience. When we did so, we were confronted by a President who \npromised to proceed with great care, whose commitment to deliberation \nhas calcified into a stubborn refusal to confront reality or re-engage \nin a changing debate.\n\n  America has evolved on this issue, but the President has stood still. \nThat is why over an overwhelming bipartisan Senate majority, the \nPresident finally dusted off the veto pen and offered up the first and, \nto date, the only veto of his entire Presidency. The President has \nsigned good and bad legislation--torture bills, pork, giveaways to oil \ncompanies, and tax cuts for millionaires. But when it came to a strong \nemerging national consensus on an issue that brings hope to families \nacross the country, the President chose to shut down the debate and \nblock Federal funding for scientific research.\n  Make no mistake, this is a personal issue--deeply personal for each \nof us in this Chamber, and for the President. I understand that. I am \nconfident when the President made his decision about stem cell research \nover 6 years ago, he searched his mind and his heart, as all of us who \ncare passionately about this issue have done. If he vetoes stem cell \nresearch again, that will send a message that this country no longer \nintends to be the global leader in scientific knowledge and discovery. \nIt would send a message to Americans suffering from Parkinson's, spinal \ninjuries, and countless ailments that their well-being is not important \nto us. We are telling these people we could do more to cure you, but we \nchoose not to. We are telling them help is not on the way.\n  The current policy is eroding our national advantage on stem cell \nresearch. It is undermining the hopes and dreams of millions of \nAmericans. We are tying our scientists' hands behind their backs and \nholding them back from the possibilities of the future.\n  We need a Federal policy that builds on the advances being made in \nour States and our universities, in our private foundations, and in our \nresearch centers, all of which have proceeded in a thoughtful and \ncommonsense way to the ethics concerned in this issue. The research now \nis already showing tremendous promise. In my State of Massachusetts, \nsome of the best scientists in the world are working at the Whitehead \nInstitute for Biomedical Research at MIT and the Harvard Stem Cell \nInstitute. We are still in the early stages of this line of research, \nbut there is here the kind of discovery that we are already making.\n  Let me explain. The Harvard Stem Cell Institute identified cells that \nthey call ``master cardiac'' stem cells, which is a single cell type \nthat gives rise to the major cellular building blocks of the mammalian \nheart. That discovery rewrote the story of cardiac development and \ncontributed a significant building block toward what could become \nrevolutionary new treatments for heart disease. We are already seeing \ncures for diseases in our labs.\n  At the Whitehead Institute, a leading stem cell researcher and his \nteam used stem cell therapy to cure a mouse suffering from an immune \ndeficiency disease. As you can see, the research is still in the early \nstages, so we cannot say what the immediate results are going to be for \nhumans. But, rest assured, today's breakthroughs in mice have often \nbecome tomorrow's cures for humans.\n  Now we can all hope that alternatives to embryonic stem cell research \nhold similar promise. But you\n\n[[Page S4327]]\n\ncannot wish away what our scientists are telling us. Research on \nembryonic stem cells is incredibly promising, pivotal to this new \nfield, and not easily sidestepped. Nobel Prize winners past and \npresent, and most likely future, believe this is the future biology of \nmedical science.\n  People of good will and good sense can resolve these complicated \nethical issues without stopping lifesaving research. The country has \nled the world in revolutionary discoveries, with our breakthroughs and \nour beliefs moving ahead together, symbiotically. Senate passage of \nthis bill with a veto-proof majority can put us, again, on that path.\n  We are giving this administration yet another chance to consider a \nmisjudgment with profound consequences. We are working to create a \nframework for ethical, federally funded research. Like the bill passed \nlast summer, this legislation provides important ethical safeguards by \nextending federally funded research only to embryos that are, one, \ndonated by in vitro fertilization clinics; two, created specifically \nfor fertility treatment, not for research; three, in excess of \ntreatment needs and would otherwise be discarded; and four, donated by \ntreatment-seeking individuals who provided written, informed consent \nand were not offered financial inducements. I cannot think of any way \nto more effectively and thoughtfully address the ethical issues that \nare concerned here.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes. Is that \npossible?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what may not have been clear to us \ninitially--and it should be clear now--it just doesn't make sense to \nallow in vitro fertilization to create millions of embryos that will \nnever become human beings and then prohibit science from using them to \ncure sick people and relieve human suffering but to simply discard \nthose embryos.\n  Valuing the mysteries and sacredness of human life is something all \nof us should do. It underlies every religion on this planet. Stem cell \nadvocates are no different. Here in the Senate and across this country, \nAmericans are approaching an ethical consensus which bans human \ncloning, which is thoughtful about the use of embryos that would be \ndiscarded, and which respects life and also respects that life by \nprotecting stem cell research.\n  We don't have the luxury of patience, not when 100 million Americans \nsuffer from illnesses that might one day be cured with stem cell \ntherapy, not when more than 3,000 Americans die from diseases every day \nthat one day may be made treatable by stem cell research.\n  If we can get 67 votes out of 100 Senators--4 more than we had last \nsummer--then we can send the President a veto-proof message. Last \nsummer, the Senate sent the administration a strong message by passing \na bill that would responsibly fund this research, and the American \npeople showed their agreement last November when they sent an even \nlarger majority back to Washington to vote in greater numbers to \nsupport lifesaving scientific research. Sixty-three votes are not \nenough. We hope we receive more today so that we can open the doors to \nthis promising future.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee, Mr. Corker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I will probably take more like 5 minutes, \nif the Senator from Georgia wants to allocate the time elsewhere.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to speak today. As you \ncan tell by my location in the Senate, I am new to the Senate. I spent \na great deal of time, as many people did, over the course of the last 2 \nyears visiting with citizens in our State. I think there is nothing \nthat touches us in the public arena more than seeing people who have \nneeds and trying to address those needs. That is the reason many of us \nare in the public arena--I hope all of us are in the public arena.\n  Few of us are untouched by the many illnesses that plague Americans. \nI know all of us have people who have diseases, such as diabetes, \nvarious forms of cancers, heart disease, Alzheimer's. I know my own \nfamily has been touched by Alzheimer's disease. My father has it. All \nof us are aware of issues that are affecting human beings. We also want \nto see breakthroughs take place.\n  It is amazing, the breakthroughs that are taking place today with \nstem cell research--research from adult stem cells, research that is \ntaking place from matter from amniotic fluids, research that is taking \nplace from cord blood matter. So there are amazing cures taking place \nin America today with this research, and I doubt there is a Senator in \nthis body--not a Senator in this body--who doesn't support stem cell \nresearch. The issue really comes down to embryonic stem cell research.\n  Mr. President, I want you to know that over the course of the last 2 \nyears, I spent a tremendous amount of time looking into this issue, \nreading white papers, talking to researchers all across America, \nvisiting embryonic adoption centers where embryos were actually being \nadopted and creating human beings. Because of this issue, because of \nthe ethical divide this issue seems to create for so many Americans, a \ntremendous amount of time was put forth by myself and my staff, but \nmyself firsthand, to reach a conclusion about this issue and to be able \nto communicate that to Tennesseans and Americans.\n  There are four points I have learned about this issue. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts just spoke. He and I have a very different view on \nthis issue. What I have learned about this issue is that honorable \npeople can disagree. Honorable people who truly want to see cures take \nplace for Americans and for people all across the world can disagree as \nto their viewpoint as it relates to embryonic stem cell research. \nAgain, all of us support adult stem cell research.\n  The second point I have learned is that there are tremendous \nbreakthroughs, as I have already mentioned, regarding research that is \ntaking place with adult stem cells, cord blood stem cells, and amniotic \nfluids have matter that is creating stem cells. Tremendous cures are \nbeing created with these stem cells.\n  The third point is that science is going to absolutely outpace our \nability to deal with this issue. There is no question that even if we \npass legislation today, science is going to continue to outpace us as \nit relates to our ability to deal with this fascinating area of \nscience. But I also believe science and these breakthroughs are going \nto allow us to continue to achieve these cures for Americans and for \npeople all across this world without creating this ethical divide of \ndestroying human embryos.\n\n  So I am here to strongly support and applaud the Senator from Georgia \nand the Senator from Minnesota who have put forth the HOPE Act. I am \nhere to strongly support S. 30, which allows additional research to \ntake place on stem cells without breaking that divide. I am also here \nto voice opposition to S. 5, which actually uses Federal dollars to \ndestroy human embryos.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I say to my friend from Tennessee, \nthere is not one dime in S. 5 that would be permitted to be used for \nthe destruction of embryos--not one dime. That is prohibited by the \nDickey-Wicker amendment. This bill does not override that amendment. \nNot one dime in this bill can ever be used for the destruction of any \nembryos. I just want to make that very clear.\n  Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to my colleague, someone with whom \nI have worked on health issues now going back--let me think about \nthis--almost 13 years, I guess, back to 1993, someone with whom I have \nworked very closely on a number of health issues and for whom I have a \ngreat deal of respect for his approach on this issue and so many \nothers. I yield 20 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. \nHatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa. I \nappreciate the arguments he has been making about this issue.\n\n[[Page S4328]]\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of embryonic stem cell \nresearch.\n  First, I plan to vote in favor of both bills that will be considered \ntoday, S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007, and S. 30, \nthe Hope Offered through Principled and Ethical Stem Cell Research Act.\n  I call upon my colleagues to vote in favor of and pass these bills.\n  And I call upon the President to sign both bills into law.\n  However, let me make one point perfectly clear while I will be voting \nfor both S. 5 and S. 30, I believe that S. 5 is clearly preferable to \nS. 30. S. 5 permits Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research; \nS. 30 does not.\n  I want everyone to understand that the votes we cast today could \ntomorrow mean the difference between a healthy life and one of misery \nfor many, many Americans.\n  I commend my good friends and colleagues for their hard work on S. \n5--first, Senator Arlen Specter and Senator Tom Harkin, who held over \n15 bipartisan hearings on embryonic stem cell research over the last \nseveral years.\n  Next, I recognize Senators Kennedy, Smith and Feinstein for their \ncourageous leadership and commitment to this important issue.\n  And, in the House of Representatives, Representatives Mike Castle and \nDiana DeGette must be singled out for their principled leadership on \nthe companion embryonic stem cell research measure, which was approved \nby a strong bipartisan vote.\n  Each day, the Congress must address consequential events--and even \nmomentous threats to our Nation--but it is not often that we have the \nopportunity to cast a vote that is filled with as much hope and promise \nfor the future as the embryonic stem cell research bill we are \nconsidering today.\n  It reminds me of our country's quest for space many years ago, which \nwas no more than a dream when the effort began. Yet what was only a \nvision when it was conceived, yielded wonders beyond anything we could \nhave imagined.\n  The American space program has spawned many important new advances. \nWhen I think of space exploration, I ponder the gift of global \npositioning technology. I consider the weather mapping that we depend \nupon to warn us of impending natural disasters. I marvel at the \nrevolution of instantaneous worldwide communication.\n  As a science, embryonic stem cell research today is where the space \nprogram was when we first dreamed of it. When I think of embryonic stem \ncell research, I imagine diabetics without insulin pumps. I dream of \npatients with Parkinson's Disease who sprint rather than shuffle. I \nconceive of patients with spinal cord injury who stand up and walk \nagain.\n  I think of 16-year-old Tori Schmanski of Orem, UT, who sustained a \nsevere brain injury. I imagine Tori going back to the snowboarding and \ndancing that she loved. Tori Schmanski's parents flew her to China for \nstem-cell therapy. Her father said something that struck me. He said, \n``Our hope is that next time we do this, we won't have to go to \nChina.'' America has long been the world leader in ethical biomedical \nresearch, and we should not lightly cede this ground.\n  When I consider the potential of stem cell research, I think of \npeople like 17-year-old Travis Ashton of Highland, UT, whose brain was \ninjured in a car accident. Today, he is struggling to dribble a \nbasketball. I hope tomorrow he will be able not only to dribble a \nbasketball but dunk a couple of baskets as well.\n  And I think of my great friend, President Ronald Reagan, whose genius \nand energy were sapped away in what were to have been his golden years \nby the ravages of Alzheimer's disease. I imagine him finishing his days \nwith his characteristic humor and vitality.\n  Last year when Congress voted on the Stem Cell Research Enhancement \nAct of 2005, Former First Lady Nancy Reagan sent me a letter urging the \nSenate to support the bill. Let me remind you what it so poignantly \nsaid:\n\n       Dear Orrin:\n       Thank you for your continued commitment to helping the \n     millions of Americans who suffer from devastating and \n     disabling diseases. Your support has given so much hope to so \n     many.\n       It has been nearly a year since the United States House of \n     Representatives first approved the stem cell legislation that \n     would open the research so we could fully unleash its \n     promise. For those who are waiting every day for scientific \n     progress to help their loved ones, the wait for United States \n     Senate action has been very difficult and hard to comprehend.\n       I understand that the United States Senate is now \n     considering voting on H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research \n     Enhancement Act, sometime this month. Orrin, I know I can \n     count on friends like you to help make sure this happens. \n     There is just no more time to wait.\n       Sincerely,\n       Nancy\n\n  As we all know, last year, the Senate did approve this legislation, \nbut President Bush vetoed it.\n  And while I think we all know how this vote will come out today, it \nremains my fervent hope and prayer that President Bush--a person whom I \ngreatly respect and with whom I share strong belief in the right to \nlife--will sign this bill into law.\n  I have received many letters from constituents who ask me, ``Senator \nHatch, how can you support embryonic stem cell research when adult cell \nresearch is so promising?'' They ask, ``Why don't you realize that cord \nblood research makes embryonic stem cell research unnecessary?''\n  My answer is simple. Who among us can know which will yield the \ngreatest breakthroughs? Who among us dares to predetermine the outcome \nby limiting the possibilities of ethical scientific research at the \noutset of this new field of research?\n  The stories I have just related compel me to advocate for all types \nof ethical stem cell research--adult, cord blood, amniotic, and \nembryonic.\n  Indeed, it must be recognized that in August, 2001, President Bush \nbecame the first President to support Federal funding for embryonic \nstem cell research. The President has my respect and admiration for his \ndecision. At that time, he announced that 78 embryonic stem cell lines \nwould be eligible for Federal support. It was a good start.\n  It was also a decision that recognized discarded embryos can, and \nshould, be used to advance our Nation's scientific inquiry. That is \nfundamentally still the issue before us today.\n  The President's policy has not lived up to its promise.\n  In the past 6 years, much has changed. What was once thought to be \nover 70 stem cell lines has dwindled. A number of scientists have told \nme that in reality the number of usable cell lines has shriveled to \nmerely a dozen or fewer.\n  Scientists have told me that these lines are not enough to represent \nthe general population anyway--they have been genetically distorted by \nyears of replication. Furthermore, they are contaminated with so-called \nanimal feeder cells and, therefore, can never be approved for use in \nhuman therapy.\n  Existing Federal policy has created what I have characterized as \nhandcuffed science. By this I mean that scientists are forced to go to \nextreme lengths to comply with Federal law. When they are able to \nscrounge up private funding for fresh embryonic stem cell lines, the \nscientists find their hands bound.\n  They are afraid of violating Federal law by mixing research between \nthe limited, contaminated, federally sanctioned stem cells and cells \nwith the new cell lines lawfully developed with non-Federal funds. No \nequipment purchased with NIH funds touches the new, lawful cell lines \nand the result is that equipment purchased with Federal money lays \nunderused while limited precious money is used to purchase duplicate \nequipment and supplies.\n  Dr. Linda Kelley is an Associate Professor of Medicine at the \nUniversity of Utah. Dr. Kelley told me that the limited number of \ncurrently federally sanctioned cell lines is so unstable that, in her \nwords, ``You are lucky if you can recover 10 percent of the cells they \nsend you.'' She said the cells have been reused for so long that they \nhave degraded and no longer represent the comprehensive human \npopulation.\n  I do not want Utah's scientists moving to California or America's \nscientists moving overseas so they can do their research.\n  Just as we are a nation that would never want to allow a situation to \nexist where American citizens must go abroad for best medical \ntreatment, we should neither allow nor accept an atmosphere where our \nbest doctors and\n\n[[Page S4329]]\n\nscientists must go abroad to develop and provide the best medicine.\n  I do not want U.S. scientists walking away from embryonic stem cell \nresearch because there are too many impediments to pursuing it in our \ncountry for our citizens.\n  Dr. Marie Cseta is a cell biologist from Emory University and is one \nof the many scientists who firmly believe that embryonic stem cells \nhold unusual promise. She is unable to send her NIH-funded, post \ndoctoral fellows to qualified laboratories to learn new procedures \nbecause those laboratories work with the new cell lines. She told me \nthat the restrictions that current Federal policy places upon her and \nher colleagues are, in her words `` . . . so odious that many \nscientists just do not try.''\n  I want scientists to try.\n  I think we will see after today's vote that most Senators want \nscientists to try.\n  I am sure my friends, neighbors, and constituents in Utah want our \nbest scientists to try.\n  In forming my opinions and views on this topic, I met with many \nleading experts in the field of science, ethics, law and, yes, \nreligion. I met with a number of Nobel Laureates including Dr. Harold \nVarmus, former Director of the National Institutes of Health; Dr. \nThomas Cech of the Howard Hughes Institute of Medical Research and Dr. \nPaul Berg of Stanford University.\n  I met with other leading experts including: Dr. Curt Civin and Dr. \nJohn Gearhart both of Johns Hopkins University; Dr. Irv Weissman of \nStanford University; and the University of Utah's own Dr. Mario \nCapecchi.\n  Let me tell my colleagues that we have some great scientists in the \nState of Utah. In fact, Dr. Capecchi, a leading research professor at \nthe University of Utah, is widely recognized as one of the true \npioneers of embryonic stem cell research. He has been working on \nembryonic stem cell research throughout his 40-year career. He has been \nthe recipient of the prestigious Lasker Award which is considered the \nmost prestigious American award in the biomedical sciences. It is often \nthe case that Lasker Award winners go on to receive Nobel prizes.\n  When I was home in Utah last week, I spent a lot of time talking to \nDr. Capecchi. I asked him if he could provide me with what he believed \nare the top reasons why our government should fund embryonic stem cell \nresearch. He shared the following with me:\n  1. Potential source of cures. Embryonic stem cell research provides \nthe potential to cure or ameliorate some of the most devastating and \ncostly diseases faced by our Nation including diabetes, Parkinson's \ndisease, and Alzheimer's disease.\n  2. Embryonic stem cells grow quickly and are versatile. Two inherent \nproperties of embryonic stem cells, not shared with adult stem cells, \nmake them especially attractive cells for cell transplantation-based \ntherapies: i) rapid cell division and ii) versatility.\n  Rapid cell division is critical if we want to use any stem cells for \ntransplantation therapy, as we must quickly expand a limited number of \ncells to the large mass required for therapeutic effect. Embryonic stem \ncells are almost unique in their capacity for rapid growth without loss \nof developmental function.\n  The versatility of embryonic stem cells is truly remarkable. In the \nmouse, embryonic stem cells have been unequivocally demonstrated to be \npluripotent, capable of generating every cell type present in the adult \nbody. Studies in cell culture indicate that human embryonic stem cells \nalso possess this remarkable pluripotency.\n  3. Adult stem cells grow slowly. In contrast, adult stem cells divide \nslowly and normally require a very specialized and undefined cellular \nenvironment--called a niche--for their survival and growth. For \nexample, removal of adult intestinal stem cells from their biological \nniche leads to their automatic, programmed cell death. Blood stem \ncells, obtained from the bone marrow, are among the few adult stem \ncells currently in clinical use, but they cannot yet be expanded in \nculture without losing their developmental function, and hence their \nlimited therapeutic utility.\n  4. Adult stem cells are very restricted in what cell types they can \nproduce. Whereas embryonic stem cells are extremely versatile in their \ncapacity to generate different cell types, adult stem cells appear to \nrange in versatility from quite restricted--for example, blood stem \ncells that can generate multiple types of blood cells, but nothing \nelse--to completely restricted, for example, muscle stem cells that \ngenerate only muscle cells.\n  5. Many important organs do not have adult stem cells. Many tissues \nsuch as liver, pancreas, and blood vessels do not appear to have a \ncorresponding adult stem cell population. Therapies of diseases \ninvolving these tissues would therefore not be readily approachable by \nadult stem cell-based therapy, but could be approached using embryonic \nstem cell-based therapies.\n  6. The usefulness of existing embryonic stem cell lines is extremely \nlimited. The approved set of human embryonic stem cell lines, \nauthorized nearly 6 years ago for federally funded research, is \nwoefully inadequate. Some of them apparently do not exist at all, \nothers are embroiled in extensive proprietary agreements and all of \nthem though suitable for some research purposes, will never be \nsuitable, due to problems with contamination, for therapeutic purposes.\n\n  More importantly, ongoing research--funded by private foundations and \nindustry, or performed abroad--has brought about improvements in how \nlaboratories isolate and grow embryonic stem cells. Mouse embryonic \nstem cells were first characterized over 25 years ago, yet the cell \nlines that researchers use today are far superior to the ones available \n5 or 10 years ago. With the hope of further improvements, we continue \nto isolate new mouse embryonic stem cell lines.\n  So long as the Federal funding ban remains in place, the majority of \nAmerican researchers cannot make similar progress with human embryonic \nstem cells, nor exploit the advances made by others. With the limits \ncurrently in place, American human embryonic stem cell researchers are \nin the unfortunate and unique position of being frozen in time, trapped \nby the technical limitations of mid-2001, while other disciplines \ncontinue to advance. This makes no sense from a medical or scientific \nperspective.\n  Although today's debate focuses on the use of spare embryos to \ndevelop embryonic stem cell lines, the next two points that Dr. \nCapecchi makes center on a different method of producing embryonic stem \ncell lines.\n  For the last three Congresses, Senator Feinstein and I have \nintroduced legislation that addresses this form of embryonic stem cell \nresearch. Although this issue is not squarely before us today, I hope \nthat the majority leader will allow us to take up this important matter \nsometime this Congress.\n  7. Somatic cell nuclear transfer as a research tool. A limitation of \nIVF embryo-derived stem cells is their potential of rejection by the \npatient because of immunological incompatibility. A potential solution \nis the generation of ``customized'' embryonic stem cells by somatic \ncell nuclear transfer, SCNT, which has been demonstrated in proof of \nconcept experiments in mice.\n  While, at present, nuclear transfer using human eggs to generate \ncustomized embryonic stem cells for therapy would be too complex and \ntoo controversial to be applicable for routine transplantation \nmedicine, it represents an important tool for investigating the \nmechanism of converting a somatic cell such as skin cell into an \nembryonic stem cell.\n  We need to learn the ``reprogramming rules'' the egg uses to convert \nthe adult nucleus into an embryonic state following nuclear \ntransplantation. One goal of research in this field is to convert a \nsomatic cell to a pluripotent embryonic stem-cell-like state in culture \nwithout SCNT.\n  We need to use eggs temporarily to learn how to reprogram the adult \nnucleus without the need for human eggs. Progress toward this goal can \nonly be assured if Federal funding would be able to support research in \nthis field in the best academic institutions of our country.\n  8. Embryonic stem cells to study human disease. Because SCNT allows \nproduction of patient-specific embryonic stem cells, this approach \nwould allow establishing research tools for the investigation of \ncomplex human diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, or \ndiabetes in cell culture.\n\n[[Page S4330]]\n\nAn embryonic stem cell line derived from such patients would carry in \nits genome all genetic alterations that caused the disease. Thus, \ndifferentiating these patient-specific embryonic stem cells in culture \nto a cell type that is defective in the patients may provide crucial \ninsights into the pathology of the disease and may provide a critical \nplatform to identify drugs that help prevent, ameliorate, or cure the \ndisease.\n  9. Lack of government commitment means lack of future researchers. \nThe brightest young researchers in our country are currently not \nengaging in human embryonic stem research because they are aware of its \nuncertain future, the low level of commitment by our government to its \nsupport and of the cumbersome restrictions faced by scientists \nparticipating in this research. We are losing the scientists that will \ncarry this critical research into the future.\n  10. Health and economic implications. The health and economic \nimplications of human stem cell research are enormous and other \ncountries have recognized this potential. They are heavily investing in \nembryonic stem cell research. Our country is in grave danger of falling \nbehind in one of the most promising fields of biomedical research.\n  Dr. Capecchi gives very compelling reasons for funding embryonic stem \ncell research. I believe that all ethically responsible avenues of stem \ncell research should be pursued and that is the Congress's obligation \nto the American public to see that they all are pursued.\n  But let me caution that no one should imagine that one bill is a \nsubstitute for the other.\n  S. 30, introduced by Senator Norm Coleman, directs the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to conduct and support research on \npluripotent stem cells that do not damage a human embryo. It also \nspecifies work on naturally dead embryos.\n  But, the concept of alive-but-naturally-dead embryos is based upon \nlimited research that has not yet been duplicated widely.\n  It is promising research, but it is no more than that at this stage. \nIn fact, some scientists are worried that these arrested embryos are \ndefective and would, therefore, produce defective stem cells. And it is \nby no means certain that an arrested embryo can be differentiated from \none that could develop further.\n  In short, this idea may not pan out.\n  Recently, there was another flurry of activity around the possibility \nthat certain cells in amniotic fluid behave similarly to stem cells. \nBut even Dr. Anthony Atala who characterized these cells has said that \nit is a mistake to assume that they are a substitute for embryonic stem \ncells.\n  The vote that counts in the minds of our best and brightest \nscientists--and should count for my colleagues in the Senate and the \nAmerican public--is your vote for S. 5, the Specter-Harkin bill that \nhas already passed the House by a broad bipartisan vote. Our leading \nscientists, including more than 40 Nobel Laureates, tell us at this \ntime there is no known scientific substitute for embryonic stem cells.\n  Yet I understand that the vote I ask you to cast is ethically \ntroubling for some of my colleagues.\n  I have a long, proud and strong record as a right-to-life Senator.\n  I stand against abortion on demand, and I think that Roe v. Wade \nshould never have been decided the way it was.\n  As a member and former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \nworked toward a constitutional amendment banning abortion.\n  In the 108th Congress, I was at the President's side when he signed \nthe bill banning the barbaric practice of partial birth abortion. I was \nchairman of the House-Senate conference committee that finalized the \nbill.\n  So why does a pro-life Senator support embryonic stem cell research? \nBecause I do not consider a frozen embryo to be a human life until it \nis implanted in a woman's uterus. S. 5 allocates Federal research \nfunding to embryonic stem cells derived from frozen embryos that are to \nbe discarded. In fact, thousands of such embryos are routinely \ndiscarded each year.\n  I should explain why frozen embryos exist and why they are discarded.\n  As part of the fertility treatment process, multiple embryos are \ncreated and only one or a few of those that are created are ultimately \nused. The rest can be stored for years in liquid nitrogen. About 11,000 \nembryos per year are discarded by their donors and could be used for \nresearch.\n  I see ethics as being on the side of creating human life through \nfertility treatments. I see it as trying to cure human misery through \nethical stem cell research as is provided through S. 5.\n  When I first took this position in 2001, it was over the objection of \nsome of my constituents in Utah. Utah is a very conservative State. \nSince that time, however, the majority of Utahns and the majority of \nAmericans have come to support the use of Federal funds for embryonic \nstem cell research conducted under ethical guidelines.\n  This year, as in past years, I have had a steady stream of Utahns \nwith chronic diseases visiting my office urging me to continue to push \nfor stem cell research. One young man who has been afflicted with \ndiabetes since youth now has a son with the disease. He urged me to \ncontinue with this fight so that maybe his son might be spared the \nravages of the disease. A woman disabled with multiple sclerosis \nearnestly told me to persist. A constituent with Parkinson's disease \ntold me to do whatever it takes. They all want hope.\n  NIH support is the bedrock of scientific research in the United \nStates and really around the world. And without NIH support, embryonic \nstem cell research will never reach its full potential.\n  While constrained by his position in the administration about what he \ncan and cannot say about the legislation before the Senate, in \ntestimony before the Congress, NIH Director Dr. Elias Zerhouni recently \nmade it abundantly clear that--based on consideration of science \nalone--embryonic stem cell research presents great opportunities for \nscientific advancement. And Dr. Zerhouni is not alone.\n  As I emphasized, one reason is that the limited and continually \nshrinking number of federally sanctioned contaminated cell lines are so \ntired that they no longer adequately represent the genetic code of the \nlarger human family.\n  A second is that the logistics of investigation are burdensome and \nimpractical because of the need to separate funding sources for \nresearch with the limited, deficient federally sanctioned stem cell \nlines and the newer cell lines lawfully developed within Federal \nsupport.\n  A third reason is that scientists cannot now use Federal funds for \nresearch on any embryonic stem cell line that they could implant in \nhumans--these federally sanctioned lines are contaminated with animal \ncells.\n  A fourth reason is the need to be able to bring the fruits of basic \nresearch to the patient. It is one thing to find several hundred \nthousand dollars of private money to complete an early stage research \nproject on stem cell lines in the laboratory. However, when it comes \ntime for clinical testing, the costs of research are in the millions of \ndollars, not the hundreds of thousands of dollars per experiment. \nTypically, this kind of private money is not available unless it is \nfrom industry. Clinical research with stem cells will hit the wall \nwithout NIH funding when that time comes.\n  The private sector will not want to invest millions of dollars into \nstem cell lines that we already know will never yield ethical human \ntreatments. Nor should Congress and the public allow the status quo to \ncontinue.\n  If we unlock the shackles on our scientists, I believe we can \nmaterially shorten the time between basic and applied research--the \ntime between the test tube and the patient's bedside. Let me give you \njust a few examples of what has been accomplished since the Senate last \ndebated this issue.\n  In last October's Nature, biotechnology investigators reported that \nthey could convert human embryonic stem cells into cells capable of \nsynthesizing insulin, the missing hormone in diabetics. This work was \nconducted on privately funded stem cell lines.\n  At the University of California, Los Angeles researchers demonstrated \nthat they could coax embryonic stem cells into becoming T-cells of the \nimmune system, the missing cell line in AIDS patients.\n\n[[Page S4331]]\n\n  And in my own State of Utah, Dr. Raymond D. Lund, a professor of the \nMoran Eye Center at the University of Utah, reported that human \nembryonic stem cells injected into the eyes of blind rats improved \ntheir vision. This important work was conducted with private funding.\n  An Israeli team partially funded by the Israel Science Foundation \nreported engineering a small piece of heart tissue derived from human \nembryonic stem cells that contracted rhythmically, carrying promise for \nfuture cardiac replacement therapies.\n  Last month, Dr. Dachun Wang and Dr. Rick A. Wetsel at the University \nof Texas reported a procedure that differentiates human embryonic stem \ncells into the lung cells that are missing from many lung diseases. The \nwork was funded with a grant from a private donor.\n  Finally, in a recent Nature Medicine Journal, human embryonic stem \ncells delayed the onset of the mouse equivalent of a degenerative brain \ndisease by 70 percent. The approach described in the article holds \nexciting potential for treating dreadful diseases such as ALS and \nAlzheimer's disease.\n  As you can see, there is a lot of promising work being done in the \nfield of embryonic stem cell research. Unfortunately, due to the \nlimitations and restrictions placed on the few cell lines eligible for \nFederal research assistance, much of most promising work is being done \noutside the normal channel of the NIH research network.\n  Yet with all this progress, is science progressing as fast as it \nshould? I recently asked this question of an eminent neuroscientist who \ndirects the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, Dr. \nStory Landis.\n  At the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee's hearing \nentitled ``Can Congress Help Fulfill the Promise of Stem Cell \nResearch,'' committee members heard from scientists, from a young \npatient who suffered from diabetes, and from Dr. Landis. I asked Dr. \nLandis if NIH funds were made available for research on all ethically \nobtained embryos from in vitro fertilization, would the probability of \nfinding cures for human diseases increase?\n  Her response was as follows:\n\n       Absolutely it would increase. There is no question about \n     it. We would have a real opportunity. I can give you one \n     specific example. Huntington's disease is an inherited \n     disease. It caused a particular kind of nerve cell in the \n     brain to die . . . If we had embryonic stem cells derived \n     from discarded embryos that were not implanted, we would be \n     able to make extraordinary inroads into therapeutics for that \n     disease.\n\n  Much is weighing in the balance on today's vote.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider carefully the positions they take \ntoday.\n  In the interests of all those who suffer from debilitating diseases \nand hope for deliverance, I urge my colleagues to vote for S. 5.\n  Let me close by making a point I made to President Bush back in 2001.\n\n       In the opening days of your term in office, scientists have \n     completed the task of sequencing the human genome. While this \n     accomplishment--the work of many in the public and private \n     sectors--is of historical significance, it is only the end of \n     the beginning in a new era of our understanding of the \n     biological sciences. Over your next eight years in office, \n     you have an unprecedented opportunity to provide the personal \n     leadership required to see to it that your Administration \n     will be remembered by future historians as the beginning of \n     the end for such deadly and debilitating diseases as cancer, \n     Alzheimer's and diabetes.\n\n  That is what S. 5 is all about--providing a potential new avenue of \nresearch that may lead to treatments and cures for many diseases that \nafflict many families across our Nation and the world.\n  Mr. President, while I have no objections to S. 30, let us not delude \nourselves into thinking it is the best solution to this. Again, while I \nwill be voting for both S. 5 and S. 30, I believe that S. 5 is clearly \npreferable to S. 30. S. 5 permits Federal funding for embryonic stem \ncell research, S. 30 does not. S. 5 is the bill that will clearly make \na significant difference in the future of medical research.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of S. 5.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen and a half minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 13 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon, Mr. Smith.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am very grateful the Senate is \nconsidering the issue of stem cell research today. This debate marks \nthe culmination of years of work by many of my colleagues and certainly \nby myself and a host of dedicated advocates.\n  I thank Senators Harkin and Specter for their leadership on this \nissue, as well as Senators Hatch, Feinstein, and Kennedy. Working \ntogether for almost a decade, the six of us have over the years laid \nthe groundwork for the Senate to overwhelmingly approve Federal funding \nfor embryonic stem cell research.\n  We did this last July but, as we all know, unfortunately, that bill \nwas ultimately vetoed by the President. That is behind us now, and with \na new Congress comes a new opportunity to revisit this important issue, \nthe issue of embryonic stem cell research.\n  I hope the experiences of the past have helped my colleagues to gain \na fresh perspective on this issue. I know they certainly have for me. \nSome may view the vote we will take later today on S. 5 and S. 30 as a \none-or-the-other option. In my opinion, that is simply shortsighted.\n  I intend to vote for both measures. At the end of the day, they both \naccomplish the goal of advancing stem cell science in the hopes of \nfinding cures for debilitating illnesses such as Parkinson's, \nAlzheimer's, and diabetes, to name but a few.\n  S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007, would allow \nFederal dollars to support research on stem cells derived from human \nembryos created through in vitro fertilization.\n  S. 30, the so-called alternative bill, would provide the support for \nother means of deriving pluripotent stem cells. In that regard, both \nmeasures deserve the Senate's support. I find it troubling that these \nmeasures should be pitted against one another. Many argue that S. 5 is \na must-pass legislation, and I would tend to agree with them.\n  But that should not detract from the importance of alternative forms \nof stem cell research sanctioned in S. 30. As research on embryonic and \nother forms of stem cells like amniotic or the placental therapies is \nstill in its infancy, we need to support them all to fully realize the \npotential they might hold.\n  Since the Senate last considered stem cell research, we have all had \nadditional time to reflect on the sensitive issues underlying this \ndebate. As a pro-life Republican, I initially had some uneasiness with \nendorsing this type of research that so heavily relies on human \nembryos.\n  Drawing from my deeply held religious beliefs, scientific evidence, \nand countless stories of individuals living with terrible illnesses, I \nfashioned my position on the basis that I truly believe it supports the \nsanctity of human life.\n  The real tension surrounding this issue, I believe, pits the \npotential medical benefits stem cells hold against the ethical \nuncertainties or the religious convictions some of my colleagues might \nhave with what this kind of research entails. Based upon my personal \nstruggle with this issue, I now believe any reservations with embryonic \nstem cell research are misplaced, especially when one truly considers \nthe question of when life begins.\n  For me, it begins with the mother, with the implantation of the \nembryo.\n  I believe the Scriptures provide ample support showing that flesh and \nspirit become one within a mother. This is one of womankind's supernal \ngifts. I find verses in the Old and the New Testament, in Genesis, \nJeremiah, the Psalms, Job, as well as in the Gospels.\n  All of these things lead me to feel comfortable with an ethical \nconclusion that life begins when flesh and spirit are united in a \nmother's womb and not before.\n  Embryos created as part of the in vitro fertilization process were \nintended to provide infertile couples the gift of life, the chance to \nbecome parents. Those that go unused in infertility treatments should \nstill have the opportunity to give the gift of life either by later \nimplantation or to those living with debilitating diseases through stem \ncell research.\n  Without being implanted in a mother's womb, an IVF embryo is a group \nof\n\n[[Page S4332]]\n\ncells growing in a petri dish. If those cells are stored in a lab for \n1,000 years, they have no possibility of developing into anything more \nthan a group of cells. They remain the dust of the Earth, one of the \nbuilding blocks leading to life.\n  It is the act of implantation within a mother that gives them life. \nIt is the act of implantation that is the essential missing ingredient \nin this debate. So instead of destroying or discarding unused embryos, \nwe have the opportunity to use them to derive much needed stem cell \nlines for the advancement of stem cell science.\n  It is not more moral to simply throw them away. While many of my pro-\nlife colleagues may not agree with my position, I know they do support \nthe intent of embryonic stem cell research; that of finding cures for a \nnumber of chronic diseases and debilitating health conditions. That is \nwhy I still struggle with describing S. 30 as an alternative to S. 5. \nIt is not an alternative or a substitute, it is a perfect complement.\n  To fully realize the benefits that all types of stem cell research \noffer, I urge my colleagues to vote affirmatively for both measures we \nare considering today.\n  The promise of embryonic stem cell research is very real. Those \nsuffering from Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes, cardiovascular \ndisease, and many cancers believe in that promise, and so do I.\n  But we have yet to unleash the potential behind this science because \nof the restrictions we have placed upon stem cell research. While I \nappreciate the President allowing the research to move forward on a \nlimited number of stem cell lines, we all know that over time those \nlines have been degraded, and scientists are in desperate need of new, \nuncontaminated lines.\n  We cannot expect scientists to make progress in developing today's \ntreatments if we limit them to yesterday's science.\n  I believe the Federal Government has a vital, moral role to play in \nthe development of stem cell science to ensure that appropriate ethical \nguidelines are followed. It is uncertain where we will end up if \nembryonic stem cell research becomes an entirely private sector \nventure.\n  With lack of sufficient funding and ethical boundaries, who knows \nwhere we will wind up? The Federal Government can guide research in the \nright direction. I fear if we fail to show up to work on this issue, we \nwill run into very serious problems in the long run.\n\n  Over the last 7 years it has become increasingly clear to me that \nbeing pro-life requires protecting both the sanctity of human life and \nthe quality of human life. By allowing research on stem cell lines \nderived from unused IVF embryos, we could forge a path that would one \nday lead to cures for some of mankind's most dreadful medical maladies.\n  If only one life-improving application of stem cell science comes \nfrom my vote in favor of S. 5, then I believe I have done my job, and \ndone it correctly; for I have chosen to err on the side of hope, \nhealing, and health.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues, even those who have some ethical \nreservations or contrary religious feelings on this issue, to do the \nsame. I have heard some refer to embryonic stem cell research as a \nconflict between science and religion. I do not believe that is the \ncase. One of the greatest qualities and aspects of life in the United \nStates is our religious pluralism. It is something we see an absence \nof, tragically, in too many places around the world.\n  We do not serve the public well by taking the narrowest theological \nposition and trying to impose it on public policy. The American \ntradition is open enough to include other considerations of ethical \nideas, Scriptural interpretations, and scientific hope.\n  I am not a scientist, and I am not a theologian. But as I use my \nagency to interpret what I know in the Scriptures, and the complexities \nof medicine, I have come to the conclusion that we are all made of \ndust. Dust thou art and unto dust thou shall return, as the Lord said \nto Job.\n  In that regard, pluripotent stem cells are one of the building blocks \nof life, the dust of the Earth. I believe we miss the understanding of \nthe importance of the spirit, the breath of life, the spirit within \nmankind, as the essential ingredient which causes life to begin.\n  I do not find that religion and science are in conflict in the Senate \ntoday. I believe they are in harmony. I believe we should have a broad \nenough view to include the many views that comprise American pluralism.\n  To that point, Mr. President, I turn to the Scriptures even to find \nwisdom that I do not have of myself. In the earliest pages of the Old \nTestament, I find this statement:\n\n       And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and \n     breathed into him, his nostril the breath of life, and man \n     became a living soul.\n\n  Mr. President, there are two conjunctions. The dust of the ground \n``and'' the breath of life ``and'' then man becomes a living \nsoul. Until you have both, you do not have life.\n\n  I cannot end my comments today without mentioning also my own \nfamily's history. It has played a role in shaping my views on embryonic \nstem cell research. My mother's name was Jessica Udall. I watched my \ngrandmother Lela Lee Udall die of Parkinson's. I watched my uncle \nAddison Udall die of Parkinson's. I watched my cousin, former \nDemocratic Presidential candidate and Arizona Congressman, Morris K. \nUdall, die of Parkinson's. To watch people die of such a malady is to \ninstill in one's heart a desire to err on the side of health, hope, and \nhealing. We will all die, but no one should have to die as they died.\n  I yield the floor and urge my colleagues to vote for both of these \nmeasures. They are complementary. They are headed in the same \ndirection. They are not putting science and faith at odds with one \nanother.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Who yields time?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Florida, Mr. Martinez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, this is indeed a difficult issue and \ndebate. I respect so much my colleague from Oregon. I know he speaks \nwith passion and heart as he deals with these contentious but important \nissues. I must express some disagreement with him, while I agree with \nmost of what he said.\n  The issue of stem cells is a vital and emotional one, and we need to \ndeal with it carefully as we move forward in the Senate.\n  The embryonic stem cell debate stimulates some of us to defend the \ninherent human desire to make discoveries and to build on them; \nlikewise, this debate galvanizes others of us who defend human life and \nbelieve it should be valued in all its forms. The engineered creation \nor destruction of a human embryo for the sake of scientific advancement \ncannot be the answer to any of our ever-growing challenges.\n  In this great country of ours, and around the world, there are many \nsuffering from debilitating conditions and ravaging diseases such as \nmultiple sclerosis, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. These people are in need \nof medical treatment. Thanks to the brilliant minds and innovative ways \nof doctors and scientists across the globe, many medical treatments are \nnow available. We can credit advances in stem cell research with this \nexpanding treatment.\n  Stem cell research holds tremendous opportunities for our society to \nhelp treat and cure people's diseases and illnesses; and some would \nlike to extend the success found through federally funded adult stem \ncell research to embryonic research. They have proposed that we harvest \nthese human embryos--which were created with the knowledge that many of \nthem would be destroyed--to be used for research.\n  While I, and others, understand the great need, we also know that \nthere has to be a better way. In fact, I know there is. That is what I \nwant to discuss today.\n  The legislation currently being considered will direct Federal \ntaxpayer dollars specifically for the destruction of human embryos to \ndevelop cells that might lead to treatments for various health \nproblems. This raises moral objections with me because of my deeply \nheld religious beliefs.\n  We are currently funding research on nonembryonic stem cells derived \nfrom adult stem cells, amniotic cord blood or placenta sources. These \nhave proven their ability to target many, if not eventually all, of the \nconditions expected to be addressed through embryonic stem cell \nresearch.\n\n[[Page S4333]]\n\n  The University of Florida has one of the top five adult stem cell \nresearch centers in the world and their findings are already making a \ndifference.\n  At the University of Florida, researchers are making great headway \nwith stem cell research. They have in the works treatments for heart \ndisease, a cure for diabetes, and preventions for diabetic eye \ndiseases. Additionally, researchers at the University of Florida are \nmaking significant strides on the path toward reversing adult \nblindness, treating neurological conditions, and rebuilding human brain \ncells. Researchers in Gainesville are also leading the world in \nidentifying cancer stem cells a primary step toward identifying \ntherapies to cure various forms of cancer.\n  It is worth noting that all of these advances have a vital common \nthread; each of the aforementioned breakthroughs came about thanks to \nnonembryonic stem cells.\n  At the end of 2005, President Bush signed a bill that aims to further \ndevelop our Nation's cord blood inventory to allow for increased \navailability of existing and future stem cell treatments; and I was \nvery proud to have supported this legislation.\n  As my colleagues know, this legislation made its way through Congress \nwith tremendous success. The House of Representatives passed it with \nonly one dissenting vote, and in the Senate it passed it unanimously.\n  The Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005 created a new \nFederal program to collect and store cord blood. In addition, the law \nexpands the existing bone marrow registry to include cord blood.\n  New programs utilizing cord blood, such as the recently created \nCORD:USE Center at the Winnie Palmer Hospital in my own home State of \nFlorida, are building on this valuable and expanding foundation. These \nprograms are advancing science without compromising morality.\n  Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies in Orlando is now able to \ncontribute a diverse and increased supply of cord blood. This is \nreassuring news for the thousands of people who would otherwise die \nunnecessarily each and every year were it not for the large, \ngenetically-diversified stem cell bank that is now available. The uses \nof cord blood are fascinating and they speak of breakthroughs.\n  Stephen Sprague, one of the first adults to receive a stem cell \ntransplant from umbilical cord blood, recently visited Winnie Palmer \nHospital and its cord blood bank to express his gratitude for what they \nare doing. Stephen was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia in \n1995, and when chemotherapy and other treatments did not work, and a \nmatch for a bone marrow transplant could not be found, he was informed \nthat essentially nothing more could be done. Luckily, Stephen's \noncologist was able to enroll him in one of the first clinical trials \nusing umbilical cord blood.\n  A wonderful mother agreed to donate her placenta; from that, the \nlifesaving cord blood was collected. Ten years after receiving the stem \ncell transplant, Stephen remains completely cancer-free. Not only this, \nbut before his cord blood transplant, Stephen was an insulin-dependent \ndiabetic. Following the transplant, Stephen has not needed to use \ninsulin; through taking only oral diabetic medications, his sugar \nlevels have remained normal.\n  So, not only was Stephen's life saved by the transplant, his quality \nof life was improved. It is no wonder that Stephen has now dedicated \nhis life to telling his cord blood story of hope to patients and \nmothers who can also give the gift of life through the donation of \ntheir cord blood.\n  Umbilical cord blood stems cells have now been used in thousands of \npatients requiring a potentially lifesaving stem cell transplant and \nwith good results.\n  The collection of these cells from the delivery of a healthy newborn \nbaby can result in a stem cell transplant desperately needed to save \nsomeone else's life. Essentially, new life is helping to stimulate more \nlife.\n  This allows us to help countless people in need without the moral \ndilemma presented by the embryonic alternative which, from my \nperspective, is no true alternative.\n  Cord blood is currently being used to treat nearly 80 diseases.\n  Adult stem cells have made, and will continue to make, a recognizable \ncontribution to helping those with leukemia, sickle cell disease, and \nother potentially fatal illnesses and conditions.\n  Proponents of embryonic stem cell research say they want to make \navailable for research only those embryos that are, in their words, \n``unwanted.'' One of my colleagues recently asserted, ``If these \nembryos were going to create life, we wouldn't be supporting research \non them.\n  Yet, there is proof that these embryos are living things and that \nthey are wanted. Yes, these embryos can, and are, growing into fully \nformed babies. Known as ``snowflake babies,'' these babies are born \nfrom adopted embryos--excess embryos from successful in vitro \nfertilization parents that are donated and adopted by a couple where \nfertilization techniques were forgone or unsuccessful.\n  To date, 133 snowflake babies have been born, with nearly another two \ndozen on the way.\n  Had these--in the words of the critics, ``unwanted'' embryos--been \ntossed aside, human life would have literally been discarded.\n  Many Americans agree that we need to move forward on this issue with \nprudence, and in a way that respects and values human life. As we stand \nto balance our interests in helping those in need without destroying \nhuman life, there is a good piece of legislation being considered that \nI want my colleagues to consider.\n  Under the HOPE Act, no living embryo would be damaged or harmed for \nthe sake of research. What the HOPE Act would do is allow scientists \nfor the first time to apply for Federal funds to perform research on \nembryos that have died naturally during the in vitro process. For those \nhoping to find a cure through embryonic stem cell research, this would \nbe a modest and principled step toward achieving that goal.\n  It would also be the right step to take, because it is the only \noption that opens up new frontiers without damaging human life; a move \nin this direction would not detract from the real results we have seen \nthrough federally-sponsored adult stem cell research. I encourage my \ncolleagues to strongly consider voting in favor of the HOPE Act.\n  We must be dedicated only to research which preserves and protects \nlives. Adult stem cells hold great promise, have had more proven \nsuccess in lab trials and actual applications, and they do not require \nthe destruction of human life. This is where our Federal funding should \nremain focused.\n  At this time, efforts to federally fund a different area would siphon \nmoney from proven research.\n  If it is possible to simultaneously defend human life and help others \nin need, why on earth would we not do it? Why wouldn't that be the \nbetter option? We know it is possible to do both at the same time. It \nseems to me to be the reasonable thing to do. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues today to support the HOPE Act, to support a way of \ncontinuing to advance the frontiers of research while at the same time \navoiding the troublesome and meddlesome moral dilemmas that funding for \nembryonic stem cells would present.\n\n  There is an option. There is an alternative. There is an opportunity \nto advance stem cell research of the embryonic type, knowing we have \nalready had great success with adult stem cells, with cord blood, and \nall of the other usages, but at the same time not tampering with the \nmoral dilemma we would have to cross if we are destroying embryonic \nlife in order to have stem cell research in that direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida and \nmy colleague from Oregon as well. I want to address a couple of issues \nin response to some of the statements that have been made and also get \nus back to what we are discussing.\n  On S. 5, the central issue is, will we sanction the destruction of \nnascent human life with Federal taxpayer dollars? There is currently no \nprohibition\n\n[[Page S4334]]\n\nagainst embryonic stem cell research in this country. Any private group \nin Illinois or Kansas or Pennsylvania that wants to develop an \nembryonic stem cell line can do so. There is no prohibition. The \nquestion is, will we use Federal taxpayer dollars to destroy human life \nto develop additional stem cell lines? That is what S. 5 is about.\n  The second point is, if we want to talk about cures, which I believe \nthat is what the debate should be centered on, is it appropriate to \ndivert taxpayer dollars from adult stem cell research, from cord blood \nresearch, from placental research, from amniotic fluid research into \nthese areas of highly speculative embryonic stem cell research that has \nnot produced results to date and is unlikely to produce results in the \nnear future, if at all. If it does produce results, it is going to lead \nus toward human cloning, because we are not going to have a genetic \nmatch on the embryonic stem cell line. You are going to need a genetic \nmatch so you will have to develop human cloning to get a genetic match \nto produce the cure you want.\n  Cloning is not on the table today, but that is what this moves us \ntoward, because that is what is going to have to happen, if this will \never work. But it doesn't need to go that route. I want to get us back \non those central questions.\n  Let's talk about the facts on these questions. We have invested \nheavily as a country in embryonic stem cell research. We have invested \nin adult stem cell research. We have invested nearly $613 million on \nembryonic stem cell research. In total, since 2002, $613 million \ninvested in embryonic stem cell research. So to say that we are not \nfunding, we are not doing work in this area, is false. We have invested \na considerable amount of work and effort in this field.\n\n  Now, individuals are saying: OK, yes, you have put money into this \nfield, but the lines on which you allow research are contaminated. I \nwish to draw attention to this article from Nature magazine--excuse me. \nI want to get this one up. This article: ``Bush Stem Cell Line \nContamination is Exaggerated.'' This is from a CEO of a stem cell \ncompany:\n\n       So the stuff you hear published--\n\n  I am reading the quotation--\n\n     --that all of these lines are irrevocably contaminated with \n     mouse materials that could never be used in people--hogwash. \n     If you know how to grow them, they're fine.\n\n  That is in an article where one of the key individuals, the CEO of a \nstem cell company, is saying that. So we have $613 million that is in \nhuman and nonhuman embryonic stem cell research. The idea that the \nlines are contaminated is hogwash. They are not contaminated. They are \nuseful. They are being used. The research is taking place. So we have \nthis. We have $613 million going into this area since 2002. One would \nreasonably expect we ought to have some results after over half a \nmillion dollars going into the field in this period of time and a lot \nof efforts from the scientific community. We have known about embryonic \nstem cells for 25 years.\n  Indeed, the magazine Nature in 2006 marked the 25th anniversary of \nthe two papers reporting the first isolation of mouse embryonic stem \ncells--a 25-year celebration. So we have known about embryonic stem \ncells for 25 years and in humans for the last 10 years. We have been \nable to research on them in lab animals for the last 25 years. That is \nan exciting development which took place a quarter of a century ago. We \nhave invested heavily--$613 million since 2002. We have put a lot of \nmoney into this. We put a lot of scientific effort into this.\n  What do we have? That should be a reasonable question all my \ncolleagues would ask. All my colleagues would say: Well, OK. We have \ntalked about this, we have put money in it, we have discovered it, and \nwe have put a lot of our best scientific minds into this field. What do \nwe have? The results for adult versus embryonic: We have invested more \nin adult than we have in embryonic, but it is not an inconsequential \namount that we have put into embryonic--$613 million. This chart shows \nthe current human applications in the two fields of adult versus the \nembryonic. For allergy and infectious disease, embryonic stem cell \nresearch and human applications: zero. We have 15 in the adult field. \nCancer Institute: zero in ESCR, 26 in adult. Child Health Institute: \nzero here for embryonic, 8 in adult. Diabetes and Digestive: zero for \nembryonic, three in the adult field. Eye Institute: one adult, zero \nembryonic. Zero embryonic, zero embryonic, zero embryonic in each of \nthose fields. You can see what we have been able to do in the adult \nfield by the investment we have there.\n  So from just a sheer practicality standpoint--we have known about \nthis for 25 years, and we have put $613 million into it. We have zero \nhuman clinical applications today taking place. We have over--and here \nI want to show an adjusted chart. I am sorry this is one we have had to \npaper over, but just yesterday we had juvenile diabetes on our board \nfor adult stem cell application--one of the big ones. This affects a \nlot of people. It is one that a number of people in this body are \nstrongly interested in, deeply interested in.\n  I just read to my colleagues this morning from the Chicago Tribune \nabout this adult stem cell work treating juvenile diabetes where an \nindividual with their own--this is type 1 diabetes--treating an \nindividual with their own stem cells at Northwestern University. Here \nis a quote from a researcher who was reviewing it from Harvard Medical \nSchool:\n\n       Their results look better than anything I have seen so far.\n\n  Type 1 diabetes. We added it, gladly, to the board today. Seventy-\nthree different human applications we have in adult stem cells. Cord \nblood. We don't have amniotic fluid yet developing, which I think we \nshould start banking the amniotic fluid from the placenta because of \nthe rich stores of stem cells, but we haven't quite started that yet \ntoday. So we have put in money in adult and we have put money in \nembryonic. We have a lot of results in adult.\n  I held this up for my colleagues yesterday, but I hope they get a \nchance to look at it again. This is the front page of the research \nfindings in the adult fields we have. It is about a 4-inch binder. That \nwas accumulated as of April 2006--last year. We did an addendum from \nJune 2006 to March 2007. These are the findings. These are the \nsuccessful results in the adult cord blood field that we have. I don't \nhave my empty binder to show what we have on embryonic stem cell. It is \na legitimate question, just a legitimate question about what we should \nbe investing in that is yielding results in the adult versus embryonic \nfield that is taking place.\n  There is the tumor problem. My colleague from Utah was saying we can \nget over this tumor problem which is taking place. Unfortunately, I \nhave a stack--and I put it into the Record yesterday--of 10 research \npapers, and that was really just a sampling of the papers where the \nembryonic stem cells are producing tumors. This is real. It is \nsignificant. It is not going away, these tumor-formation problems with \nembryonic stem cells.\n  This is in a publication called ``Stem Cells'': ``The presentation of \nthe insulin gene could be demonstrated only when the cells \ndifferentiated in vivo into teratomas''--into tumors. These are tumors \nwhich are taking place. This is just one of a stack of research papers \nsaying this is a problem. It is a difficulty we have.\n\n  Let's talk about patients again because, to me, that is what we \nreally have to get to--the bottom line. We have to bring this back to \nthe patients.\n  We now have this exciting development which is taking place with type \n1 juvenile diabetes. Unfortunately, it is taking place in Brazil \ninstead of the United States. I wish we were having the researchers \ndoing this in the United States. I guess they--whether they are being \nattracted overseas to do adult stem cell work and not in the United \nStates--but this was Northwestern University which was doing this in \nBrazil.\n  I want to look at Parkinson's. One of my colleagues raised the issue \nof Parkinson's, which is a very difficult, terrible disease that \nconfronts and confounds us as a society and as individuals. I wish to \npoint out to my colleagues an individual who came to testify in 2004 \nwho was a Parkinson's patient and testified about his treatment with \nhis own stem cells that was taking place, a Parkinson's patient, Dr. \nDennis Turner, and he was Parkinson's free for a period of 5 years. We \ntried to get him in to testify a number of different times. We had \ntrouble. He was\n\n[[Page S4335]]\n\nout doing African safaris after his stem cell treatment as he was doing \nso well from it.\n  My point is that we have tried this. We have tried it aggressively. \nWe have tried it ethically to say: OK, let's try embryonic stem cell \nwork on lines where a life-and-death decision has already been made. \nThat was the President's determination in 2001. He was saying: We don't \nknow at this point in time where this science will lead us. Let's try \nit on these ethical lines because somebody has already made the life-\nand-death decision. Let's put money into it. Let's start in the \nnonhuman area first because we want to develop this in the animal \nmodels, which is clearly the right way to go. Let's invest heavily in \nit, which I noted in the earlier chart where I pointed this out, the \namount of animal trials, the money that has been put into animal trials \non embryonic stem cell work--in 2006 alone, $110 million; $481 million \nfor 2002 through 2006--trying to find out: Is there a place? Is there a \nway? Can we make this work? We continue to have this tumor problem \nwhich keeps coming up in almost all of the studies. Yet we are saying: \nLet's try it on human embryonic and these lines that have already been \ndeveloped, and we still are not getting the results. So why would we \ncontinue to fund in this area?\n  Now we want to expand the funding in this area and we want to expand \nthe lines and we want to--not only go there, we want to cross the big \nmoral divide that many of us have different opinions on but all of us \nhave to say is a profound question: the use of taxpayer dollars to fund \nthe destruction of young human life. We are all troubled about that. \nOne way or the other, we are all troubled about that. That is the \nquestion on this particular bill and why it is so divisive. We all want \ncures. I think people are troubled about the lack of scientific results \nin one area and the fact that we are now at, in clinicaltrials.gov., \n1,422 human clinical trials now going on, being recruited for or no \nlonger recruiting for using adult stem cell work right now. So this is \ngoing on. It is going on well. We are not seeing any of it in the \nembryonic.\n  Now we want to take another step. We want to use taxpayer dollars. We \nwant to destroy young human life. We want to create more embryonic stem \ncell lines. Never mind that it hasn't worked to date. Never mind that \nwe are getting a lot of results in this other field. Never mind that a \ngood portion of our electorate finds this ethically very troubling. We \nare going to do it. We are going to go with it. We think we ought to do \nit.\n  I don't think this is a wise move. I don't think it is wise \npractically. I don't think it is wise ethically in spite of the \nthoughts others might have. Ronald Reagan said: If you didn't know if \nsomebody was alive or dead, you wouldn't bury them. If you weren't \nsure, you wouldn't bury them, just as a commonsense thought.\n  My colleague from Oregon did a very good discussion of the ethical \nissues here, yet I could even detect in his thoughts that this is a \ntroubling question. It is a tough one. So if we are not sure if it is \nalive or dead, would you bury them? No, you wouldn't. And if we have a \nmoral question about this and we have a route where we can use this \n$613 million to get treatments for people like Dennis Turner, whom I \nput up here, and where we have had some successes, if we can get \ntreatments for diabetes that are being developed by Northwestern \nUniversity--but for some reason, we are not having enough interest here \nto do them here, we are having to do them in Brazil. I want people to \nget treatments. I want Parkinson's treatment to take place. We have a \nroute to do this. We are not unlimited on money resources in the health \ncare field. I think we should invest more in the health care field. We \nhave a route to go here. We have a route that can use the resources. If \nwe are at 1,422 clinical trials now, my guess is there would be a lot \nmore we could try.\n  I put up pictures of people here yesterday who are having to go to \nPortugal for spinal cord injury treatment. I want to put a picture back \nup here again. She wonders why we couldn't do this here.\n  I might also note to my colleagues that it is critical that this is \ndone quickly. They are finding in these early research results that the \nsooner you can get the treatment for a spinal cord injury, the more \nlikelihood of success. So how many people here can afford to fly to \nPortugal for the treatment, and how much better would it be if this \nwere done in Chicago or in Kansas City where people could go in this \ncountry? This lady from central Illinois was having to go to Portugal.\n\n  We are finding this in the diabetes area. They are saying the sooner \nthe treatment is taking place--and this is common sense to most of us \nas well--we know that the sooner you catch something, the more \nlikelihood you have success if you get quick treatment. Should we be \nforcing people, then, to go to Brazil and Portugal and Thailand to get \nthese adult stem cell treatments, many of which were developed in the \nUnited States, being done by U.S. researchers, and now are being \nconducted abroad? Why? I understand we are all after this goal of \ntreatments, and I would hope--and I give that to my opponents, that is \nwhat they are after as well--they see this hope and promise.\n  I can't cross the ethical boundary they have been able to cross. I \nfind that each of these lives--and here, I am not quoting from a \nreligious source; I am quoting from a biology textbook, an embryology \ntextbook, 1996 human embryology textbook that says this about when life \nbegins, not talking about the theology but the biology. It says:\n\n       Although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a \n     critical landmark, because under ordinary circumstances, a \n     new genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.\n\n  The Presiding Officer wouldn't be here if he was destroyed as an \nembryo. If we have somebody in the future who in this body--I want to \nshow Hannah--who was in this body who was created--or, excuse me, was \nstarted in an IVF clinic, was a frozen embryo at some point in time, \nshe is destroyed as a frozen embryo, she isn't going to be here as a \nU.S. Senator. This life is a continuum. We all know this. This is not \nsomething which is new to anybody. Here is man who is a snowflake baby, \na frozen embryo, who was adopted. We have another route to go on these \nfrozen embryos. We could really push an adoption technique. If she is \ndestroyed at this early phase, she obviously isn't here at a later \nphase. We know that. We know what the embryology textbook says, and we \nknow each of us started out as an embryo, so why would we do this? I \nunderstand people are saying: Well, because we want cures. And I do, \ntoo. We have an ethical route to go on the cures. We have a route which \nis producing enormous successful results and one which is producing no \nresults.\n  Now, maybe it will, in a decade or two, over large U.S. expenditure, \nover a great ethical divide that we all are troubled about, and then we \nwill expand into human cloning to be able to get a genetic match, \nbecause it will have to. Otherwise, if you do this with embryonic stem \ncells and implant them and the genetic type doesn't match up with that \nof the body, you are going to have to have immunosuppressants being \nused all your life. Is it likely we are going to continue that route? \nNo. We are obviously going to have to do human cloning, develop young \nhuman clones that genetically match the individual being treated. You \nare going to have to harvest thousands, if not millions, or hundreds of \nthousands of women's eggs to get the human eggs to develop the clones.\n  Do we want to go there with women? You are probably going to have to \nincentivize and pay women in poorer countries to get the human eggs to \ndevelop the clones that genetically match so you can implant them. This \nleads down several paths we don't want to go. So why would we start \ndown there if we don't want to go there and we have an ethical route in \nwhich to go?\n  I plead with my colleagues that we don't need to do this. We don't \nneed to jump over this ethical divide, and we don't need to ignore this \ndefinition. We don't need to create a legal fiction that, yes, it is \nalive but it is not a life, which we are doing now with this \ndiscussion. We don't need to go back to the old debate of treating \nhuman life as property and that you can patent it and own it and \nmanipulate it, and treat it for your own purposes. We have been there \nbefore. We have always regretted\n\n[[Page S4336]]\n\nit. Why would we do that now? We don't need to go there. I say to my \ncolleagues, let's not go there. Let's go this route we can all agree \non. Let's do amniotic fluid banking. Let's do banking of those stem \ncells and create more treatments. Let's invest more heavily in the \nadult stem cell field so we can create and find those cures. Let's have \ntreatments done in the United States and not force people to travel \noverseas to get these treatments. We don't need to go there.\n  We don't need to get women into a position to pay them to harvest \ntheir eggs. We don't need to go down the route of human cloning, \ncreating life for our own purposes. We have done that before and have \ndeeply regretted it.\n  This is a turning point for us. I have no doubt how the vote will \ncome out today. It will be in favor of S. 5. I think that is \nregrettable. I believe the President when he says he is going to veto \nit. I hope he does. I will be strongly in support of him doing that. \nInstead of having a culture that looks at using life, let's have a \nculture that values life, that sees every life as dignified, beautiful, \nsacred, a child of a loving God, not to be used for other purposes but \nhas dignity because of who it is, because of the beauty of who it is. \nWhat is wrong with that? Let's find cures, and we can do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Will the Chair advise us of how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia controls 14 minutes. \nThe Senator from Iowa controls 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois will speak next \nand he told me he needed extra time. In the spirit of cooperation, I \nwill be glad to yield 5 of our minutes to the Senator from Illinois so \nhe will have 11 minutes, and then I will conclude. Is that fair?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. We will yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. You have 6 minutes left. I am giving him 5 and I will \ntake a closing. Is that fair?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That sounds good to me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia for his \ngracious gesture. I also thank my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, \nalong with Senator Specter, for introducing this bill on stem cell \nresearch.\n  Some important things have been said on the Senate floor today. \nSenator Smith of Oregon made an exceptionally moving statement on this \nissue. I thank him for sharing his views. This is a tough issue. It is \nnot easy. I totally respect those who see it differently than I do, \nincluding the Senator from Kansas. They are trying to apply to this \nimportant political debate their own conscience. That is an important \nthing in this business, that we bring our conscience to the Senate \nChamber. I know, as most people do, that as we meet and debate this \nissue on the floor of the Senate, the lives of Americans continue. All \nacross America, in sterile laboratories, there are doctors and \nscientists at work today trying to help loving couples create human \nlife. These are men and women, husbands and wives, who want a child \nand, because of some physical problem, they cannot conceive. So they \nspend enormous sums of money--thousands of dollars--on the chance that \nin a little glass dish in a laboratory life can be created that will \nend up being the child they will love for the rest of their lives. It \nis a beautiful story of love that is repeated every day in America in \nthese laboratories. I have a friend who recently had a baby girl--2 \nweeks ago. Eight days after she was born, I was giving her a bottle. I \nthought I had lost all those talents, but they came back to me. My wife \nwas admiring her and telling the mom how proud we were. She talked \nabout going through this process and how when they went into this \nlaboratory and looked at all of the possible embryos that could lead to \nthe birth of the child, they picked the healthiest and strongest ones, \nnaturally.\n  But other embryos were not chosen. What happens to those? At the end \nof the day, what happens to those that are not chosen to end up \nbecoming a baby? They are thrown away, discarded. Now, Senator \nBrownback has referred to these as ``nascent'' human life, young human \nbeings. I see this a little differently. I cannot understand how we can \ncondone legally a process that will end up at the end of the day with \nthese embryonic stem cells being thrown away and discarded, when we \nknow if those same stem cells that are about to be thrown away are \ngiven, under appropriate guidelines, with strong ethical standards, to \nlaboratories, they could lead to cures for serious illnesses. Is it \nbetter morally to throw them away or is it better morally to use them \nin a positive way to enrich and save human life? That is what this \ndebate comes down to, as far as I am concerned.\n\n  I have many friends and there isn't a family in America that hasn't \nbeen touched by Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, spinal cord injuries, ALS, or \ndiabetes. We all know the stories. That is part of American family life \ntoday. When you are a parent of a child who suffers from one of these \nillnesses or diseases, the first thing you want to know is: Doctor, \nwhat can be done? Is there a cure? Is there a place I can take my \ndaughter to where they are going do surgery or a procedure--something--\nto save her from this disease? That is the first question a parent \nasks.\n  Because President Bush decided over 4 years ago to close down Federal \nfunding in this area of research, it limits the opportunity to find \nthose cures. The President has said he is asserting his moral belief, \nhis ethical position on this issue. Well, everybody brings their moral \nand ethical positions to these issues, but you have to ask the larger \nquestion: Is it right for the President to impose on all of the \nfamilies in America who are afflicted with diseases his moral and \nethical views?\n  I think what Senator Harkin has done is more reasonable. He has said \nwe will have strong ethical guidelines for this kind of research. No \none is going to make a dollar off this. You cannot direct this research \ntoward any person. This is strictly scientific, closely guarded, with \nstrong ethical guidelines. Senator Isakson has come up with an \napproach, too, to use a different form of these cells. I also applaud \nhis approach. Let us try everything we can ethically find that moves us \nforward toward finding cures. That is what this should be about. If you \nbelieve the embryos not used in in vitro fertilization are human life, \nas described here, I think you have a moral obligation to outlaw in \nvitro fertilization because, frankly, at the end of the day these \n``nascent'' human lives will be destroyed. We know that. But you have \nnot heard that suggestion. Those opposing stem cell research are not \nopposing in vitro fertilization; they say go forward with that, knowing \nthe choice would be made to discard the stem cells rather than use them \nfor medical research. I don't follow that logic. I think it is morally \nconsistent for them to oppose embryonic stem cell research and prohibit \nin vitro fertilization. But they have not gone that far.\n  We have tough choices ahead of us in this bill. I think they are \nobvious choices. We understand what Senators Harkin and Specter have \ndone. They open the door for funding Federal research in this area. I \nam glad the Governor of Illinois found money to initiate this research \nin Illinois. California and many other States are also doing this. Why \nare we doing it State by State, not as a national Government, as we do \nall medical research? The President doesn't view this the same as other \npeople. He used his veto pen once as President and that was to veto \nstem cell research. I think that is inappropriate.\n  As I get into this debate, I think about a lot of people I have met \nwho are victims of multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, ALS, cancer, and \nspinal cord injuries. I think about visiting the Heinz VA Hospital \nyesterday and seeing a quadriplegic who has been bedridden since the \nKorean war. Imagine that, if you will. I think about those who have \nsuffered spinal cord injuries who want the chance, the possibility, \nthat this research will allow them to lead a more complete and full \nlife. I also think of my colleague from the House of Representatives, \nLane Evans. He came to Congress in 1982 as a wonderful, great young \nman, a Marine Corps veteran of the Vietnam era. He had to give up his \ncongressional career last year because of Parkinson's. It got\n\n[[Page S4337]]\n\nto the point where he could not continue his official duties. He used \nto come to the floor and beg for this bill to pass so others suffering \nfrom Parkinson's would have a chance.\n  I dedicate my vote in support of this bill in support of Lane Evans, \nthe veterans, and so many others who are counting on us to move this \nresearch forward. Dr. Elias Zerhouni, the Director of the NIH, stated \nour Nation would be better served if federally funded scientists had \naccess to embryonic stem cells for research. He separated himself from \nthe Bush administration's official position. He said:\n\n       It is not possible for me to know how we can continue the \n     momentum of science and research with the stem cell lines we \n     have at NIH that can't be funded. From my standpoint as \n     director of the NIH, it is in the best interest of our \n     scientists, our science, and our country that we find ways \n     and the nation finds a way to go full speed across adult and \n     embryonic stem cells equally.\n\n  I am not going to argue against research using cord blood, adult stem \ncells, the type of stem cells described by Senator Isakson in his bill. \nBut I think we have a moral obligation to the men and women who are \ncounting on us to open this research to find cures. This is our chance, \nwith passage of this bill.\n  I will vote in favor of both S. 5, the Harkin bill, and S. 30, the \nIsakson bill, to support all ways of deriving stem cells in a positive \nway to save lives. If you are in favor of human life and making it \nbetter, this is your chance. What matters most in this debate is that \nwe aim to make good on the promises we vowed to keep. Let's support the \nresearch that can lessen so much pain for so many and support S. 5.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I will be brief. I will take a portion of \nthe remainder of our time and yield back the rest. I compliment Senator \nDurbin on his excellent remarks. Referring back to Senator Dorgan's and \nSenator Smith's speeches and so many other speeches, I think this has \nbeen a terrific debate.\n  I compliment the Senator from Iowa tremendously. We all gained a \ngreat deal of education. I think, with rare exception, we have seen \nexhibited a passion to further embryonic stem cell research. The \nquestions are not if that is what we should do but how we go about \ndoing it.\n  What I have tried to do, and Senator Harkin and I had a great \nexchange last night when we educated one another on our positions, but \nwhat I tried to do is open a door that already existed, a door that \nbrought about 5 of the 21 embryonic stem cell lines that are currently \nunder NIH approval. But as Senator Harkin and others have stated, those \nlines have now been experimented on for 5\\1/2\\ years, using mice, they \nhave developed pollution or less-than-quality lines. It is time for us \nto find a way to further the science, to reach out for those \ndiscoveries and do so. S. 30, which I am here to advocate for, affords \nthat opportunity because it allows the NIH to invest future funds in \nembryonic stem cell research on embryos derived from Level III Gardner \nprinciple remainders and in vitro fertilization, arrested embryos, as \nthey are referred to in some cases, dead embryos as referred to in \nother cases, but in all cases embryos that are no longer going to \nbecome a life but do generate and contain pluripotent embryonic stem \ncells.\n  In the end, I feel that approach satisfies the questions raised at \nthe White House and affords us an opportunity of a bill that will be \nsigned by the President and does what everybody on this floor supports, \nwith rare exception, I believe, or maybe no exception once done, and \nthat is the expansion and the extension of the research.\n  I end where I began with my remarks a minute ago. I compliment \nSenator Harkin and others who have spoken and the advocacy that has \nbeen here today and the level and quality of this debate on this \nsubject. I look forward to this afternoon and the remaining 3 hours as \nwe lead up to the votes.\n  I guess I would say the same thing the Senator from Iowa would say. \nIf any Members want to speak this afternoon, it is time to let us know \nnow rather than later because we will have 3 hours equally divided \nbetween four different groups.\n  With that said, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I believe under the previous agreement I have 30 \nminutes at this time, may I inquire of the Chair?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Approximately 30 minutes--44 \nminutes, the Senator has.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I want to introduce to the body, into the discussion, \na gentleman I had a chance to meet who came in front of a Senate \nCommerce, Science and Transportation Subcommittee--Keone Penn. I have a \npicture of this young man here. I want to share his story. He was cured \nof sickle cell anemia. We use that term advisedly, but clearly, cured \nof sickle cell anemia through cord blood adult stem cell treatment--\ncured.\n  I want to do part of this to encourage other people out there who \nmight by chance be listening or know somebody else who has sickle cell \nanemia who has not yet been able to get treated; to talk about cures \nusing cord blood. We have cord blood banking. That is taking place. \nCord blood is the blood between the mother and the child when the child \nis in the womb, and the use of it, which we have now banked--10,000 \nunits roughly have been banked and used throughout the country for many \ntypes of illnesses and sicknesses. I want to talk about curing sickle \ncell anemia in some cases using cord blood.\n  Sickle cell anemia is a disease that afflicts more than 70,000 \nAmericans and a disproportionate number of African Americans. Keone \ntells the story the best so I will just highlight what he stated in \nfront of a Senate science subcommittee hearing that I chaired. He said:\n\n       My name is Keone Penn. Two days ago I turned 17 years old. \n     Five years ago they said I wouldn't live to be 17. They said \n     I'd be dead within 5 years.\n\n[[Page S4338]]\n\n       I was born with sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell is a very \n     bad disease. I had a stroke when I was 5 years old. Things \n     got even worse after that. My life has been full of pain, \n     crises, blood transfusions every 2 weeks, and more times in \n     the hospital than I can count.\n       The year before I had my stem cell transplant I was in the \n     hospital 13 times. I never was able to have a normal life. My \n     stem cell transplant was not easy, but I thank God that I'm \n     still here. I will graduate from high school and I want to \n     become a chef because I love to cook. I think I'm pretty good \n     at it.\n       Sickle cell is now a part of my past. One year after my \n     transplant I was pronounced cured. Stem cells saved my life.\n\n  Many have heard of Keone's amazing story on previous occasions, and \nthe effectiveness of cord blood stem cell research for such diseases \nrightly gives hope to millions.\n  Keone's story is yet another of a great litany of adult stem cell \nsuccesses.\n  I want to focus now on the cord blood stem cell successes and why we \nshould not be directing research dollars down other paths, such as \nembryonic stem cell and human cloning that have not produced these \nsorts of cures or these sorts of treatments, when we could do a lot \nmore with treatments in the cord blood field.\n  As I noted, we started a cord blood banking program. We now have cord \nblood banking taking place in several places. I hope people are doing \nmore of this across the country. As I stated, we have distributed \nnearly 10,000 units of this to get to matches in various places, in \nvarious individuals across the country. We need more cord blood donated \nbecause you have to match a series of six factors and at least four of \nthose factors must match to be able to use the cord blood in a \nparticular individual such as Keone. Therefore, you need to have a \nbroad cross-section of cord blood in the banking supply so people can \npossibly find a match.\n  In many places it has been used as a substitute for bone marrow and \nthe difficult collection process that takes place sometimes with \nmarrow. We need more in the cord blood field so we can get more people \ntreated like Keone Penn. I think that is a key avenue for us, in stem \ncell work, in producing the results.\n  Next step, the next field we need to go to is amniotic fluid. I want \nto show this to my colleagues. Some of them would have seen this issue. \nWe started a cord blood banking program to get this, so we could get \nmore matches across the country and could get a broader cross-section \nof individuals who have contributed from various types of blood so we \ncould get matches.\n  The next area we need to bank in, I believe, is amniotic fluid. The \nfluid that surrounds the child as the child is in the womb is also a \nrich source of stem cells. It would be my hope that in this year's \nappropriations bill we would not only study, I hope we will begin the \ncollection and funding of collecting amniotic fluid.\n  Now I urge my colleagues on all sides of this issue to say: Here is \nanother one we can agree upon in moving forward in the stem cell field. \nI wanted to cite to this, because it is an exciting breakthrough of \nnews.\n  This article appeared in JAMA, Journal of American Medical \nAssociation, February 28 of this year, on amniotic fluid. Amniotic \nfluid-derived stem cells can be coaxed to become muscle, bone, fat, \nblood vessels, nerves, and liver cells. It might be capable of \nrepairing damaged tissue resulting from conditions such as spinal cord \ninjuries, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke.\n  My reason for pointing this out is this is one we can agree upon. \nThis is one we can move forward with. The amniotic fluid is discarded \nafter the pregnancy, is not collected. It can be collected. It could be \ncollected. We should see about collecting this and move forward on \nthese treatments, and some of the $613 million we spent on embryonic \nstem cell research could go into this field, and likely you are going \nto be producing results very quickly. If the amniotic fluid some people \nare talking about, as well as the placenta, being able to collect stem \ncells from the placenta and other rich sources of stem cells--if we can \ntake some of this $613 million that has produced zero human clinical \ntrials to date and put it into fields that are producing or have a high \npotential here in a near-term basis to be able to produce treatments or \npossibly even cures--no ethical problem, no ethical issues; this would \nbe clearly a key one to go forward with.\n  I also want to further develop the thought about embryonic stem cells \nleading inevitably to human cloning. I want to put out some numbers on \nthis, follow with the discussion on this. People certainly will \nunderstand it. If we are to collect and develop additional embryonic \nstem cell lines, we get these embryos from IVF clinics around the \ncountry, and you start these lines, the genetic match will not take \nplace. That genetic material will not match anybody, because it is \nunique genetic material, so as soon as it is implanted into somebody \nelse, there is going to be a rejection by the body taking place. That \nindividual is going to have to be on immunosuppressive drugs for the \nremainder of their life, because the body is rejecting this foreign \nmaterial.\n  Therefore, the answer is to move forward, saying, well, okay, we have \ndeveloped this science, we can do human embryonic stem cell work, it \nworks, but we are getting the rejection taking place. Therefore, we are \ngoing to need to do human cloning, but it is not going to be real human \ncloning, it is going to be SCNT--somatic cell nuclear transfer, that is \nthe scientific name for human cloning--and we are not going to clone, \nbecause we will create the clone, we will harvest women's eggs, we will \nthen create the clone, and we are not going to allow the implementation \nof it. Therefore, we can say it is not cloning because it is not going \nto result in a full-scale child, by all definitions. We are going to \nclone a person, we are going to start human life, then we are going to \npurposefully kill it for its stem cells, that genetic match.\n  That is the process this will inevitably lead to if we are successful \nin this science that I believe highly doubtful, given the tumor \nformation. But let's say we are successful in the next couple of \ndecades, we can develop the science, the tumor issues somehow we are \nable to deal with, over that period of time, we get over that hurdle, \nwe can develop it.\n  We have an immunosuppressant problem, so therefore now we have got to \nmove into human cloning. Where do we get those human clones? We get \nthem from people. We have to have an egg we get from women. We will get \nthe genetic material from the person who needs the embryonic stem \ncells; that is not a problem. But we are going to have to harvest a lot \nof eggs.\n  I want to go through some of those numbers from different individuals \nwho have looked and thought about this. I would hope my colleagues, \neven if they are on the other side of this, would think about where \ndoes this take us, which is a real question about the idea of doing \nmassive amounts of human cloning, massive amounts of harvesting of \nwomen's eggs to do human cloning that is going to take place. Because \nyou do not get a one-for-one match, you get the one human egg, you are \nnot going to get it to necessarily take as a human clone, it is going \nto take a number of attempts to take place--I believe the numbers I \nhave heard are somewhere around 200 eggs are necessary to get one clone \nto take.\n  Now, maybe we are able to develop that technology better into the \nfuture. But if we develop this line, you are probably going to look at \nthe need for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of embryos needed \nto pursue this speculative embryonic stem cell research. And for this \napplication, you are going to need millions of eggs and millions of \nhuman clones--excuse me, I cannot call them clones--SCNT products, that \nis the scientific name for human clones, SCNT clones. These embryos are \ngoing to have to be developed that way to obtain sufficient embryos for \nthis speculative research science, that will turn to human cloning, \nwhich will exploit women for their eggs, because where are we going to \nget hundreds of thousands of eggs? Are we going to have women in this \ncountry be willing to voluntarily go through the process, a difficult \nprocess? It can be damaging to their bodies.\n  Maybe we will get some to do that. Probably more likely we will be \ngoing abroad to recruit people to give eggs. It is unlikely they will \ngive them, it is more likely they will be paid for those eggs to take \nplace, and to go through this difficult, painful, and potentially \nharmful problem.\n  Is that the route we want to go, or would we be wiser to work with \namniotic fluid, the cord blood, the placenta collection that is taking \nplace,\n\n[[Page S4339]]\n\nand take some of this money and develop that field? I think the route \nforward is pretty clear.\n\n  I also want to discuss the idea we were talking about, a disposable \nmedical infrastructure, the frozen embryos. I want to put back up a \nchart of one of those embryos we have here, and talk about this from a \nstandpoint. I ask my colleagues to think about this for a second.\n  I believe everybody is wrestling with the notion that the human \nembryo is alive. We all agree it is alive. Some of us will give it the \nstatus of a life; others would not. Others would call it a potential \nfor human life. I do not believe that is the scientific term, but some \nwould call it a potential for human life.\n  It is a human embryo. Here is a picture of a human embryo. That is \nactually a child who was adopted as a frozen embryo and implanted and \ngrew. This is, of course, what we are looking at as a physical entity. \nIt is human. It is in the human species. We know that. All of us are \nhaving some level of difficulty with using taxpayer funding to destroy \nthat young human life. Well, why are we having that level of difficulty \nwith destroying something that looks like this? I think it is because \nin our own being, and the natural law that resides in each of us, we \nbelieve in dignity for every human being, period. We believe everybody \nwho is here, who is listening or watching this, is a dignified person \nand worthy of respect and worthy of recognition as a person. That is \nwhy when we have people on death row and facing execution, we do not \nsay, let's go and harvest their organs. When we hear that term, we are \nappalled by it, because we are saying: That is wrong.\n  Well, why? Because the person is going to die. They were convicted of \na heinous crime. Why not harvest their body parts and save some lives? \nBecause we certainly could. That way we could save a number of lives by \nharvesting the organs of a person who committed a terrible crime. They \nare guilty. Despite the number of people having difficulty with the \ndeath penalty--and I have difficulty with the death penalty--why \nwouldn't we go ahead and harvest the organs? We are going to throw them \naway, right? We are going to dispose of them, right?\n  Well, but something within us says, that doesn't feel right; that \nseems as if that is the wrong thing to do. And it doesn't seem as if it \nis right because it is not the right thing to do. It violates their \nhuman dignity, that individual, even though they have committed that \ncrime, is a dignified human being and worthy still, even though they \nhave committed the heinous crime, is worthy of us treating them with \nsome level of respect, and not harvesting their organs. If they decide \nto voluntarily give them up, that is their choice, but they are worthy \nof that respect. So why, when we are looking at human life here, that \nall of us agree is human, alive, would we say: Well, callously, we can \nthrow them away because they do not look like us.\n  Well, the child at this stage starts to look like us, but it is \npretty small. You can say it doesn't look much like us. Can we do it at \nthat stage too? Then if we are uncomfortable with doing it in the early \nphase, or we are comfortable with doing it in an earlier phase, or when \nHannah is born, can we research on her then? She cannot do a whole lot \nat that point in time for herself. If we leave her by herself, she will \ndie. She can't care for herself at that point in time. So why not \nresearch on her at that point? Well, no, because she is a dignified \nhuman. So, okay, she is here. At what point? Here? Probably so. At that \npoint? Here?\n  Well, I don't think so. I agree she is human. I agree she is alive, \nbut I am not willing to give her any dignity status as a human.\n  What divides those? Some would say place, placement. If it is placed \nin a womb, it is. If it is not in the womb, it is not. Location has not \ndetermined personhood in our past. I would suggest it doesn't determine \nit in our future or presently. There is a natural revulsion toward this \nidea that we would take life from somebody for their body parts for \nsomebody else, and here we are having difficulty saying, well, yes, but \nthe possibilities are so promising we are going to go ahead and do it \nanyway.\n  I quarrel with the possibilities being that promising, and I have \ngone through this at length with my colleagues and discussed that. Even \nif it were, what about the human dignity of each of us? When we have an \nalternative that is working, and when we have more possibilities we can \nfund in the amniotic fluid developing, and the placenta research, why \nnot go those avenues, where we are actually getting some possibilities, \nwe are actually getting people treated, and we have no ethical \nquestions, and we can go forward aggressively and happily about it?\n  I am pro-life and whole life. I believe life is sacred. I believe \nlife is sacred in the womb and I believe life is sacred wherever it is. \nI believe a child in Darfur is sacred, I believe that person even on \ndeath row is sacred, and should be treated with dignity. I believe the \nyoungest phase that people are is sacred and should be treated with \ndignity. I do not think we have to go there. And if we do go there, it \nleads down a path we do not want to follow in human cloning, and that \nwe should agree with as a society.\n  Mr. President, I want to also note to my colleagues we can spend a \nlot of time on this bill. I do not believe it is going to become law \nbecause of the divide in this country, because the President is going \nto veto it. We will see if there are votes to sustain that veto or to \noverride that veto. I do not think this is going to become law. So why \nwould not we then look at this as a chance for us to work together on \nareas that we know have high potential for cures and treatment and that \nunite us? There are plenty of things that divide us. There are clearly \nthings in areas that unite us, there are clearly future areas of things \nthat we can work on to unite us and to provide cures. Why would that \nnot be a better approach? Are we so locked into a division here that we \ncannot find a way forward? I would submit we can find a way forward, \nand that we can work on these topics and provide cures so none of us is \nthe poorer for it. We are moving forward. Unfortunately, too much of \nthe work is happening overseas in the adult stem cell work and our \npeople are not getting good access to it. I have cited several \nexamples--that should not be happening overseas; it should be readily \navailable here--of treatments that are developed here but are actually \nbeing practiced in places overseas because of either lack of interest \nor support that we would have here. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst S. 5. I urge my colleagues to work with me and others on \ndeveloping this promising field in amniotic fluid. I urge others to \nwork with me as we work in the areas of adult stem cell and cord blood \nthat are currently treating and curing people and that we can do more \nof that and we can do that together and happily together and unite our \ncountry on an important topic instead of constantly dividing.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, are we operating under a UC at the moment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are operating under consented \ntime. The Senator from Iowa controls 90 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have been authorized to yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in the previous Congress, the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives voted resoundingly to lift the President's \nburdensome restrictions on embryonic stem cell research. The President, \nhowever, used the first--and so far only--veto of his administration to \nreject this potentially life-giving research which is supported by a \nclear majority of the American people. We are here today to try again \nto give our scientists the tools they need as they work to cure some of \nthe most debilitating and dreaded diseases. We will not--and we should \nnot--yield until we remove the obstacles the President has put in their \nway.\n  This fight is critical, because embryonic stem cell research could \nhold the key to curing diseases that no other research could cure. As \nbest we know now, an embryonic stem cell is unique in nature. It alone \ncan develop into any other type of cell in the body. Embryonic stem \ncells--and embryonic stem cells alone--can become a nerve cell, a \nmuscle cell, or any of the more than\n\n[[Page S4340]]\n\n200 types of cells in the body. The promise of this unique ability is \nclear: If scientists could replace diseased cells with healthy cells \ncreated from embryonic stem cells, it could save an untold number of \nlives.\n  For example, Parkinson's disease is a motor system disorder that \nresults from a loss of brain cells that produce dopamine. Individuals \nwith Parkinson's disease often experience a trembling in the hands, \narms, or face, and impaired balance and coordination. As the disease \ndevelops, it can become difficult to walk, talk, and complete other \nbasic tasks. With research, scientists may be able to coax embryonic \nstem cells into becoming healthy neurons that produce the desperately-\nneeded dopamine. If those neurons can be successfully transplanted into \na patient with Parkinson's disease, that person could be cured.\n  The list of diseases that could benefit from stem cell research is \nlong--Alzheimer's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease, juvenile diabetes, \nspinal cord injuries, and many others. Stem cell research could offer \nthe millions of Americans suffering from these diseases not just hope \nbut cures.\n  Supporters of stem cell research understand that these breakthroughs \nwill not be easy or inevitable. But the President's policy makes them \nfar less likely. On August 21, 2001, President Bush issued an executive \norder that the Federal Government would only fund embryonic stem cell \nresearch on stem cell lines created before that date. ``Stem cell \nline'' is the name given to constantly-dividing cells that continue to \nbe derived from a single embryo.\n  Most independent experts estimated at the time of the President's \nexecutive order that about 80 stem cell lines--a woefully inadequate \namount--would be available for Federal research. Most of those lines \nwere later determined to be polluted and unusable, leaving only about \n20 stem cell lines available.\n  Last month, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. \nElias Zerhouni was asked during testimony before the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation whether ``scientists have a better chance of finding new \ncures [and] new interventions for diseases if the current restriction \non embryonic stem cell research were lifted.'' Dr. Zerhouni responded: \n``these cell lines will not be sufficient to do all the research we \nneed to do . . . these cell lines have exhibited instability from the \ngenetic standpoint and it's not possible for me to see how we can \ncontinue the momentum of science in stem cell research with the cell \nlines that we have currently at NIH that can be funded. It is clear \ntoday that American science would be better served and the nation would \nbe better served if we let our scientists have access to more cell \nlines.''\n  In issuing his executive order and in vetoing the bill we passed last \nyear, the President did not question the scientific possibilities of \nstem cell research. In fact, he said the opposite. He stated in 2001:\n\n       Scientists believe further research using stem cells offers \n     great promise that could help improve the lives of those who \n     suffer from many terrible diseases.\n\n  The President's objection is to using embryos for research. But the \nkey fact--and one that opponents refuse to deal with--is that any \nembryo not used for stem cell research is going to be destroyed anyway. \nThe embryos created by fertilization clinics that are not going to be \nused for implantation will be destroyed. Why not give them a life-\ngiving use then? No answer has been forthcoming from the President.\n  RAND Health conducted a study in 2003 that found there were \napproximately 400,000 embryos in storage in the United States and some \nof these embryos will never be used because parents either had a \nsuccessful pregnancy and no longer need them or because treatments were \nunsuccessful. In addition, the study found that only 2 percent of these \nembryos will be used to create pregnancies in unrelated mothers. Many \nwill be discarded.\n  Last year, the Detroit News editorialized against a Michigan law \nrestricting embryonic stem cell research and used words that apply \nequally well to the President's policy. The News wrote:\n\n       The justification for this law is to protect human embryos, \n     but the fact that fertility clinics can simply discard them \n     means that the research ban is pointless.\n\n  Sean Morrison, director of the University of Michigan's Center for \nStem Cell Biology and one of the country's leading stem cell \nresearchers, agrees. In an article in the Ann Arbor News last month, \nDr. Morrison stated:\n\n       The thing about that that's crazy is human embryos are \n     discarded all the time by fertility clinics . . .So it's \n     legal to throw them away, but it's not legal to use them to \n     try to help somebody.\n\n  Embryonic stem cell research is truly a life-giving process because \nof the extraordinary potential for healing living, breathing human \nbeings, human beings with names and faces and families.\n  Members of the House of Representatives have now passed the \nbipartisan Stem Cell Research and Enhancement Act, H.R. 3. After we \ndebate the companion bill, S. 5, I hope we too will again adopt it and \nremove the President's arbitrary prohibition against funding stem cell \nresearch on embryos. It will pave the way for hundreds or thousands of \nadditional stem cell lines to be made available.\n  This bill has the strong support of the American Medical Association, \nthe Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research, the Association \nof American Universities, the Christopher Reeve Foundation, the \nJuvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the Leukemia and Lymphoma \nSociety, the Parkinson's Action Network, and more than 500 additional \norganizations. More importantly, it has the overwhelming support of the \nAmerican people. If the President again vetoes this bill, I hope \nCongress will override that veto.\n  As part of the unanimous consent agreement to consider this \nlegislation, we are considering an additional bill as well. Senators \nColeman and Isakson introduced a bill that promotes stem cell research \nlimited to those stem cells obtained from ``naturally dead'' embryos. \nThese embryos are called ``naturally dead'' because they are unable to \ndivide and reproduce like other embryos. While we should pursue all \ntypes of research, I do not believe we should limit stem cell research \nto stem cells that may be flawed, as indicated by their inability to \nreproduce and divide.\n  Embryonic stem cell research holds enormous promise for healing and \nsaving individuals who suffer from debilitating diseases and injuries. \nIt is our responsibility to pursue those cures and treatments in an \nethical manner. In order for our scientists to do quality research and \nmake advances in medicine, they must have access to embryonic stem \ncells that are uncontaminated and viable for research, especially since \nthey will otherwise be destroyed. S. 5 will allow our scientists to \nmove forward to a new generation of potentially life-saving cures. It \ndeserves the support of this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes from the time \nreserved on Senator Harkin's side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the Senator is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in favor of S. 5, the stem cell \nenhancement bill of 2007. Many of my colleagues have eloquently stated \nreasons for supporting this bill over the past 2 days. The passage of \nthis bill would be an important step forward for research into \ntreatments of devastating diseases. In addition, passing S. 5 will help \nthe United States as a leader in biomedical research, a leader in \ntransparent and ethical research practices, and a leader in developing \nsafe, effective treatments for diseases. I wish to see stem cell \ntherapies developed in this country so we can ensure the safety and \navailability of these treatments for American families and at the same \ntime create jobs for highly skilled workers to do the necessary \nresearch and to develop these new treatments.\n  Our current policy puts us at a severe disadvantage to other \ncountries. As the Director of the NIH said at a recent hearing, our \ncurrent stem cell policy is akin to working with one hand tied behind \nour backs. Scientists in most other countries are at an advantage to \nU.S. scientists because they are allowed to study the best stem cell \nlines and do so with government funding.\n  Let me explain this world stem cell policies map I have put up. It is \ncolor coded to show the different stem cell policies that exist in \ndifferent parts of\n\n[[Page S4341]]\n\nthe world. We have essentially chosen four colors or four categories of \npolicies I am trying to focus on. First, we have the countries in \nyellow which have not adopted stem cell policies. You can see those \ncountries are fairly extensive. Next to those are those that have \nadopted stem cell policies. The United States is part of that group. \nThose are the countries in gray on this world map. The United States is \namong the most restrictive of those countries that are in gray, but we \ndo have other countries that have policies that are in that category as \nwell.\n  Third are the countries in light brown which allow the creation of \nstem cell lines from leftover embryos in IVF clinics. We can see those \nlight-brown countries. Passing S. 5 would move the United States into \nthat group of countries, such as France and Canada and Brazil.\n  The final group depicted on this world map is those that are shaded \nin dark brown. These countries allow other laboratory techniques to be \nused to create embryonic stem cell lines. You will notice that many of \nthese countries have very strong scientific research programs. I \nparticularly mention the United Kingdom, India, and China as part of \nthat. Scientists in these countries, other than the United States, are \nfree to use the type of stem cells best suited to their research, \nwhether they are adult stem cells or embryonic stem cells created \nbefore 2001 or embryonic stem cells created after 2001. In fact, many \ncountries have been promoting stem cell research because they see this \nas an opportunity to get ahead in this field during a time when U.S. \nscientists are restricted to less useful stem cell lines.\n  For example, the United Kingdom has established a world stem cell \nbank to collect, characterize, and distribute embryonic stem cell lines \nto researchers around the world. The United Kingdom has also developed \na comprehensive national regulatory system that requires researchers to \nfollow strict ethical guidelines. While these regulations may slow \nresearch to some extent, embryonic research is an area that merits \nextra care and transparency and oversight. We should not relinquish our \nduty to uphold high ethical research standards to other countries or to \nindividual States within this country or to the market more generally.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Many other countries, including Singapore, Korea, and \nAustralia, also have federally funded centers for embryonic stem cells. \nHowever, it will be difficult for the United States to capitalize on \nthe research advances that are made in these other countries since \nfederally funded scientists in the United States are restricted from \ncollaborating with foreign scientists who use the stem cell lines that \nwere generated after 2001.\n  Furthermore, we can't leave this important field of science to the \nprivate sector alone. We have a long history of bipartisan support for \nbasic science research in this country precisely because it does not \nmake financial sense for industries to invest substantially in early-\nstage research. Any scientist will tell you that human embryonic stem \ncell research is still in its early stages, and that it has gone more \nslowly than it would have otherwise gone because of the restrictions \ncurrently in place in our own policy. Furthermore, most cell-based \ntherapies, including bone marrow stem cell transplants, were first \ndeveloped in academic research hospitals and have never been widely \nutilized. This means Federal funding is even more important for cell-\nbased therapies such as stem cell transplants than it is for other \ntypes of treatments.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support S. 5. It is an \nimportant step to keep the United States a world leader in the field of \nbiomedical research, and it will give hope to many of our citizens for \nthe treatments they desperately need.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak with some great \nurgency on the need to pass the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of \n2007, S. 5.\n  We must pass this bill because if we do not, the American people will \ncontinue to suffer, our brilliant researchers will be discouraged and \nthink about leaving the field of scientific research and, No. 3, we are \nalso outsourcing our intellectual capital because other research is \ngoing overseas.\n  We have to have a sense of urgency because stem cell research takes a \nlong time. We cannot have science on demand or scientists on demand. If \nwe do not act now, we are going to be discouraging very important \nresearch and wonderful young people from going into this field.\n  Every year we wait, we fall 3 years behind in our research--another \ntime where a patient might have been saved, a family might not have had \nto watch a loved one suffer, and also where we would not have to watch \nour great ideas going somewhere else.\n  Stem cell research is very important to the American people. It is \nvery important to Maryland. It is very important to me. I am a firm, \nclear, unabashed supporter of expanded stem cell research and, at the \nsame time, that this research be conducted under the strictest \nbioethical standards. That is why I like S. 5. This legislation is \nbased on sound cellular biology science and also good, sound ethical \nprinciples.\n  This legislation is so important not because legislation is important \nbut because it opens more opportunity to do stem cell research. What \ndoes that mean? It means that currently the existing law under \nPresident Bush restricts stem cell research to adult cells, to some \nvague 21 lines that are becoming tired and toxic. But under our \nlegislation, it would open it up to embryonic stem cell research where \nembryos are garnered that are discarded in in vitro processes in which \nthe donors themselves have to make that informed choice.\n  What does this do, though? Well, I will tell you, stem cell research \nis the kind of research that could find a cure for Parkinson's disease, \ndiabetes, diseases of the brain and the immune system, multiple \nsclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Imagine if scientists could find a \ncure for Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, or if they cannot find a cure, to \nbe able to regenerate new kinds of brain cells to give people a \ncognitive or functioning stretchout. Think about the impact on \nfamilies, but also think about the impact on our nursing home budget.\n  Think about research in juvenile diabetes, type 1 diabetes, where \nlittle children, every day--whether they are 5 or 9 or 11--have to be \ntesting their blood sugar. They cannot eat the way other kids do. They \nhave to watch how they pace themselves when they play ball or do other \nthings so they do not induce hypoglycemia. As they get older and their \ncells get even more tired, they fear they could lose a kidney or lose \ntheir eyesight.\n  If we could find more breakthroughs in juvenile diabetes, we would \ngive them their childhood back. We would give them a life that has a \nfuture full of promise. That is why we are fighting here. It is not \nabout ideology. It is not about party. It is about our American people. \nAnd what we invent here could help save lives everywhere.\n  Yesterday, I went to Johns Hopkins University to discuss this stem \ncell research. I wanted to be sure I was on the right track: sound \nscience, good, solid ethical frameworks. I said to the scientists: Tell \nme what you are doing and tell me what impedes you now working under \nthe Bush framework?\n  Well, they gave me an earful. First, it is inspirational--\ninspirational--in what they are doing in pediatric leukemia, in \njuvenile diabetes, in multiple sclerosis. Also, to give an example, in \ntalking to Dr. Doug Kerr, he is working now through stem cells--yes, it \nis with paralyzed rats--to not only regenerate the spinal cord but to \nhave those cells connect to muscle so not only for whether you are \nregenerating spinal cords that have been injured or severed, but also \nto connect the muscle so you could walk again. That was the dream of \nChristopher Reeve. But that is the dream of every paraplegic right \nnow--whether it has come from a diving accident, if you are an athlete, \nor whether you have been injured in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  Don't we want Dr. Kerr to do what he is doing now and to be able to \nextend that? But they do not get the clinical\n\n[[Page S4342]]\n\ntrials because they are restricted in the types of cells they can use.\n  So we saw a cornucopia, again, of opportunity there. But I said to \nthe docs at Hopkins: Why can't we do this with private or State funds? \nThey said: Senator Mikulski, you have to have a national framework. \nFirst, that is where you get your bioethical guidelines. It is done not \nwhile there is one set of guidelines for States that can afford \nresearch and that there is another set of guidelines for those States \nthat can't. Also, there is not enough in private philanthropic funds to \nbe able to do this.\n\n  Private funds function like venture capital. But at the same time, \nwhat happens with States? Maryland is now in a bidding war with our $25 \nmillion against California. We have scientists who are leaving Maryland \nto go to California. Hats off to them. But also, then, we have \nscientists in Maryland and California who are leaving the country \nbecause they can do work in Sweden or Singapore that they cannot do in \ntheir own country. These are American scientists who want to do their \nown work in their own country. But we are driving them out with our \nnarrow-minded ideological sense of politicizing science.\n  So we cannot do this with State funds, and we cannot do it with \nprivate funds. As I said, right now we are outsourcing this to China, \nto Singapore, to Australia, to Germany. I am not saying there are good \ncountries or not good countries, but what are we doing? We are losing \nour intellectual capital. We are also losing our young scientists.\n  Yesterday, I talked to a young doctor. I knew him as a resident. His \nwife was a friend of a friend of mine. I knew him through his \nresidency. Now he is a young doctor, married, with three children. His \nwhole field is diabetes. He is so eager to do this juvenile diabetic \nresearch. He has already started it. He is already good at it. Gosh, \nmaybe he could win the Nobel prize one day. But guess what. There is \nnot the money for the young scientist. Also, with the very shackling of \nwhat goes on now in these so-called Bush lines, with these ideological \nguidelines, they cannot do the research. He has to think hard about \nwhether he wants to continue his life dream of finding a cure for \njuvenile diabetes.\n  You see, this man has devoted his life to getting ready to do this, \nand now his own Government is stopping him--not because he is not \nsmart, not because we do not have the will, but because we have too \nmuch ideology and too little money in the wallet.\n  We have a President who has given us a framework where research has \none hand behind its back. Scientists have been prohibited from doing \nnew stem cell research.\n  Six years ago, the President restricted Federal funds for embryonic \nstem cell research. What did it do? It created an unregulated \natmosphere. The result was federally funded stem cell research was \nhalted almost entirely. Stem cell research was done by private \nentities. A private entity has no Federal bioethical standards.\n  Mr. President, like you, I am a sunshine person. I believe you should \nhave research conducted in the sunshine. That is where you have \ncompliance with bioethical standards. That is why we need to have the \nkind of national framework where everybody goes by the same rules, at \nthe same time, in the same way. Without national standards, research \nwill be done by the well-heeled, outside of the public eye, with no \nnational scrutiny. This is where I fear dark and ghoulish things can \noccur.\n  I acknowledge the validity of some of the concerns raised by \ncolleagues. But as long as you shove it underground, as long as you \nshove it behind closed doors, then you are going to get either faulty \nresearch or very bad ethics.\n  I believe the legislation pending will remove the restrictions \nimposed by the President. It will provide the ethical and medical \nframework we need for federally funded stem cell research. It will \ncreate strong ethical guidelines. Most of all, it will ensure that we \nnow open the opportunity for even greater and more expanded stem cell \nresearch so scientists will now have access to new, fresh stem cell \nlines which they now do not.\n  What does it mean? Well, I can tell you what it means. It means for \nthe United States of America we have heard what the voters said in \nNovember. They said: Change the direction of the country. Change the \npriorities. Come back home, America. Remember what America is. We are \nthe land of the free, the home of the brave, and of discovery. Let's go \nfor it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for her \nvery eloquent statement and for her strong support of hope and health \nand healing, as encompassed in S. 5.\n  Mr. President, while I wait the arrival of our next speaker, I want \nto point out that time and time again I hear those who are opposed to \nS. 5 use the phrase that they are opposed to funds being used for the \ndestruction of embryos. Earlier today I had corrected one Senator who \nsaid that. I said: Show me in the bill where it is. Well, then other \nSenators--the Senator from Kansas and others--have gotten up and talked \nabout not using money for the destruction of embryos.\n  I challenge anyone, any Senator to come and take S. 5 and show me \nanywhere in there where there is one dime used for the destruction of \nembryos. It is not there. I get the feeling that a misrepresentation \nrepeated and repeated somehow seems to take hold so that people say: \nWell, there must be money for the destruction of embryos in this bill. \nThere is not. That is covered by the Dickey-Wicker amendment which \npertains to appropriations bills, and I am an appropriator, and that is \ncovered there. So none of this money is used for the destruction of an \nembryo. All it is used for is for the research on stem cells that have \nbeen derived, which is what is being done today, by the way--which are \nderived. Now, those derivations can come from private entities or State \nsponsored or wherever, maybe some international, maybe foreign \ncountries--wherever. But none of the money here in our bill, S. 5, can \nbe used for the destruction of an embryo, period. If anyone says so, \nplease come and show us where it is in the bill that says that.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Missouri is here. \nI yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on a matter of \nsignificant medical, scientific, and personal importance. Today, my \ncolleagues and I have the opportunity to support research which will \nresult in lifesaving cures, research which alleviates pain and \nsuffering, and research which improves the quality of life of millions \nof Americans. I am speaking about research which will provide some of \nthe most significant medical advances we have ever seen in the history \nof mankind.\n  Of course, I am speaking in the strongest support of S. 5, the Stem \nCell Research Enhancement Act. I thank my distinguished colleagues, \nSenators Harkin, Hatch, Kennedy, and Specter, for the leadership they \nhave offered on embryonic stem cell research legislation over the last \nseveral years.\n  In my short time in the Senate, I have had the occasion to speak and \nvote on numerous matters of significant national importance, but not \nevery day do we have the opportunity to vote to heal the sick. Today, \nwe have a chance to set aside partisan politics and support legislation \nthat aims to improve the quality of life for tens of millions of \nAmericans. It is a noble cause and one that reminds me of how proud I \nam to represent Missouri in the Senate.\n  Who would oppose such a cause, and what would their reasons be for \nsuch opposition? The opponents of embryonic stem cell research attack \nit on multiple fronts--public opinion, scientific fact, and moral \ngrounds--and the war against embryonic stem cell research is fought in \nour communities, in the media, and today in this Congress. \nUnfortunately, the casualties are the medical researchers and doctors \nwho want nothing more than to cure diseases. That is all they want. \nThey have no grand scheme. There is no big money here. We are talking \nabout curing diseases. Ultimately, the casualties are the patients who \nwould benefit from those cures.\n  My greatest disappointment in this debate has been the numerous \ninaccurate statements made in this Chamber by opponents of embryonic \nstem\n\n[[Page S4343]]\n\ncell research. Because this issue was on the ballot in Missouri last \nyear, I had the opportunity to learn a great deal about this field \nduring the months we campaigned for the U.S. Senate, as this issue was \ndebated in great detail across my State. Let me talk about a few of the \nmisrepresentations that have been made in this debate.\n  Claim: Adult stem cell research and stem cells derived from umbilical \ncord blood and amniotic fluid are adequate and we don't need embryonic \nstem cell research and there are 72 adult stem cell treatments for \nhuman diseases. The truth: In the medical journal Science, July of \n2006, Dr. William Neaves of the Stowers Institute for Medical Research \nin Kansas City and Dr. Steven Teitelbaum of Washington University \nMedical School in St. Louis detail that this false claim originates \nfrom David Prentice of the Family Research Council. Mr. Prentice \nasserts that there were over 1,000 ongoing clinical trials of adult \nstem cell therapies. A review of the record at the NIH Web site that \ntracks clinical trials, however, showed that Mr. Prentice grossly \nmisinterpreted the data. He searched the database for any entry \ncontaining the word ``stem'' and counted items such as ``brain stem,'' \n``system,'' and ``stem from,'' which is a verb. There were numerous \nother errors and omissions that served as the basis for this claim. In \nfact, there are only a handful of clinical trials with adult stem \ncells, and only nine conditions have adult stem cell treatments that \nare approved by the FDA.\n  In addition, as the Senator from Iowa so eloquently outlined \nyesterday, most scientists and patient advocacy groups agree that adult \nstem cell research is not a substitute for embryonic stem cell \nresearch. All research is good, but we cannot substitute an inferior \nform of research for the type of research that holds the most promise \nfor these elusive cures.\n  Many organs do not have adult stem cells, and adult stem cells and \ncord stem cells are not pluripotent. That means they don't have the \nability embryonic stem cells do to develop into any type of cell, and \ntherefore their use is limited.\n  Claim: Tumors are a necessary product of implanting embryonic stem \ncells. The truth: Tumors will only develop if undifferentiated stem \ncells are injected into mice. Undifferentiated cells are those which \nhave not developed into their final state. For example, a cell that has \nnot developed into its final state is a blood cell or a bone cell or a \nnerve cell. In fact, tumor formation is exactly how scientists \ndetermine that a cell is pluripotent--in other words, able to develop \ninto a multitude of different types of cells. However, nobody is \nsuggesting that undifferentiated stem cells be injected into humans. \nThe FDA has monitored this question, and there is no evidence that \ncells differentiated from embryonic stem cells cause tumors.\n  Claim: The 21 viable embryonic stem cell lines we have currently \nfunded are plenty. It is sufficient. The truth: As Dr. John Gearhart \ntold the Committee on Aging, the federally approved lines are not \ngenetically diverse, meaning we don't have the cell lines needed that \nwill allow us to fully utilize this vital research. Importantly, \nminorities are the greatest affected group due to the lack of genetic \ndiversity in these cell lines. In addition, many of the federally \napproved lines are contaminated with mouse feeder cells. Finally, some \nof these cell lines are involved in proprietary arguments and are not \navailable for research purposes. Asking America's scientists to work \nwith only 21 viable embryonic stem cell lines is hamstringing them and \nimpeding this important progress.\n\n  Claim: This legislation will use tax dollars to fund destruction of \nhuman embryos. The truth: Each year, Congress attaches the Dickey-\nWicker amendment to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill stating that no \nFederal funds can be used to destroy human embryos. That has not \nchanged. This bill simply allows Federal funds to be used to study stem \ncell lines that are derived from human embryos that otherwise would \nhave been discarded. How many times do we need to say it: ``that \notherwise would have been discarded.'' Not a dime of Federal money will \nfund the destruction of human embryos.\n  Claim: If embryonic stem cell research was such a promising field, it \nshould have produced hundreds of cures by now. Over 30 years of \nresearch into embryonic stem cells has proved fruitless. The truth: The \nfirst of human embryonic stem cells were not isolated until 1998, and \nresearch with embryonic stem cells was not awarded Federal funding \nuntil 2002. That was only 5 years ago. To put this in context, from the \nfirst research into a vaccine for polio, over 20 years passed before \ndoctors first developed the first effective polio vaccine. Hundreds of \nNobel laureates agree that embryonic stem cell research has great \npotential for developing cures, but this will take both funding and \ntime. The NIH has provided over half a billion dollars each year in \nFederal funding for stem cell research since fiscal year 2003, but only \na small fraction of those funds has gone to embryonic stem cell \nresearch.\n  Claim: There are inadequate ethical guidelines in S. 5. In fact, this \nproposed legislation has tougher ethical guidelines than those which \ncurrently exist. This legislation provides the ethical framework we \nneed for this legislation. This proposed legislation makes sure that, \nfirst, the only embryos that can be used are those which are created \nfor fertility treatments and which are in excess of the clinical need \nand would be discarded; second, there must be written, informed consent \nfrom the donors; third, donors can receive no financial reward for \ntheir donations.\n  These two facts are important to me as I listened to the \nmisinformation about the way we are going to subject women to egg-\nharvesting and this rampant practice of selling eggs on the open \nmarket. Both of those things are prohibited in this legislation. Donors \ncannot receive financial reward for their donations, and it has to be \nonly eggs that would otherwise be discarded.\n  Fourth, the Director of the National Institutes of Health must issue \nguidelines 60 days after the enactment of this legislation.\n  Finally, it is interesting to note that some of the 21 stem cell \nlines that are currently being used for embryonic stem cell research \nmight not even meet the strict guidelines that are contained in this \nlegislation.\n  Families all across America are using medical research to participate \nin the miracle of birth.\n  Fact: The process of using medical research to enhance the likelihood \nof pregnancy produces an excess of eggs. I have heard no claims to the \ncontrary because that is the fact.\n  Fact: Thousands of these eggs are going to be destroyed. I have heard \na lot of claims in this Chamber, but no one is arguing with a straight \nface that the process of producing eggs for in vitro fertilization does \nnot produce thousands of excess eggs.\n  Fact: Thousands of these eggs are going to be destroyed. It is just \nthat simple.\n  Here is the question. This is the question of the day: Is it better \nto use these eggs to save lives as opposed to throwing them away? It \nreally boils down to that. Ultimately, if some of our colleagues say it \nis wrong to use these eggs to save lives, then surely these same \ncolleagues must believe it is wrong to throw them away. Where is their \nlegislation outlawing their destruction? In other words, where is their \nlegislation outlawing in vitro fertilization? Because inherent in that \nprocess is the destruction of human embryos.\n  I come from Missouri, where we say what we think and we mean what we \nsay. Two of Missouri's finest and most respected leaders have spoken \nquite eloquently on the subject of embryonic stem cell research.\n  Senator John Danforth, a former Republican Member of this body, \nstrongly supported the stem cell initiative that was put successfully \nbefore voters in Missouri in 2006. An Episcopalian minister, Senator \nDanforth voted many times in this Chamber as a Senator who believed \nthat abortion should not be legal in this country. An Episcopalian \nminister, Senator Danforth has also worked through the moral and \nethical issues he had with embryonic stem cell research. When asked \nabout the equality of a multicelled embryo in a petri dish and the life \nof a human child suffering from a debilitating disease, he put it in \ncontext by asking simply: If a house were on fire and you had to make \nthe choice, would you rescue a petri dish or a 3-year-old child?\n\n[[Page S4344]]\n\n  Doctor William Neaves is the president of the Stowers Institute for \nMedical Research in Kansas City, one of the finest research \ninstitutions in the Nation. One of the most spiritual and thoughtful \nmen I have known, Dr. Neaves has studied the moral and ethical \nimplications of in vitro fertilization and stem cell research over the \nlast 25 years with his wife, who is also a bioethicist and an ordained \nMethodist minister. He struggled with his position on these issues due \nto his faith and upbringing, but in the end, upon reflection and \nstudying the Bible, he concluded that embryonic stem cell research is \nmorally and ethically acceptable.\n  I will close with Dr. Neaves' words:\n\n       Two elements have been pivotal in forming my belief. The \n     first is the biological fact that in normal human \n     reproduction, most blastocysts, or embryos, perish rather \n     than implant in the uterus. The second is Ecclesiastes 11:5 \n     in the English Standard Bible:\n       As you do not know the way the spirit comes to the bones in \n     the womb of a woman with child, so you do not know the work \n     of God who makes everything.\n       Many people of faith believe that research with embryonic \n     stem cells represents a perfectly moral means of fulfilling \n     the biblical mandate to heal the sick. Other people of faith \n     disagree. Should Federal policy disqualify a field of \n     research from competing for Federal funds because some \n     Christians object to it? As a Christian who supports this \n     research, I certainly hope not.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Missouri for a very eloquent and \npoignant statement. I know the Senator mentioned that recently she came \noff a campaign in Missouri. I know that, in listening to her statement, \nshe is reflecting the wishes and hopes of so many people in her own \nState who want to make sure we move ahead and find cures and \ntreatments. I thank her for her eloquence and for her forthright \nstatement on behalf of embryonic stem cell research.\n  Mr. President, I now yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the question \ncurrently before the Senate regarding whether to allow Federal funding \nfor embryonic stem cell research. Let me start out my remarks, first, \nby acknowledging Senator Harkin and the great work he has done in this \nfield. It is beyond a doubt that he is an expert on embryonic stem cell \nresearch, one of our national leading experts in terms of health care, \nand having been an advocate in that area, he is recognized across this \ncountry. I admire his work on this legislation, as well as the work \nthat has been put into this legislation by a number of colleagues, \nincluding many on the Republican side of the aisle who have joined this \nbipartisan coalition to make stem cell research a reality for the \npeople of America.\n  At the end of the day, S. 5 is about hope--about hope for over 1 \nmillion Americans who today suffer from the trembling caused by \nParkinson's disease. It is about hope for the over 1 million people in \nAmerica who suffer from Alzheimer's disease. It is about hope for the \n17 million Americans who suffer from diabetes, including the hope that \nwe should be giving to those young people who are suffering from \njuvenile diabetes and have to look at a life of dealing with the \ndifficulties of that illness. It is about hope for the more than 64 \nmillion Americans who today suffer from one or more forms of heart \ndisease. So the debate on the floor today is, in fact, about the hope \nand aspirations of all Americans, including people, many of whom are \nrelated to Members in this Chamber today.\n  Scientists in America agree that, without a doubt, embryonic stem \ncell research holds great potential for curing these and other \ndiseases. It is remarkable that against the conclusive determination of \nthe scientific community, we have the Federal Government in a position \nwhere it is actively withholding the financial support that is needed \nto carry on this very important research for America. That is not the \nAmerican way. The American way is to open new doors of hope. We ought \nto be opening new doors of hope as well with the passage of this \nlegislation later today.\n  The reason that scientists are so excited about the potential of \nembryonic stem cell research--and the reason that this kind of research \nmay hold the cure for a whole host of diseases--is that embryonic stem \ncells have the potential to become virtually any kind of cell in the \nhuman body, such as brain cells, heart cells, or cells that produce \ninsulin.\n  The difficult part of embryonic stem cell research for scientists is \ncontrolling the process by which embryonic stem cells become other, \nmore specialized kinds of cells. Much more research into that process \nis needed. To quote a document prepared by the National Institutes of \nHealth, ``the promise of stem cell therapies is an exciting one, but \nsignificant technical hurdles remain that will only be overcome through \nyears of intensive research.''\n  The Federal funding this legislation authorizes will provide a \ncritical boost to that effort.\n  Mr. President, like millions of other American families, my family \nhas been touched by the ache of loss brought about by Alzheimer's \ndisease. My father died of complications related to the disease only a \nfew years ago. At the end of his life, I wanted nothing more than to be \nable to help ease his suffering. Now, as I reflect on that difficult \ntime, I think of the families that are currently enduring the same pain \nmine did, and I want to help them.\n  I trust the vast majority of the scientific community that believes \nembryonic stem cell research may hold the key to the cures these \nfamilies are seeking. I also believe that our Government can work to \npromote this science responsibly by paving the way for treatments that \nwill save millions of lives without destroying others.\n  Toward that end, I believe the legislation passed by Congress last \nyear and before the Senate today represents a measured, responsible \nstep toward tapping into the vast potential that embryonic stem cell \nresearch has with respect to finding cures for Alzheimer's, \nParkinson's, diabetes and a wide range of other devastating diseases.\n  In millions of cases, this legislation could mean the difference \nbetween a normal life and one of pain and suffering. In millions of \nother cases, it could mean the difference between life and death. And \nby authorizing Federal funding only for research on embryonic stem \ncells that will never become human life and that are donated willingly, \nit achieves its objectives without destroying the potential for life.\n  To be sure, support from private funds for this research has been \nwelcome. But it is simply not enough. I have heard from scores of \nscientists in my home State of Colorado--working in university labs as \nwe speak, trying to find cures for our most devastating diseases--who \ntell me that the Federal funding this legislation would authorize would \nboost their capabilities exponentially.\n  In addition to the practical impact on American laboratories, \nhowever, there is something else to consider. I can think of no other \nNation that should lead this research with strict guidelines than the \nUnited States.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, America has been the leader in \nmaking monumental scientific strides that have made life easier and \nbetter for people in our country and all over the world. In a field \nwith such great promise, and at a time where American competitiveness \nis at the forefront of the Congressional agenda, I believe we must once \nagain be the global leader.\n  Mr. President, I want to be clear that I also believe we should \npromote alternative methods of creating embryonic stem cells. For that \nreason, I strongly support the other proposal that is currently before \nthe Senate, S. 30, which would intensify research into these \nalternative methods.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 37 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield until 3:45 to the Senator from New York, Senator \nSchumer.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I rise in strong and profound \npraise of my colleague from Iowa. He has led this fight dauntlessly, \nalways being both dogged and smart. That is why we are where we are \ntoday.\n  I rise in support of S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. \nToday, as we stand on the brink of scientific breakthroughs, we cannot \nlet politics pull us backward. A modern nation\n\n[[Page S4345]]\n\nloses its greatness, its preeminence, when it turns its back on \nscience. That is what history has shown.\n  Stem cell research is the key to hope for 100 million Americans and \ntheir families who suffer from debilitating diseases. Talk about it any \nway you want, spin it any way you want, talk about all these \nalternatives; the bottom line is very simple: A ``no'' vote is a vote \nagainst science, a vote against the millions who are anxiously awaiting \na cure for diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, spinal cord injuries and \nother diseases and injuries.\n  Unfortunately, we all know someone with a disease such as diabetes, \nheart disease, Parkinson's, ALS or cancer who could benefit from \nembryonic stem cell research. Every one of us has looked into the eyes \nof somebody who needs help--in my case, a young mother with a little \ngirl about 5 years old who had juvenile diabetes who said: Senator, the \ndoctors tell me the odds are high that my child could be blind at age \n20 if we don't do embryonic stem cell research. How can we say no to \nthat mother and to that child? Scientists are on the cusp of making \nincredible progress through stem cell research, a process that has the \npotential to cure diseases that have been with us for centuries, such \nas diabetes and heart disease.\n  When their progress was stalled in 2001 when President Bush limited \nfederally funded stem cell research to only 19 sources that are truly \nviable, every family who had hope was set back. With that Executive \norder, the President shut the door on hope for all those families.\n  With that one action, the President not only stopped current research \nin its tracks, he sent a message to future scientists that they should \nnot pursue this line of work.\n  As they see a limited funding stream for the work they do, fewer and \nfewer graduates are specializing in this type of research, and those \nwho are deeply committed to it tend to go overseas. That is not a great \nAmerica--an America that turns its back on science and puts politics in \nits place. We want all the best minds in the country to be working \ntogether to find a cure for these debilitating diseases.\n  S. 5 would answer the prayers of millions of families. It would \nincrease the number of stem cell lines that can be used by researchers \nwho are funded by Federal grants.\n  These stem cell lines are not made from new embryos that would be \ncreated for the purpose of research. They would not be harvested from \nwomen, like some people think. These lines would be made from leftover \nembryos created by couples who were trying to conceive through in vitro \nfertilization but are not used and are going to be destroyed. With \npassage of this bill, those embryos could contribute to critical \nresearch instead of being thrown away.\n  Let's think about the good that having these new stem cells could do \nby looking at juvenile diabetes. As many as 3 million Americans have \nType I diabetes, with over 13,000 children newly diagnosed each year. \nThese children must be injected with insulin multiple times each day \nand prick their fingers to test their blood sugar as many as six times \na day.\n  That doesn't have to be the reality forever. Researchers have already \ndemonstrated they can produce insulin-producing cells from \nundifferentiated embryonic stem cells. This has the real potential to \ndevelop a cure for juvenile diabetes, providing relief to the 3 million \nAmericans and their families who are burdened with the implications of \nthe disease every day.\n  Without being able to use Federal funding for their research, \ninnovative stem cell research is being relegated more and more to only \nthose individuals and institutions that can afford it.\n  Because NIH-funded research activities have to be housed in different \nbuildings from stem cell research labs, which has created enormous \nheadaches and financial barriers for researchers in my State of New \nYork and has hampered both research on stem cells and research using \nother methods, unless we vote yes on S. 5, we are not going to make \nprogress.\n  This bill would provide enormous hope to growing numbers of \nAmericans. It would accelerate the movement toward a cure for \ndevastating diseases, while strengthening the rules on ethics that must \nbe involved in this research. This is one of those issues that hits \nhome more than anything else. Everyone knows a mother with Alzheimer's \nor a neighbor with diabetes. They are gut-wrenching situations.\n  What is most heartbreaking is to think the President's first veto was \nto stop us from alleviating all this terrible pain. I urge my \ncolleagues to look into the eyes of a young child with juvenile \ndiabetes, look into the eyes of a middle-aged couple who has a parent \nsuffering from Alzheimer's. Don't say no to them.\n  I yield the floor, and I yield the remainder of my time back to the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, throughout the history of our Nation, \ngenerations of American scientists have looked for ways to improve the \nhuman condition and address the problem of disease and the afflictions \nof old age. Working in labs either spartan or spacious, they have \ntoiled together over the years to find cures for the health conditions \nthat continue to plague mankind.\n  As they conducted their research, each scientist's work built on the \ndiscoveries that preceded it, and the results they achieved over the \nyears have enabled us to live longer, healthier, more productive lives. \nThe list of medical miracles and marvels that have come from their work \nhas made the phrase ``American ingenuity'' known around the world for \nthe creativity it represents and the results it has so often provided.\n  From time to time, however, there is a breakthrough--or possible \nbreakthrough--in medical science that has the potential to \nrevolutionize not only our ability to diagnose or treat an affliction \nbut our basic understanding of how the human body operates. When that \noccurs, a debate ensues as society attempts to evaluate the new \nprocedure's potential to address the diseases that threaten our health \nas well as the ethics of putting the new procedures into practice.\n  Such a possible breakthrough is stem cell research. At present, its \npromise and potential for changing the way we view health and disease \nseems limitless. In theory, stem cells may be capable of doing \neverything we can possibly imagine--and more. Unfortunately, there is \noften a wide gap between what is possible in theory and what is \npractical and possible in the real world. What the future of stem cells \nwill be no one knows for certain. Still, the possibilities are more \nthan intriguing and certainly worth an in-depth look.\n  The research that has been conducted into stem cells so far has been \nso exciting because of the very nature of these cells. Stem cells have \nthe capacity to renew themselves and then become specialized cells. \nMost of the cells that are in the body are created and committed to \nperforming a specific function. A stem cell remains ``on the fence,'' \nhowever, uncommitted until it is given a signal by the body to develop \ninto a specialized cell.\n  That ability to change and become a cell that can be used almost \nanywhere in the body has fascinated scientists who are studying the \nability of the body to repair itself through the use of using these \n``uncommitted'' cells.\n  We have all heard the saying--you don't have to be a weatherman to \nknow which way the wind is blowing. In this case, however, you really \ndo need a strong background in science to understand fully the \nspecifics of stem cell research and its implications for the future. \nFortunately, we are not here to predict the impact stem cells will have \non our health care system in the years to come. We are here to make a \ndetermination as to the wisdom of using taxpayer dollars to finance \nadditional work in this area--and then pick the best vehicle to support \nit. There is a big difference.\n  In debating and voting on the two bills before us today, we are not \nmaking a judgment about the science itself, as others have stated. \nRather, we are making a judgment about whether that science should be \nsupported by taxpayer dollars. We are deciding the appropriate moral \nconstruct for the work of those key scientists in manipulating and \npossibly even destroying the basic building blocks of human life. We \nare reaffirming how we as a society view the embryo and its function.\n  Every year, within our appropriations bills, we make a judgment about \nhow we want to treat embryos--the very beginning of human life. The\n\n[[Page S4346]]\n\nDickey-Wicker amendment is clear. Federal dollars cannot be used for \ncreating human embryos for research purposes or for research in which a \nhuman embryo or embryos are destroyed, discarded, or knowingly \nsubjected to the risk of injury or death greater than that allowed for \nresearch on fetuses in utero. Therefore, every year, as part of the \nappropriations process, we reaffirm that science must be guided by \nmoral values, and our values as a society compel us to place certain \nlimits on the pursuit of science. Today's debate will consider whether \nour values as a society compel us to maintain certain limits on \ntaxpayer funding of embryonic stem cell research.\n  Without question, science must be guided by morality. There have been \ntoo many instances over the course of human history in which terrible \nthings have been done in the name of science. Scientific exploration is \nimportant and we should do everything we can to further our knowledge \nof ourselves and our world, but not at the expense of disregarding the \nmoral viewpoints of millions of Americans who don't believe their taxes \nshould pay for something they find abhorrent.\n  In determining how to proceed, we of course must consider the promise \nof stem cell research. But in considering that promise, we must make it \nclear that while stem cells may someday lead to therapeutic \nadvancements for devastating diseases like Alzheimer's, diabetes, \nParkinson's, leukemia, and spinal cord injuries, that day has not come \nyet. That is why we must be careful not to oversell the promise of this \nresearch to the American people because this field of research has not \nyet resulted in human clinical trials. Every reputable scientist will \nadmit that any possible cure or advanced treatment using embryonic stem \ncells are many years away. There are currently no cures waiting to be \nplucked off laboratory shelves after our votes on these bills.\n  So, while the research provides great hope for millions of Americans, \nat this point, the full benefits have not yet been realized. They fire \nour imagination as we consider the possibilities that may or may not \ncome to pass. Whether embryonic stem cells will fulfill their promise \nsomeday is still very much in question, and much work is already \nongoing to see whether we can get an answer.\n  In this context, I want to further discuss S. 5, the Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act of 2007. A similar bill was passed the House \non January 11, 2007, by a vote of 253 to 174. S. 5 would allow \nadditional research on embryos from in vitro fertilization procedures, \nunder some limited circumstances.\n\n  However, even in these rather limited circumstances, I must oppose S. \n5, because the limits it imposes on taxpayer-funded science do not \nrespect the moral value of a human embryo. It does not fully recognize \nour decision within Dickey-Wicker and other contexts to treat the human \nembryo as more than simply material for scientific research.\n  The supporters of this bill will acknowledge that it does not limit \nresearch to human embryos that are currently frozen but extends the \nwindow for that research well into the future. By doing so, the bill \ncreates an incentive for the creation of embryos solely for research \npurposes. This is contrary to what Congress reaffirms within the \nDickey-Wicker language each year.\n  And, although the bill prohibits financial and other inducements for \nthe parents of the embryo, it does not eliminate financial or other \ninducements for the clinics and doctors that create the embryos. Thus, \nit does not eliminate the financial incentives for in vitro \nfertilization clinics to create more embryos than are absolutely \nnecessary to help parents conceive a child. This loophole will further \nerode the congressional prohibition through Dickey-Wicker against the \ncreation of human embryos solely for research purposes.\n  I am not opposed to embryonic stem cell research, but I am opposed to \nthe provisions of S. 5. I would welcome the opportunity to debate \namendments to the bill, but the agreement that governs our debate does \nnot permit amendments. And, without an opportunity to amend S. 5, I \nhave no choice but to vote against it.\n  However, I will support alternatives, such as the Isakson-Coleman \nbill, so that we can allow greater Federal support for embryonic stem \ncell research. I believe we can and should unite behind a bill that \nrespects the diversity of our views on human embryos, but still pushes \nthe science forward. The Isakson-Coleman legislation is such a bill.\n  A vote for or against S. 5 is not a vote for or against scientific \nadvances. After all, if we truly trust science, we ought to give \nscience a chance to solve this dilemma over embryonic stem cell \nresearch. As outlined by the report from the President's Council on \nBioethics, researchers are exploring at least five different ways by \nwhich we can create stem cell lines without harming or destroying \nembryos. If these researchers are successful, then the arguments \nagainst Federal funding of embryonic stem cell research will fall away.\n  Further, States and private research organizations are already \nplowing billions of dollars into human embryonic stem cell research \nthat goes beyond the parameters of President Bush's policy. Let those \nefforts continue, while we continue working in Congress to support stem \ncell research that doesn't involve harming or destroying an embryo, \nwhich is something that the vast majority of Americans could support.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \ntalk about the two bills before us today dealing with stem cell \nresearch.\n  One of these bills is wrong, while the other offers us a chance to \nadvance scientific research using stem cells while still protecting the \nsanctity of life.\n  Stem cell research remains a controversial issue in the medical, \nscientific and religious communities as well as in Congress. In fact, \njust last July, we were debating this very topic, and here we are again \ntoday.\n  I am not opposed to stem cell research. I believe that many forms of \nstem cell research offer great hope to millions of Americans suffering \nfrom various diseases, including research using adult and umbilical \ncord stem cells. We are already seeing medical advances in this type of \nresearch. In fact, adult stem cells have proven effective in combating \nseveral serious conditions, such as diabetes and spinal cord injury.\n  Also, just recently in the papers, scientists announced that amniotic \nfluid may be a promising source of stem cells. This shows we have a lot \nto learn about stem cells.\n  I am 100 percent opposed to embryonic stem cell research, however. \nThis is why I will be voting against S. 5, the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act of 2007.\n  This bill would remove all current protections against the \ndestructive use of embryos for harvesting embryos for stem cells. I \nbelieve it is morally wrong to take embryos in the early stages of life \nand destroy them, even for research purposes. We should protect human \nlife--not destroy it.\n  Back in 2001, the Bush administration began allowing Federal funding \nfor embryonic stem cell research on a limited number of stem cell lines \nthat were already in existence. As an opponent of the destruction of \nhuman embryos, I opposed the Bush administration decision to allow some \nembryonic stem cell lines to be used for Federal research.\n  However, S. 5 goes even further than the current policy by removing \nthe current limitations set by the President on federally funded \nembryonic stem cell research. The bill allows Federal funds to be used \nfor this type of research on embryos created for fertility treatments.\n  This is the wrong direction for us to go. It is immoral for us to \nconduct medical research on these budding lives, and American taxpayers \nshould not be forced to pay for this type of research. Some people have \nargued that these embryos are ``excess'' and will be destroyed anyway. \nI firmly believe that we cannot create a human life and then destroy it \nin order to save a life. Ethically, it is unjustifiable.\n  In fact, it is important to remember that embryonic stem cell \nresearch is not illegal. There are just limitations on the Federal \nfunding for it. Anyone can conduct embryonic stem cell research. They \njust have to live by the federal regulations or rely on other sources \nof money.\n  The other bill we are considering today, S. 30, the Hope Offered \nThrough Principled and Ethical Stem Cell Research Act, offers us an \nopportunity to\n\n[[Page S4347]]\n\nfurther stem cell research in an morally defensible manner. The bill \nwould allow stem cells to be derived from embryos that die naturally, \nand reinforces the current policy that federally funded research should \nnot involve destroying or discarding embryos.\n  This bill provides access to embryonic stem cells, but protects human \nlife and avoids the ethical pitfalls of S. 5. It seems to me that we \nshould all be able to support this bill. It places reasonable \nrestrictions on additional embryonic stem cell research, while also \nprotecting human life. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  No one likes to see people with medical conditions suffer, and like \nmany Americans my family and friends have certainly been stricken with \nterrible diseases over the years. However, we are at an ethical \ncrossroads with this issue, and we must stay true to our values of \nrespecting life.\n  It seems foolish to barrel ahead with Federal funding for embryonic \nstem cell research as S. 5 does, when other alternatives are available \nthat offer real hope to patients and promise in research.\n  In closing, I firmly believe that we cannot create life and then \ndestroy it, even if to save another life. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst S. 5, and vote for S. 30.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to S. 5, the \nStem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007. Although I am not opposed \nto stem cell research and in fact enthusiastically support some types \nof stem cell research, I cannot support this bill.\n  This is a very difficult vote for me to cast. I have spent a \nconsiderable amount of time thinking about the issue of Federal funding \nfor stem cell research involving the destruction of embryos. Over the \nlast several years, scientific developments in human genetics have been \nproceeding at a rapid pace. This kind of research has the potential to \nbe very helpful in the understanding of human development and the \ntreatment of human diseases. However, this type of research also raises \nserious ethical and public policy questions that must be confronted. \nWhat limits do we place on research with human embryos?\n  Experimentation with embryonic stem cells is considered by some to be \na revolution in medical research. Many in the medical, public and \nscientific communities believe that embryonic stem cell research could \nlead to the cure for such sicknesses as Parkinson's disease, \nAlzheimer's and diabetes. However, human embryos must be destroyed in \norder to derive embryonic stem cells and this is where my ethical \ndilemma arises.\n  It is my deeply held and personal belief that an embryo is an actual \nliving being; it is not merely a potential living human being. The \npossibility of helping those who are sick may be a very powerful \nmotivation, but I strongly believe that human embryos deserve the same \nrespect as any other human being and it is never morally or ethically \njustified to kill one human being in order to help benefit another. It \nis for this reason that I cannot support the use of human embryonic \nmaterial for research even if it has the potential to save others. I \ncannot accept the diminished status of the human embryo in order to \njustify their destruction in the course of research solely because they \nmay theoretically provide potential benefits for another human being \nsometime in the future.\n  I want to make it clear that my ethical problem is not with the \nresearch itself but rather with the destruction of embryos. I believe \nthere is potential for advances in stem cell research that does not \ninvolve the moral dilemma of destroying an embryo in the process. It is \nfor this reason that I support S. 30, The Hope Offered through \nPrincipled and Ethical Stem Cell Research, HOPE, Act.\n  The HOPE Act will advance alternate forms of stem cell research by \nintensifying research on methods that do not involve the destruction of \nhuman embryos. This bill instructs the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to develop techniques for the isolation, derivation, \nproduction, and testing of stem cells, provided that such techniques do \nnot involve the creation of human embryos for research purposes; or the \ndestruction or discarding of, or risk of injury to, a human embryo. \nResearch that can benefit others without the destruction of human life \nis in my opinion the best path forward.\n  Scientists have shown they have the skill and ability to pursue the \npotential benefits of stem cell research without endangering human life \nin the process. I support these alternative approaches because I truly \nbelieve that they have the potential to help people while still \nmaintaining ethical guidelines. This is the best way to allow Federal \nscience-research on stem cells without offending the beliefs of \nmillions of Americans.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to clarify my position on \nstem cell research. As a veterinarian I understand the need for \nresearch and scientific advancement. Current law does not prohibit any \nsort of stem cell research. In fact, all forms of stem cell research \nhave flourished under current law.\n  I can not and will not support legislation that would drive abortion. \nTherefore I cannot support S. 5. This legislation would allow for \nFederal dollars to be used to incentivize the further destruction of \nhuman embryos for research purposes. I do not support this use of \nFederal funds. I will not oppose private industry from doing embryonic \nstem cell research, but it would be very irresponsible to use Federal \ntaxpayer dollars to fund such a contentious issue.\n  Science is advancing. Over the past weeks and months research using \nadult stem cells has had many breakthroughs. The use of amniotic fluid \nand placental stem cells has much of the same potential that embryonic \nstem cells have, but they are not as controversial. S. 30 provides \nresources to further research in the area of adult stem cell research. \nBecause of the emphasis on adult stem cell research, I support S. 30 \nand will vote in favor of S. 30 later today.\n  I not only understand the need for scientific advancement, but also \nfor ethical boundaries. We should not be using Federal dollars to drive \nabortion, when there are alternative opportunities for scientific \nadvancement that are not as contentious.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we live in an age when medical miracles are \noccurring every day, many in my home State of Arizona. Breakthroughs \nare treating and curing children and adults who could have died from \ntheir diseases just a few years ago. And some of these cures and \ntreatments are the result of stem cell research.\n  For example, thanks to the Cord Blood Registry located in Tucson, \nchildren and adults are being treated, and often cured, of once \nterminal diseases such as leukemia, aplastic anemia, cerebral palsy, \nand sickle-cell anemia. And these are just a handful of the 72 diseases \nthat have undergone clinical trials or been treated using stem cells \nobtained from bone marrow and umbilical cord blood.\n  I favor the broadest possible effort to pursue promising medical \ntechnologies within appropriate ethical limits. Scientists have derived \nstem cells from two principal sources: the tissues, fluids, and organs \nof adults, and cells from human embryos. Human embryonic stem cells \nhave only been obtained through a process that destroys the embryo.\n  In the last Congress, we passed, and the President signed into law, \nthe Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005. This legislation \nwas intended to spur additional advances by establishing an \ninfrastructure to facilitate the collection and dissemination of two of \nthe most promising categories of adult stem cells: those derived from \nbone marrow and those derived from umbilical cord blood. Based on \nreports in the media over the past 2 weeks, I would say this bill has \nbeen a success.\n  For example, the New York Times reported on a coming revolution to \nsports medicine from adult stem cells that could be able to heal and \nrehabilitate tendons, ligaments, muscle and cartilage.\n  More significantly, ABC News reported that adult stem cells are being \nshown to be useful in repairing damaged heart muscle. While this has \nbeen known for some time in other countries, U.S. doctors and \nscientists are now embarking on the first human clinical trials. This \nmay turn out to be one of the most significant breakthroughs in recent \nhistory for treating the most deadly disease in the United\n\n[[Page S4348]]\n\nStates--heart disease--which last year claimed the lives of almost \n500,000 Americans.\n  What's more, a recent study conducted by the Wake Forest University \nSchool of Medicine promisingly resulted in scientists harvesting stem \ncells from amniotic fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds a baby \nbefore it is born. These amniotic stem cells offer many of the benefits \nfound in embryonic stem cells, and without its ethical complications, \ndemonstrating just how much faster science is moving than politics. \nThose researchers at Wake Forest found that amniotic-fluid stem cells \nproved successful in producing bone, heart muscles, fat, nerve, and \nliver tissues. All of this was possible without destroying the nascent \nlife in an embryo.\n  By contrast, embryonic stem cell experiments have not yielded any \ntreatments for human patients. Nevertheless, researchers believe there \nis much potential there, so a great deal of private and public money \nhas been raised to pursue it.\n  In 2001, the President issued an Executive order that made available \nfor the first time Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research \nusing embryos that had already been destroyed. In the subsequent 6 \nyears, the Federal Government has spent more than $130 million on this \ntype of stem cell research and has spent more than $2.5 billion on all \nstem cell-related research.\n  In 2006, the Senate considered legislation that would have overturned \na key element of the current policy: the stipulation that Federal \ntaxpayers' money cannot provide an incentive for the further \ndestruction of human embryos. While this bill was approved by Congress, \nit was later vetoed by the President.\n  I voted against this legislation because I believe that taxpayers \nshould not have to subsidize the destruction of nascent human life, \nespecially when a number of State governments and large universities \nhave directed significant resources to embryonic stem cell research. \nSince there are already billions of dollars available for embryonic \nstem cell research on lines from newly destroyed embryos, increases in \nFederal funding and a change in the Federal policy are not necessary.\n  S. 5, which we are debating today, and which is similar to \nlegislation already passed by the House, is essentially the same \nlegislation as that the President vetoed last year. There is one \ndifference: added to S. 5 is legislation that was passed unanimously by \nthis body last year--the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies \nEnhancement Act. I supported that legislation, which was not passed by \nthe other body. However, that very positive legislation is attached to \nlegislation I cannot support because it would force taxpayers to \nsubsidize the destruction of nascent life.\n  Thankfully, S. 30 is also being considered today. I fully support \nthis legislation offered by Senators Coleman and Isakson. Their \nleadership has brought to the floor a bill that would build on the \nresearch that is treating patients now. This legislation would direct \nthe Department of Health and Human Services to seek out alternative \nsources of stem cells and to study the possibility of establishing an \namniotic and placental stem cell bank, similar to the bone marrow and \ncord blood stem cell bank, while reaffirming a policy that prohibits \nresearch that destroys human life.\n  We can all agree: stem cell research holds promise and has already \nprovided life-saving treatments and cures. And we should continue to \nsupport that research within appropriate ethical restrictions. I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose S. 5 and support S. 30.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an issue of \ntremendous significance to countless Americans and to generations to \ncome--the matter of stem cell research. I thank the majority leader for \nhis efforts to ensure consideration of stem cell legislation. The \nbottom line is, there is research we should be conducting today that \ncould help us treat--and in some cases cure--some of our most serious \ndiseases. That is why two-thirds of Americans favor embryonic stem cell \nresearch and why I am an original cosponsor of the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act.\n  The promise of stem cell research lies in the simple fact that \nembryonic stem cells have the unique potential to develop into any of \nthe cells which could be needed to treat the multitude of diseases from \nwhich Americans suffer. The vast potential of stem cell therapy is key \nto future therapies because in so many diseases, cells in the body are \ndamaged or destroyed, and their role is often irreplaceable. Stem cells \noffer an opportunity to actually replace the function which was lost.\n  Consider today that 20 million Americans live with diabetes. Despite \ntreatment with drugs and insulin, many diabetics experience vision \nloss, injury to extremities, heart disease and other complications. For \nyears, scientists have sought to find a cure. And today stem cells \noffer that potential to end dependence on insulin--freeing millions \nfrom diabetes.\n  In many diseases, there simply is not an effective therapy to replace \nthe function which individuals lost or damaged cells can no longer \nprovide. Today there are limited treatment options for brain disorders \nsuch as Parkinson's disease and ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. For such \ndiseases, stem cell therapies offer promise that we could alleviate the \nsuffering that millions now experience.\n  This week the Senate is considering two bills. The first of these \npromotes stem cell research. It encourages research which is already \nunderway--which is eligible today for both private and public funding. \nAnd while that research should be encouraged, it is not facing \nimpediments, save for the fact most of us would like to see greater \nprogress in biomedical research funding--and stop the erosion of the \nbudgets of the National Institutes of Health.\n  Yet since no impediment exists to the work described this first bill \ndescribes, this legislation is--despite its positive aspects--a \ndistraction from a crucial question. That is, whether we will continue \nto impede progress in human embryonic stem cell research.\n  The problem is, that while scientists are tackling stem cell research \non multiple fronts, to ensure success they try to predict the path most \nlikely to be successful. In that regard, we know that embryonic stem \ncells have the potential to develop into any cell type of the body. \nThat is why scientists have sought to use them in their race to create \ncures.\n  Today, Federal funding for research is restricted to a small number \nof embryonic stem cell ``lines'' that were established prior to August \n9, 2001. Unfortunately, only 19 of those 78 stem cell lines in \nexistence are available to researchers, as many were found to be \ncontaminated or otherwise unusable. We recognize today that even when a \nstem cell line is created, it simply cannot reproduce indefinitely.\n  So, many scientists are frustrated, are perplexed that a Federal \nfunding restriction would essentially block their efforts to develop \ncures. Some have proposed they should use adult stem cells. Yet those \ninvolve a detour in the journey to a cure.\n  We know that in order to use embryonic stem cells to make cells which \ncan be used to treat a disease--like diabetes--scientists must learn \nhow to make the cell become the right type. But an adult stem cell is \nactually already somewhat specialized, so one cannot directly use them \nto produce many of the types of cells we need to produce new therapies. \nSome advocates of adult stem cell research say we could try to take \nsuch a stem cell and reverse its development--back to an embryonic \nstage--and then begin the task to develop it into the specialized cell \nrequired. It is as if you were driving down an interstate on a trip, \ntook an exit, made a few turns, and then decided to back up--in \nreverse--all the way to the interstate in an attempt to try another \ndestination. This is not an efficient way to get where you are going. \nAnd any scientist will tell you, the more steps you must take, the more \nchance there is that something simply won't work.\n  Recently some have proposed that scientists could use other types of \ncells. We have learned recently about stem cells which are found in \namniotic fluid--``amniotic stem cells''--which also appear to have \npotential to develop into different types of tissues. This is an \nencouraging development, yet much remains to be learned about those \ncells. The leader of the research group which has just described these\n\n[[Page S4349]]\n\ncells--Anthony Atala--was recently asked whether his research ends the \nargument over whether embryonic stem cells are needed. He answered that \nquestion simply:\n\n       It does not, mainly because it's another stem cell choice. \n     And I think you really can't tell which cell is going to be \n     best for which indication, and all cells have advantages and \n     disadvantages.\n\n  That is truly the statement of a scientist. Because we do not yet \nknow about the full potential of these alternatives to embryonic stem \ncells. But we do know that embryonic stem cells can develop into any \ntype of cell. That is why losing years in which we could have made \nprogress is so tragic. There is so much that scientists have yet to \nlearn, and while we always hope for quick cures, experience shows that \nmedical breakthroughs typically result from years of concentrated \neffort--and we cannot wait any longer to embark on that journey.\n  That is why I am a cosponsor of the second bill which we are \nconsidering--the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. This legislation \naddresses the critical issue which has inhibited research here in the \nU.S.--the restriction of Federal funding to only those few stem cell \nlines which were in existence back in 2001. Our legislation would \nensure that Federal research would only use stem cells from embryos \nwhich would otherwise be destroyed and would require full consent from \nthe donor before coming into use. I thank Senators Specter and Harkin \nfor their leadership on embryonic stem cell research.\n  The legislation which they have championed sets a very constrained \nset of circumstances under which embryonic stems cells may be obtained \nin order to assure we can move this vital research forward within an \nethical framework. Never will an embryo be created for research \npurposes, nor does this legislation facilitate such studies. This \nlegislation assures that an embryo may be used only when it would not \never be used for infertility treatment. Donation must be voluntary, \nunder full informed consent and no financial or other inducement may be \ngiven.\n  The fact is that fertility treatment has allowed many to have \nfamilies whom otherwise could not. A consequence of this remarkable \ntherapy is that some embryos are created which will not be used. I must \nnote that under the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, it will be the \ncouple who will--under no bias--decide whether they will be used. This \nlegislation facilitates that donation.\n  Today Americans who have faced fertility problems are facing the \nquestion of what to do with unused embryos. Indefinite storage is not \ntruly an option--we know that we cannot maintain the viability of these \nembryos indefinitely. So given the choices available, some couples see \nthe potential to help those suffering from serious disease. It assures \nthat this gift can be given and used to help medical progress.\n  I believe many Americans who have undergone fertility treatment and \nrealized a gift of life in their families will opt to save lives \nthrough a donation which promises to save many lives. But it must \nalways be individual conscience that is the determinative factor--and I \nrespect the views and conscience of each and every individual on this \nmatter.\n  There can be no doubt that stem cell research will move forward. The \nreal question is whether our Nation will be engaged--whether our \nscientists will realize the breakthroughs--whether we will produce the \ntreatments or whether those developments will draw our best minds and \nnew medical investment abroad, where American vision and oversight will \nnot influence the future of medicine.\n  I believe in stem cell research. I believe in it because I cannot \nlook at a person suffering from a debilitating, and even fatal disease \nand support prohibitions which impede ethical research aimed at \nalleviating of that suffering. That is why I joined with my colleagues \nin the Senate in urging President Bush to ease the current restrictions \non the use of stem cells so that research can move forward and lives \ncould be saved. That is why I am a sponsor of this legislation. It is \nwhy I urge my colleagues to give that bill their support. This is the \nbill which will make a difference. I urge the President to reconsider \nthis issue, and urge his support.\n  I think back to President Reagan's passing nearly 3 years ago, and \nremember the outpouring of concern we all had for our former President, \nand the First Lady and their entire family. We spoke much of the \ntragedy of Alzheimer's disease and how we must do more to alleviate the \nsuffering. Nancy Reagan inspired us all with her courage--and inspires \nus no less in her call for research which could alleviate the suffering \nfrom so many diseases. Her recent words call out to us, ``A lot of time \nis being wasted . . . A lot of people who could be helped are not being \nhelped.''\n  I cannot think of a more significant living memorial to our former \nPresident than to allow more research to be done in order to find new \ncures for diseases affecting millions of people.\n  Today I ask my colleagues to consider allowing individuals--who have \nthrough modern medical science, enjoyed a gift of life, to contribute \nto saving other lives. That is exactly what this legislation does, and \nthat is why we must send this bill to the President and he must sign \nit.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I stand in full support of the Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act as I did when this bill was introduced and \nsent to the President's desk in the 109th Congress. I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill.\n  I am frustrated by the opposition this bill has generated and \nsaddened that we are preventing the advancement of important science \nthat could potentially impact millions of suffering Americans. The \nstudy of stem cells holds enormous promise for the treatment of \ndebilitating and life-threatening diseases. However, in order to reach \nthis level of medical achievement, much more research is necessary to \nunderstand, and eventually harness, the amazing potential of stem \ncells. Instead of creating roadblocks, we must all work together to \nexpand Federal funding of stem cell research and continue moving \nforward in our fight against disease by advancing our knowledge through \nscience and medicine.\n  Each year, 100,000 Americans will develop Alzheimer's disease, with \nimpaired memory, ability to understand, and judgment. Over 1 million \nadults will be diagnosed with diabetes this year, and risk \ncomplications that include blindness, damaged nerves, and loss of \nkidney function. We all know or have met individuals with spinal cord \ninjuries, including national celebrities, local war heroes, and loved \nones from our own families and circles of friends, who are struggling \nto maintain mobility and independence.\n  For most of our history, medicine has offered little hope of recovery \nto the 100 million individuals affected by these and other devastating \nillnesses and injuries.\n  Until now.\n  Recent developments in stem cell research may hold the key to \nimproved treatments, if not cures, for those affected by Alzheimer's \ndisease, diabetes, spinal cord injury, and countless other conditions.\n  Many men, women, and children who are cancer survivors are already \nfamiliar with the lifesaving applications of adult stem cell research. \nPatients with leukemia or lymphoma often undergo bone marrow \ntransplants, a type of stem cell transplant, which can significantly \nprolong life or permanently get rid of the cancer. This therapy has \nbeen used successfully for decades, and is saving lives every day.\n  Yet this breakthrough has its serious limitations. Adult stem cells, \nsuch as those used in bone marrow transplants, can only be collected in \nsmall quantities, may not be a match for the patient, which can lead to \nrejection, and have limited ability to differentiate or transform into \nspecialized cells.\n  Similarly, the promising advances of stem cell use from a patient's \nown cord blood, as illustrated by the success stories of Dr. Joanne \nKurtzberg from Duke University, also have their limitations. If, for \nexample, a young cord blood recipient's condition should deteriorate \nafter his or her initial treatment or should develop another illness, \nthere simply are not enough cord blood cells left for a second use. The \nfew remaining cells would have to be cloned to get enough cells for \nfuture treatment, or stem cells would have to be obtained from another \nsource.\n\n[[Page S4350]]\n\n  Two of my constituents, Mary Schneider and her son Ryan, are well \naware of the potential of cord blood treatments. Her son, diagnosed \nwith cerebral palsy at 2 years of age, has made what appears to be a \nfull recovery after treatment with his own cord blood. Despite the \ncompelling results witnessed by the Schneider family, they also firmly \nbelieve and support expanded research of embryonic stem cells to combat \ndisease.\n  A recent scientific paper about stem cells derived from amniotic \nfluid has drawn much attention. While this offers an exciting \nalternative to regenerative medicine therapies, the author of that \nreport, Dr. Anthony Atala, has himself urged that his work on amniotic \nstem cells will not replace the continued need for investigation into \ntreatments with stem cells derived from embryos.\n  All of these alternative treatments are just that, alternatives, and \nare not substitutes for embryonic stem cell research.\n  Embryonic stem cells can be obtained from a number of sources, \nincluding in vitro fertilization. At this very moment, there are over \n400,000 embryos being stored in over 400 facilities throughout the \nUnited States. The majority of these are reserved for infertile \ncouples. However, many of these embryos will go unused, destined for \npermanent storage in a freezer or disposal. We should expand and \naccelerate research using these embryos, just as we should continue to \nexplore the viability of adult stem cell use, cord blood use, and \namniotic fluid use.\n  The promise of embryonic stem cells has come to light in a recent \nachievement by researchers at Johns Hopkins. They were able to repair \ndamaged nerves and restore mobility in paralyzed rats through embryonic \nstem cells. One can't help but wonder when, not if, this research will \nbe translated into techniques that will help human patients who have \nlost the ability to walk.\n  Of course, any work in this area must have appropriate oversight. \nEmbryonic stem cell research demands comprehensive, thoughtful, and \ncarefully crafted ethical and scientific guidelines. We must not only \nlook to guidance from the National Institutes of Health and the Food \nand Drug Administration but also to our reason, our morals, and our \ncompassion.\n  The President's veto of the stem cell bill proposed in the last \nCongress prevents Government funding beyond 78 previously established \nstem cell lines. However, recent estimates on the number of viable cell \nlines bring the numbers down closer to 20. Clearly, we are moving \nbackward in our efforts with these current restrictions. Stymieing \nembryonic stem cell research is a step in the wrong direction. It \ncloses the door on many Americans awaiting new treatments that could \npotentially provide a better quality of life or, perhaps, even save \ntheir life.\n  My hope, and the hope of so many in this country, is to provide our \nresearchers with the means to explore the uses of embryonic stem cells \nso that we can begin to turn the tide on the devastating diseases \naffecting our Nation and the world.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nemotional, divisive, and often confusing issue of stem cell research. \nLet me start by expressing why I believe we should focus our scarce \nresources on adult and umbilical cord stem cells rather than on \nembryonic stem cells.\n  Given the tremendous results that have come from adult and umbilical \ncord stem cell therapy in the areas of oncology and orthopedics--and, \nmore recently, in cardiology and neurology--I am further encouraged by \nthe possibilities these noncontroversial, adult stem cells have to \noffer. In this tight budgetary environment, in which there is a choke \nhold on our domestic discretionary spending, we must be vigilant in the \nway we appropriate taxpayer dollars and concentrate our resources on \nthose lines of medical research that hold the greatest potential.\n  Furthermore, in recent years, scientists have made tremendous strides \nin designing methods to obtain fully pluripotent stem cells that have \nthe flexibility of embryonic stem cells, while avoiding the destruction \nof human embryos. The potential to extract these versatile stem cells \nin an ethically sound manner, coupled with my interest in seeing \nfurther research in the area of adult and umbilical cord stem cells, is \nwhy I rise to support S. 30, the HOPE Act.\n  Before I delve into a discussion of the two bills this body is \nconsidering, let me clarify that there are two different categories of \nstem cells--and, thus, of stem cell research. The first, embryonic stem \ncells--as their name suggests--are derived from human embryos developed \nfrom eggs that have been fertilized at an in vitro fertilization \nclinic. Alternatively, adult stem cells are undifferentiated cells \nfound among differentiated cells in tissues or organs. These cells can \nrenew themselves and eventually develop into a specific cell in the \nbody. What is notable, however, is that these undifferentiated adult \nstem cells can be gathered by scientists without any harm to the \nindividual donor.\n  Umbilical cord blood derived from a mother's placenta following the \nbirth of a newborn baby is now also included in this category of adult \nstem cells. In fact, with the arrival of my seventh grandchild, I \nlearned a great deal about the benefits of preserving cord blood stem \ncells. What at one time was considered medical waste and discarded \nafter birth is now recognized as a rich supply of stem cells and has \nbeen used to treat a number of blood and immune-system diseases, \ncancers, and other physical disorders.\n  I was introduced to the promise of adult and umbilical stem cell \nresearch by experts at the National Center for Regenerative Medicine in \nmy hometown of Cleveland, OH. Several institutions make up the center, \nincluding Case Western Reserve University, the Cleveland Clinic, \nUniversity Hospitals Case Medical Center, Athersys, Inc., and the Ohio \nState University. Together they have created an outstanding medical \nfacility that is leading the Nation in the use of nonembryonic stem \ncells to regenerate new tissues in diseased organs rather than using \ndrugs or devices to improve the function of the organs.\n  Since 1976, researchers at the center have been studying nonembryonic \nstem cells, and they performed their first stem cell transplant as \nearly as 1980. Today, the center is capable of conducting clinical \ntrials with cord blood stem cells for gene therapy and for heart and \nblood vessel repair. Investigators at the center are now able to cure \nleukemia and lymphomas with nonembryonic stem cell transplantation, as \nwell as repair unstable bone fractures and treat genetic disorders.\n  I have had the chance to meet several patients whose lives have been \ntransformed by this new medicine. Elisabeth, who was a patient at the \nNational Center, was in a motorcycle accident and had compound \nfractures in her right femur and right tibia. Even though she was \nrushed into emergency surgery after the accident, her bones did not \nheal properly, and she was told she would never walk again. Elisabeth \nsought out a second opinion from a doctor at the National Center who \noperated a second time, using some of his adult stem cell gel. This gel \ntakes on the characteristics of the surrounding bone cells and helps \nwith the healing of broken bones. I am happy to report, Elisabeth is \nnow walking, living a healthy life, and pursuing a future in physical \ntherapy at the Ohio State University.\n  Elisabeth is not alone.\n  I recently visited the National Center for Regenerative Medicine, and \nI had the chance to meet Ashley. Ashley is 8 years old and was \nsuccessfully treated for her leukemia at Rainbow Babies and Children's \nHospital of University Hospitals Case Medical Center. She was first \ndiagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia, ALL, in January 2006, and she \nunderwent a stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor in June 2006. \nBut since her transplant, Ashley has done wonderfully.\n  Even more encouraging is the potential for scientists to leverage all \nthis great medicine into new fields, including cardiology and \nneuroscience. Researchers at the National Center for Regenerative \nMedicine are hopeful that in the not so distant future they will make \ninroads in the treatment of degenerative arthritis, will decrease the \nseverity of graft versus host disease after stem cell transplantation, \nand will allow physicians to use a patient's own stem cells to repair \nheart damage following congestive heart failure, as\n\n[[Page S4351]]\n\nwell as use their own neural stem cells to improve function after \nspinal cord damage.\n  I am concerned, however, that not enough Americans are aware that \nsome of the most advanced medicine today can be attributed to adult--\nand not embryonic--stem cells. What I find even more disturbing is that \nmany supporters of embryonic stem cell research have been kept in the \ndark about the advances of umbilical and adult stem cell treatments and \nhave been over-sold on embryonic stem cell research, which is still in \nits infancy.\n  I want to remind my colleagues who support the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act that embryonic cells have not been successfully used to \ntreat even one disease yet I have had the opportunity to meet numerous \npeople whose lives have been saved by adult stem cell therapy. In fact, \nadult stem cells have been used to treat 72 diseases, including breast \ncancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell anemia, \nspinal cord injuries, and others. That is why I continue to be \nencouraged by the possibilities adult stem cells have to offer.\n  In recent years, medical research has made tremendous strides, and it \nis now widely believed that new technology can lead to methods of \nobtaining fully pluripotent stem cells that have the flexibility of \nembryonic stem cells without destroying potential life. That is why I \nrise today to support S. 30, the HOPE Act.\n  Despite all this progress, scientists around the world agree that \nthere is still a great deal that remains unknown about the potential \nfor stem cell therapy. That is why I support this legislation \nintroduced by my colleagues from Minnesota and Georgia that can help us \ntap even more potential cures and therapies.\n  The HOPE Act would continue to encourage Federal research on adult \nand umbilical cord stem cell therapies that are already proving \nsuccessful, while requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto develop techniques to identify and derive pluripotent stem cells \nthat have the flexibility of embryonic stem cells without destroying a \nhuman embryo. There is evidence that these alternative methods may make \nit easier for scientists to genetically match patients with therapies \nand could reduce the complications, like tumor formation, that have \nbeen seen with embryonic stem cells.\n  The HOPE Act would also require the Secretary to prioritize stem cell \nresearch that will reap near-term clinical benefit and take into \naccount the findings of the President's Council on Bioethics along with \nother appropriate techniques and research. It is my hope that this type \nof progress will help eliminate the controversy surrounding embryonic \nstem cell research without any compromise of scientific advancement. \nThis legislation paves a path forward for Federal scientists, while \nrespecting the principles and morals of millions of taxpayers.\n  I believe it is my moral responsibility to direct the Federal \nGovernment's dollars toward research that has the greatest near-term \npotential to help the largest number of Americans.\n  Over the past several years, Congress has increased total NIH funding \nfor medical research--including increasing the amount of money \navailable for stem cell research--from $15.1 billion in fiscal year \n1999 to $28.9 billion in 2007. However, in recent years the cost of \nfighting the war in Iraq, defending our homeland, and protecting \nagainst natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina has left very few \nresources for domestic discretionary spending. In fact, today, the \nFederal Government spends only one-sixth of its annual budget on \nnondefense discretionary spending, and I am afraid that exploding \nentitlement spending threatens to soak up every Federal dollar, leaving \nno revenue for things like scientific research. There is a tremendous \nneed to pursue treatments for many diseases, but we face a reality of \nlimited funding.\n  We have to be smart about spending our money. In the current budget \nenvironment, I have concerns that increasing funding for research on \nembryonic stem cells will take away opportunities for research in areas \nlike adult and umbilical research that has proven its ability to save \nhuman lives--or even for new techniques to help us remove pluripotent \nstem cells without destroying human embryos.\n  I have the greatest sympathy for patients and their families who \ncontinue to struggle with a wide range of fatal diseases. I understand \nwhat it is like to watch a loved one suffer and the tragedy of losing a \nmember of your family--especially a young child. I lost my father to \ndiabetes and my young nephew C.T.--who was only 14--to bone cancer. \nLike many here today, I have been a witness to the devastating effects \nof Alzheimer's, arthritis, and many other debilitating diseases. That \nis why I am sympathetic with my colleagues' efforts to seek out a \npanacea. But I fear that too often proponents of embryonic stem cell \nresearch make exaggerated claims about this line of research and offer \nfalse promises when the evidence is just not there.\n  I read a great op-ed in The Washington Post by Charles Krauthammer--\nwho has long supported legal abortions and doesn't believe that life \nbegins at conception--in which he issued a stern warning against \npursuing embryonic stem cell research. As he said, he has a very \nhealthy respect for ``the human capacity for doing evil in pursuit of \ngood.'' And, that is exactly what I see happening in this Chamber \ntoday. Too many of my colleagues are focused exclusively on embryonic \nstem cell research, and they are missing potential that is right under \ntheir noses.\n  I am reminded of Aesop's fable, ``The Stag at the Pool,'' in which a \nstag stops at a spring to drink some water. He looks down at his shadow \nreflected in the water and greatly admires the size and shape of his \nbeautiful horns, all the while thinking that his feet are too slender \nand too weak. Just as he is looking at his reflection, a lion appears \nat the pond. The stag sees the lion in the water and runs as fast as he \ncan to safety. As he enters the woods, though, his horns get tangled in \nthe tree branches, and the lion catches up to him. Finally, at that \nmoment, the stag realizes that it was his feet that could have saved \nhim and his antlers that led to his demise.\n  The moral of the story is: What is most truly valuable is often \nunderrated. I think the same is true on the subject of stem cell \nresearch. We have been so focused on what we perceive to be the future \nof medical research that we have been willing to overlook successful \ntreatments and therapies that are already taking place right under our \nnoses.\n  In light of all the advances and results science has provided with \nadult and umbilical cord stem cells, I urge my colleagues to direct \nFederal funding toward research that will have the greatest near-term \nimpact on human life.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 5, the Stem \nCell Research Enhancement Act of 2007, a bill that will expand the \nnumber of stem cell lines eligible for federally funded research, \nensuring scientists at NIH and laboratories around the country have \naccess to new, uncontaminated stem cell lines.\n  Many families in America have experienced the tragedy of watching a \nloved one suffer through a deadly or debilitating illness. Diseases \nlike Parkinson's and Alzheimer's take a terrible toll on families' \nlives and livelihoods. While we have made great strides in biomedical \nresearch in recent years, we still don't have all the keys to unlock \nthe secrets of disease.\n  That is why the potential of embryonic stem cells is so exciting. \nEmbryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into virtually any \ncell type in the human body. Scientists tell us that harnessing the \npower of these cells could one day lead to new treatments, and maybe \neven cures, for a number of diseases that afflict American families. \nImportant research is being done every day on stem cells. I am proud \nthat some of this research is being done at the University of Wisconsin \nin Madison, which was the first to isolate human embryonic stem cells.\n  We all understand that this research is not without controversy. I \nrespect the concerns that some people have about the use of embryonic \nstem cells in research, and I agree that we must closely monitor this \nresearch to ensure that it is done ethically. However, scientists and \ndisease advocates are warning us that the current limits on Federal \nfunding for stem cell research are seriously inhibiting our potential \nto find new cures. Without expanded Federal support, we risk slowing \ndown the\n\n[[Page S4352]]\n\ntremendous progress that could be made to alleviate human suffering.\n  It would be unconscionable for the Federal Government to turn its \nback on the discoveries that expanding stem cell research promises. Now \nmore than ever, it is important to grasp this opportunity in an ethical \nmanner by making sure that potentially lifesaving research keeps moving \nforward.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 5, the \nStem Cell Research Enhancement Act. We must enact this legislation so \nthat researchers are able to move forward on ethical, federally funded \nresearch projects that develop better treatments for those suffering \nfrom diseases. Human embryonic stem cells have such great potential \nbecause they have the unique ability in developing into almost any type \nof cell or tissue in the body. Stem cell research holds great promise \nto develop possible cures or improved treatments for a wide range of \ndiseases and injuries, such as diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's disease, \nAlzheimer's, autism, heart disease, spinal cord injuries, and many \nother afflictions. We must not limit research that could improve the \nlives of so many suffering from diseases that we have limited ability \nto prevent, treat, or cure.\n  In August 2001, the President implemented an unworkable, flawed \npolicy that made a small number of human embryonic stem cell lines \neligible. The President's restrictions on stem cell research prevent \nFederal funds from being used for research on newer, more promising \nstem cell lines. In addition, embryonic stem cell lines now eligible \nfor Federal funding are not genetically diverse enough to realize the \nfull therapeutic potential of this research. The President's stem cell \npolicy prevents researchers from moving ahead in an area of research \nthat is very promising. We must enact this legislation to help move \nresearch forward that could alleviate the pain and suffering of \nindividuals.\n  If we fail to enact S. 5, our researchers are likely to fall further \nbehind the work being done in other countries. Australia, Canada, \nFinland, France, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, and the United Kingdom have \nprovided substantial governmental support for stem cell research.\n  Too many of my constituents suffer from Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, \ndiabetes, and other diseases. S. 5 provides some hope for the \ndevelopment of improved treatments that could improve the lives of so \nmany people.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will vote in support of the two bills \nunder consideration today, S. 5 and S. 30, which would provide a \nframework for Federal support of stem cell research under strict \nguidelines and ethical criteria. I supported similar legislative \nproposals during the last Congress.\n  Stem cell research has the potential to give us a better \nunderstanding of deadly diseases and spinal cord injuries affecting \nmillions of Americans. One day, these efforts may lead to cures and \ntreatments for these devastating diseases and conditions. At the same \ntime, it is important and right to recognize the ethical and moral \nconcerns that have been raised by individuals inside and outside of the \nmedical research community regarding one particular type of stem cell \nresearch that involves embryonic stem cells. I believe that these two \nbills will provide an appropriate framework for moving stem cell \nresearch forward in a responsible way.\n  We must create a framework for Federal support of stem cell research \nnow, since research involving embryonic stem cells is also proceeding \noutside the United States. While we have had a robust and needed debate \non the ethical and moral concerns of embryonic stem cell research, as \nreflected by the President's Commission on Bioethics, the same cannot \nalways be said of private industry and scientific research communities \nin other parts of the world. I am deeply concerned where unregulated \nresearch may lead us if researchers are left without ethical and moral \nguidance and stringent regulations and oversight.\n  It does not have to be that way. One bill before us today, S. 5, is \nsimilar to H.R. 810, a bill that I supported and that passed the Senate \non July 18, 2006. S. 5 will provide the same strict ethical guidelines \nfor stem cell research that the Senate supported last year. This bill \nwould authorize Federal support for embryonic stem cell research, but \nlimits appropriately that support to scientists who use embryos \noriginally created for reproductive purposes, and now frozen or slated \nfor destruction by in vitro fertilization clinics. Before there is even \nconsideration of whether to donate unused embryos for research, the \nlegislation would require that the patient who is the source of the \nembryos be consulted and a determination be made that these embryos \nwould otherwise be discarded, and would never have been implanted in \nthe patient or another woman.\n  S. 5 also provides support for alternative stem cell research methods \nby offering increased Federal funding and support for research that \ndoes not involve the use of human embryos. Such alternative research \nwas unanimously supported in the Senate last July and deserves our full \nsupport again today. Researchers believe that this type of stem cell \nresearch holds tremendous potential and I strongly support their \nefforts. Millions of Americans affected by many diseases and conditions \nstand to benefit from the future cures provided by this type of \nresearch.\n  I am also supportive of the other measure that is before us today, S. \n30. This bill will also offer increase Federal funding and support for \nadult stem cell research and other research that does not involve the \nuse of human embryos. Additionally, S. 30 would allow research to be \nperformed on embryonic stem cells taken from naturally dead embryos. \nThis research shows some promise but only additional research will tell \nwhether it can lead to cures and treatments, and we should embrace the \nopportunity that would be afforded under this legislation to determine \nthe research potential that might exist.\n  The United States offers an ideal climate for scientific and medical \nresearch because of the quality of our educational institutions, the \nstrength of our economy, and the scope of our comprehensive legal and \nregulatory system for protection of intellectual property rights. The \nguidelines and requirements contained in S. 5 do not exist currently, \nand this sort of embryonic stem cell research remains largely \nunregulated in the private sector and in many scientific communities \noverseas. Enacting S. 5 would provide the Federal oversight necessary \nto ensure that embryonic stem cell research does not expand into \nethically objectionable ground in balancing the promise on the \nforeseeable horizon of stem cell research with the protection of human \nlife.\n  It should be clearly recognized that embryonic stem cell research \nwill occur with or without Federal approval and guidance. Keeping that \nin mind, I believe embryonic stem cell research is best carried out \nunder strict Federal guidelines and oversight. With the limited Federal \nsupport and stringent guidelines afforded under this legislation, we \ncan promote the benefits of stem cell research while maintaining \nclearly our ethical and moral values and obligations, which we must \nnever sacrifice at any price.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the bill \nbefore the Senate this week, S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement \nAct of 2007. This legislation will put us on the path of progress by \nreversing the President's policy a policy that is holding back the \npromise of stem cell research.\n  It is unfortunate that the Congress must even spend time debating \nthis measure. The majority of Americans support stem cell research, as \ndoes the Director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Elias \nZerhouni. It has been 6 years since the President announced his \nadministration's restrictive policy on stem cell research, which \nlimited the number of stem cell lines available for use with Federal \nfunding. Now we know that all of these lines are contaminated by the \nuse of mouse feeder cells, and they will probably never meet the \nstandards required for human treatment.\n  It is clear that, because of the President's policy, we are now years \nbehind in developing therapies and cures for diseases such as diabetes, \nAlzheimer's and cancer. That is time that millions of Americans simply \ndo not have to waste. For millions of others, this wasted time has \ndampened hope.\n  Some families who hold out hope for the potential of stem cell \nresearch are from Vermont. Many are either afflicted by, or know \nsomeone one who is\n\n[[Page S4353]]\n\nsuffering from, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's or Lou Gehrig's \ndisease. I have met these Vermonters, many of whom are advocating not \nfor themselves, but for future generations who they hope will not \nendure the debilitating nature of these diseases.\n  There are others in Vermont who know firsthand the good this research \ncould bring. These are the scientific researchers at the University of \nVermont and Dartmouth College who are doing groundbreaking work that \nneeds the support of our federal government to be truly successful. \nThese scientists know that the most viable method for progress in \nresearch is to expand the number of embryonic stem cell lines that are \navailable.\n  I would like to take a moment to also address some of the myths \nperpetrated about what S. 5 will and will not do. Let us be clear: This \nbill will not allow Federal funds to be used for the destruction of \nhuman embryos. While Federal dollars can be used for research on stem \ncell lines that are derived from human embryos, the creation of these \nlines cannot be funded with Federal moneys. S. 5 will do nothing to \nchange this policy.\n  This legislation will also ensure that Federal funding will be used \nonly for researching stem cells lines that are derived from human \nembryos that have been donated from in vitro fertilization clinics. The \nin vitro fertilization process creates more embryos than are needed, \nand the remaining embryos will simply never be used. There are more \nthan 400,000 of these embryos that are frozen in fertility clinics, the \nmajority of which will ultimately be destroyed.\n  This week the Senate will vote on two stem cell bills. While I \nsupport both, only one of these bills will take us solidly forward. The \ntime for passage of this legislation is now, and I urge the President \nnot to veto this critical bill.\n  I hope that the President will heed the advice of his own chief \nmedical researcher in the United States, NIH Director Dr. Zerhouni who, \nwhen he testified before the Labor, Health and Human Services \nAppropriations Subcommittee, said that American science would be better \nserved, and the Nation would be better served, if we let our scientists \nhave access to more cell lines.\n  As Congress is poised to send this legislation to the White House, I \nhope the President will take note of Dr. Zerhouni's remarks. I hope \nthat he will also listen to Congress and the millions of Americans who \nbelieve that we should support all angles in stem cell research, and \nsign this bill.\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Stem \nCell Research Enhancement Act. In the coming hours, the Senate will \nvote to pass this bill like it did last year and unlock the door for \nresearchers across the country to use embryonic stem cells to better \nunderstand diseases like Parkinson's and juvenile diabetes so that we \nmay one day find a cure. With each day that has passed since the \nPresident vetoed this legislation, nearly 4,100 Americans were \ndiagnosed with diabetes, 3,800 were diagnosed with cancer, and 160 were \ndiagnosed with Parkinson's. What we are talking about here is research \nthat may one day provide relief to the more than 100 million Americans \nsuffering from Parkinson's, diabetes, spinal cord injury, ALS, cancer, \nand many other devastating conditions for which there is still no cure.\n  The legislation we are about to vote on would expand the number of \nembryonic stem cell lines available for federally funded research by \nallowing the use of stem cells derived through embryos from in vitro \nfertilization clinics that would otherwise be discarded. Strict ethical \nrequirements apply to the use of these stem cell lines. In fact, I \nbelieve these ethical requirements are one of the most essential \nprovisions of the bill. Since the HELP Committee first began \nconsideration of the President's policy toward embryonic stem cell \nresearch in 2001, I have maintained that the pursuit of scientific \nresearch that may benefit millions of Americans and their families was \nas important as ensuring that science did not outpace ethics.\n  Under this legislation, the only embryonic stem cells that can be \nused for federally funded research are those that were derived through \nembryos from in vitro fertilization clinics that were created for \nfertility treatment purposes and were donated for research with the \nwritten, informed consent of the individuals seeking that treatment. \nAny financial or other inducements to make this donation are \nprohibited. These embryos will never be implanted in a woman and would \notherwise have been discarded. The ethical requirements contained in \nthis bill are stronger than current law. In fact, it is possible that \nsome of the 21 stem cell lines approved for Federal funding, the so-\ncalled ``NIH-approved lines,'' may not meet the strict ethical criteria \ncontained in this bill.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues who oppose this legislation argue \nthat this legislation allows, even encourages, taxpayer-funded \ndestruction of human embryos. That is totally false. There is a \nprovision called the Dickey amendment which is attached to every annual \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill prohibiting any Federal funds from being \nused to destroy human embryos. This provision is not affected by the \nembryonic stem cell legislation before the Senate today. Federal funds \ncan be used to study stem cell lines that were derived from human \nembryos that meet the ethical requirements I just laid out, but the \nderivation process itself cannot be paid for with Federal money.\n  I have also heard some of my colleagues who oppose this legislation \nargue that embryonic stem cell research is unnecessary given the \nadvances in adult stem cell research. There is no question that adult \nstem cells such as those found in bone marrow and cord blood have led \nto great advances in patients suffering from leukemia, Hodgkin's \ndisease, sickle cell anemia, among others. I was a coauthor, along with \nSenator Hatch and others, of a bill that is now law to advance bone \nmarrow and cord blood stem cell collection for use in adult stem cell \ntransplantation, and I believe it is essential that we arm researchers \nand physicians with every possible therapeutic weapon in their medical \narsenal. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting full funding for \nthis important law, which passed unanimously in the Senate, in the \nupcoming Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill.\n  The fact remains that there will always be limits to the use of adult \nstem cells when compared with embryonic stem cells, and that is why the \nlegislation before us is so important. Our Nation's best scientists, \nincluding many Nobel laureates, believe that embryonic stem cell \nresearch has a unique potential to ease human suffering and that is \nbecause embryonic stem cells, unlike adult stem cells, can become any \ncell in the body. Embryonic stem cells can become heart cells, lung \ncells, brain tissue, and that property--called pluripotency--is unique \nto their embryonic state.\n  The expansion of embryonic stem cell research may one day unlock the \nmysteries behind so many deadly and debilitating diseases that afflict \nmillions of Americans and their families. I urge the President to \nreconsider his position on this legislation and not stand in the way of \nour Nation's scientists who simply want to find the key that will ease \nthe burden of suffering.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I welcome the vote on this important \npiece of legislation, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007.\n  Stem cell research holds great hope of providing cures for chronic, \nincurable conditions from which millions of Americans suffer. But \nunless we act, the Bush administration will continue to meet this \nunparalleled moment of scientific discovery with unbridled ideology--\nand the American people and scientific community will pay the price.\n  The President's stem cell ban amounts to a ban on hope for millions \nof Americans. It's time this Congress put an end to the Bush \nadministration policy which is holding science back and holding our \nNation back in the race to new medical treatments and discoveries.\n  We all expect that this bipartisan legislation will pass both the \nSenate and the House. There is a broad consensus in the Congress, among \nmedical experts, scientists, and patient advocacy organizations, and \namong the American people, demanding that we open the doors to \nscientific innovation--instead of barring those doors shut.\n\n[[Page S4354]]\n\n  Even within the Bush administration, there is a desire to pursue stem \ncell research. The Director of the National Institutes of Health, \nDoctor Elias Zerhouni, has gone on record supporting expanded access to \nnew lines of embryonic stem cells.\n  I am deeply concerned, however, that we have been down this road \nbefore a road that begins with the promise of new cures and ends, not \nwith discovery, but with ideology and a veto by the President.\n  The promise of stem-cell science is crystal clear--and already being \ndemonstrated. Embryonic stem cells develop into a variety of more \nspecialized types of cells--like nerve cells or muscle tissue that \ncould be used to replace or repair tissue lost or damaged from illness.\n  In New York, researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center \nhave been using embryonic stem cells to develop bone, cartilage or \nmuscle replacement therapies. And in 2006, a team of researchers from \nColumbia University and another team from Cornell published research on \nnew ways of turning embryonic stem cells into treatments for \nParkinson's disease.\n  These are just several examples, but the work of these scientists and \nscientists around the world is inspiring hope for millions in New York \nand the country living with chronic diseases, or caring for a loved one \nwith these conditions.\n  In fact, New York is leading the way--letting science, not politics, \nguide research. My State will soon invest $600 million in stem-cell and \nregenerative medicine research over the next decade. Thanks to this \nstem cell funding plan, New York researchers will benefit from expanded \nresources for all types of stem cell research, including embryonic stem \ncells, adult stem cells, and somatic cell nuclear transfer. And our \neconomy will benefit as well, as we draw great American scientists and \ninnovators pursuing the next great American scientific innovations.\n  This is encouraging news for New York, but as a Nation, the \nleadership vacuum under the Bush administration has left the scientific \ncommunity holding its breath. The Bush administration has put a ban on \ncertain kinds of research, prohibiting Federal funding for any research \non stem cell lines created after August 9, 2001.\n  Federally-funded scientists are limited to less than 20 stem cell \nlines, instead of the 78 lines advertised. And not all of these lines \nare even suitable for research. Some may be contaminated with mouse \ncells, which can increase the risk of creating strains of diseases \nwhich can more easily pass to people. Other problems because of the ban \ninclude genetic instability, which is associated with formation of \ntumors, and practical issues associated with using so few lines--\npreventing scientists from collecting evidence they need.\n  While American scientists are being held back, other countries are \nracing ahead, putting billions of dollars into stem cell science--\ncreating research institutions, clinical centers, and investments of \nall kinds to attract scientists from the United States and elsewhere \nwho will come to pursue this research.\n  We are losing ground instead doing what Americans do best: leading \nthe world in innovation, ingenuity, and new ideas. The Bush \nadministration's stem cell policy is impeding science and compromising \nAmerica's ability to remain at the forefront of biomedical research.\n  At the same time, the Bush ban is a ban that affects more than 100 \nmillion Americans who suffer from Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's \ndisease, diabetes, muscular dystrophy, cancers as well as for their \nfriends, families, and caregivers.\n  These are real people I meet every day in New York and across the \ncountry. It's an adult with type I diabetes--or a mom whose son or \ndaughter has the disease. It's a senior citizen struggling with \nParkinson's disease or a son or daughter with a parent struggling with \nAlzheimer's.\n  These are Americans crossing every divide imaginable--hopeful if not \nfor themselves or their children, then for their grandchildren and \ngreat grandchildren. My dear friends Christopher and Dana Reeve, whom \nwe lost in the past several years, were eloquent, passionate advocates \nfor this research. Christopher, from his wheelchair, performed his \ngreatest role after his accident, to try and bring the best of American \ningenuity to bear on the worst kinds of illnesses and diseases.\n  I respect my friends on the other side of the aisle who come to the \nfloor with grave doubts and heartfelt concerns. This is a balancing act \nand we must never lose sight of our ethics and values. But we can \nstrike that balance--and I believe we have in this bill.\n  When the promise of embryonic stem cell research became apparent in \nthe 1990s, the Clinton administration, working through the National \nBioethics Advisory Commission and the NIH, examined the ethical and \nmedical issues involved with such research.\n  In September 1999, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission \nreleased its report, ``Ethical Issues in Human Stem Cells Research.'' \nIn this report, it recommended that research using cells from embryos \ncreated, but not used for, infertility treatment, should be eligible to \nreceive Federal funding.\n  By August of 2000, the NIH had released guidelines for research using \nstem cells. These guidelines would have allowed funding for research \nfrom lines derived from embryos voluntarily donated which would have \notherwise been discarded. These recommendations are followed in this \nbill, which also includes funding for non-embryonic stem cell research, \nsuch as work with stem cells derived from amniotic fluid.\n  As we wade into these new scientific waters, we must always be \nsteered by our values and morals, which is why I have stood against, \nand voted to ban, human cloning. We must make a strong legal and \nethical stand, but we cannot simply stand still as scientific \nopportunity passes us by and new cures remain just out of reach.\n  I applaud the leadership of Senators Harkin, Specter, and Kennedy on \nthis bill. I am hopeful that we can send the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act to the President, and end the ban on research and hope \nfor Americans looking to us to fund the next great medical discoveries.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as we debate this important legislation \nregarding stem cell research, we are reminded of the millions of \npatients and families across America who await treatment and cures for \nour most deadly and tragic diseases. Scientists believe that over half \nof Americans over 85 may suffer from Alzheimer's disease, and at least \nhalf a million Americans currently have Parkinson's disease. People of \nall ages suffer from spinal cord injuries, diabetes and other chronic \nconditions. As we all know, these kinds of serious diagnoses affect not \nonly the patient, but that patient's family, friends, and community.\n  I am a strong supporter and proud cosponsor of the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act. I have heard from many of my constituents in Wisconsin \nin support of this legislation, and I am glad that the Senate is again \naddressing this issue and responding to the requests of millions across \nthe country. It is important that we approve this legislation as \nexpeditiously as possible, and provide the resources that scientists \nneed to develop treatments and cures for these diseases. Millions of \npatients and their families across the Nation cannot afford to wait any \nlonger for enactment of this urgently needed legislation.\n  Researchers believe that they can unlock enormous potential in stem \ncell research if Congress and the President will only give them the \nkeys. At the University of Wisconsin in 1998, Dr. James Thomson became \nthe first scientist to break into this new frontier by isolating human \nembryonic stem cells. Since then, researchers at the University have \ncontinued to be leaders in this science. But despite the incredible \npromise this research holds, it has been limited by the President since \n2001. As others have noted, even Story Landis, director of the NIH's \nNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and interim \nchair of the agency's stem cell task force, acknowledges that the \nPresident's stem cell policy is holding back potential breakthroughs. \nCongress must act to provide more stem cell lines to scientists so that \nthis research can go forward, without the Federal Government standing \nin the way.\n  The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act would allow federally funded\n\n[[Page S4355]]\n\nresearch to be conducted on stem cell lines derived from excess embryos \noriginally created for in vitro fertilization--IVF--that are no longer \nneeded and are donated by couples for research. It is estimated that \nthere are hundreds of thousands of embryos created for fertility \ntreatments that could be used for research and will otherwise be \ndestroyed. This bill does not interfere with alternative stem cell \nresearch, but it supports all avenues of research within the ethical \nlimits Congress has already established. This bill will open doors for \nscientists to access new, healthy, uncontaminated stem cell lines that \nare currently off-limits to federally funded research under President \nBush's restrictions.\n  The embryos that could potentially be used for research are those \nthat will never be implanted. Thanks to this legislation, embryos that \nwould otherwise be discarded could be used for research that could save \npain and suffering for millions of people, and the lives of millions \nmore.\n  While I support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, I have \nconcerns about the other bill we are considering today, S. 30. The \nlanguage in that bill has not been properly vetted through the \nscientific community, and it is unclear what effect it might have. S. \n30 could potentially limit the scope of current research, even further \nrestricting the availability of stem cells for federally funded \nresearch. For these reasons, I oppose this legislation.\n  There is much work that needs to be done to further understand the \nrole that embryonic stem cells can play in providing answers to some of \nthe most troubling medical diseases and conditions that affect so many \nAmericans. The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act will help our \nNation's researchers get closer to unlocking what this research holds \nby increasing the quantity and quality of stem cells lines available \nfor research.\n  Embryonic stem cell research is very important to me and to \nWisconsin. I am proud that the University of Wisconsin has played a \nprominent role in stem cell research in this country. I know that my \nconstituents, and Americans across the country, are eagerly awaiting \nthe benefits that this research will provide.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this incredibly \nimportant science which would expand our research horizons, and bring \nhope to so many people.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Hope \nOffered through Principled and Ethical Stem Cell Research Act, S. 30.\n  My objection to this bill is simple. This legislation will do nothing \nto overturn President Bush's failed policy that is restricting access \nto viable stem cell lines.\n  The United States Senate must be very careful when incorporating \nscientific concepts, and scientific definitions, into legislation. This \nbill relies on the notion of so-called ``naturally dead'' embryos to \nprovide viable stem cells. It defines these embryos as:\n\n       having naturally and irreversibly lost the capacity for \n     integrated cellular division, growth, and differentiation \n     that is characteristic of an organism, even if some cells of \n     the former organism may be alive in a disorganized state.\n\n  We do not know what the implications of this definition may \nultimately be. And the fact is, neither do many scientists. As the \nleadership of The American Society for Cell Biology wrote yesterday,\n\n       Naturally dead is a scientifically meaningless idea. To our \n     knowledge, there is no scientifically credible way to \n     determine this.\n\n  They continue:\n\n       It is critically important that the Senate proceed with \n     caution as it continues its work in the area of scientific \n     policy. Legislation based on inaccurate science could have a \n     detrimental impact on the course of the American biomedical \n     research enterprise.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.).\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I could not agree more. This debate should be about \nproviding Federal funding, and a consistent policy, for embryonic stem \ncell research. It is not the place of the U.S. Senate to rely on \nconcepts and definitions that are ``scientifically meaningless.''\n  The truly important vote will occur on the passage of S. 5, the only \nlegislation that will reverse what the majority of Americans, and the \nmajority of the medical and scientific community believe to be a flawed \npolicy.\n  S. 30 will very clearly leave in place President Bush's August 9, \n2001 Executive Order, which limits Federal funding to stem lines \nderived before that date. We need to overturn this policy, not affirm \nit.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing S. 30.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                          The American Society for\n\n\n                                                 Cell Biology,\n\n                                     Bethesda, MD, April 10, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Reid: We would like to express our views about \n     the upcoming Senate debate on stem cell research, as the \n     President and Public Policy Committee Chair respectively for \n     the American Society for Cell Biology. Our nonprofit, \n     professional society of more than 11,000 members includes \n     many of the leading scientists working in this area.\n       As you know, it is critically important that science policy \n     be carefully crafted to allow ethically sound scientific \n     research to proceed. This is particularly difficult to do \n     when the science behind the policy is as complicated as in \n     the current policy debate on stem cell research.\n       We are particularly concerned about a major provision of \n     S.30, the ``Hope Offered through Principled and Ethical Stem \n     Cell Research Act.'' The expressed purpose of S.30 is to \n     ``promote the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines \n     without the creation of human embryos for research purposes \n     and without the destruction, discarding of, or risk of injury \n     to a human embryo or embryos other than those that are \n     naturally dead.''\n       S.30 relies on the false premise that scientists can \n     determine whether a human embryo is ``naturally dead.'' \n     However, naturally dead is a scientifically meaningless idea. \n     To our knowledge, there is no scientifically credible way to \n     determine this. In fact, we think that to establish \n     sufficiently precise scientific or clinical standards about \n     the quality of embryos at the very early stages of \n     development would require experiments that the bill itself \n     would not permit.\n       It is critically important that the Senate proceed with \n     caution as it continues its work in the area of science \n     policy. Legislation based on inaccurate science could have a \n     detrimental impact on the course of the American biomedical \n     research enterprise. Not only do we risk driving research and \n     researchers to other countries more interested in cutting \n     edge research but we also delay the day when our fellow \n     Americans who suffer from some of the most debilitating \n     diseases finally realize the benefits of scientific \n     research.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bruce Alberts,\n                                                        President.\n     Larry Goldstein,\n                                   Chair, Public Policy Committee.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today we made an important step forward \nfor the hope of millions of patients and their families.\n  Unfortunately, with this important step forward, there was also a \nsmall step backward.\n  I had initially stated that I would vote in favor of S. 30, but after \ncarefully reviewing the language, I decided to vote against it.\n  I will ask to have printed in the Record a letter from the Joint \nSteering Committee on Public Policy that supports S. 5 and opposes S. \n30.\n  The Joint Committee is a group made up of the American Society for \nCell Biology, the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the \nGenetics Society of America, Science Service, and the Society for \nNeuroscience.\n  Many of us here believed that S. 30 was a harmless bill.\n  After all, it is an initiative that would show we are supportive of \nall forms of embryonic stem cell research.\n  And I believe that some still feel that way.\n  But after hearing from a variety of research organizations and \nscientists, I have serious reservations.\n  After carefully reviewing the legislation, it is now clear that S. 30 \nsends the wrong message to the scientific community.\n  S. 30 puts forth a number of scientific issues that negatively \nposition the scientific debate around what constitutes life and death \nand raises concepts that may not even be scientifically defined.\n  As elected officials discussing complex science issues, we are \nalready in somewhat unfamiliar territory.\n  If we are to delve deeper into this discussion and the details of it, \nwe need the scientific community on our side.\n  I stand for the advancement of medical research and I hope that this \nvote has made it clear.\n\n[[Page S4356]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the aforementioned \nletter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Joint Steering Committee\n\n\n                                            for Public Policy,\n\n                                      Bethesda, MD, April 9, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: On behalf of the Joint Steering \n     Committee for Public Policy (JSCPP), I would like to express \n     our support for S. 5, the ``Stem Cell Research Enhancement \n     Act of 2007.'' S. 5 would expand the current federal policy \n     regarding federally funded embryonic stem cell research to \n     allow the use of cells derived since August, 2001, from \n     embryos originally generated for reproductive purposes that \n     would otherwise be destroyed.\n       I would also like to express the JSCPP's opposition to S. \n     30, the ``Hope Offered through Principled and Ethical Stem \n     Cell Research Act.'' The purpose of S. 30 is to ``promote the \n     derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines without the \n     creation of human embryos for research purposes and without \n     the destruction, discarding of, or risk of injury to a human \n     embryo or embryos other than those that are naturally dead.''\n       S. 5 represents an important step forward for human \n     embryonic stem cell research, a new field that offers great \n     promise for the replacement of damaged cells, the \n     understanding of the mechanics of disease, and the \n     development and testing of new drugs. Unfortunately, current \n     federal policy, in place since 2001, has not kept pace with \n     the speed of scientific discovery and is today of limited \n     value to the scientific community, a position endorsed by the \n     Director of the National Institutes of Health, Elias \n     Zerhouni, at a recent Senate appropriations hearing.\n       While the JSCPP is supportive of S. 5, we strongly oppose \n     S. 30. S. 30 is proposed as an alternative to S. 5, but \n     contains no substantial measure to reverse current \n     limitations on embryonic stem cell research and simply \n     endorses research avenues that are already open under current \n     law. We oppose the bill because it contains unnecessary \n     provisions and places confusing and short-sighted \n     restrictions on biomedical research.\n       The prohibitions in S. 30 against the use of government \n     funds to derive stem cells with methods that generate embryos \n     for research purposes or that involve the destruction of \n     embryos are unnecessary, because the annual Departments of \n     Labor, Health & Human Services and Education Appropriations \n     bill has, for many years, included the same prohibitions.\n       Furthermore, the central provision of S. 30 appears to \n     allow research on embryos considered to be ``naturally \n     dead.'' We are particularly concerned about this requirement \n     because the term ``naturally dead'' is not a scientific term, \n     and there are no scientific or clinical standards for \n     determining the quality of embryos at the early stages of \n     embryonic development.\n       We are also concerned about the provision in S. 30 that \n     requires a priority to be placed on research ``with the \n     greatest potential for near-term clinical benefit.'' Not only \n     is it impossible to know the benefits of research in advance, \n     but limiting the scope of research in this way places a \n     muzzle on the scientific process, placing short-term \n     incremental advances ahead of the more challenging goals of \n     preventing or curing diseases such as diabetes.\n       For these reasons, we believe that passage of S. 30 would \n     be a significant step backwards for human embryonic stem cell \n     research and for biomedical research in America. Therefore, \n     we urge a ``yea'' vote on S. 5 and a ``no'' vote on S. 30.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Harold Varmus, MD,\n\n                                   Chair, Joint Steering Committee\n                                                for Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Will the Presiding Officer give us the allocation of \ntime remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 31 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Thirty-one minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-one. The Senator from Kansas has 25 \nminutes. The Senators from Minnesota and Georgia have 45 minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. With all due respect, Mr. President, we reached an \nagreement at the end of the previous time that we would equally divide \n2 hours 30 minutes between Senator Harkin, Senator Brownback, Senator \nColeman, and Senator Reid. We are in the fourth of those 30-minute \nblocks now, which would be ours, and then we go to four 10-minute \nblocks equally divided; is that correct?\n  I believe I am correct. How much of our time do we have left of the \n30-minute block?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five minutes for the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield 10 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the Senator \nfrom New York. As a practicing physician and somebody who has delivered \nover 4,000 children, I cared for both toddlers and young adults with \ntype 1 diabetes. There is nobody who doesn't want to see that disease \nfixed. The problem is, we shouldn't promise things we don't know are \naccurate.\n  What we do know is that yesterday on CNN, an article was released \nfrom JAMA showing the treatment of 13 young Brazilians who had type 1 \ndiabetes who are now free from using exogenous insulin. They are on no \nmedicine whatsoever and their sugar is totally controlled. That is one \nstep going forward in all the areas of medicine.\n  The other comment I will make before I make my final points is, if \nyou talk to anybody in the area of research on Alzheimer's--\nAlzheimer's, and we heard it time and time again, is a devastating \ndisease for individuals who have it, and it is a devastating disease \nfor families who care for their loved ones with it--I don't know of \nanybody in embryonic stem cell research or in research in medicine by \nthemselves who has great hopes for a cure of Alzheimer's with embryonic \nstem cells. We have heard that claim time and time again. It is not a \ngreat hope for Alzheimer's. There is hope. There is beta secretase, \nwhich is an enzyme that causes Alzheimer's to be laid down. There are \ngreat medicines coming forward. Some are in trials in primates right \nnow that tend to stop Alzheimer's in its tracks.\n  We ought not to be promising things we don't know or are not \nrealistic in terms of Alzheimer's. That is the case.\n  I want to sum up where we are, the differences between the two bills. \nOne bill, S. 5, has lots of positives in it. We hear it is not going to \ndestroy any other embryos, there is going to be a grandfather of the \nembryos that have been created since. We heard the Senator from New \nYork say something different. We heard the Senator from California \nyesterday talk about the 400,000 embryos that are frozen today, of \nwhich only 2.8 percent are available and less than that number--so less \nthan 250 lines--could totally be created out of all the embryos that \nare available in this country today.\n  The answers are kind of sleight of hand. To have an effective \nembryonic stem cell program, other than what is provided in S. 30, \nmeans we are going to use Federal taxpayer dollars, indirectly or \ndirectly, to destroy embryos. You can say you are not, but the fact is \nthat will happen.\n  What are the positives of S. 30? The positives of S. 30 are that it \nlooks at everything. It looks at all the new and upcoming methods. One \nis altered nuclear transfer. No. 1, you don't destroy any embryo, you \ndon't create an embryo, but yet you get identical cells to what an \nembryonic stem cell would be, totally pluripotent, totally capable of \ndoing everything an embryonic stem cell can do.\n  Why is there resistance to that? Why would there be any resistance to \nthat? There shouldn't be.\n  The second point is what we call germ cell pluripotent stem cells. \nThose are made from the testes and ovaries of us, each of us, and we \ncan have treatments designed for ourselves. Every tissue type in the \nbody has now been produced from germ cell pluripotent stem cells, \neither ovarian or testicular, again, applying the same pluripotent stem \ncells you get from an embryo, but you never destroy a life.\n  My friend from Minnesota, one of the coauthors of this bill, makes a \ngreat point. Whatever happens at the end of the day--right now this \nglass of water represents what is happening on embryonic stem cell \nresearch with Government funds in this country. There is a whole lot of \nother research going on with embryonic stem cells outside the \nGovernment. It has not dead stopped. As a matter of fact, it is \nadvancing forcefully without Government money. But this represents what \nis there. If S. 5 is passed out of this body and the House, this is \nwhat we will see next year: the same amount, because this bill is going \nto be vetoed.\n  However, if S. 30 is passed, what we will see is this much research, \na doubling of the research next year. So one says help people play the \npolitical game when we know it is going to be\n\n[[Page S4357]]\n\nvetoed. S. 30 says let's do something real. Let's give an answer to the \nhope. Let's double it up and let's do it in a way that is an ethically \ngood way.\n  The final point I wish to make is to anybody who wants us to do \nembryonic stem cell research, anybody who has a family member with a \nchronic disease, anybody who has a child with diabetes, anybody who has \nany need that has hope coming from ``embryonic stem cell research,'' \nthe question I put forward to them is this: If we can show you the \nscience is going to give us exactly the same results with never \ndestroying an embryo, what would your choice be--destroy an embryo and \nget the results or do not destroy an embryo and go one of the multitude \nother ways to accomplish exactly the same purpose?\n  That is the real question that is facing this body. That is the \nquestion the American people ask. The science is 2 to 3 years ahead of \nthe debate in this body today.\n  A lot of times my colleagues accuse me of not making much sense on \nthe floor when I talk about these issues because it is a medical issue, \nit is a scientific issue. I am a doctor. I understand the science, so I \ntend to not use the words as plainly as I should. But the \nethical question still arises: Do you want a doubling of the research \nto go forward and answer the very human need that is out there or do \nyou want to play the political game and have exactly what we have \ntoday?\n\n  I say to Senator Harkin, that is what will happen if S. 5 goes \nthrough. It is going to be vetoed. It will not be overridden in the \nHouse. Or we can have S. 30 that does as much or more than S. 5 and we \nwill see a difference for the American people.\n  The hope my colleagues talk about will be realized when S. 30 gets \npassed, when S. 30 gets signed. The President has said he will sign it. \nIt makes available everything we will need and still accomplishes the \nsame goals but does it twice as fast. That is the real question: Do we \nwant to play politics with this issue? Do we want to say somebody's \nlegitimate position of valuing life, that they have an illegitimate \nposition because they value life at the expense of somebody with \nchronic disease, or can they value life, come with an answer that \nactually accomplishes the same purpose in a better timeframe with \nbetter results with S. 30? That is the real question for us.\n  I understand the political game we are playing. I understand the \ndiseases. But when you read the basic raw research that is going \nforward today, we are not even close to what is happening, we are not \neven talking about what is happening out there.\n  Final point. Make sure you understand that if you believe in \nembryonic stem cell research as a viable ethical alternative, you also \nhave to believe in cloning because the only way you will get a \ntreatment that is good for you without rejection, without rejecting the \nvery treatment that is being given to you, is for you to clone \nyourself. That is the dirty little secret nobody wants to talk about in \nthis debate because once we accomplish with true embryonic stem cells \nversus altered nuclear transfer, any treatment will require \nantirejection drugs or you having to clone yourself.\n  The language is very specific. There is no cloning as far as \nimplanting into a uterus, but it doesn't mean you don't clone yourself \nand destroy yourself to meet a need for you.\n  It is a very complicated ethical issue about which we ought to be \nvery clear. It is not just destroying embryos. It is going the next \nstep now to have an effect from that treatment.\n  I believe there will be good treatments come out of embryonic stem \ncell research. I don't have any doubt about that. I believe exactly \nthose same treatments will come and be better from altered nuclear \ntransfer, from dedifferentiation, which is a term that says you take a \ncell that is more mature and dedifferentiate it back to a pluripotent \ncell, or from germ cells, either ovarian or testicular.\n  We can accomplish the desires of everybody who is hurting in our \ncountry today who has a hope and do it in a realistic way with S. 30 \nthat will deliver the goods, deliver taxpayers' dollars to make a \ndifference. S. 5 will deliver nothing, nothing for at least 2 years, \nbecause this President won't sign it.\n  So the consequence and the question that comes back to us is: Are we \ngoing to do something that is meaningful or are we going to play the \npolitical game that in the long term has no meaning, at least for the \nnext 2 years?\n  I yield back my time to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I yield up to 15 minutes of our time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota, Mr. Coleman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma, who \nbrings a physician's perspective. We hear so often on the floor of the \nSenate that we need to look in the eyes of young kids with juvenile \ndiabetes and say: Are we doing all we can do? My colleague from \nOklahoma has dealt with that on a regular basis. He stands with me, and \nI thank him for his support.\n  In the end, there is a practical conclusion, as he demonstrated with \nthe glasses of water. If you want an answer, if you want to look those \nkids in the eyes, talk to the families of folks with ALS or heart \ndisease, if you support S. 30, you can look them in the eye and say: \nToday I have done what I can do to move the science forward, to have \nadditional Federal support for embryonic stem cell research but \nresearch which, in the end, is unifying research.\n  Dr. William Hurlbut, who is one of the authors of a technique known \nas altered nuclear transfer, used a phrase that I borrowed. It is an \nisland of unity and a sea of controversy. That is what S. 30 offers, an \nisland of unity and a sea of controversy. There is disagreement in this \ncountry about the use of Federal dollars for the destruction of a human \nembryo. That is a reality. In the end, scientific advancement should be \nsomething that is unifying. It shouldn't be tearing this country apart. \nYou shouldn't worry, if you are going into a hospital for some kind of \ntreatment, whether there is some moral line that has been crossed for \nyou as an individual. You shouldn't have to do that. We shouldn't put \npeople in that position.\n  The good news is we don't have to. It is fascinating. I think the \nscience has gotten ahead of the politics. I have no doubt, as I \nlistened to this debate, these are people of good will on both sides of \nthis debate, supporting both proposals, but I believe the same ultimate \nkind of vision to improve quality of life, to enhance scientific \nresearch, to put an end to debilitating and threatening disease and \nillness, is the kind of common bond we have, people of good will.\n  I suppose a number of years ago, individuals of good will, good moral \nbackground, religious background, may have come to a conclusion that \nthey would support the destruction of a human embryo for the \nopportunity to do good today for someone who is here. It is a line some \nof us can't cross. We bring deeply held moral perspectives to this \nissue. I understand others of good faith and strong character, solid \nreligious background and belief, say this is the line, this is the \nright thing to do.\n  I heard my colleagues on the other side quote scriptures and pastors \nand others--my friends, of good will, and good heart. In the past, that \nmay have been the only path to where we wanted to go.\n  The Clinton administration looked at this. In fact, this is the \nlanguage they used. In 1999, President Clinton's National Bioethics \nAdvisory Commission issued a report entitled ``Ethical Issues in Human \nStem Cell Research'' acknowledging that a week-old human embryo is a \nform of human life that deserves respect. The Commission stated:\n\n       In our judgment, the derivation of stem cells from embryos \n     remaining following infertility treatments--\n\n  These are the embryos we are talking about here, IVF--\n\n     is justifiable only if no less morally problematic \n     alternatives are available for advancing the research.\n\n  Science has moved ahead of where we were in 1999. I was on the phone \na little while ago with a Dr. Landry from, I believe, Columbia \nUniversity. Dr. Landry talked about a stem cell line coming from dead \nembryos that has all the capacity, pluripotency of the stem cell lines \nfrom fertility clinics. So a ``less morally problematic alternative'' \nis available.\n  My friend and colleague from Georgia, the coauthor of this \nlegislation,\n\n[[Page S4358]]\n\nknows from Georgia experience that scientists worked on dead embryos. I \nthought about it, and I believe it is part of the 21 lines the \nPresident authorized for embryo research. The work is being done. The \nreality is there are cell lines available today that are not eligible \nfor Federal funding. That is because we have a policy that says no \nFederal funding for embryo stem cell research. But if we pass S. 30, \nand S. 30 gets signed into law, then we have available Federal funding \nfor embryonic stem cell research that would not be available today.\n  That is then ``morally less problematic'' because it does not involve \nthe destruction of a human embryo.\n  When we talk about a dead embryo, my colleague from Georgia has done \na very good job. My colleagues may have said: It is a dead embryo. What \ncan you get out of a dead embryo? Let me explain two concepts. They are \nat the heart of this debate. I am not a scientist, but I have learned a \nlot about pluripotency, the capacity of a cell to give rise to many \ndifferent cell types. Embryonic stem cells, those that have come from \nin vitro fertilization clinics, they have pluripotency. They have this \nelastic capacity to recreate any kind of cell. So maybe sometime in the \nfuture you can create stronger heart muscles. Today, in fact, with some \ntypes of stem cell research, that is being done. Maybe you can grow \nlimbs. Maybe you can cure ALS. There is an incredible capacity, \npluripotency.\n  There is also this concept of totipotency. Totipotency is the \ncapability of a zygote or other cell to develop into a complete, \nintegrated human being. The line we are talking about today between S. \n5 and S. 30 is the line between pluripotency and totipotency. We all \nsupport research that will provide for pluripotent stem cells, \npluripotent cells that have the capacity to be almost anything.\n  The dividing line, though, is whether you have totipotency, so with a \nhuman embryo, cells that are involved in a fertility clinic--I am going \nto switch charts and talk about a couple of other techniques that \ninvolve pluripotency but not totipotency. What we look at with dead \nembryos are cells that are pluripotent. I don't know if it is a great \nanalogy, but even after death we can harvest organs that have the \nability to serve the function you want them to serve. So dead embryos \nare embryos that have no totipotency but have pluripotency. You get \npluripotent cells.\n  The other approach is an approach known as altered nuclear transfer. \nThat, by the way--I say ``the approach.'' There are a number of other \napproaches out there. My colleague from Oklahoma talked about that. I \nthink he talked about dedifferentiation, talked about germs--there are \na number of different procedures and techniques that have strong \nscientific support that allow us to produce pluripotent cells without \ntotipotency. They allow us to produce embryonic stem cells that have \nall the capacity for research that gives the hope we are talking about \nwithout creating a human embryo that does not involve, then, the taking \nof human life; that does not involve the moral line that many Americans \nfeel is there.\n  Not all. There is a difference in this. That is why I am saying, what \nS. 30 does is it gives us this island of unity in the sea of \ncontroversy. What it does is allow all of us--and I do hope all my \ncolleagues, wherever you are on this issue--support for S. 30. Why \nwould you be opposed to Federal funding for embryonic stem cell \nresearch that advances us?\n  My colleague from Oklahoma used the two glasses of water. If you \nsupport S. 5, all you are going to get tomorrow--in January 2008, S. 5 \npasses. It passes in the Senate, passes in the House, it is vetoed. We \nhave this much right now--I believe it is about $130 million. That is \nwhat this glass represents in research, embryonic stem cell research. \nThose are the 20-something lines left the President authorized.\n  In January of 2008 you are going to get $132 million of federally \nfunded stem cell research. But if we pass S. 30, what we have then is \nthe opportunity for research in a range of other areas, perhaps \ndoubling and maybe more--I would hope much more--of stem cell research, \nor pluripotent stem cells, to get the capacity to do all the treatments \nand provide the hope.\n  We are, by the way, a long way away in reality from human treatments, \nbut it is hope. That is what this bill is, this is the HOPE bill.\n  One of the other mechanisms we talked about is altered nuclear \ntransfer. Just to explain, in the natural fertilization process, \nbiology 101, you have the sperm, you have the egg, you get the \nfertilized egg, and you get the embryo.\n  In the clone what you have is the egg cell, you enucleate it--you \ntake out the center. This may come from a fingernail or skin, whatever, \na cell with all the DNA, and you insert it into this enucleated egg. \nYou activate it and then you get an embryo. I think that is the way \nDolly the sheep came about.\n  By the way, my colleague from Oklahoma talked about this. If we are \ngoing to do stem cell research from here, and we are going to take this \nembryo and we are going to create stem cells and we put that into you \nor me, you are going to have an immune reaction, and your whole life--\nif you put this in you, you are, for your whole life, going to have to \ndeal with immune reaction suppression and the drugs. The only way \naround that is the Dolly approach. If you create stem cells from your \nown cells there is no immune reaction.\n  We are not talking about that, although there are those of us who \nraise the concern: How do you get ultimately where you want to go \nwithout that possibility?\n  Another way is the altered nuclear transfer. You take the genetic \nmaterial, the somatic cell, fingernail or something, and what you do \nbefore you insert it into this enucleated egg is touch off a trigger \nmechanism that shuts off the ability to create the embryo, but it still \ncreates an inner cell mass with pluripotent cells--the capacity of a \ncell to give rise to many different types of cells. Do all the research \nyou want.\n  So S. 5 provides funding for new stem cell research. It provides the \nopportunity to do all that one wants to do without crossing the moral \nline. Why wouldn't we get there?\n  My great fear is that what will happen this year is what happened \nlast year. In the Senate there was a bill, the Specter-Santorum bill, \nwhich, by the way, did not provide for all that we have in S. 30. It \ndid not provide for the dead embryo research. I think it may have \nprovided for some sort of ANT. The good news is that is included in S. \n5, but S. 5 is going to be vetoed so that doesn't go anywhere.\n  Last year that passed, 100 to 0, a bill with some alternative \nmeasures. But, again, we have gone way beyond last year, this year, in \nterms of the science.\n  The House refused to hear it. They took an all-or-nothing approach: \nIf you don't support the destruction of a human embryo to do stem cell \nresearch we are not passing anything. Where is the hope in that? As you \nlook at this I challenge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nto tell their colleagues in the House: Give hope, the hope we have \ntalked about on this floor, the hope we all agree on, the hope that \nthere is just consensus on that we want to move the research forward. \nDo not let some kind of politics that I cannot understand stop us from \nmoving forward with the opportunity to move research that can produce \nhope.\n  There are many scientists who have kind of said: Yes, we looked at \nANT and we know it can work and we need to put our efforts into that. I \nwill read a couple of quotes:\n\n       Research results suggest that altered nuclear transfer may \n     be able to produce human pluripotent stem cells--in a manner \n     that is simpler and more efficient than current methods.\n\n  That is by Hans Scholer, chair of the Department of Cell and \nDevelopmental Biology at the Max Planck Institute in Germany.\n\n       Recently, multiple labs in the United States and from \n     around the world have published or reported experiments in \n     which adult cells were converted not to embryos but directly \n     to pluripotent embryonic-like cells. The resulting cells were \n     virtually indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells derived \n     from embryos. The techniques used included altered nuclear \n     transfer, cell fusion and chemical reprogramming. The results \n     were obtained from top scientists in the field and published \n     in the best journals.\n\n  That was by Markus Grompe, M.D., Oregon Stem Cell Center.\n  It is fascinating, those scientists that support just embryonic stem \ncell research without anything, they will tell\n\n[[Page S4359]]\n\nyou nothing else works; this is the whole ball of wax; my way or the \nhighway. Then you have scientists who support these alternatives who \nsay: Yes, this is the best way to go.\n  Maybe it is about Federal funding. Maybe if you don't believe your \nway is the only way you are not going to get Federal dollars. We have \nto get past the politics. We have to get past the petty scientific \ndivisions and simply look at what we have out there and embrace and \nseize the opportunity to move forward in a way that is cohesive, that \ngets this Nation outside of the culture wars, outside of the battles \nover Federal funding for the destruction of human life. Put it aside. \nWe don't have to go there today. Science is offering us a better path.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I urge my colleagues to take a look at S. 30, regardless \nof where you are on S. 5. This is a bill that deserves unanimous \nsupport. In the end, let's work on our friends and colleagues in the \nHouse to pass the law so that we have, in the end, one the President \nwill sign, one which offers and delivers true hope.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. How much of our time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 17 minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I will acknowledge, given the agreement we previously \nmade, I think I will only take 5 of those. I recognize myself for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I acknowledge the patience of the Presiding Officer. I \nknow the Presiding Officer was in the chair last night when the Senator \nfrom Iowa and I had an exchange. I want to repeat some of what was \nsaid, so I apologize to the distinguished Presiding Officer, but in the \nend I want to try to synthesize what got me to the point of being a \npart of S. 30.\n  In August 2001, when the directive came down, I started learning \nabout stem cells. When the veto took place last year, I wondered what \nmore I needed to know to try to find a way to deal with the concerns of \nsome but the compassion of everyone. I stumbled upon a professor at the \nUniversity of Georgia, Dr. Steven Stice. I really didn't stumble upon \nhim; one of my interns, an honor student, directed me to him. He said \nhe was doing research in this area.\n  As it turned out, he was operating three stem cell lines, lines BGO1, \nBGO2, and BGO3. So I went to the university and spent 2 days going \nthrough what their research team was doing and the way in which they \nwere derived. I came to learn that Dr. Stice and his team, like teams \nin California, Wisconsin, and other States that have since derived \nembryonic stem cells this way, derived them from what is known as \nnaturally dead or arrested embryos. Those are embryos that after 7 days \nfollowing in vitro fertilization stopped cellular division. The embryo \nitself is clinically dead, as is a human being who is brain dead, \nalthough all their other organs are working. But contained within that \nembryo are stem cells. So it has gone through a natural death, not one \nat the hands of a doctor or anyone else, and it produces these stem \ncells.\n  After reading everything I could on it, I want to read one sentence \nfrom just one study which verified the pluripotency, the \nundifferentiation, and the independence of those lines:\n\n       Lines BGO1, BGO2, and BGO3, human embryonic stem cells are, \n     therefore, independent, undifferentiated and pluripotent \n     lines that can be maintained without an accumulation of \n     karyotypic abnormalities.\n\n  It took a long time to practice those last two words and say them \nright, but what that practically means is exactly what we all seek.\n  That is, embryonic stem cells that have the full potential for \nresearch, to answer the hope all of us in this room have expressed \ntoday, can, in fact, be derived from embryos that are not destroyed by \nthe human hand but through the natural process of the life cycle.\n  So I asked myself this question: Well, if this is a legitimate \ndebate--which it is a legitimate debate--if science has found there is \na way to derive these stem cells without the destruction of the embryo, \nand if--which is true--5 of the 21 lines currently exempted by the \nPresidential order of 2001, are, in fact, 5\\1/2\\ years of study side by \nside with stem cells derived by destroying the embryo, and if we have \nclear evidence they are undifferentiated, they are pluripotent, and \nthey do not have abnormalities, then this is the answer to thread the \nneedle to solve the problem.\n  The White House has acknowledged they will sign the bill. So with \nrespect for every Member of this Senate who has eloquently spoken on \nbehalf of the hope of furthering research, I do not know what the \nresults of the research are going to be, but I know this: If we do not \ndo it, we will never know, and if there is a way to do it and \naccelerate it and thread the needle, which this does, then I submit we \nshould do it.\n  I would encourage all of my colleagues to support S. 30.\n  I acknowledge the tremendous work of the Senator from Minnesota and \nothers who have helped. I appreciate the time allotted to us in this \ndebate. In the end, I think the most used word in the last 2 days has \nbeen ``hope.'' There is now a hope that we actually bring about the \nreality of scientific development for the cure of deadly and terrible \ndiseases and do so in a way that recognizes the natural process of the \nlife cycle and the advancement of the science.\n  With that, I yield back our time in this cycle.\n  Mr. President, my understanding is--I am going to repeat this--it is \nmy understanding that we now have a period of 30 minutes that is open, \nat which time, following that, each of the four designees will have a \nclosing 10 minutes.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Kansas is on the Senate floor. \nMy understanding of that 30-minute division, Senator Brownback, is you \nwould have up to 7\\1/2\\ minutes of that 30, and if--I would ask--I am \ngoing to try this. I ask unanimous consent that the next 30 minutes be \ndivided, with 15 minutes under the control of Senator Harkin, 7\\1/2\\ \nunder the control of Senator Brownback, 7\\1/2\\ under the control of \nmyself and Senator Coleman, and then the remaining 40 minutes would be \nequally divided between the four designees: Senator Harkin from Iowa, \nmyself and Senator Coleman, Senator Brownback, and Senator Reid, and \nthen lastly, the leaders will have 30 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. From what I understood of that agreement, I think the \nSenator from Kansas would have 7\\1/2\\ minutes, then the Senator from \nIowa would have 15, then I would have 7\\1/2\\. Is that fair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 7\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if the Chair would please remind me \nwhen I have a minute left of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do that.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I wish to start by entering into the Record four \ndocuments and briefly covering them as much as possible. I ask \nunanimous consent that all four of these documents appear directly \nafter my testimony.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibits 1 through 4.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. This first one is the list of 72 current clinical \napplications using adult stem cell therapy. No ethical problems on \nthese. Actually, the list now is 73. I will cover that in just a \nminute, but I want to get that in.\n  I want to back this letter up, or this statement up, with a letter \nthat appeared in the magazine Science, January 19, 2007, that was \nrefuting the article--that was a letter put forward by other \nindividuals questioning this level of adult stem cell therapy and \ntreatment.\n  Then this letter which was in the Journal of Science was backed up by \nthe third document we have here, which is a list of 14 pages of the \npeer-reviewed scientific articles on adult stem cell therapies and the \nbenefits those have produced.\n  Then the final document we have here in this stack that I will be \nputting forward is the article that just appeared out even today from \nJAMA, the Journal of American Medical Association, on Type 1 juvenile \ndiabetes being treated with the use of adult stem cells. The results--I \nam just going to\n\n[[Page S4360]]\n\nread these, because they are just so phenomenal, from this JAMA \narticle: During a 7- to 36-month followup, 14 patients became insulin \nfree; one for up to 35 months with this treatment.\n\n  This was an adult human stem cell treatment. One patient was not able \nto become insulin-independent.\n  The reason I cite that is it is such an exciting set of results. \nPeople have been talking on the floor a great deal about curing \ndiabetes. Here we have a JAMA article, as I have noted to my colleagues \nearlier. The unfortunate thing is the actual test took place in Brazil \ninstead of the United States even though it was designed and much of it \nwas done by U.S. scientists at Northwestern University and other \nplaces. The work should be being done in the United States.\n  Point one being, we don't have to go there with the taxpayer funding \ndestroying this young human life. I would hope my colleagues would say \nthat in and of itself is enough information for me to say we do not \nneed to cross this ethical boundary. The ethical boundary we are \ntalking about yet again is using taxpayer dollars to fund the \ndestruction of human life so we can research on these entities. Some \nwould refer to it as potential for human life; that is human life, so \nwe can research on it.\n  Do we want to cross that ethical boundary that has everybody in \nsomewhat of a question of whether they want to do this or not? I would \nsubmit, No. 1, we do not need to; we have routes to go that work. No. \n2, we should not do that in researching on human life because of the \nrespect we have and the dignity afforded to each and every human life \nat all stages, at all places, for the human existence this individuals \nhas.\n  Proverbs tell us this: There is a way that seems right to a man, but \nits end is the way of death. There is a way that seems right to a man, \nbut its end is the way of death.\n  That would seem to really highlight this debate--the way that seems \nright to a man. Let's just research on these embryos; they are going to \nbe disposed of anyway. Why not do it instead of throwing them away? Why \nnot do it instead of having them being adopted? Why not do it? Why not \nresearch on someone who is on death row? Why not?\n  There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of \ndeath. Well, we shouldn't because it does continue that continuation of \nus breaching human dignity--at a very early stage, granted, but \nnonetheless human by all definition of what a human species and an \nindividual is. It does breach that, and we should not go there with \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  As I have noted to my colleagues, it is legal to do in the United \nStates. States can fund it, private individuals can fund it. I have \nnoted to my colleagues that private individuals are not funding it. \nThey are not funding it because it is speculative, it is not producing \nresults, and it is producing tumors.\n  I have entered into the Record previously a large set of different \nstudies in various areas done by various groups. These embryonic stem \ncells are producing tumors. That is what is taking place. There is a \nway that seems right to a man, but its end is death. Do we want to put \ntumors in individuals? Is that the route we are going forward with? I \ndon't think so. I don't think we should.\n  I emphasize as well to my colleagues that we have another route to go \non this that we can work on together. I would hope we could work on the \namniotic fluid and banking of amniotic fluid. I think that would be an \nimportant key route for us to work together.\n  I am disturbed that at this point in time in the legislative session, \nthe first half of the year after an election, we are spending this \namount of time on a topic that is going to be vetoed--S. 5 is going to \nbe vetoed; unlikely that the veto override is going to occur; maybe it \nis going to be able to happen but unlikely--when we have other routes \nwe can work on that will work and will produce results. Are we going to \ncontinue this effort for division? It is all about dividing. It is all \nabout causing a fight and somebody scoring some political points, when \nwe have a hopeful route that is producing results that we can work on \ntogether, that we can get more funding for, and everybody wants cures \nand we can get more funding for this route which is working, and we can \nstart a new area in amniotic fluid and placenta or we can go along with \nmy colleagues from Georgia and Minnesota on a route upon which we can \nagree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I think we can do those things. Yet we continue down \nthis route of division. Why would we do that when in the balance sit \npatients in this country and around the world who seek our help? I have \nshown you many pictures of those who have gotten help but need more and \nare having to travel overseas for these treatments. Let's not force \nthem to do that.\n  Let's stop the politics of division. Let's start working together and \nhave a culture that respects human dignity. We can do that. Reject S. \n5.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     72 Current Human Clinical Applications Using Adult Stem Cells\n\n                       (List Updated March 2007)\n\n\n                    anemias & other blood conditions\n\n       Sickle cell anemia\n       Sideroblastic anemia\n       Aplastic anemia\n       Red cell aplasia (failure of red blood cell development)\n       Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia\n       Thalassemia (genetic [inherited] disorders all of which \n     involve underproduction of hemoglogin)\n       Primary amyloidosis (A disorder of plasma cells)\n       Diamond blackfan anemia\n       Fanconi's anemia\n       Chronic Epstein-Barr infection (similar to Mono)\n\n\n                          AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASES\n\n       Systemic lupus (auto-immune condition that can affect skin, \n     heart, lungs, kidneys, joints, and nervous system)\n       Sjogren's syndrome (autoimmune disease w/symptoms similar \n     to arthritis)\n       Myasthenia (An autoimmune neuromuscular disorder)\n       Autoimmune cytopenia\n       Scleromyxedema (skin condition)\n       Scleroderma (skin disorder)\n       Crohn's disease (chronic inflammatory disease of the \n     intestines)\n       Behcet's disease\n       Rheumatoid arthritis\n       Juvenile arthritis\n       Multiple sclerosis\n       Polychondritis (chronic disorder of the cartilage)\n       Systemic vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels)\n       Alopecia universalis\n       Buerger's disease (limb vessel constriction, inflammation)\n\n\n                            BLADDER DISEASE\n\n       End-stage bladder disease\n\n\n                                CANCERS\n\n       Brain tumors--medulloblastoma and glioma\n       Retinoblastoma (cancer)\n       Ovarian cancer\n       Skin cancer: Merkel cell carcinoma\n       Testicular cancer\n       Lymphoma\n       Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma\n       Hodgkin's lymphoma\n       Acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n       Acute myelogenous leukemia\n       Chronic myelogenous leukemia\n       Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia\n       Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia\n       Cancer of the lymph nodes: Angioimmunoblastic \n     lymphadenopathy Multiple myeloma (cancer affecting white \n     blood cells of the immune system)\n       Myelodysplasia (bone marrow disorder)\n       Breast cancer\n       Neuroblastoma (childhood cancer of the nervous system)\n       Renal cell carcinoma (cancer of the kidney)\n       Soft tissue sarcoma (malignant tumor that begins in the \n     muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, blood vessels)\n       Ewing's sarcoma\n       Various solid tumors\n       Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (type of lymphoma)\n       Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\n       POEMS syndrome (osteosclerotic myeloma)\n       Myelofibrosis\n\n\n                             CARDIOVASCULAR\n\n       Acute Heart damage\n       Chronic coronary artery disease\n\n\n                           IMMUNODEFICIENCIES\n\n       Severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome\n       X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome\n       X-linked hyper immunoglobulin M syndrome\n\n\n                             LIVER DISEASE\n\n       Chronic liver failure\n       Liver cirrhosis\n\n\n                NEURAL DEGENERATIVE DISEASES & INJURIES:\n\n       Parkinson's disease\n       Spinal cord injury\n       Stroke damage\n\n\n                                 OCULAR\n\n       Corneal regeneration\n\n\n                           WOUNDS & INJURIES\n\n       Limb gangrene\n\n[[Page S4361]]\n\n       Surface wound healing\n       Jawbone replacement\n       Skull bone repair\n\n\n                       OTHER METABOLIC DISORDERS\n\n       Hurler's syndrome (hereditary genetic disorder)\n       Osteogenesis imperfecta (bone/cartilage disorder)\n       Krabbe Leukodystrophy (hereditary genetic disorder)\n       Osteopetrosis (genetic bone disorder)\n       Cerebral X-linked adrenoleukodystroph\n\n       ``It is nearly certain that the [human] clinical benefits \n     of the [embryonic stem cell] research are years or decades \n     away.

(28 July 2006, p.439), S. Smith et al. claim that \n     we misrepresent a list of adult stem cell treatments \n     benefiting patients. But it is the Letter's authors who \n     misrepresent our statements and the published literature, \n     dismissing as irrelevant the many scientists and patients who \n     have shown the benefits of adult stem cells.\n       We have stated that adult stem cell applications have \n     ``helped,'' ``benefited,'' and ``improved'' patient \n     conditions. Smith et al.'s Supporting Online Material \n     repeatedly notes patient improvement from these cells. We \n     have never stated that these treatments are ``generally \n     available, ``cures,'' or ``fully tested in all required \n     phases of clinical trials and approved by the U.S. Food and \n     Drug Administration (FDA).'' Some studies do not require \n     prior FDA approval, and even the nine supposedly ``fully \n     approved'' treatments aclmowledged by Smith et al. would not \n     be considered ``cures'' or ``generally available'' to the \n     public at this stage of research.\n       The insistence that no benefit is real until after FDA \n     approval is misplaced. Such approval is not a medical \n     standard to evaluate patient benefit, but an agency \n     determination that benefits outweigh risks in a broad class \n     of patients. Physicians and patients use an evidentiary \n     standard. Our list of 72 applications, compiled from peer-\n     reviewed articles, documents observable and measurable \n     benefit to patients, a necessary step toward formal FDA \n     approval and what is expected of new, cutting-edge medical \n     applications.\n       Smith et al. also mislead regarding citations for \n     testicular cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, referring to \n     ``[t]he reference Prentice cites . . .'' as though only one \n     reference existed in each case, and not mentioning four other \n     references that, according to their own SOM, show ``improved \n     long-term survival'' of patients receiving adult stem cells. \n     There are currently 1238 FDA-approved clinical trials related \n     to adult stem cells, including at least 5 trials regarding \n     testicular cancer and over 24 trials with non-Hodgkin's \n     lymphoma. They also disregard studies showing successful \n     stimulation of endogenous cells for Parkinson's.\n       The ethical and political controversy surrounding embryonic \n     stem cell research makes scientific claims especially prone \n     to exaggeration or distortion. All such claims should receive \n     careful scrutiny, as recently acknowledged by the editors of \n     this journal after two articles claiming human ``therapeutic \n     cloning'' success were revealed to be fraudulent. This \n     scrutiny should be directed equally to all sides. We note \n     that two of our critics, Neaves and Teitelbaum, are founding \n     members of a political group whose Web site lists over 70 \n     conditions that ``could someday be treated or cured'' using \n     embryonic stem cells. High on this list is Alzheimer's \n     disease, acknowledged by experts as a ``very unlikely'' \n     candidate for stem cell treatments, with one NIH expert \n     describing such a scenario as a ``fairy tale''. The entire \n     list, in fact, is based on no evidence of benefit in any \n     human patient from embryonic stem cells and little evidence \n     for its claims in animal models. No one should promote the \n     falsehood that embryonic stem cell cures are imminent, for \n     this cruelly deceives patients and the public.\n\n                             CSC Exhibit 3\n\nPEER-REVIEWED REFERENCES SHOWING APPLICATIONS OF ADULT STEM CELLS THAT \n             PRODUCE THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT FOR HUMAN PATIENTS\n\n              Adult Stem Cells--Hematopoietic Replacement\n\n\n                                Cancers\n\n     Brain Tumors--medulloblastoma and glioma\n       Dunkel, IJ; ``High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem \n     cell rescue for malignant brain tumors''; Cancer Invest. 18, \n     492-493; 2000.\n       Abrey, LE et al.; ``High dose chemotherapy with autologous \n     stem cell rescue in adults with malignant primary brain \n     tumors''; J.

Foss, \n     MD, PhD; Elizabeth Squiers, MD; and Richard K. Burt, MD.\n       Context: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) results from a cell-\n     mediated autoimmune attack against pancreatic beta cells. \n     Previous animal and clinical studies suggest that moderate \n     immunosuppression in newly diagnosed type 1 DM can prevent \n     further loss of insulin production and can reduce insulin \n     needs.\n       Objective: To determine the safety and metabolic effects of \n     high-dose immunosuppression followed by autologous \n     nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation \n     (AHST) in newly diagnosed type 1 DM.\n       Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective phase 1/2 \n     study of 15 patients with type 1 DM (aged 14-31 years) \n     diagnosed within the previous 6 weeks by clinical findings \n     and hyperglycemia and confirmed with positive antibodies \n     against glutamic acid decarboxylase. Enrollment was November \n     2003-July 2006 with observation until February 2007 at the \n     Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit of the School of Medicine of \n     Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil. Patients with \n     previous diabetic ketoacidosis were excluded after the first \n     patient with diabetic ketoacidosis failed to benefit from \n     AHST. Hematopoietic stem cells were mobilized with \n     cyclophosphamide (2.0 g/m \\2\\) and granulocyte colony-\n     stimulating factor (10 mg/kg per day) and then collected from \n     peripheral blood by leukapheresis and cryopreserved. The \n     cells were injected intravenously after conditioning with \n     cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) and rabbit antithymocyte \n     globulin (4.5 mg/kg).\n       Main Outcome Measures: Morbidity and mortality from \n     transplantation and temporal changes in exogenous insulin \n     requirements (daily dose and duration of usage). Secondary \n     end points: serum levels of hemoglobin A1C, C-\n     peptide levels during the mixed-meal tolerance test, and \n     anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody titers measured \n     before and at different times following AHST.\n       Results: During a 7- to 36-month follow-up (mean 18.8),14 \n     patients became insulin-free (1 for 35 months, 4 for at least \n     21 months, 7 for at least 6 months; and 2 with late response \n     were insulin-free for 1 and 5 months, respectively). Among \n     those, 1 patient resumed insulin use 1 year after AHST. At 6 \n     months after AHST, mean total area under the C-peptide \n     response curve was significantly greater than the \n     pretreatment values, and at 12 and 24 months it did not \n     change. Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody levels \n     decreased after 6 months and stabilized at 12 and 24 months. \n     Serum levels of hemoglobin A1C were maintained at \n     less than 7% in 13 of 14 patients. The only acute severe \n     adverse effect was culture-negative bilateral pneumonia in 1 \n     patient and late endocrine dysfunction (hypothyroidism or \n     hypogonadism) in 2 others. There was no mortality.\n       Conclusions: High-dose immunosuppression and AHST were \n     performed with acceptable toxicity in a small number of \n     patients with newly diagnosed type 1 DM. With AHST, beta cell \n     function was increased in all but 1 patient and induced \n     prolonged insulin independence in the majority of the \n     patients.\n       Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: \n     NCT00315133.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes from this side.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak out in strong \nsupport of the promising research that can save lives and bring hope to \nmillions of Americans. I will vote for the Stem Cell Enhancement Act of \n2007, and I urge all of our colleagues to do so.\n  More importantly, I urge President Bush to finally hear the voices of \nscientists, medical leaders, patients, and more than 500 organizations \nthat have said loudly and clearly that it is time for promising \nresearch to move forward in this country. It is time to take the \nhandcuffs off of our scientists, those who say they will then be able \nto pursue what all Americans are hoping for and promising research for \nso many diseases that impact so many of our families. For too long, \nthis President has allowed politics and ideology to trump lifesaving \nresearch. We have to correct that mistake. The bill, S. 5, we are \nconsidering today shows us how.\n  Throughout this country, Americans are suffering from diseases such \nas Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and they and \ntheir families are looking to us for help. We have scientists and \nresearchers who are so eager to provide that help, but today, as we all \nknow, their hands are tied by the arbitrary restrictions President Bush \nimposed back in 2001.\n  I believe we can allow research on embryonic stem cells, and we can \ndo so with strong ethical guidelines that are required under this \nlegislation.\n  Back in August of 2001, President Bush greatly limited the number of \nembryonic stem cells that were available for federally funded research. \nThose limits were based on inaccurate science and ideology, and they \nhave restricted our ability to make progress. At the time, the White \nHouse said there were 78 stem cell lines available for federally funded \nresearch, but now we know there are only 21 such lines. Researchers, \nthose men and woman whom we count on to find cures to the diseases that \nimpact so many, believe it is imperative to have access to newer, more \npromising stem cell lines that do not pose the risk of contamination.\n  The first consequence of the President's restriction has been to \nlimit hope and to limit progress for families who suffer from these \ndiseases. The second impact has been to push embryonic stem cell \nresearch overseas. That means that our country is falling behind other \ncountries in a cutting-edge field.\n  Because of the President's imposed arbitrary limits, we are now in \nthis country surrendering our scientific leadership to other \ncountries. That can have far-reaching consequences for our economy and \nfor our future.\n\n  My State of Washington is home to world-class research institutions \nsuch as the University of Washington. I want our country and \ninstitutions such as that to be the leading edge of scientific \nfrontiers so our country and all of us can benefit from the new \nadvances.\n  The bill we are considering today and will vote on this evening will \nlift the President's arbitrary restrictions and put in place expanded \nresearch under strict ethical guidelines. It would direct the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to conduct and support research \non stem cells that are derived from frozen embryos that are now stored \nin fertility clinics that would otherwise be destroyed. This bill also \npromotes research into finding alternative ways to derive stem cells \nthat do not involve the destruction of an embryo. This bill imposes \nstrong ethical guidelines. In fact, the guidelines in this bill are \neven stricter than the President's policy.\n  Embryonic stem cell research is a relatively young field. These cells \nwere not even isolated in humans until 1998. Scientists believe that \nembryonic stem cells are more valuable than adult stem cells because \nthey can develop into any type of cell or tissue in the body. Think of \nall the veterans who are coming home from the war in Iraq who have \nspinal cord injuries. Think of all the veterans of the first gulf war \nwho are now being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and who could be \nhelped by this promising research.\n  In my own family, I have seen up close and personally the impact a \ndisease such as multiple sclerosis can have. When I was 15 years old, \nmy dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.\n\n[[Page S4366]]\n\nI saw him in just a few years going from working to being someone who \nwas home in a wheelchair every single day every single minute. For the \nrest of his life, my father was confined to a wheelchair. I can't tell \nyou what a profound impact that had on my family. My mom had to stay \nhome and raise myself and my six brothers and sisters. She had to go \nback to work and get a job and she had to stay home and take care of \nhim, all at the same time. It was a very difficult time for my family. \nThe medical bills were amazing. The challenges my family went through \nbecause of my dad's illness were incredible. I can only imagine what it \nmight have been like had there been a cure for MS for my family and for \nthousands of others. When I was growing up, the promise of this type of \nresearch was not even on the horizon. Today that potential is in our \nhands. We need to do everything we can to make sure that that research \nis done so families such as mine have hope and opportunity in the \nfuture.\n  I hope we don't see it continually blocked by an ideological policy \nthat puts politics over science. It is time to change course and put \nour Government on the side of the patients and their families and to \ngive them hope again.\n  Last month the Director of the National Institutes of Health told us:\n\n       [I]t is clear today that American science would be better \n     served and the nation would be better served if we let our \n     scientists have access to more cell lines . . .\n\n  The NIH Director said that existing lines will not be sufficient for \nthe research that needs to be done, and he said that adult stem cells \ndo not have the same potential as embryonic stem cells. That is the \nscientific view of the Director of the National Institutes of Health. \nThe Senate and the President would be very wise to heed his counsel.\n  I know what it is like to grow up with someone who has a serious \nillness. I can only imagine what it would have been like to know there \nwas hope and a chance for a cure. I know of many families out there who \nhave been waiting for this day in the Senate, for us to vote and pass \nthis important stem cell research bill. I commend Senator Harkin for \nhis perseverance in coming back and again pushing at this as one of the \nfirst pieces of legislation we consider in this Congress. We all know \nit has a ways to go. We know the President has said he might veto it. I \nhope he doesn't. I hope he sends a message to some young girl out there \nwhose dad has just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis that we are a \ncountry of hope once again.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for S. 5. I look forward to its passage \ntoday, moving through conference. I hope it will be signed by the \nPresident.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are getting close to the end of the \ndebate, we have some floor time in the next hour or so to go back and \nforth. I thought I might take a few moments now to talk about why it is \nso necessary to have NIH do this kind of research, to oversee this \nresearch. The Senator from Oklahoma said that a lot of research is \ngoing on now on embryonic stem cells. To be sure, it is. It is going on \nin different States, in private institutions, in England and Australia \nand France and Japan and Singapore and a few other countries. Why do we \nwant to get the Federal Government involved? First, there is no other \narea of medical research in which we say the Federal Government should \nstep aside and let the States do it. I know of no other area of medical \nresearch.\n  I always look at the human genome project. What if we had said to the \nStates: We are not going to do it. You do it. They might have sequenced \none gene or another or let the private sector do it. They would have \nbeen getting patents on it or everything like. Now we have the mapping \nand sequencing of the entire human gene, and you can go online and get \nit, free to everybody. Any researcher anywhere can get it. Now they may \ntake that and develop it into drugs and therapies. That is fine. That \nis that sort of symbiotic relationship we have developed very well \nbetween the private pharmaceutical industry and the basic research \nindustry, which is NIH.\n  Again, our National Institutes of Health should be involved in \noverseeing this, because if we don't have a coherent Federal policy on \nstem cells, each State writes its own rules. That means that different \nStates may have different ethical guidelines. One State would be \ndifferent from another. You would wind up with a patchwork quilt of \nlaws. Then you would wind up with States competing against each other. \nSo California gets to doing stem cell research, and what it does is, it \nhires researchers away from Missouri. Then Missouri is hiring people \naway from Iowa and then Ohio. Then New York is trying to bid people \naway from Ohio. You get this terrible State-versus-State kind of \ncompetition in stem cell research.\n\n  We don't want that. We ought to be doing it on a national basis, a \nnational effort, and we should not lose the international leadership we \nhave always had in biomedical research. Should we give it up to \nSingapore or to Korea or England? No. We have always been the leader in \nthe world in biomedical research, and we should continue.\n  Secondly, the issue of why we have to expand our stem cell policy. \nAgain, I repeat, for the sake of emphasis, of those 78 cell lines that \nwere supposedly available on August 9, 2001, only 21 have been \navailable. A lot of them are sick. They are not propagating properly. \nThey are unhealthy. Right now NIH is only using between four and six of \nthese lines and even they, I have been told, are not very healthy. So \nthe restrictions we have had by the Bush administration, since August \n9, 2001, have resulted in a situation where fewer and fewer viable good \nstem cell lines are available for NIH researchers. However, during that \nsame period of time in other sectors, we have derived over 400 \ndifferent cell lines. Yet no one who gets NIH funding is able to do any \nresearch on these healthy embryonic stem cell lines. That is why we \nneed to develop these. We need to expand it.\n  That is what S. 5 does. S. 5 takes off the handcuffs. It lets us use, \nunder strict ethical guidelines, those embryos that are slated to be \ndiscarded at IVF clinics. With all due respect to my friend from \nGeorgia, S. 30 does not do that. S. 5, if passed, will do everything \nthat S. 30 wants to do. If S. 5 passes, what they want to do in S. 30 \ncan be done by NIH. The problem with S. 30 is, if S. 30 passes and S. 5 \ndoesn't, then S. 30 is very limited. It says you can only use these few \nembryos that are naturally dead which, by the way, I don't think there \nis such a scientific term, but it has been bandied about here and it is \nin the bill. There is no such scientific delineation of what is \nnaturally dead.\n  So that is the situation we are in. S. 5 will do both. It will open \nnew stem cell lines with ethical guidelines. It will allow them to \nextract stem cells from these nonviable embryos. S. 30 will not. S. 30 \nstill will not permit us to get the healthy stem cell lines our \nresearchers need. That is why we need to pass S. 5.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will conclude my 2\\1/2\\ minutes then by referring to \nthe other chart. Again, we have to keep in mind that the policy now in \neffect, the policy in effect right now says we could use Federal money \nto examine and do research on embryonic stem cells that were derived \nprior to 9 p.m., August 9, 2001. But we can't use Federal money to \nexamine or to do research on stem cells derived after 9 p.m., August 9, \n2001. Those are morally unacceptable. Before 9 p.m., August 9, 2001, \nthat is morally OK. After 9 p.m., it is not morally OK. Who decided \nthat 9 p.m. on August 9, 2001, was some kind of moral dividing line, \nthat stem cells derived before that, that is OK, but stem cells derived \nafter that, that is not OK? Only one person decided that, and that was \nPresident Bush.\n  The people of this country didn't decide that. Ethicists didn't \ndecide that. Theologians didn't decide that. Scientists didn't decide \nthat. President Bush decided that. It is sheer hypocrisy to say we can \nfund those before, but we can't fund those after. That is the situation \nwe find ourselves in today.\n  Let's take off the handcuffs. Let's get rid of that fake moral \ndividing line that has no substance in reality and let's get on with \nfinding the cures for\n\n[[Page S4367]]\n\npeople with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and spinal cord injuries. That \nis what S. 5 is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nGeorgia, for his leadership on this issue, his passion, his knowledge. \nHe is not a biologist, but I have learned more about God and principle \nand stem cell lines from that former real estate guy than the many \ndoctors I have talked to.\n  I also thank my colleague from Iowa. I went to law school at the \nUniversity of Iowa. I think I have some Iowa roots. The Senator from \nIowa has been a champion of those with disabilities, of disability \nrights, a champion of hope for a long time. In this debate there is so \nmuch we agree on. Where we disagree, though, is that S. 30 is not about \na few small lines. S. 30 is about opening up embryonic stem cell \nresearch, research on pluripotent embryonic stem cells, in part, one \ntechnique being dead embryos; another technique being alternate nuclear \ntransfer, all of which have numerous scientists who say there is hope \nfor moving the science forward, and we could do it in a way that \ndoesn't involve the destruction of the human embryo so we don't cross a \nmoral line but we have all the research we want.\n  You may ask: How can something so small be so important? To my right \nis a chart showing a pinhead. These are the embryonic stem cells right \nthere. They are the size of a pinhead. That is how big they are. How \ncould something so small be so important? Size is not the measure of \nmoral meaning. If you look at it, this point of view from outer space, \nand look at the people, that is small, but that crowd has meaning. If \nyou look at it from a universe perspective to the Earth, boy, that is \nreally small. You can't even see it. It is not even the size of a \npinhead. Or our galaxy, if I had a picture of the universe, our galaxy \nwould be the size of a pinhead. What we are talking about today has \nmeaning. We have an opportunity in this country to come together and \nput the politics aside, the ideological divisions aside. The debate \nover Federal funding, which has been longstanding Federal policy, we do \nnot provide Federal funding for the destruction of a human embryo, and \nwe don't have to. We come together with the same intention. We come \ntogether with the same perspective, with the same hope.\n  There are two paths to follow. One is S. 5, which will be vetoed and, \nin the end, what we will have tomorrow in terms of research is what we \nhave today, well intentioned, but again, unfortunately, because the \nmoral line is crossed and the division that will create, it will be \nvetoed. There will be no movement forward.\n  But if we pass S. 30, we have the opportunity to move the science \nforward, to create a full range of pluripotent embryonic stem cells. By \nthe way, if you are just using IVF stem cells, it is a narrow universe. \nBut with the dead embryo and the altered nuclear transfer, you can \ncover every race and ethnic group in America.\n  The science has gotten way ahead of the politics. We can put ideology \naside. We can put political division aside. We can offer real hope and \nreal advancement without crossing a moral line. Why wouldn't we do \nthat? I hope my colleagues see the wisdom in offering hope, in moving \nthe science forward, and not falling victim to a Presidential veto, but \nthat, in the end, by next year saying we have more Federal dollars \ngoing into embryonic stem cell research, research on pluripotent stem \ncells, stem cells that have the capacity to be perhaps anything. We \ndon't know, but there is still hope.\n  There is a lot of research that has to go into it, but we can open \nthe doors with the passage of S. 30. I urge my colleagues to vote for \nS. 30.\n  With that, I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, it is my understanding, according to the \nunanimous consent agreement, we have four 10-minute periods.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, it is further my understanding the first \nof those four periods is controlled by me; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each Senator controls 10 minutes in no \nparticular order.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I will take that time as allocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa and the \nSenator from Minnesota for their diligent work over the last 2 days on \nthe floor of the Senate dealing with this issue. I admire the passion \nof both. I am so pleased their passion is rooted in their belief, which \nI share, that we can move science forward, that we can enhance research \nfor what are currently incurable diseases, and that we can do so in the \npublic domain.\n  Senator Harkin made a very good statement--he has made a number of \ngood statements, but he made a good statement a little bit ago about \nwhy NIH is important. NIH is important because the research gets in the \npublic domain, not in the proprietary domain of an investor or someone \nwho is hoping to find something but does not want to share that with \nanybody else. So it is important to find a way to get the NIH \ninvestment in the embryonic stem cell research. S. 5 and S. 30 approach \nit from a different direction, but the goal in the end is the same; \nthat is, to further the science and to find cures.\n  I grew up in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1960s, I am reminded of a \nstatement I heard--often repeated--by then Senator and previously \nAttorney General Robert Kennedy. I remember a particular speech he \nmade, when, having returned from Biafra, where there was a terrible \nfamine at that time, he said: Some people see things as they are, and \nask, why?--referring to famine. I--meaning him--see things as they \nnever were and ask, why not?\n  That is what this is all about. Why not find cures? And why not find \nways to seek those cures that pass the test we desire to pass that S. \n30 portends? I have stated on more than one occasion the methodology \nand the derivation of these stem cells. It has been questioned a couple \nof times, but facts are stubborn. BGO1, BG02, and BG03, currently under \nthe investment domain of the National Institutes of Health--lines for \nwhich diabetes research, neurological progenitor cell research, and \nother research takes place at this very day--were all derived from \nembryos that had passed the seventh day following in vitro \nfertilization, were naturally dead or arrested but contained \npluripotent embryonic stem cells.\n  I might add, in vitro fertilization takes place every day in the \nUnited States of America. My family has been touched by it. Many \nfamilies have been touched by it. In each of those processes, the \ndevelopment of those embryos goes through the three stages I have \nreferred to: Gardner principle I, the first 72 hours; Gardner principle \nII, the next 4 days; and then those thereafter where the cells stop \ndividing, where the pluripotent stem cells exist but the embryo is not \nimplanted.\n  Now, there have been some who have talked about: Well, there is no \nevidence of success yet in stem cells. I join Senator Harkin in his \nstatement that the only way you find out about evidence of success is \nby doing the research. But I want to read something I think is \nimportant and I am proud to share because research that has been done \non BGO1 and 03--two of those three lines derived in this methodology--\nhave had significant research conducted on them in a number of areas. \nThis has a little bit of technical language, but it expresses the \npromise and the hope the Senator from Iowa and I and the Senator from \nMinnesota have all talked about. I quote:\n\n       The directed differentiation of BGO1 and BG03 cells to \n     neuroepithelia and multiple differentiated neuronal lineages, \n     including cells expressing multiple markers of the midbrain \n     dopaminergic lineage, has previously been demonstrated.\n\n  ``Previously been demonstrated.'' That statement was confirming the \nresearch on BG01 and 03, designed to see if there was a way to develop \nneurological cells that could carry the hope for cures to spinal cord \ninjury and, in fact, to neurological cell or brain cell injury.\n  From the research on those three lines, a patent is now pending on a \nneurological progenitor cell process, which\n\n[[Page S4368]]\n\nis a real advancement from embryonic stem cell research, from embryonic \nstem cells derived from level III Gardner principle derivation or those \nderived from an arrested or a dead embryo.\n  So I would submit my passion for S. 30 is in the hope of finding \ncures, in the hope of avoiding a veto, and, instead, having an \ninvestment in the furtherance of science that can grow exponentially \nbecause of the unlimited moral and ethical access that would exist \ntoward these stem cells.\n  I conclude by encouraging all the Members of the Senate to \nthoughtfully consider S. 30 and encourage them to vote for it as a step \nin the right direction, the opening of a door that has, in fact, not \nbeen shut but stuck, and an opportunity to do what everybody in this \nChamber has stated affirmatively they want to do; that is, provide hope \nfor those who do not have it, expand research in the public domain at \nthe National Institutes of Health, and invest tax dollars ethically in \na process that brings a promise of hope to every single American.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, let me ask, we have, I guess, 20 \nminutes; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa controls 10 minutes. The \ndesignee of the majority leader controls 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am going to vote for S. 30. I do not \nthink it does anything more than the current law is but, nevertheless, \nI appreciate the intentions of the two Senators, my dear friends, who \nhave done this.\n  Mr. President, as this debate draws to a close, I want to take one \nlast opportunity to give my strong endorsement to the need for our \ncountry to provide a better level of support for a very promising line \nof scientific inquiry: embryonic stem cell research.\n  While I will vote in favor of both bills, it is S. 5, the Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act of 2007, that provides the promise of making a \ndramatic, yet ethical, difference in the lives of so many. S. 5 offers \npeople hope who have no hope today. S. 5 has the potential to save \nlives. S. 5 opens up a door to medical research that offers much \npromise to both the scientific community and the patient community. And \nwhy is that? Because S. 5 allows the Federal Government to fund the \nmost promising line of stem cell research--embryonic stem cell \nresearch--and S. 30 does not.\n  Make no mistake about it. Under the current policy, the President's \npolicy, our Government does support embryonic stem cell research. All \nS. 5 would do is expand that policy.\n  To those who raise questions about the ethicality of this bill, I \nanswer this way: If it was ethical to implement such a policy in 2001--\nand I have heard little criticism about that--then it should be ethical \nto adopt S. 5 as well.\n  Let me underscore the need for this bill with what one of the leading \nembryonic stem cell researchers in our country has had to say. I am \nspeaking about the University of Utah's eminent researcher, Dr. Mario \nCappecchi.\n  For the benefit of each Senator, the doctor has boiled down the \narguments in favor of the Government funding embryonic stem cell \nresearch. I think it bears repeating, as this is knowledge crucial to \neach Member's understanding of what is one of the most critical issues \nfacing this body today.\n  Indeed, I believe history will judge us very harshly if we allow this \ngreat opportunity to pass us by. We have to support this research which \nto date holds forth more promise than other types of stem cell inquiry. \nIn the interest of all those who suffer from debilitating diseases and \nhope for deliverance, I implore my colleagues to vote for S. 5 and send \na clear message to the American people that we want this research to be \nexpanded for the good of mankind--of all mankind.\n  There should be Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research \nbecause: No. 1, it is a potential source of cures; No. 2, embryonic \nstem cells grow quickly and are versatile; No. 3, in contrast, adult \nstem cells grow slowly; No. 4, adult stem cells are very restricted in \nwhat cell types they can produce; No. 5, the tissue in many important \norgans does not have adult stem cells so therapies for diseases \ninvolving those tissues would not be readily approachable by adult stem \ncell-based therapy; No. 6, the usefulness of existing embryonic stem \ncell lines is extremely limited; No. 7, somatic cell nuclear transfer \nis an important research tool; No. 8, SCNT allows production of \npatient-specific stem cells to treat complex human diseases like \nAlzheimer's and Parkinson's; No. 9, lack of Government commitment means \nlack of future researchers; and No. 10, the health and economic \nimplications of human stem cell research are enormous. Other countries \nhave realized this; we are in grave danger of falling behind.\n  I read Dr. Cappecchi's points again for one reason--I want all of my \ncolleagues to recognize that much is weighing in the balance on today's \nvote.\n  Therefore, I ask my colleagues to consider carefully the positions \nthey take today.\n  In the interests of all those who suffer from debilitating diseases \nand hope for deliverance, I urge my colleagues to vote for S. 5.\n  Let me close by making a point I made to President Bush back in 2001:\n\n       In the opening days of your term in office, scientists have \n     completed the task of sequencing the human genome. While this \n     accomplishment--the work of many in the public and private \n     sectors--is of historical significance, it is only the end of \n     the beginning in a new era of our understanding of the \n     biological sciences. Over your next eight years in office, \n     you have an unprecedented opportunity to provide the personal \n     leadership required to see to it that your Administration \n     will be remembered by future historians as the beginning of \n     the end for such deadly and debilitating diseases as cancer, \n     Alzheimer's and diabetes.\n\n  That is what S. 5 is all about--providing a potential new avenue of \nresearch that may lead to treatments and cures for many diseases that \nafflict many families across our Nation and the world.\n  While I have no objections to S. 30, let us not delude ourselves into \nthinking it is the best solution. S. 5 is the bill that will clearly \nmake a significant difference in the future of medical research for all \nof the reasons I have outlined today.\n  For those who oppose any type of embryonic stem cell research, let me \nsay this: For the life of me, I cannot understand how we can destroy \n7,000 to 20,000 live in vitro fertilized eggs every year--just destroy \nthem, kill them--without using those for the benefit of--let's just \nchoose one malady--kids with diabetes, virulent diabetes, who might \nlose their eyes, their hands, their feet. Why wouldn't we do everything \nin our power to utilize those rather than cast them aside as hospital \nwaste? I cannot understand that. That is not pro-life; that is \nprodeath. Frankly, being pro-life is not just caring for the unborn, it \nis caring for the living as well.\n  While I will be voting for both S. 5 and S. 30, I believe that S. 5 \nis clearly preferable to S. 30. S. 5 permits Federal funding for \nembryonic stem cell research, S. 30 does not. S. 5 is the bill that \nwill clearly make a significant difference in the future of medical \nresearch for all of the reasons I have outlined today.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of S. 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my dear colleague for allowing me to make those \nremarks on the floor. This is an important debate. I hope we can get \nthe 67 votes that are essential because we are going to get them \nsomeday. It is just, why put it off another 2 years?\n  I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, my friend from Utah, \nfor a very strong, very powerful, poignant statement. There has been no \nstronger leader in this Senate on health, life issues than Senator \nHatch. I thank him for his support of S. 5.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Smith of Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hatch and Senator Harkin \nfor their leadership on this vital issue.\n  The Senate today has conducted a very dignified debate on an issue \nthat\n\n[[Page S4369]]\n\nbrings us right to the edge of science and faith. I have argued for \nseveral years now that science and faith need not be in conflict on \nthis issue. I have always supported in vitro fertilization, believing \nthat is a noble way to help infertile couples to be parents.\n  Today in America there are probably a million children who are now \nAmericans because of this process. The inevitable consequence, however, \nof in vitro fertilization is that excess embryos are created. The \nquestion we are debating is, frankly, whether they constitute human \nlife, when does life begin.\n  My colleague, Senator Hatch, has argued nobly and long for the \nproposition that life begins not with a scientist, it begins with a \nmother. It begins when cells and spirit are joined to create a living \nsoul. If you have an embryo in a petri dish and you leave it there for \n1,000 years, at the end of that time, you will have an embryo in a \npetri dish for the simple, logical reason that life begins with mom. \nLife begins with the joining of flesh and the spirit. Then the question \nbecomes: Is it more moral to throw all these embryos away or is it more \nmoral to allow them to be utilized for medical miracles? I have reached \nthe conclusion that we cannot have tomorrow's miracles if we tie \nscientists' hands with yesterday's rules.\n  I believe we can, consistent with religion, faith, science, and \nlogic, allow embryonic stem cell research to proceed. We should do this \nbecause it is morally right. We should do this because the U.S. \nGovernment needs to show up to work on this vital issue. We should do \nthis because the resources we can provide and the ethical boundaries we \ncan create are essential for this new area of science to go forward, \ngiving us a chance to cure some of the most horrible maladies that \nafflict humankind, whether it is Lou Gehrig's, whether it is \nParkinson's, childhood diabetes, cancer, and more. We can't \noverpromise, but the people afflicted with this that I see all the time \nin the State of Oregon need our best effort, and they need us to keep \nhope alive.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for both the bills before us today \nbecause it is a morally right thing to do. It is a pro-life thing to \ndo. It is important that an ethic of life care for the unborn as well \nas for those who are living, both the sanctity of life and the quality \nof life.\n  I believe life begins with mom, not in a science lab. Because of \nthat, I am voting for this, and I do so with respect for the feelings \nof my colleagues who have a different theological conclusion. I believe \nthat scripture and science are not in conflict on this issue and that \nlife begins with mother.\n  With that I yield the floor, and I urge and affirm the vote on both \nthese important pieces of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. OBAMA). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes of time as designee \nof the majority leader.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thought I had 12 minutes left, until 5:15. Well, \nanyway, in closing, first let me thank my colleagues, Senator Isakson, \nSenator Coleman, Senator Brownback, and others who have participated in \nthis debate. It has been a very informed and a very good debate over \nthe last 2 days. I thank my colleague, Senator Isakson, for his many \ncourtesies. There were a lot of things we agree on and obviously there \nare things we disagree on, but that is the march of legislation in the \nSenate. I wish to thank Senator Isakson and others for their speeches \nand for their insight into this very important issue. I particularly \nwish to thank Senator Hatch and Senator Smith for their great \nleadership on this and so many other health issues in the Senate and \nfor their very poignant, very powerful statements they made on the \nSenate floor.\n  I started this whole debate yesterday morning by talking about hope, \nhope for cures for Parkinson's, to repair spinal cord injuries, to end \nthe scourge of juvenile diabetes, to lift the death sentence of those \nafflicted with Lou Gehrig's disease, or ALS, hope for families with \nsomeone lost to Alzheimer's disease. S. 5, the bill before us that will \nbe our first vote, is a bill that provides this hope, not a hope based \non dreams or fiction but based on solid scientific foundation. It is \nwhy 525 disease-related groups and research institutions and \nuniversities all support S. 5, because it has solid scientific \nfoundation. It is why the Director of NIH, Dr. Zerhouni, recently said \nmore embryonic stem cell lines needed to be investigated:\n\n       It is clear today that American science would be better \n     served and the Nation would be better served if we let our \n     scientists have access to more cell lines.\n\n  That is what S. 5 does: provides more cell lines.\n  It is why the former Director of NIH, Dr. Varmus, a Nobel laureate, \nsupports S. 5, to take the handcuffs off our scientists. I wish to make \nit again abundantly clear, as there has been a lot of misinformation in \nthe last couple of days on the floor, that S. 5 somehow contains money \nfor the destruction of embryos. That is not true. I challenge anyone to \nshow me in the bill anywhere where it contains any money for the \ndestruction of embryos. It is simply not true. Anyone who says \notherwise is simply not being accurate.\n  There are those who say: Well, the Federal Government shouldn't get \ninvolved. We can leave it up to the States and private entities. Well, \nwe can't do that. We need coherence. We need to have the crown jewel of \nthe Federal Government, the National Institutes of Health, to oversee \nthis so we have good, strong ethical guidelines, so we have \ncompatibility, so we have the kind of interplay between scientists that \nis necessary to advance scientific research. To leave it up to the \nStates means we will have a patchwork quilt of laws all over this \ncountry when it should be a national effort--a national effort. Then we \nwill have States bidding against one another for scientists to come to \ntheir States to do this research. We don't want that to happen.\n  Lastly, we cannot afford to lose our global leadership in biomedical \nresearch. We, the United States of America, have always been the \nworld's leader in biomedical research. All the great scientific \ndiscoveries, whether it is the polio vaccine, smallpox, all these \nthings that have made our lives better; all the new drugs we have for \nfighting AIDS around the world came from the United States. All the \ncancer interventions, the reason cancer is now on the decline is \nbecause of biomedical research in this country. We can't afford to lose \nthat to other countries. We need to keep it in America.\n  So what it comes down to in the final analysis is simply this: If you \nwant to promote good science, vote for S. 5. If you want strong ethical \nstandards, S. 5 has the strongest ethical guidelines, stronger than \nwhat the Bush administration has right now and stronger than any other \nbill that has come before the floor of the Senate. If you want to move \nahead with more cell lines, as Dr. Zerhouni wants, S. 5 is the bill \nthat will provide those cell lines. If you want to put embryonic stem \ncell research into overdrive, to make it a national priority to do this \nresearch, S. 5 will put it into overdrive. If you want to say to Karli \nBorcherding right here, age 12, using 120 needles a month to give \nherself insulin shots because she has juvenile diabetes; if you want to \nsay to Karli Borcherding and all the other kids with juvenile diabetes, \nif you want to say to them that we are going to give you hope, we are \ngoing to give you hope that your diabetes will be cured, hope that you \ncan live a full and normal life; if you want to say to those families \nwho have a loved one suffering from Alzheimer's, we are going to give \nyou hope; if you want to say to those who have a family member \nsuffering from Parkinson's disease or under the death sentence of ALS, \nwe are going to give you hope--hope not based upon fiction, not based \nupon some will-of-the-wisp thoughts that somebody might have but hope \nbased on solid science that scientists know we can use.\n\n  We have already taken embryonic stem cells and made nerve cells, \nmotor neurons, bone cells, heart muscle cells. We know that it can be \ndone. Yet our scientists are handcuffed today because of the policy \nlaid down by President Bush on August 9 of 2001. It is time to lift \nthose restrictions.\n  Some say the President will veto this bill. We can't decide what we \ndo around here because a President--any President--threatens to veto \nsomething. We have to do what is right. We have to do what the people \nof America want us to do. We have to do what is in the best\n\n[[Page S4370]]\n\ninterests of this country as we see our duty to do it. I hope the \nPresident will sign this bill. I hope he will see we have made our \ncompromises, that we have strong ethical guidelines, that this is the \nway to give hope to Karli Borcherding.\n  So I hope we don't fall prey to: Well, we can't pass this because the \nPresident will veto it. We have to do what we think is right. The right \nthing to do is to support S. 5. As Senator Hatch so eloquently said, \nlet those thousands of embryos that are being discarded every year in \nin vitro fertilization clinics, let them be used to provide life to \nother people, hope to Karli Borcherding, hope for people suffering from \nmultiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries. To me, that is the true \nethical course to take. That is the guideline I think we must follow. \nLet those embryos be used to provide hope to these people.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague and a cosponsor of our bill who has \nbeen a leader on this issue for so many years, and I yield the \nremainder of our time to Senator Specter of Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on so many merits, the support has been \noverwhelming to allow Federal funds to be used for embryonic stem cell \nresearch. There are 400,000 of these embryos which will be discarded. \nIf they can produce life, no one would want to have research done. The \nfact is we appropriated $2 million and only about 135,000 of those \n400,000 embryos have been used. So it is a matter of use them or lose \nthem, pure and simple.\n  The only reason not to advance this research is on the life issue, \nand that is gone. We have had some of the staunchest pro-life \nsupporters in this Chamber endorsing this bill and this concept. The \npotential for medical research to cure or ameliorate the worst maladies \nof our era will be present with the use of embryonic stem cell \nresearch. What is involved here is when the people of the United States \nwill demonstrate sufficient political will to insist that the Congress \nand the White House adopt legislation to use Federal funding for \nembryonic stem cell research. That is the only question.\n  We started this on December 2, 1998, with the first hearing, and we \nhave made a fair amount of progress. It is my hope the President will \nsign the bill and not veto it, but he has already said he will veto the \nbill. So with 110 million Americans directly, personally, or \nindirectly, through families with a stake on their health and on their \nfamily's health, it is a question of when America will move to insist \nthe Congress act and, if necessary, override a Presidential veto. It is \nnot a question of if it will be done, it is a question of when. I hope \nthis discussion and the proceedings now will motivate the American \npeople to say to Washington: Get it done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Kansas, under the previous agreement, is now \ncontrolling time and has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to give two numbers to my \ncolleagues: 613 and zero--$613 million spent on embryonic stem cell \nresearch since 2002 and the number of human treatments we have to show \nfor it, which is zero, 613 to zero. I think those are two important \nnumbers to remember when what we are after is cures, and we have cures \nto show. We have cures that are working, and we can take the next $613 \nmillion and invest it in places that are getting cures, such as adult \nstem cells, cord blood, and amniotic fluid.\n  Do we want to spend another $613 million and use Federal taxpayer \ndollars to destroy young human life in the process--an ethical boundary \nwe have not thought wise to cross before? Do we want to cross that \nboundary and spend more money and still not get results, when we have a \nproven route we can take?\n  I urge my colleagues to reject and vote against S. 5 on two grounds. \nNo. 1, ethical grounds. Embryonic stem cell research, even if presented \nin supposedly ethical terms, remains unethical, with the destruction of \nhuman life. No. 2, practical grounds. We don't have an infinite budget, \nand in the stem cell field, we need to put our money into areas where \nwe are getting real results--the adult field--and not divert them to \nthe speculative embryonic stem cell field. Let the private sector or \nthe States do it. If they want to go into these areas, they can do so.\n  Let me discuss ethics. Will we sanction the destruction of nascent \nhuman life with Federal taxpayer dollars? That is the central question \nsurrounding S. 5. Those voting for it would say yes. I say no. I \nrespect my colleagues who look at this differently, but those are the \nfacts.\n  No. 2, individuals should be treated with respect, whoever they are, \nwherever they are located, at whatever age or stage of life they are \nin. We should avoid prejudices. Each individual has an inalienable \nright to life.\n  Claims that embryos are merely ``potential life'' are not supported \nby the science. From biology textbooks, we learn:\n\n       Although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a \n     critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a \n     new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed. . \n     . .\n\n  It takes place in the beginning. The embryo is not ``potential \nlife,'' it is human life at that particular stage of development in the \nlife cycle continuum. That is not Sam Brownback; that is biology. The \nembryo would continue along the life cycle continuum if we were not \ninterfering in its normal development by keeping it in a freezer or \ndestroying it for experiments.\n  With the scientific fact in hand, we evaluate the facts in light of \nour ethical framework. For instance, we know the human embryo is a \nhuman life, so how should we treat it?\n  Human life has immeasurable value--we can all agree on that--from the \nyoungest to the oldest. Human beings are ends in themselves. It is \nwrong to use any human as a means to an end, period. That has happened \nin human history before. It has always been regretted. Our value is \nintrinsic. Yes, we want to help and treat people with medical \nconditions, but we must not trample upon any human to achieve such a \ngood end.\n  Treatments. There remain no embryonic human treatments or \napplications despite 25 years of embryonic work in animal models and a \ndecade of work with human embryonic stem cells, and $613 million has \nbeen invested since 2002 at the Federal level. That doesn't include \nStates, private, and other governments.\n  What we have learned about embryonic stem cells is that these cells \nform tumors when implanted. The scientific literature abounds with such \nstories. If you read this article from ``Stem Cells,'' you will find \nthis:\n\n       The expression of the insulin gene could be demonstrated \n     only when the cells differentiated in vivo into teratomas.\n\n  Those are tumors.\n  Moving from the ethical to the practical, should we put millions or \nbillions of dollars into speculative research on these tumor-forming \nembryonic stem cells or should we put our money where we are already \ngetting strong results with adult stem cells?\n  I have this. It is the front page of the research journals on adult \nand cord blood stem cell research and the successes since 2002. Are \nthere similar files for embryonic stem cells? No, there are none. Adult \nstem cells have no ethical strings attached. You can get them from an \nadult without causing the patient harm; you can harvest them from rich \ncord blood, and, as noted in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation on March 7 of this year, they can be obtained from amniotic \nfluid without causing harm to the unborn child.\n  When we started this debate yesterday, we were aware of at least 72 \npeer-reviewed, real human treatments and applications using adult stem \ncells. Now, with the breaking news yesterday on juvenile diabetes from \nNorthwestern University in Chicago, worked on in Brazil, we are at 73. \nAgain, there remain no embryonic stem cell applications.\n  I say to my colleagues, remember Jacki Rabon, a lady from Illinois, a \nconstituent of the Senators from Illinois, who has spinal cord \ninjuries. She had to go to Portugal to be treated. Do not divert funds \naway from successful adult stem cell treatments and force your \nconstituents to go to Portugal at great personal expense. Vote against \nS. 5 and put the money into adult stem cell research.\n  Remember David Foege. For your constituents who have heart disease,\n\n[[Page S4371]]\n\ndo not divert funds away from successful adult stem cell treatments. Do \nnot force your constituents to go to Bangkok at great personal expense. \nVote against S. 5.\n  Remember Dennis Turner. For your constituents with Parkinson's, don't \ndivert funds away from successful adult stem cell treatments. Let us \nprovide these treatments here in America. Vote against S. 5.\n  Remember the 13 diabetes patients whom we learned about yesterday who \nhave gone 3 years insulin-free using a treatment with their own adult \nstem cells. Don't divert these funds away from this area. Vote against \nS. 5.\n  Mr. President, the Proverbs tell us that there is a way that seems \nright to man, but its end is the way of death. That seems right to some \npeople. I respect their opinion and I respect them, but its end is the \nway of death. Killing young human life harms us as a culture, when we \ntreat human life as property. We have done that, and we don't like the \nhistory associated with it.\n  These embryonic stem cells form tumors. Tumors remind me of death. Do \nwe want to go that way, even though it may seem right? These embryos \nare going to be destroyed, so why not? Somebody on death row is going \nto be destroyed, so why not? Because they have dignity, and they remain \ndignified. We should treat them with dignity, as we should here. Vote \nagainst S. 5.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/11/senate-section/article/S4371-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4371-S4372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Bradley D. King\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Gas \nCity. Bradley King, 28 years old, was killed on April 2 while deployed \nin Al Amiriyah, Iraq, when a roadside bomb exploded near his humvee. \nWith his entire life before him, Bradley risked everything to fight for \nthe values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around \nthe world.\n  Bradley attended Mississinewa High School, enlisting in the National \nGuard in 1997, a year before his graduation in 1998. Bradley enjoyed \nthe military and felt a sense of duty to serve his community and \ncountry. The day before he was deployed, Bradley told his mother that \nhe felt ``called to serve in the military for his country.'' His aunt \ndescribed Bradley as ``a responsible young man determined to do his \nbest for the people he loved.''\n  Bradley was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was a member of the 2nd Battalion, 152nd Infantry Regiment, \n76th Infantry Brigade, Marion, IN. MSG Bill Wallen, King's supervisor, \ntold local media, ``he was a heck of a human being, he's what everybody \nelse needs to be in this world.'' Staff Sergeant King leaves behind his \nwife Adrian and 15-month-old son Daethan.\n  Today, I join Bradley's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Bradley, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Bradley was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Bradley will be remembered by family \nmembers, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we \nhonor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Bradley's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we \ncannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living \nand dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor \npower to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember \nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This \nstatement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am \ncertain that the impact of Bradley's actions will live on far longer \nthan any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Bradley D. King in the \nofficial Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate \npain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nBradley's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah, who \nsaid, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe \naway tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Bradley.\n\n\n                       1st Lieutenant Neale Shank\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today with a heavy heart and deep sense of \ngratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Fort Wayne. Neale \nShank, 25 years old, died on March 30 while deployed in Baghdad on \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. With his entire life before him, Neale risked \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Neale has been a lifelong Hoosier, graduating from Concordia Lutheran \nHigh School in Fort Wayne in 1999. First Lieutenant Shank graduated \nfrom the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 2005. His valor over \nthe course of his service in Iraq exemplifies Hoosier values and \ncourage. He decided to attend West Point because, as he put it, ``it is \nnot a job and it is not a way of life, the Army is my life.'' Neale \nenjoyed the military, and he believed that throughout all the hardships \nthey faced he and his company were helping the Iraqi people. His \ngrandfather described his grandson to local media outlets as an \nadventurous, active person saying, ``He was all boy, he wasn't no \ninside kid.''\n  Neale died while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He \nwas a member of the Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 1st Squadron, \n89th Cavalry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division based in Fort Drum, NY.\n  Today, I join Neale's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Neale, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Neale was known for his dedication to his community and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Neale will be remembered by family members, \nfriends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Neale's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Neale's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Neale M. Shank in the official \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nNeale's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Neale.\n\n\n                private first class orlando e. gonzalez\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my respects to \nPrivate First Class Orlando E. Gonzalez, who last month lost his life \nin the service of our country.\n  On the morning of Sunday, March 25, Private First Class Gonzalez was \nhanding out candy to Iraqi children in the province of Diyala when a \nsuicide\n\n[[Page S4372]]\n\nbomber killed him and three other soldiers. Private First Class \nGonzalez was only 21 years old.\n  Born in Bridgeport, CT, Orlando is being remembered today for his \ndedication to the U.S. Army, and for his warm and giving nature. ``He \nalways had a smile on his face,'' said his high school principal, Brian \nCashman. ``He was kind of a handful, but you couldn't help but like \nhim.''\n  Private First Class Gonzalez rose above what his principal described \nas a ``rough'' background to find purpose and discipline: first at a \nfaith-based camp for students, and then as an American soldier.\n  ``We just loved him around here,'' said Patrick LeBlanc, director of \nSummit Grove Camp. The first thing that came to LeBlanc's mind on \nhearing of Orlando's death was his infectious playfulness. LeBlanc \nrecalled seeing a wild rabbit on the camp grounds, and telling Orlando \nhe was fast enough to catch it. Orlando only nodded--and a few hours \nlater, knocked on LeBlanc's door, petting the rabbit and beaming.\n  But it was in the Army that Private First Class Gonzalez found, as so \nmany have found before him, meaning and a second home. ``I think the \nArmy is what he needed,'' said Principal Cashman. Patrick LeBlanc \nagreed: ``It was the second happiest place I'd seen him, other than \ncamp here. . . . He was doing what he wanted to do.''\n  As a scout javelin gunner for the 82nd Airborne Division, 3rd Brigade \nCombat Team, 5th Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, Private First Class \nGonzalez immediately distinguished himself. ``On a daily basis, Private \nFirst Class Gonzalez displayed courage, honor, and selfless service in \nthe struggle to keep America safe and improve the nation of Iraq,'' \nsaid Captain John Carson of the 73rd Cavalry. Private First Class \nGonzalez was already highly decorated at the time of his death, and we \ncan only wonder what an outstanding career might have been waiting for \nhim.\n  Instead, Private First Class Gonzalez leaves behind two grieving \nparents, Orlando G. Gonzalez of Bridgeport, and Carmen Diaz of New \nFreedom, PA. But he leaves behind, as well, an example of dedication \nthat won't soon be dimmed.\n  ``This hero will be sorely missed and will forever live in our \nmemories,'' said Captain Carson.\n  Orlando, though, might have used other words. ``Call him a hero and \nhe would get mad,'' Orlando's friend and pastor, the Reverend Paul \nJuchniewich, said in a funeral sermon. ``He would just say he was doing \nhis duty to rescue those who are in peril. He did not die in a \nconventional battle, but rather a battle for the hearts and minds of \nthe future generation.''\n  The struggle's outcome is still uncertain. But we will keep fresh the \nmemory of one man who advanced it with all his strength, Private First \nClass Orlando E. Gonzalez, whose last act on this Earth was to \ngive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/11/senate-section/article/S4372-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On April 7, 2007, in New York City, NY, Akino George pleaded guilty \nfor his part in the beating of a gay man. George and three other men \nattacked Kevin Aviance, a popular entertainer, after he left a gay bar. \nThe four men threw bags of garbage and a can of paint at Aviance before \nknocking him to the ground, punching and kicking him. Aviance suffered \nseveral injuries including a broken jaw. George testified in his plea \nthat Aviance was targeted for being gay.\n  I believe that the government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/11/senate-section/article/S4372-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO THE PEACE CORPS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the Peace \nCorps on its 46th anniversary and to pay tribute to the many volunteers \nboth at home and abroad for their dedicated service to our country.\n  Since its inception in 1961, the Peace Corps has helped change the \nlives of millions of people all over the world. There is no \norganization that better demonstrates America's commitment to \ndeveloping nations than the Peace Corps.\n  I recently had the opportunity to travel to South America and was \nable to meet with Peace Corps volunteers in the Andean region. The \nnumerous projects they have been working on to help the local \ncommunities are truly impressive. I have known several individuals--\nmembers of my staff, former interns and my own family members--who have \nvolunteered their service to the Peace Corps. The stories of their \nexperiences are remarkable.\n  The gift of service is driven by a passion for something greater than \none's self. The men and women of the Peace Corps possess this passion \nand have shown what a difference one person can make. By helping \nindividuals in developing countries who seek a better life for \nthemselves, their children, and their communities, the Peace Corps \nshows the world that Americans do truly care. It is vital that the \norganization and its volunteers continue this important work. Their \nservice is greatly appreciated, and I commend the Peace Corps and its \nvolunteers on 46 years of successful service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/11/senate-section/article/S4372-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4372-S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SECOND CHANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nRecidivism Reduction and Second Chance Act, a bill to strengthen \ncommunity safety and reduce poverty by improving the reintegration of \npeople returning from prison. I am pleased to work with Senators Biden, \nSpecter, Brownback, and Leahy as a cosponsor of this very important \nbill.\n  It is estimated that approximately 650,000 prisoners are released \ninto communities across America every year. They have paid their debt \nto society and now return to their homes and neighborhoods, to their \nfamilies, and back to their lives.\n  The problem is that for most of these returning prisoners, their \nfamilies, neighborhoods, and prior lives often lack what it takes to \nensure successful reintegration.\n  In the best of cases, incarcerated individuals maintain contact with \ntheir families and receive rehabilitation services while in prison; \nthey are released to a network of law-abiding peers and quickly find a \nrewarding job that provides the skills and career development for long-\nterm opportunity. Released prisoners can help support their families, \nbecome active in their churches and other community organizations, stay \noff drugs, away from trouble, on track, and out of jail.\n  Unfortunately, that rarely happens. Up to two-thirds of all released \nprisoners nationwide end up back in prison within just 3 years. They \ndon't manage to find and keep effective jobs and to care for themselves \nand their families. Many become a drain on their families and a drain \non the system. They are more likely to resort to criminal activity and \nto perpetuate poverty and family dysfunction.\n  Their failure is our failure since we all share the high cost, lost \nopportunities, and other burdens of unemployment, crime, community \nfailure, and cycles of recidivism.\n  Fortunately, people have been hard at work in hundreds of communities \nand community organizations all across the country to improve the \nprocess of reintegrating prisoners. As one example, the Safer \nFoundation in Illinois has managed to cut the State's recidivism rate \nby almost 50 percent for the people who receive Safer's supportive \nemployment services. And Safer has further demonstrated that ex-\nprisoners who are still employed after 12 months of supportive services \nhave a recidivism rate of lower than 10 percent. One of Safer's program \nmodels, funded by the U.S. Department of Labor, provides participants \nwith job placement and support services, and matches them with mentors \nfrom the neighborhoods where the participants reside. Only 2 percent of \nthe participants in this community and faith-\n\n[[Page S4373]]\n\nbased program recidivated over a 2-year period.\n  One of the most effective reentry strategies that Safer, the \nHeartland Alliance for Human Needs and Human Rights, and other \nnonprofit organizations have devised is transitional jobs, a strategy \nthat worked for welfare to work, and is now working for prison \nreturnees. In a transitional jobs program, former prisoners with \nemployment challenges are hired and paid a wage for legitimate \nemployment in a time-limited, subsidized job. The program not only \noffers real work, income, skill development, and a letter of reference \nand experience to add to their resume, it also offers coaching and \nsupport services to help participants overcome substantial barriers to \nemployment, such as substance abuse or mental health issues. The \nprogram focuses heavily on placement into unsubsidized work at the \nearliest possible time and job retention services after placement.\n  The participants in transitional jobs programs gain an immediate \nsource of legitimate income upon release. They also gain paid work \nexperience, access to professional counseling and training services, \nand a clear path to unsubsidized employment in the community. Employers \ngain access to a pipeline of supported workers who have demonstrated an \nability to do the job and remain employable. Most of all, our \ncommunities gain by helping ex-prisoners to contribute positively to \nfamily, neighborhood, and the larger environment.\n  Too many people are caught up in the criminal justice system. \nEspecially within the African-American community where nearly a third \nof Black males will enter State or Federal prison sometime during their \nlifetime. Communities are protected and strengthened when people who \nbreak the law are punished appropriately. But communities--all \ncommunities, including yours and mine--are weakened if we neglect the \nchallenges of rehabilitation and reentry.\n  To improve the integration of former prisoners and to reduce \nrecidivism is in all of our best interests. A well-designed reentry \nsystem can enhance public safety, reduce recidivism, reduce costs, and \nhelp prisoners achieve long-term integration. The Second Chance Act is \nan important effort to strengthen America's communities. The bill is \nsupported by a wide range of organizations, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin us in passing this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/11/senate-section/article/S4373-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING ZACH JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to have the fortunate \nopportunity to recognize and congratulate a fellow Iowan on a \nmagnificent achievement. On Sunday, 31-year-old Zach Johnson won the \nprestigious Masters golf tournament at the famed Augusta National Golf \nClub in Augusta, GA. I am joined by my colleague, Senator Harkin, in \nsubmitting a Senate resolution congratulating Zach for his victory.\n  Zach not only won one of the most difficult golf tournaments in the \nworld, he also won quite possibly one of the most difficult of all the \nMasters' tournaments in history. Gusting winds and bitterly cold \nweather combined with the traditional challenges of the golf course to \ncreate one of the toughest tournaments. His winning score of one-over-\npar 289 tied the highest winning score in Masters history. In the \nprocess, he beat fellow golf champions Tiger Woods and Retief Goosen by \ntwo-strokes.\n  Zach was born in Iowa City and grew up in Cedar Rapids, playing golf \nat Elmcrest Country Club in Cedar Rapids. He went on to play golf at \nDrake University in Des Moines, graduating in 1998. To continue his \npursuits as a professional golfer, Zach counted on the support of \nfamily and friends in Cedar Rapids who believed in him. His success \ndidn't happen overnight; his dedication to the game and his hard work \nethic helped him earn the prized green jacket.\n  Even in the aftermath of winning one of golf's highest achievements, \nhe remained humble in his acceptance. He attributed much of his success \nto his perseverance and patience. He recognized his family and friends \nwho believed in him even when he wasn't so sure himself, and as a man \nof faith he knew there was another power guiding him.\n  Through it all, he continued to insist that he's just a normal guy \nfrom Cedar Rapids, IA. I am proud of Zach Johnson for his brilliant \nwin, and I am proud of him as an Iowan. I know Iowans are honored and \nblessed to have a person like Zach Johnson representing us in the world \nof professional golf. So I congratulate him on his outstanding victory, \nand I wish him and his family all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/11/senate-section/article/S4373-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      RECOGNIZING STELLA WILDRICK\n\n Mr. STEVENS.

A remote \nand rural community accessible only by air, Lake Minchumina depends \nupon mail service for the delivery of food, clothing, and supplies, as \nwell as correspondence.\n  As Postmistress, Stella has been a very important person in this \ncommunity where everything that cannot be harvested or made from the \nland must be flown in.\n  Throughout the past 15 years, Stella has also been an asset to the \nU.S. Postal Service as a professional, friendly, dependable and always \nhelpful representative.

A bill to amend the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act to allow \nthe Federal Coordinator for Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects \nto hire employees more efficiently, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat should allow the entity we created just 2\\1/2\\ years ago to \noversee and expedite construction of a gas line to bring Alaska's huge \nreserves of natural gas to markets in the lower 48 States to work \nbetter and function more smoothly and quickly.\n  I, and Senator Ted Stevens who is co-sponsoring this legislation, are \nintroducing this bill in an effort to help speed the full functioning \nof the Office of Pipeline Coordinator, the entity that we created in \nfall 2004 to oversee the permitting, design and then construction of an \nAlaska Natural Gas Pipeline project, intended to bring Alaska's \nreserves of gas to a Nation in need of additional natural gas supplies.\n  In 2004 we passed two sets of provisions. The first in that year's \nMilitary Construction Appropriations Act, H.R. 4837, P.L. 108-324/15 \nU.S.C. 720, set up an Office of Federal Pipeline Coordinator to oversee \nthe 15 Federal agencies that will have a role to play in construction \nand financing of a pipeline system. The bill also set up a streamlined \npermitting and expedited court review process to limit unnecessary \ndelays in the project--and hopefully prevent costly delays from driving \nup the project's price. That bill also included an $18 billion Federal \nloan guarantee. The second of that year's pipeline related bills, the \nFSC-ETI Act (H.R. 4520/P.L. 108-357) provided the Federal financial \nincentives expected to be needed to aid financing of the project. They \nincluded a tax credit for the cost of the pipe in Alaska and a tax \ncredit for the cost of construction of an Alaskan North Slope gas \nconditioning plant. The two credits were believed to produce about \nthree-quarters of a billion dollars of benefit to the project.\n  The project itself involves building a system, either an overland \npipeline through Canada or a pipeline through Alaska leading to a \nnatural gas liquefication facility at tidewater in Alaska, to move gas \nto markets in the lower 48 States. Alaska has 35 trillion cubic feet of \nknown gas in the Prudhoe Bay oil field and likely holds another 150 to \n200 trillion cubic feet of gas both on and offshore in northern Alaska. \nGetting that gas to market would help to meet a likely gas shortage in \nthe lower 48 States within a decade, helping to keep the United States \nfrom becoming even more dependent on imported LNG from foreign \nsuppliers.\n  Currently Alaska's new Governor is in the process of calling for \nproposals from gas producers, pipeline companies and others interested \nin building the project, one currently estimated to cost between $30 \nbillion and about half that amount--depending on whether the line \nthrough Canada or an LNG project is deemed most economic.\n  Congress last year funded the creation of the Federal Coordinator's \noffice to begin the process of bringing Federal and State agencies \ntogether to oversee the permitting, design, and construction of a \npipeline. The Office of the Federal Coordinator was funded for fiscal \nyear 2007 initially with a $403,000 transfer of funds from the \nDepartment of Energy, with perhaps another $450,000 to $500,000 soon to \nbe transferred. A coordinator, Alaskan former State Senate President \nDrue Pearce, was also named, confirmed and is now at work, and the \noffice has reached an agreement with all of the 15 Federal agencies it \nwill oversee on how a pipeline is to be permitted.\n  The Bush administration has proposed $2.3 million in its fiscal year \n2008 budget request to better fund the Coordinator's Office. But \ndevelopment of the office has shown three problems that need corrective \naction by Congress, the first immediately.\n  First, the 2004 act made the Coordinator follow Federal personnel \nlaw, specifically Title 5 that is a slow and cumbersome personnel \nprocess. This bill grants a waiver to Title 5 hiring procedures so that \nthe Federal Coordinator can hire and fire her staff, based on their \ncompetence. That should cut the time needed to staff the office with \nexperts in pipeline construction by 6 to 9 months. Given how important \nit is that the agency has specialists quickly to assist the State of \nAlaska in its efforts to select a pipeline builder, passing legislation \nto speed the hiring of Office staff is vital.\n  The waiver, also is common practice for smaller Federal agencies as a \nhost of agencies, from the Election Assistance Commission to the \nVietnam Education Foundation, enjoy the hiring waiver.\n  Second, the bill gives the coordinator the ability to establish \nreasonable permit filing and service fees and charges to defray the \ncost of regulating and the oversight of any pipeline project. While the \nproposed budget may pay for a half dozen to a dozen employees, nearly \n400 were employed in oversight of construction of the Trans-Alaska Oil \nPipeline, some 30 years ago. The bill copies the structure that is \ncurrently employed by the Bureau of Land Management's oil and gas \nleasing division, FLP Section 304, so that it follows a known \nprocess in allowing the Federal Coordinator to set and collect fees.\n\n  Third, the bill in its Section 2 clarifies part of the original 2004 \nact's Section 107. That section set up an expedited review process so \nthat any suit concerning the pipeline under its enabling legislation or \nconcerning its compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act \nwould go first to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit. All \ncases would have to be filed within 60 days of an action and the court \nwould have to ``expedite'' decisions on all such cases. This action \nsimply also adds that suits stemming from the pipeline's permitting or \nconstruction that relates to the Administrative Procedures Act, the \nEndangered Species Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act, \nbesides NEPA, would also go to the D.C. Circuit for expedited review. \nIt clearly follows the original intent of the 2004 act, but does not \nlimit litigation unfairly.\n  The goal of this legislation, if it can be approved quickly by this \nCongress, would be to help the Pipeline Coordinator staff her office \nmore quickly and then to provide the office the possibility of a more \nreadily available source of funding, should a pipeline applicant move \nto proceed: The bill also will clarify the legal process for review of \na pipeline, helping to speed the project and reduce the chances for \ncost overruns in construction of potentially the largest private \ncapital construction project in the world's history.\n  This is a vital project. It has the ability to move from 4.5 to 6 \nbillion cubic feet of gas a day, about 5 percent of the Nation's total \ngas needs in 2018--the first year the pipeline could go into service, \nif a final overland project was selected and proposed within the next \nyear. It would likely produce about a third of that initially, if an \nLNG project was selected to be built.\n  This should not be a controversial measure. It should have no \nnonappropriated costs involved in carrying out its provisions. Section \n2 of the bill will save the Nation untold millions of dollars in \noverseeing permitting and construction of a pipeline, once a firm \nproject is selected. Some will say that the bill is not needed since \nthe State of Alaska has yet to reach final agreement with Alaska North \nSlope gas producers on a firm agreement to build a line. I would argue, \nhowever, that this bill needs to pass now to provide additional \nassistance to help the State\n\n[[Page S4383]]\n\nhammer out such an agreement and so the regulatory process is clearly \nin place, once such an agreement is reached. The Coordinator's Office \nis already involved in a host of discussions and actions relating to a \npipeline and the pace is likely to quicken in coming months, provided \nthe office has the expertise it needs to provide technical information \nto further a project.\n  I hope the Senate and the Congress will review and approve this bill \nquickly.\n  The Alaska gas line project is too important for this Nation's energy \nfuture, for our energy security, for our national security and for our \nbalance of payments deficit for it to be delayed needlessly. These \nchanges will likely speed the process of proceeding with a pipeline.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 1090. A bill to amend the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act \nof 1973 to assist the neediest of senior citizens by modifying the \neligibility criteria for supplemental foods provided under the \ncommodity supplemental food program to take into account the \nextraordinarily high out-of-pocket medical expenses that senior \ncitizens pay, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Senior \nNutrition Act, which will make needed improvements to the Commodity \nSupplemental Food Program to prevent our seniors from having to make \nthe terrible choice between food and medicine as they try to balance \ntheir budgets.\n  I am pleased to have the support of my friend, Senator Domenici of \nNew Mexico, who has been one of the Senate's strongest supporters of \nCSFP.\n  Nationally, 32 States and the District of Columbia participate in \nCSFP, which works to improve the health of both women with children and \nseniors by supplementing their diets with nutritious USDA commodity \nfoods. According to USDA, nearly half a million people each month \nparticipated in CSFP during fiscal year 2006, with the overwhelming \nmajority being seniors.\n  My State of Michigan has one of the largest and oldest CSFP network \nin the Nation. Last year, over 80,000 people in Michigan benefited from \nthis important program.\n  The bill I am introducing today will make the following important \nchanges to CSFP.\n  First, categorical eligibility is granted for seniors for CSFP if the \nindividual participates or is eligible to participate in the Food Stamp \nProgram. No further verification of income would be necessary in such \ncases. The Food Stamp Program provides a medical expense deduction, \nwhich seniors may use to account for their high prescription drug \ncosts.\n  Second, this bill says that the same income standard that is \ncurrently used to determine eligibility for women, infants and children \nin CSFP 185 percent of the Poverty Income Guidelines--would be applied \nto seniors as well. The current income eligibility standard for seniors \nhas been capped at just 130 percent. Under the current Federal poverty \nguidelines, a single senior cannot earn more than $13,273 per year to \nqualify. By raising the standard to 185 percent of poverty, the same \nsenior can earn as much as $18,888 to qualify for food. This will make \na major difference in the lives of so many seniors who are struggling \nwith the high cost of prescription drugs.\n  This bill has been endorsed by the National CSFP Association and \nAmerica's Second Harvest. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of these \nsupport letters be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                    National CSFP Association,\n\n                                                   March 19, 2007.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: Thank you for your continuing \n     support of the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) \n     which provides an important buffer for our vulnerable \n     children and seniors each month. Your support has made a \n     tremendous difference and we appreciate your tireless \n     efforts.\n       The National CSFP Association strongly supports your \n     efforts to re-introduce and pass the Senior Nutrition Act and \n     will work diligently to see that it happens this year. As you \n     know, 91% of our recipients are now seniors living below 130% \n     of Federal Poverty Level. For a household of one, this is \n     only a maximum of $1,062 per month. While some changes have \n     been made in Medicare to help seniors buy prescriptions, the \n     rising medical and fuel costs are still of great concern to \n     those on fixed incomes and many of those seniors qualifying \n     for food stamps due to medical cost deductions will lose the \n     deductions to income and subsequently their food stamps.\n       By amending the eligibility criteria for seniors served by \n     CSFP through the Senior Nutrition Act, the neediest of \n     seniors will continue to receive nutrition assistance, which \n     is crucial if they are to remain in good health.\n       Again, thank you for championing the causes of our nation's \n     elderly.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Frank Kubik,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         America's Second Harvest,\n\n\n                               The Nation's Food Bank Network,\n\n                                                   March 27, 2007.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: I am writing on behalf of the more \n     than 200 food banks and approximately 50,000 emergency \n     feeding organizations that are part of America's Second \n     Harvest--The Nation's Food Bank Network, to thank you for \n     your continuing support for the Commodity Supplemental Food \n     Program (CSFP) and your persistent efforts to improve the \n     nutrition and health of millions of this nation's elderly.\n       With approximately 27 percent of our food bank members \n     distributing nutritious food boxes through the CSFP, we know \n     how very necessary it is to expand this program so that it \n     can reach more of the nation's needy seniors. Strengthening \n     the nutrition safety net for older Americans is a matter of \n     paramount importance as this population grows and ages.\n       We strongly endorse the Senior Nutrition Act and support \n     your and Senator Domenici's effort to expand the number of \n     elderly eligible for the program by broadening the income \n     eligibility standards and permitting categorical eligibility \n     for seniors who participate in or are eligible to participate \n     in the Food Stamp Program.\n       As you know, the CSFP provides critical nutrients to \n     supplement the diets of thousands of low-income elderly who \n     could not replace this food at the same low price as that \n     provided by the CSFP food package. Moreover, as you are \n     aware, this program also helps to support our nation's \n     farmers who grow the food that feeds this needy population, \n     along with millions of others who depend on our country's \n     food and nutrition programs.\n       We are very grateful for your efforts to expand eligibility \n     for this important program and for the contribution you have \n     always made in waging the war against hunger in America. \n     Thank you very much.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                    Vicki Escarra,\n     President and CEO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/11/senate-section/article/S4383-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 840.

Res. 76\n\n       Whereas armed groups have been moving freely between Sudan, \n     Chad, and the Central African Republic, committing murder and \n     engaging in banditry, forced recruitment of soldiers, and \n     gender-based violence;\n       Whereas these and other crimes are contributing to \n     insecurity and instability throughout the region, \n     exacerbating the humanitarian crises in these countries and \n     obstructing efforts to end violence in the Darfur region of \n     Sudan and adjacent areas;\n       Whereas on January 5, 2007, the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that crossborder \n     attacks by alleged Arab militias from Sudan and related \n     intercommunal ethnic hostilities in eastern Chad had resulted \n     in the displacement of an estimated 20,000 people from Chad \n     during the previous 2 weeks and posed a direct threat to \n     camps housing refugees from Sudan;\n       Whereas these new internally displaced Chadians have \n     strained the resources of 12 UNHCR-run camps in eastern Chad \n     that are already serving more than 100,000 internally \n     displaced Chadians and 230,000 refugees from Darfur and \n     providing humanitarian support and protection to more than \n     46,000 refugees from the Central African Republic in southern \n     Chad;\n       Whereas Chadian gendarmes responsible for providing \n     security in and around the 12 UNHCR-run camps in eastern Chad \n     are too few in number, too poorly equipped, and too besieged \n     by Chadian rebel actions to carry out critical protection \n     efforts sufficiently;\n       Whereas on January 16, 2007, the United Nations' \n     Humanitarian Coordinator for the Central African Republic \n     reported that waves of violence across the north have left \n     more than 1,000,000 people in need of humanitarian \n     assistance, including 150,000 who are internally displaced, \n     while some 80,000 have fled to neighboring Chad or Cameroon;\n       Whereas in a Presidential Statement issued on January 16, \n     2007 (S/PRST/2007/2), the United Nations Security Council \n     reiterated its ``concern about the continuing instability \n     along the borders between the Sudan, Chad and the Central \n     African Republic and about the threat which this poses to the \n     safety of the civilian population and the conduct of \n     humanitarian operations'' and requested ``that the Secretary-\n     General deploy as soon as possible an advance mission to Chad \n     and the Central African Republic, in consultation with their \n     Governments'';\n       Whereas the Presidential Statement acknowledged ``the \n     position taken by the Central African and Chadian \n     authorities in favor in principle of such a presence and \n     looks forward to their continued engagement in preparing \n     for it'';\n       Whereas a December 22, 2006, report of the United Nations \n     Secretary-General (S/2006/\n\n[[Page S4386]]\n\n     1019) expressed a need to address the rapidly deteriorating \n     security situation of Sudan, Chad, and the Central African \n     Republic and to protect civilians in the border areas of \n     Sudan, Chad, and the Central African Republic and recommended \n     a robust mission that ``would, among other tasks: facilitate \n     the political process; protect civilians; monitor the human \n     rights situation; and strengthen the local judicial, police \n     and correctional system'';\n       Whereas the December 22, 2006, report went on to recommend \n     that the force also be mandated and equipped to deter attacks \n     by armed groups and react preemptively to protect civilians, \n     including refugees and internally displaced persons, with \n     rapid reaction capabilities;\n       Whereas on August 30, 2006, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Security Council Resolution 1706 (2006), \n     authorizing a multidimensional presence consisting of \n     political, humanitarian, military and civilian police liaison \n     officers in key locations in Chad, including in the \n     internally displaced persons and refugee camps and, if \n     necessary, in the Central African Republic;\n       Whereas continuing hostilities will undermine efforts to \n     bring security to the Darfur region of Sudan, dangerously \n     destabilize volatile political and humanitarian situations in \n     Chad and the Central African Republic, and potentially \n     disrupt progress towards peace in southern Sudan;\n       Whereas a December 2006 United Nations assessment mission \n     report outlined possibilities for a mission in Chad, \n     including a force large enough to monitor the border, deter \n     attacks, and provide civilian protection;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council has requested \n     proposals for a United Nations force in Chad and the Central \n     African Republic to help protect and provide humanitarian \n     assistance to tens of thousands of civilians affected by the \n     conflict that began in Darfur; and\n       Whereas a technical assessment mission was dispatched in \n     January 2007 toward that end: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses concern for the more than 1,000,000 citizens \n     of Sudan, Chad, and the Central African Republic who have \n     been adversely affected by this interrelated violence and \n     instability;\n       (2) calls upon the Governments of Chad and Sudan--\n       (A) to reaffirm their commitment to the Tripoli Declaration \n     of February 8, 2006, and the N'Djamena Agreement of July 26, \n     2006;\n       (B) to refrain from any actions that violate these \n     agreements; and\n       (C) to cease all logistical, financial, and military \n     support to each others' insurgent groups;\n       (3) urges the Government of Chad to improve accountability \n     and transparency as well as the provision of basic services \n     to redeem the legitimacy of the Government in the eyes of its \n     citizens;\n       (4) urges the Government of Chad to take action to increase \n     political participation and to strengthen democratic \n     institutions to ensure that all segments of society in Chad \n     can participate in and benefit from a transparent, open, and \n     capable government;\n       (5) urges the Government of Chad, the Government of Sudan, \n     and other key regional and international stakeholders to \n     commit to another round of inclusive political negotiations \n     that can bring lasting peace and stability to the region;\n       (6) urges the Government of the Central African Republic--\n       (A) to engage in constructive and inclusive dialogue with \n     rebels in the northwestern region of the country;\n       (B) to hold accountable security forces engaging in human \n     rights violations; and\n       (C) to strengthen government services in order to meet the \n     needs of affected populations;\n       (7) calls upon the President to urge the United Nations \n     Security Council to appoint a senior United Nations official \n     to direct and coordinate all international humanitarian \n     activities on both sides of Sudan's western border and expand \n     the response to emergency needs related to the political and \n     humanitarian situation in the Central African Republic;\n       (8) urges the President to utilize the resources and \n     leverage at the President's disposal to press for the \n     immediate deployment of an advance United Nations mission to \n     eastern Chad and northern Central African Republic to lay the \n     groundwork for a robust multilateral and multidimensional \n     presence;\n       (9) urges the United Nations Security Council to authorize \n     a multilateral and multidimensional peacekeeping force to \n     eastern Chad and northern Central African Republic with the \n     mandate and means--\n       (A) to ensure effective protection of civilians, \n     particularly refugees. and internally displaced persons, \n     including by preempting, preventing, and deterring attacks on \n     civilians;\n       (B) to organize regular patrols along the western border of \n     Sudan and implement practical protection measures for asylum \n     seekers;\n       (C) to maintain the civilian and humanitarian nature of the \n     internally displaced persons and refugee camps in Chad and \n     facilitate the efforts of aid workers;\n       (D) to deter, monitor, investigate, and report attacks on \n     humanitarian personnel and assets;\n       (E) to provide around the clock physical security in the \n     camps and surrounding areas, including organized patrols to \n     guarantee freedom of movement to all civilians and \n     humanitarian workers;\n       (F) to coordinate and share information with humanitarian \n     organizations, actively preserve unhindered humanitarian \n     access to all displaced persons, and ensure the safety of all \n     humanitarian workers in accordance with international \n     humanitarian law;\n       (G) to collect and report evidence of human rights \n     violations and perpetrators to the United Nations on a timely \n     and regular basis; and\n       (H) to support domestic and multilateral initiatives to \n     strengthen local judicial, police, and correctional systems \n     in Chad; and\n       (10) urges the President and the international community to \n     coordinate efforts to make available sufficient resources in \n     support of this multilateral and multidimensional mission, as \n     well as adequate assistance to meet the continuing \n     humanitarian and security needs of the individuals and areas \n     most affected by this conflict.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/11/senate-section/article/S4386-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         NOMINATION DISCHARGED\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the issue of stem cell research, when \nthose stem cells are derived from human embryos, is one of the most \nprofound of our time. Confronting this issue means confronting a \ndilemma, one I am sure every one of my colleagues has grappled with as \nmuch as I have.\n  On the one hand, many scientists believe that research using stem \ncells holds the promise of one day curing diseases. But we must also \nremember that the embryos from which these stem cells are derived are \nhuman life. Extracting the stem cells destroys the embryo and ends that \nlife's possibility. The moral boundaries this research crosses is \ngreatly troubling to me, and to many others.\n\n[[Page S4387]]\n\n  But what is too often missing from this important debate is a simple \nfact of modern science: Encouraging medical research and protecting the \nsanctity of life are not mutually exclusive goals.\n  I have always believed that biomedical research must be conducted in \nan ethical manner that respects human life. Now I am pleased to report \nthat new scientific research tells us that view is more possible than \never.\n  This promising new research points the way out of the moral dilemma \nthat embryonic stem cell research has always thrust us in.\n  Alternative methods for research and the potential for cures are \noften simpler and more efficient and don't require the destruction of \nlife.\n  They have scientific advantages over the older method as well. That \nmeans that everybody who wants to find a cure for any of man's most \ndevastating diseases, and find it fast, should support this form of \nresearch wholeheartedly and enthusiastically.\n  With our votes, this Senate can advance this promising research \nthrough the power of Federal funds, and we can happily provide those \nfunds without fear of offending the principles of millions of \nAmericans.\n  I thank my good friend from Minnesota, Senator Coleman, and my good \nfriend from Georgia, Senator Isakson, for sponsoring this bill and \ngiving the Senate this opportunity. I also commend Senator Specter and \nSenator Brownback who have led the debate on the competing measure upon \nwhich we will also be voting shortly.\n  The Coleman-Isakson bill, S. 30, the HOPE Act, is a solution Senators \nfrom both parties can embrace and a solution that the President will \nsign into law.\n  We should leave behind the heated debates of the past, pitting the \nhope for a cure to end human suffering against the need to protect life \nat all its stages, including its earliest.\n  Last year, a minority of Members in the other body voted to block \nlegislation promoting newer methods of research, such as the methods \nthis bill will support. I don't understand that. The only explanation \nwould be that they value the political clash and debate more than \nfinding common ground--and more than the hope this research can bring.\n  But this Senate can and should move forward united on the HOPE Act, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I want to stress to everyone just how much the possibility of finding \ncures for these life-altering diseases means to me personally. I have \nknown what it is like to feel the shadow of a debilitating disease \ndraped over one's life. As a child, I suffered from polio.\n  When I was 2 years old, I came down with an infection that felt a lot \nlike the flu. But after the fever passed, my left leg had gone lame.\n  The only reason I am able to stand here today unaided is because of \nthe heroic efforts of my mother. She was not a doctor or a nurse, but \nshe fought as hard as she knew how to save her only son from being \ntrapped forever in a leg brace.\n  For 2 years, my mother put me through a physical therapy regimen \ntaught to her by the doctors at Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for \nRehabilitation, which was, of course, founded by President Roosevelt. \nThat was over in Warm Springs, GA. From age 2 to 4, I was not allowed \nto walk or to run.\n  But after 2 years of my mother's care, I was able to have a normal \nlife. A lot of kids at that time in the 1940s were not so lucky. Some \nwere paralyzed for life. Some were sentenced to an iron lung. Many \ndied.\n  So believe me, Mr. President, when I say I understand the urgency to \nfind cures for the afflictions that are today's polio. I remember when \nthe prayers of my mother and mothers across the country were answered \nwhen Dr. Jonas Salk developed his polio vaccine in 1955. To prove the \nnew vaccine was safe, Dr. Salk administered it to himself, his wife, \nand their three children. As he did so, he was asked how he could dare \nhis and his family's lives on his new treatment. He replied:\n\n       It is courage based on confidence, not daring--and it is \n     confidence based on experience.\n\n  Dr. Salk's wisdom ought to guide us today. The daring path is the one \nthat asks us to destroy a life for the possibility that we might save \nanother. If we go down that route, we are daring to ruin America's long \nand proud record of upholding the highest moral and ethical standards \nas we seek out new solutions, new cures, and new hopes.\n  Then there is the path of confidence--the confidence that, thanks to \nnew technologies and new methods of research, scientists can explore \nthe promise of embryonic stem cell research without destroying the \nhuman embryo.\n\n       Like Dr. Salk's, this confidence is based on experience--\n     the experience of America's best scientists who are pursuing \n     these new methods of research.\n\n  The next Dr. Jonas Salk is out there. Providing the money for these \nmethods of research through this bill is how this Senate can help.\n  I am a believer in the power of science and technology to improve \npeople's lives. I saw it firsthand as a young boy.\n  Like all of my colleagues, I have great hope for the cures that we \nwill one day find. The Coleman-Isakson bill is something Senators of \nboth parties can support. I hope that they will. Millions of Americans \nwith loved ones in need hope that they will. And I look forward to the \nsuccessful passage of this bill so America's dominance in medicine and \nmedical technology can continue to move forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  How much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 minutes 35 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time on this side \nto the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his support and \nparticularly Meg Hauck who has been of immense value to us throughout \nthe entire process of this deliberation.\n  I thank majority leader Harry Reid and his staff on the floor for the \nequitable and fair way in which they allocated time in support of this \ndebate.\n  I thank Tyler Thompson on my staff, Chris Carr, Joan Kirchner, and a \nformer member of my staff who retired but started this journey with me \nsome time ago, Brittany Espy; also, Dr. Steven Stice at the University \nof Georgia, whom I have quoted many times on this floor in the course \nof the last 20 hours of debate, but a scientist like many in America \nwho seeks to find cures for diseases not yet cured, who understands the \npotential, the vibrance, and the hope of embryonic stem cell research \nand found ways to develop those embryonic stem cells that are \ncompatible with the directive of the President of 5 years ago but offer \nnew, expanded hope and reality for research in the future.\n  I particularly pay a compliment to Senator Harkin who has been the \nfloor manager on S. 5 throughout this debate. He has been very \ncooperative in every way in allowing us to share our thoughts on two \ndistinct bills, S. 5 and S. 30.\n  I want to quote Senator Gordon Smith. Senator Smith, in his speech, \nsaid these bills should not be looked at as competitors but as \ncompanions. I agree with that statement because they seek to accomplish \nthe same thing, although they travel down a highway that differs \nslightly.\n  The minority leader has accurately expressed the hopes and dreams and \naspirations of all Americans, and that is for us to be a catalyst at \nthe Federal level, to ensure that breakthroughs in health, in medicine, \nand in science take place, and that we are never a hindrance or \nobstacle to that taking place, while at the same time respecting \nconcerns of all Americans as we go down that path.\n  Senator Coleman of Minnesota has been a tremendous leader in this \neffort and has brought many of the portions of S. 30 to reality through \nhis research, through his dedication, and through his compassion. As he \nsaid so often, he and Senator Harkin and myself understand we can do \nbetter, we can do more, we can reach out, and we can do so without \ncrossing those lines that cause us trouble or may become an obstacle to \nfurther research.\n  So I conclude my remarks by thanking my colleagues in the Senate for \ntheir patience and their listening over the last 20 hours. My sincere \nappreciation to Senator Harkin for his cooperation, my praise for \nSenator Coleman\n\n[[Page S4388]]\n\nand his contribution, and my hope and belief that Members of the Senate \nwill look favorably on S. 30 so we can move science forward in the \nresearch of embryonic stem cells and the hope and promise they bring to \nall Americans.\n  I yield back the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have risen many times over the past years \nin support of the legislation that is now before this body, legislation \nthat will unlock the hope of stem cell research for millions of \nAmericans and tens of thousands of Nevadans who suffer from cancer, \nAlzheimer's, diabetes, Parkinson's, spinal cord injuries, heart \ndisease, Lou Gehrig's disease, and many other diseases.\n  Initially, I extend my appreciation to Senator Harkin. Others worked \nhard on this legislation. Senator Kennedy and Senator Feinstein have \ndone a wonderful job, but Senator Harkin, from his position as the \nchair and/or ranking member of the labor subcommittee on \nappropriations, has worked with Senator Specter--back and forth, the \ntwo of them have worked to come up with stem cell legislation.\n  Senator Harkin has been a pioneer and a leader in this cause. I \nadmire and respect him for a lot of what he has done as a longtime \nMember of the Senate, but I know I have more respect for him for what \nhe has done on this legislation.\n  He has a tremendously good staff: Erik Fatemi, Ellen Murray, and \nAdrian Hatlett. They have done good work.\n  I have to throw a bouquet to my longtime, very important legislative \nadvocate whom I have working for me, Carolyn Gluck. She has worked very \nhard on this issue. I appreciate her hard work.\n  I have spoken in the past about a man I met who is in a wheelchair in \nBoulder City, NE. This man suffers from Parkinson's. I asked him why he \nwas in his wheelchair. He told me. After this legislation was vetoed by \nPresident Bush, he felt so bad because he believes with this \nlegislation he will be able to walk again and not be confined to that \nwheelchair.\n  I have spoken of an 18-year-old twin from Las Vegas. She came to \nWashington for the first time when she was a little girl. She has \nsuffered from juvenile diabetes for most of her life. She has had tens \nof thousands of needle pricks over these years--tens of thousands. But \nthis 18-year-old girl still remains optimistic because of this \nlegislation--optimistic for a healthy adulthood. Not only does she feel \nthat way but her twin sister feels the same way.\n  I have spoken of a 23-year-old man from Henderson who just weeks \nafter his high school graduation was in a car accident which left him a \nquadriplegic and whose mother wrote to me a plaintive letter hoping, \npraying because of this legislation her son one day will lead a more \nnormal life.\n  The plight and suffering of these friends and neighbors pains my \nheart. But sadly, their stories are far from unique. Mr. President, 100 \nmillion Americans suffer just like them. Those who suffer are parents, \nare children, are friends, are our neighbors. They know that stem cell \nresearch is not a guarantee or imaginable, but they know it holds \npromise, they know it holds hope, real hope, yes, scientific hope. They \nknow it because the world's leading experts tell us so.\n  In a letter to President Bush, 80 Nobel laureates wrote:\n\n       . . . for disorders that prove not to be treatable with \n     adult stem cells, impeding human pluripotent stem cell \n     research risks unnecessary delay for millions of patients who \n     may die or endure needless suffering while the effectiveness \n     of adult stem cells is evaluated.\n  This is a statement from 80 Nobel Prize winners.\n  According to the National Academies of Science, research on both \nembryonic and adult stem cells is needed ``to most effectively advance \nthe scientific and therapeutic potential of regenerative medicine.''\n  In a letter dated a few days ago, April 9, Dr. Harold Varmus, former \nDirector of the National Institutes of Health and now the President of \nMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and also a Nobel laureate wrote:\n\n       S. 5 represents an important step forward for human \n     embryonic stem cell research, a new field that offers great \n     promise for the replacement of damaged cells, the \n     understanding of the mechanics of disease, and the \n     development of the testing of new drugs. Unfortunately, \n     current Federal policy, in place since 2001, has not kept \n     pace with the speed of scientific discovery and is today of \n     limited value to the scientific community.\n\n  A man whom I have met, Dr. Jeffery Bluestone, a leading diabetes \nresearcher and director of the Diabetes Center at the University of \nCalifornia, San Francisco, said:\n\n       We have made great strides in understanding the role of the \n     immune system in diabetes, but fully pursuing both embryonic \n     and adult stem cell research will build on our current \n     successes and could be critical in the ultimate treatment and \n     cure of patients who suffer from this disease.\n\n  I have spoken to him personally, and he has said we are going to \ncure, in the next few years, diabetes. They need this ability to go \nforward.\n  The other day I received a letter signed by more than 500 leading \norganizations from all around the country. It crossed the political \nspectrum. It includes the AARP, the American Medical Association, \nNovartis Pharmaceuticals, the Mayo Clinic, the Episcopal Church, Iraq \nVeterans for a Cure, the American Diabetes Association, Memorial Sloan-\nKettering Cancer Center, Harvard University, and the Parkinson's Action \nNetwork--to name 11 of 500 organizations.\n  They spoke with one voice in support of S. 5, writing:\n\n       The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act will move stem cell \n     research forward in our country. The bill holds promise for \n     expanding medical breakthroughs and hope for millions of \n     patients and their loved ones.\n\n  Even President Bush's own Director of the National Institutes of \nHealth, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, endorsed the need to pursue embryonic stem \ncell research in addition to alternative forms of research. At a Senate \nhearing a few weeks ago he said:\n\n       It's not possible for me to see how we can continue the \n     momentum of science and research with the stem cell lines we \n     have at NIH. . . . [F]rom my standpoint as NIH director, it \n     is in the best interests of our scientists, our science, and \n     our country that we find ways and the nation finds a way to \n     go full-speed across adult and embryonic stem cells equally.\n\n  Americans, by a huge majority, favor stem cell research because they \nsee the suffering of their own friends and relatives and neighbors, \nsimilar to those described in my introduction today. They hear the \nopinions of experts similar to those I just mentioned and they put \ntheir faith in science.\n  Californians, by ballot, voted, they agreed to spend billions of \ntheir own State Treasury on stem cell research, thus challenging the \nobstinacy of President Bush.\n  Congress has supported this important cause already. Two years ago \nthe House of Representatives passed something called H.R. 810, the Stem \nCell Research Enhancement Act, with bipartisan support. Last year the \nSenate followed suit, as Republicans and Democrats united to pass a \nbill that will expand the number of stem cell lines available to \nfederally funded researchers, while ensuring that strict ethical \nguidelines are followed.\n  Yet when we sent this bipartisan bill to President Bush's desk, he \nresponded with a veto--his only veto in 6 years, taking away the hope \nfor millions.\n  Today, as hundreds of millions of Americans wait for progress, our \nscientists, our innovators are marking time, waiting for President Bush \nto keep hope alive. The wishes of the American people and the \noverwhelming weight of evidence, scientific evidence, should trump the \nnarrow ideology of President George Bush.\n  Yesterday and today we debated S. 5, the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act, a bill that is similar to the one both the House and \nSenate passed last year with strong bipartisan support. The House \npassed it again this year. S. 5 authorizes federally funded research on \nstem cell lines derived from excess embryos from fertility clinics, \nembryos that would otherwise be discarded--discarded, thrown away, \ntrashed. These potentially discarded embryos could and should be used \nto advance lifesaving research.\n  At the same time, our bill acknowledges the important ethical issues \nat stake and enacts stronger research guidelines than exist in the \nPresident's current policy. Because we believe that all forms of \npromising research should move forward, S. 5 includes a provision that \nsupports the advancement of alternative forms of stem cell research\n\n[[Page S4389]]\n\nbased on the Santorum-Specter bill that passed the Senate unanimously \nlast year.\n\n  Tonight the Senate will also consider another measure sponsored by \nSenators Coleman and Isakson. Similar to our bill, theirs would promote \nresearch in alternative methods for deriving stem cells, some say. \nHowever, unlike our bill, this bill would retain the President's \nrestrictions on stem cell research. The legislation is, in my opinion, \nmore political than substantive, more political than scientific. The \nColeman-Isakson bill is not a substitute for S. 5.\n  I know some of my colleagues will disagree. I am not going to vote \nfor it. I think S. 30 is a cover vote, and I am not going to provide \nany cover. S. 5 is the only bill being discussed that will lift the \nrestrictions that are impeding scientific research and can lead to new \ntreatments and cures of many dread conditions and diseases. For the 100 \nmillion Americans who suffer from diseases that could be treated as a \nresult of stem cell research, there is simply no alternative to S. 5.\n  By supporting the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, we are renewing \nour faith in society's steady march forward. Whether expanding our \nfrontiers, putting a man on the Moon, or mapping the human genome, \nAmerica has always embraced great scientific challenges that hold even \ngreater promise. It is who we are and it is a commitment to the \nAmerican people that we must honor.\n  Jonas Salk, a great American scientist who moved science forward \nregarding the dread polio or, as they called it, infantile paralysis, \nwhen he invented the vaccine, once said, ``Our greatest responsibility \nis to be good ancestors.''\n  If we give our scientists the tools to succeed and give hope to the \nmillions who suffer, we will be doing just that, good ancestors.\n  I yield any time I have.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion \non the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the passage of S. 30. Under \nthe previous order, there will be two minutes evenly divided before the \nvote. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I rise in favor of S. 30. Last year the \nSenate passed a similar measure, Specter-Santorum, 100 to nothing. The \nreality is that S. 30 goes beyond what Specter-Santorum did. When the \ndust settles and S. 5 is vetoed, the only real opportunity to expand \npluripotent embryonic stem cell research is through S. 30. I ask my \ncolleagues to please put politics aside and to do the right thing.\n  I plead with my colleagues, on behalf of all of those who have looked \nto us and asked for hope to move the science of stem cell research \nforward in a way that does not divide but unifies, do what we did last \nyear, 100 to nothing, keep hope alive, vote in favor of S. 30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the bill we just passed, S. 5, does \neverything that S. 30 does. That was already said in the debate the \nother day. S. 5 has already passed by an overwhelming vote. Everything \nthat S. 5 does is in S. 30. So the next vote really doesn't make any \ndifference one way or the other, because by passing S. 5, we allow to \nbe done what is done in S. 30.\n  Secondly, I have always taken the position that we should not tell \nscientists what to do and what not to do within the ethical guidelines \nwe have established. What S. 30 says is: Go ahead and investigate. I \ndon't know if using so-called dead embryos and extracting stem cells \nwill work. I am not a scientist. But I don't want to handcuff the \nscientists and tell them they can't research it. As far as I am \nconcerned, a vote for S. 30 is saying again what we committed to do in \nS. 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is now on \nthe passage of S. 30. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Res. 142\n\n       Whereas April 15, 2007, marks the international observance \n     of Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Memorial Day, a day to remember and \n     mourn the millions who died during the Holocaust of World War \n     II;\n       Whereas thousands of Holocaust survivors, historians, and \n     researchers are being denied access to files, located at Bad \n     Arolsen, Germany, that tell the story of unspeakable crimes \n     committed by the Nazis;\n       Whereas the Bad Arolsen archives contain 30,000,000 to \n     50,000,000 pages of documents that record the individual \n     fates of over 17,000,000 victims of Nazi persecution;\n       Whereas the Bad Arolsen archives are administered by the \n     International Tracing Service, which in turn is supervised by \n     an international commission composed of 11 member countries \n     established by the Agreement Constituting an International \n     Commission for the International Tracing Service, signed at \n     Bonn June 6, 1955 (6 UST 6186) (commonly known as the ``Bonn \n     Accords'');\n       Whereas the member countries of the International \n     Commission are the United States, Israel, Belgium, France, \n     Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, \n     and the United Kingdom;\n       Whereas, in May 2006, after years of delay, the member \n     countries of the International Commission commendably agreed \n     to amend the Bonn Accords to make the Bad Arolsen archives \n     public for the first time and agreed to place digitized \n     copies of the documents in the archives at Holocaust research \n     centers in other countries, including the United States \n     Holocaust Memorial Museum;\n       Whereas the May 2006 amendments will become effective only \n     after each of the 11 member countries completes the \n     ratification process;\n       Whereas the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, \n     Poland, and the Netherlands have completed the ratification \n     process; and\n       Whereas opening the Bad Arolsen archives is an urgent \n     matter: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) joins people around the world in observing Yom Hashoah, \n     Holocaust Memorial Day, and mourning the millions who were \n     lost during the Holocaust;\n       (2) commends the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, \n     Poland, and the Netherlands, as the member countries of the \n     International Commission of the International Tracing Service \n     that have completed the ratification of the May 2006 \n     amendments to the Agreement Constituting an International \n     Commission for the International Tracing Service, signed at \n     Bonn June 6, 1955 (6 UST 6186) (commonly known as the ``Bonn \n     Accords'');\n       (3) calls on Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and \n     Luxembourg, the member countries of the International \n     Commission that have not yet ratified the May 2006 amendments \n     to the Bonn Accords, to do so immediately;\n       (4) calls on the International Commission to approve the \n     immediate distribution of copies of the documents from the \n     Bad Arolsen archives that have already been digitized when \n     the International Commission meets in Amsterdam in May 2007; \n     and\n       (5) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the Secretary of State \n     and to the ambassadors representing each of the member \n     countries of the International Commission in the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/11/senate-section/article/S4391-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
