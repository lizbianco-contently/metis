Mr. President, a few weeks ago, on Memorial Day, I spent a \ngood part of the day in Boulder City, NV, where we have a veterans \ncemetery. It is new but growing fast. There are almost 25,000 graves in \nthat cemetery which started less than 15 years ago.\n  On that day, I joined veterans, family, and friends to pay thanks to \nthe Nevadans who have lost their lives in the Iraq and Afghanistan \nwars.\n  On that occasion, I shared the words of President Lincoln when our \ncountry was torn apart by the Civil War. Lincoln said:\n\n\n[[Page S8274]]\n\n\n       My dream is of a place and a time where America will once \n     again be seen as the last best hope of Earth.\n\n  With the war raging in Iraq, with the whole area destabilized, his \nwords ring loudly and clearly. My dream, as Lincoln's, is of a place \nand time where America will once again be seen as the last, best hope \non Earth.\n  The day before yesterday, PFC Joshua Modgling, of Henderson, NV, lost \nhis life in pursuit of that dream. He was 22 years old. Joshua and Army \nSFC William Zapfe, from Kentucky, both died of wounds from a roadside \nbomb. They were 2 of the 15 killed within 36 hours, the day before \nyesterday, in that bloody civil war raging in Iraq.\n  There is not much that can be said, other than our hearts are with \nthe families of Joshua and William and all those who knew them. I speak \nfor my colleagues and all Americans in praying that every brave man and \nwoman serving overseas will come home safe and come home soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8274-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8274-S8275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PASSAGE OF H.R. 6\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, leaving that subject, which is certainly a \nsubject that concerns us all, turning to the subject of this morning, \naround midnight, when we passed the Energy bill, it was a tremendous \naccomplishment for this body. As I said yesterday when, with the first \nvote, cloture was invoked, I hope that set a new tone and pattern in \nWashington, where we can work together to pass things.\n  It would be one thing if the bill that was before the Senate for the \nlast couple of weeks was a Democratic bill, but it wasn't. I took what \nwas passed out of the Energy Committee on a bipartisan basis, I took \nwhat was passed out of the Commerce Committee on a bipartisan basis, I \ntook what was passed out of the Environment and Public Works Committee \non a bipartisan basis and put them into one bill and that is what we \nhave been working on. It is bipartisan legislation.\n  It is too bad some tried to make it a partisan issue. There is \nnothing partisan about it. It was a bipartisan bill. But some who do \nnot want any accomplishments in the Senate, who resent the fact we have \nbeen able to pass minimum wage; drought relief for farmers for the \nfirst time in 3 years; for the first time since President Bush has been \nPresident, we have gotten money for homeland security, over his \nobjection--we had tried many times--we got $1 billion; we funded SCHIP; \nwe funded the Government. You know, the Republicans left town and \nfunded the Government only until February 1. We funded the Government \nuntil October 1. We passed a balanced budget, even though our majority, \nbecause of Senator Johnson's illness, was 50 to 49. Republicans with 55 \nto 45 couldn't pass a budget. We did, and some resent that.\n  We have focused attention on Iraq, which has been unfocused for the \nentire course of that war. We had 80 hearings. The Judiciary Committee \nhas focused attention on the scandals at the Justice Department, led by \nAttorney General Gonzales. We have reestablished the legislative branch \nof Government. The Presiding Officer served for many years in the other \nbody, such as I did. The House and the Senate make up the legislative \nbranch of Government, set forth in the Constitution many years ago to \nbe a separate and equal branch of Government--the legislative, \nexecutive and judicial branches of Government.\n  For the first 6 years of this Presidency, there was no legislative \nbranch of Government. It did not exist. The President ignored it \nbecause the Republican-dominated House and Senate gave the President a \nbig rubber stamp. We have changed that, and rightfully so, for the \nAmerican people.\n  A number of people made possible passage of the bill late last night, \nor this morning. Senator Bingaman, Senator Boxer. And let me say this \nabout that wonderful Senator from the State of California, Mrs. Boxer. \nSenator Boxer has one grandchild, Zach. I have watched him grow up. I \ndon't know, he must be 10, 11 years old now. I watched him when he was \na little boy crawling around on the floor. She was so excited.\n  I had the good fortune, my wife and I, to spend a weekend with them \nin one of their homes in California, she and Stu. They were so excited \nthey were going to have their second grandchild. That second grandchild \nwas born last night about 6 o'clock eastern time. She flew to \nCalifornia and was headed toward the airport, actually had entered the \nairport, when the vote occurred last night. She was coming back here to \nbe here this morning to take that vote.\n  She is a real soldier. I so admire Senator Boxer. We came to \nWashington together in 1982. She was able to go back and spend some \nmore time with her grandson because we didn't need her here this \nmorning, but the vote was that close.\n  The bill is important. The overall manager of the bill was Senator \nBingaman. He did a tremendous job. This quiet, effective man--Stanford \nand Harvard degrees--has done a wonderful job with this legislation, as \nhe does with everything.\n  The CAFE standards in this bill which we have passed are so \nimportant. For 25 years, we have been trying to get increased fuel \nefficiency. Each time we have tried we have been defeated. People had \nenough. Senators had enough. We have voted against CAFE standards for \ntoo long. We were told they said that if you voted for increased fuel \nefficiency, we are going to close production plants, we are going to \nlay people off, we are going to lose market share.\n  They were right, except it didn't take increased fuel efficiency. \nThey simply became not competitive. Other cars coming into this market \nthat people wanted to buy, fuel-efficient vehicles, were bought. So we \nincreased fuel efficiency. It is great for this country. It will save \nmillions of barrels of oil every year.\n  There was legislation that was drafted by a number of people to make \nthis effective. It came out of the Commerce Committee originally, but \nthe people who worked so hard the last few days were Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Kerry, Senator Snowe, Senator Stevens, and let me say, I have \nthe good fortune in working very closely with the senior Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray. She is the secretary of the Democratic caucus. \nI have worked with her very closely.\n  She is a tremendous Senator, a tremendous asset to me, the caucus, of \ncourse the State of Washington, and the country.\n  One of the quiet, effective Members of the Senate is Maria Cantwell. \nThose of us who watched her the last 3 days on this Senate floor, \nmaking sure there were enough votes to pass the aspect of the bill we \ncall CAFE standards, saw her effectiveness. She, at any given time with \nvotes changing back and forth knew--that piece of paper she carried--\nwhere the votes were. I went to her many times yesterday and said what \nhappens if this happens and what happens if this happens? She knew \nright away.\n  Senator Inouye, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, reported that \nout. He worked with Senator Stevens to make sure that as the matter \nchanged a little bit, it was done properly. I hope I mentioned Senator \nKerry's name; I meant to. He is such a believer. He has written books. \nHe is so concerned about the environment.\n  Words cannot describe how important Senator Cantwell was in our being \nable to pass this legislation. Of course, my friend Senator Durbin, who \nis the whip, assistant leader, is always around, always helpful in \ndoing things I and others ask him to do, and does so much on his own.\n  I wish I could express my appreciation adequately to all of the \npeople whose names I mentioned. If I slighted someone, I certainly did \nnot mean to do that. But I have mentioned some names that have come to \nmy mind.\n  With strong bipartisan support, we passed an energy bill that will \ngrow our economy, strengthen our national security, and protect our \nenvironment. If passed into law, this bill will put us on a path toward \nreducing our reliance on oil by increasing supply of renewable fuels \nproduced right here at home, and decreasing the amount of energy we use \nin our cars, homes, and offices.\n  Why do we say it will strengthen our economy? Because especially in \nrural America there will be biofuel buildings, factories to make \nbiofuels.\n  We have done things to protect our environment by reducing greenhouse \ngases and other toxins that are emitted using fossil fuel. For the \nfirst time since 1975, our bill raises standards for new cars and \ntrucks, as I have mentioned, from 25 to 35 miles per gallon,\n\n[[Page S8275]]\n\nwhich is really important. That still puts us behind Europe, Japan, and \nChina, but it is a critical step in the right direction and will save \nup to 1 billion gallons of gas every day. Think about that--1 billion \ngallons of gasoline every day. I don't know how big a tank a billion \ngallons is. I do know that we use 21 billion barrels of oil every day \nin America, 65 percent of which is imported. I know how big a hole that \nis. It is the width of a football field, 11 miles long and 10 feet \ndeep.\n  For the automakers still wavering on increasing fuel efficiency, I \nsay this: Do not fight the change; embrace it. There is no reason our \nautomobile manufacturers cannot do this. There is no reason. Others do \nit all over the world. Cannot we as Americans do it? Of course we can. \nThey need to embrace the opportunity to build the high performance cars \nand trucks Americans want to buy and drive and which we so desperately \nneed for the sake of our national security and global warming. It is \ntime for American automobile manufacturers to lead the world once \nagain. That will only come through a commitment to clean innovation.\n  The next part of the bill that passed reduces crude oil consumption \nby more than 10 percent over the next 15 years by producing more \nrenewable fuels, by producing them right here at home, more renewable \nfuels on America's farms, fields, and in our forests, which will create \ntens of thousands of new American jobs.\n  We set new energy efficiency standards with light bulbs, light \nfixtures, appliances, water heaters, boilers, air conditioners, which \nwill save half a trillion gallons of water every year. For a State such \nas Nevada--Las Vegas gets 4 inches of rain every year--that is \ndramatic.\n  Because Government should lead by example, we also dramatically \nimproved the energy efficiency of Federal buildings and vehicles, as \nrelates to energy, which will save billions of American taxpayer \ndollars.\n  Senator Boxer has a provision in this bill that relates to the \ncapture of carbon. It is a carbon capture study at the Capitol \npowerplant, and it also requires 15 percent of every bit of energy we \nuse on this Capitol Hill complex--by the way, there are more than \n10,000 employees here--that we need to get that from renewable sources.\n  We need to invest in the technologies that will drive our energy \nfuture, such as carbon capture and storage, that hold the hope of \ncontaining carbon emissions from producing power sources before they \never reach the air.\n  Last night's passage of the Energy bill was a great victory for the \nAmerican people. Here is why: We will save American consumers tens of \nbillions of dollars annually, cut our oil consumption by 7 million \nbarrels a day within 20 years, reduce our dependence on foreign energy \nsources now, and take critical steps in these early stages of our fight \nagainst global warming. There is a long way to go to secure the kind of \nclean and safe energy future we need. This bill is a first step, but it \nis an important first step.\n  The bill is not perfect. It is unfortunate that in passing this bill \nthe administration and most Senate Republicans blocked an effort to \nrequire more of our Nation's electricity to come from renewable sources \nas well as incentives to spur the production of more renewable fuels \nright here in America. But this fight is not over. Our friends in the \nHouse will pass their bill quickly so we can send it to the President \nfor his signature. But this bill, once again, shows us when we find \ncommon ground, we can accomplish uncommon good.\n  Mr. President, I see that my friend and partner in what happens here \nin the Senate is here, Senator Durbin.\n  I have already expressed, Senator Durbin, my appreciation for the \nwork you did in getting to the final passage of this bill. You and I \nspend so much time alone that I do not often get to say anything \npublicly about you, so I will take a brief moment to say you and I have \nbeen in the legislature, on a national basis, since 1982 together. We \nhave had good days and bad days. That is what legislation is all about. \nBut I so appreciate having you as a partner here in the Senate. You \nhave been stalwart. The people of Illinois are so fortunate to have you \nrepresenting them in the Senate. I hope I can tell you in this manner \nhow much I admire and appreciate your advocacy, your friendship, and \nthe good work you do for all of our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8275-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, thank you for recognizing me. Also I want \nto thank the majority leader for his kind words. He and I work very \nclosely together, spend more time together than we ever imagined as we \nembarked on this journey, now in leadership, to try to serve the people \nof this Nation.\n  I want to say a word about my friend from Nevada. Senator Harry Reid \nis misunderstood by many Americans. Because he is soft spoken, and not \nas assertive as some politicians are, there are many on the outside who \nquestion his leadership capacity. No one on the inside questions it. He \nis the most highly respected leader I have ever had the good fortune to \nwork with. It is based on the fact that he is inclusive, he is honest, \noutspoken, and stands by those who are willing to work harder to \nachieve our agenda.\n  Last night was a perfect illustration of this. The Energy bill was \njust a dream, a theory, for so long. The question was, could we put \ntogether a bipartisan coalition. We had to find a level of compromise \nand a level of cooperation or we did not have a chance. It was not easy \nto try to put into law, for the first time in over 20 years, a new \nnational goal for fuel efficiency of our cars and trucks. It changed a \nlot of things and was viewed as threatening by many people.\n  My wife and I have made a point of doing our very best to buy \nAmerican cars. We are loyal to the American automobile industry. With \nvery few exceptions we have tried to make sure our purchases were on \nbehalf of American workers. It was painful last night to be engaged in \na debate where my good friends in the automobile industry, not just \nmanagement--but I guess I have to be totally open with you, I am closer \nto those who work the lines, in Belvidere, IL and Bloomington, the \nUnited Auto Worker employees. I know these men and women. These are \ngood people. They are hard-working people. They take pride in what they \ndo.\n  They have been disappointed. I have as well. But our automobile \nindustry in this country has been falling farther and farther behind. \nJust a few months ago, the CEOs, the major corporate officers of the \nBig Three came, just a few feet away, and met with the leadership in \nCongress. I had a chance to ask a question of the CEOs of Ford and \nGeneral Motors and Chrysler. I asked a pretty hard question, but it was \none that has been bothering me.\n  I said to them at the time: You know, I am one of your most loyal \ncustomers. I have owned cars and trucks from each of your companies and \nplan on continuing to try to buy your products in the future. But I am \ntroubled because of the simple fact--I asked them--I said: Have any of \nyou ever heard of a magazine called ``Consumer Reports''?\n  There was this kind of embarrassed silence in the room. I said: Well, \nI want you to explain something to me. Why, for the last 20 years, have \nAmerican cars consistently shown poorer performance results than \nimported cars? Why have foreign cars, particularly from Japan, over the \nlast 20 years consistently shown better performance results, better \ntrade-in value? Why? What has been happening out there? We have the \nbest engineering schools in the world. We started this industry, at \nleast on a mass volume basis. Why is there such a difference in \nquality?\n  There was this pained silence while they waited for one of them to \nrespond. Finally, one of the CEOs said: Well, we are getting better.\n\n[[Page S8276]]\n\n  I said: I hope you are.\n  But the bottom line is, this industry now has been challenged. If the \nbill we passed last night is passed in the House of Representatives and \nbecomes law, they will face a challenge. I, for one, believe they can \nrise to this challenge. I honestly do. It is going to call for a \ndifferent mindset among the management at the highest levels in our \nautomobile companies. It is going to call for the same spirit of can-do \napproach we have seen on the assembly lines from the workers. I think \nthey can rise to this challenge.\n  I think America wants them to. I want to buy a car made in this \ncountry by American workers that is of the highest quality, that I can \ntake pride in driving, knowing it is not only a good bargain for my \nfamily, but also a good deal for the environment.\n  That, I think, is what most Americans want to do. Now, that means \nthere is going to have to be some new thinking. It means a lot of \npeople in the boardrooms of those major companies are going to have to \nsit down and rethink their game plan.\n  I met with the man who is about to become the leader of Chrysler \nCorporation. He was talking about the fact that his private equity \nbought Chrysler because of their patriotic feelings. They do not want \nthis great American car manufacturer to go away.\n  Well, I know if you are in business, sentimentality takes you so far. \nAt some point you have to produce a profitable product. I think there \nis a profitability product built into the Energy bill we talked about \nlast night. I believe if there is a conscious effort by our automobile \nmanufacturers, they can meet these fuel efficiency standards we have \nincluded in our bill.\n  They can convince a lot of skeptical Americans it is time to come \nback home, to start buying these American cars. Now, it will be a \npainful process. There will be winners and losers. But, ultimately, I \nhave confidence in this country, in the companies that work in this \ncountry, and in the workers of this country. When they come together, \nthey can achieve great things.\n  Last night we set down a challenge to them: Change what you are \nselling in America. Make it a better product. Make it a more efficient \nproduct. Make it a product that is going to help us deal with global \nwarming and climate change.\n  I think most American families are on board for that agenda. That is \nwhy I think the passage of this was so important. We never would have \npassed this energy bill late last night were it not for a bipartisan \neffort. We had many Republicans who crossed the aisle to join us. I \nthink ultimately 17 or 18 came over to join the Democrats in the key \nprocedural vote that moved this forward. Then the final vote was 65 to \n27; there were even more.\n  We could have never achieved this goal of a new energy bill were it \nnot for bipartisan cooperation, if Republicans had not come forward.\n  For some, it wasn't easy. When the Republican Senate leader, Mr. \nMcConnell of Kentucky, stood up last night late in the debate and said: \nI want this debate to end, I want this bill to be defeated, I am going \nto vote no on the cloture motion--I heard him make that announcement--I \nwas stunned. This is a bill which the administration believes has good \nelements relative to fuel economy. Yet the Republican leader stood on \nthe floor and said: I am going to try to stop this bill. He did not \nprevail because 17 or 18 of his colleagues thought it was more \nimportant that the bill move forward. I salute them. It took \nextraordinary courage for them to do what they did.\n  There was another element in the Energy bill which is important to me \nbecause of my midwestern roots and because of my determination to see \nAmerica shake its dependence on foreign oil. I am sick and tired of the \nUnited States hat in hand begging for oil from countries overseas. Many \nof these nations we turn to for oil don't share our values. In fact, \nsome of them are on the wrong side in the war on terrorism. To think \nthat every time you swipe that credit card through the gasoline pump or \nput the money on the counter, a portion of that is going to a nation \nwhich is funding terrorism is an outrage. It has to end. To think that \ntime and again our brave soldiers, men and women in uniform, are drawn \ninto conflicts in the Middle East because of oil is unacceptable. I \ndon't want my grandchildren to face that. I want America to be as close \nto energy independent as possible. How do we reach that goal? Homegrown \nfuel, homegrown energy. We grow it in my State every year, a new crop \nof corn. With that new crop of corn, more ethanol, more alcohol fuels, \nand more biodiesel come from the soybean fields. That means we have \nless of a need to import oil.\n  Last night, in this bill, we raised to a much higher level our \nnational goals when it comes to alcohol fuels, renewable fuels. It \nmeans a growing industry in my part of the world, in the Midwest, in \nIowa, Illinois, Ohio, where ethanol plants are being built. These \nplants use local production of agriculture, corn by and large, and turn \nit into alcohol. The construction workers are building the plants, \ngood-paying jobs. There are people at the plants making sure they are \nproducing ethanol. They are shipping products in trucks driven by \nAmericans to put in the cars driven by Americans. I feel good about \nthis. We are moving in the right direction.\n  This bill made a significant commitment to strengthen the market for \nalcohol fuels. I was disappointed that my biodiesel program was not \nincluded. I wish it had been. I am not giving up. We have a farm bill \ncoming up. We will have several other opportunities. I think biodiesel \nis great. It uses soybeans and other oilseeds to produce a vegetable \noil added to diesel fuel so that we don't see that huge plume of black \nsmoke coming out of the tailpipes of diesel trucks and cars, so there \nis less pollution. More homegrown energy is a good thing for the \ncountry. I want to include it as part of the energy picture.\n  This was a hard debate over the last 2 weeks. I am sorry it took 2 \nweeks. We wasted more time on the floor. I am sure the people who have \nC-SPAN on their cable often turn to it and say: What in the world is \ngoing on in the Senate? It doesn't look like there is any movement. Is \nanybody alive down there? The floor looks empty except for the handsome \nand beautiful staff we have here who are on television during the day. \nMany times there are periods when there is no activity. Time is wasted. \nThere was time wasted on this bill. Time and again, the Republican \nminority forced us to wait 30 hours, file a motion, wait another 30 \nhours.\n  We have a lot to do. I think we owe it to the American people to roll \nup our sleeves and get it done. We need more bipartisan cooperation. We \nneed to put an end to these endless motions and procedural delays. \nLet's get down to business. Wouldn't the American people cheer us if we \nsaid: Let's pass the 9/11 recommendations and turn them into law to \nmake America safer; let's do something immediately about No Child Left \nBehind to send money to the schools so they can hire the very best \nteachers and produce students who are ready to compete in the 21st \ncentury. Wouldn't the American people cheer us if, instead of being \nlost in some procedural morass day after weary day, we came up with a \nway to help working families pay for college education expenses for \ntheir children so they don't end up graduating deep in debt and unable \nto take the jobs they had their hearts set on?\n  There are so many things we need to do. With a little cooperation \nfrom the other side of the aisle and a better approach, we can say to \nour Republican friends: You are entitled under the rules of the Senate \nto produce amendments, to ask for a vote, to ask for debate. But at \nsome point, it has to come to an end. At some point, we have to move \nforward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8276-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8276-S8277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are going to have a bill come up next \nweek, a critically important bill known as the Employee Free Choice \nAct. I confess I come into this debate with strong feelings. I am a \nproduct of a family where my mother and father, my two brothers, and I \nwere all members of labor unions. This was during a period where the \nlabor movement created the middle class in America. It was World War \nII's aftermath. All of the returning veterans had an appetite to build \nhomes, start families, open schools, and create the kind of middle-\nincome working families who are the bedrock of America's democracy. The \norganization that helped these Americans move\n\n[[Page S8277]]\n\nforward was the labor movement. Organized labor went into plants and \nfactories and offices across America and said: Workers, if you stand \ntogether, if you bargain together, great things can happen.\n  They did. We created health insurance as we know it today, pension \nplans that have provided the kind of security people dream of in \nretirement, good-paying jobs in safe workplaces. The American dream was \nrealized. People bought the second car, put the kids through college, \nhad enough time for a vacation, and enjoyed the good life in America.\n  It is no coincidence that as the strength of America's labor movement \nhas declined. So, too, have the wages of working families. Not that \nthose working families aren't doing a good job; they are. They are \nproducing more goods and services than ever. They are more productive \nthan ever, but they are not being paid for their hard work. They are \nnot receiving a decent, livable wage so they can work one job and still \nhave time with their family. They are not receiving the kind of health \ninsurance protection they once received and fewer and fewer are \nreceiving.\n\n  Taking a look at the numbers, in Illinois the median hourly wage fell \nin 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 by 4.4 percent. Think about that. The \nmedian wage of people getting up and going to work every day is not \nkeeping up with inflation; it is falling behind. Health care benefits \nin Illinois, the share of the population under the age of 65 with \nemployer-provided health insurance fell from 71.9 percent in 1999 to \n68.2 percent in 2004. Fewer people had health insurance through their \nemployers over a 5-year period. That is the wrong direction. Pensions \nare the same. In my State, 52.6 percent of the people had employer-\nprovided pensions in the years 1998 to 2000. By 2003 to 2005, the share \nhad dropped to under 50 percent.\n  I honestly believe if workers can organize, if they can bargain, we \ncould have profitable corporations with quality goods and services, \ngood employee morale, and employees treated decently. That can happen.\n  The Employer Free Choice Act says that we want to give employees who \nwant to organize a fighting chance. Some will say during the debate: If \na majority of the workers in the workplace sign a card and say, I want \nto be part of a union, the process moves forward. Currently, if 30 \npercent of the workers sign a card, they move toward an election. Do \nyou know how long it takes to have this election? Do you know how long \nit takes for the employees to finally get their chance to vote today as \nto whether they want a union? The Chicago Tribune pointed out in March \nof this year that the average National Labor Relations Board disputed \nelection--and so many of them are disputed--takes 802 days to resolve, \nmore than 2 years. Just think for a moment: if we said that the \ninterminable campaigns we now have for public office would double in \nlength--instead of a year from announcing your candidacy to a vote, we \nwill make it over 2 years--is it possible voters would lose interest in \nthat period of time? Is it possible people could work on their minds \nabout prejudices against a candidate or for a candidate during that \ntime? Of course it is. We need to make this a reasonable period and a \nreasonable process that comes to the ultimate question: Do a majority \nof the workers at this location want to organize collectively to try to \nrepresent their best interests and the interests of their family? I \nbelieve that is only fair.\n  Tuesday morning, we will have a vote. I hope my colleagues on both \nsides will take a close look at the legislation. If we give more \nopportunities for workers to express their heartfelt intentions about \ncreating a union and they do, what is going to happen in America is as \npositive as what happened after World War II. We are going to see more \nworkers in safer workplaces with decent living wages, good health \ninsurance, and good pension benefits, and the corporations will still \nmake a profit. Instead of giving some CEO $600 million for very little \nperformance, they may have to make do with $300 million. I know it is \ngoing to be tough, but I think they can get by and then take that $300 \nmillion and give it to the workers so they have a chance to enjoy a \ngood life without indebtedness and without the worries that come with \nthe current situation.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me on Tuesday in supporting this \neffort. I hope in joining me, we will see a change in the law and, with \nthis change, we will see a dramatic improvement in the economic fate of \nAmerican families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8277-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PROTECTION OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning's Washington Post had a \nfront-page story that troubles me. It is about Vice President Cheney \nand his attempts to exempt the Office of the Vice President of the \nUnited States of America from the Presidential Executive order that \nestablishes a uniform, government-wide system for safeguarding \nclassified national security information. The decision by Vice \nPresident Cheney to exempt his office from this system for protecting \nclassified information troubles me. It could place national security \nsecrets at risk.\n  It is hard to believe the Vice President is taking this action given \nthe history of security breaches involving high-ranking officials in \nhis office. Scooter Libby, the Vice President's former Chief of Staff, \nhas been convicted of several felonies: perjury, obstruction of \njustice, and false statements. He has been sentenced to prison in part \nfor his role in disclosing the identity of a covert CIA agent and then \nmisrepresenting that fact to a grand jury. Worse, it appears, at least \naccording to these press reports, Vice President Cheney has attempted \nto block inspection of Federal agencies and White House offices to \nensure compliance with the security procedures required by the \nPresident.\n  According to the National Archives, the agency responsible for \nconducting the oversight, Vice President Cheney asserted that his \noffice is not ``an entity within the executive branch'' and, therefore, \nnot subject to Presidential Executive orders. The Vice President is \narguing that his office is not in the executive branch of Government? \nIt is hard to imagine the tortured logic Vice President Cheney is using \nto avoid the requirements of the law and Executive orders.\n  Then he recommended that the Executive order be amended to abolish \nthe Information Security Oversight Office. Here is a Vice President who \nhas already been challenged as to the groups he meets with and the \npeople he consults with in making some of the most important decisions \nfor the country's policy. Here is a Vice President who has sadly \nmisrepresented this war in Iraq over and over again, from the \ninitiation of the war, the existence of weapons of mass destruction, \nand now is saying that he is not covered by the law when it comes to \nthe disclosure of classified information within his own office. This is \nevidence of arrogance of power, and it is unacceptable.\n  The Vice President of the United States and his former Chief of Staff \nare not above the law. They have to be held to the same high standard \nof performance as Members of Congress and every member of our \nGovernment. For the Vice President to believe he has no responsibility \nto meet this requirement of the law is, in my mind, a dereliction of \nduty and responsibility to the people of the United States. And then \nfor him to attempt to abolish the agency that was putting pressure on \nhim to follow the law shows he has gone entirely too far.\n  Vice President Cheney is not above the law. He is required to follow \nthe law, as every American citizen should. This situation and the \nprosecution of his former Chief of Staff are evidence of an attitude \ntoward governmental responsibility which has to change. I sincerely \nhope the Vice President will make it clear in the week ahead that he is \nfinally going to comply with these Executive orders, that he is going \nto make sure we protect classified information moving through his \noffice so we do not compromise this important intelligence data that \nkeeps America safe.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the legacy left \nbehind by a brave young Kentuckian. In Berea, KY, people remember \nTheodore M. ``Coty'' West as a devoted husband, a caring older brother, \na loving son, and a steadfast friend.\n  His fellow soldiers remember him as a sturdy soldier who cared about \nhis buddies. His legacy remains in the form of a charity he founded \nthat sends care packages to soldiers serving in Iraq. This work is now \ncarried on by his family, in his memory.\n  PFC Theodore M. West--``Coty'' was his nickname--enlisted in the U.S. \nArmy in August 2005, and was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry \nRegiment, 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, at Fort Hood, TX.\n  He was deployed in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in \nNovember 2006. Just a few weeks later, on November 29, 2006, an \nimprovised explosive device detonated near his vehicle during combat \noperations in Baghdad, tragically ending Coty's life. He was 23 years \nold.\n  For his valorous service, Private First Class West received the \nBronze Star and the Purple Heart, along with numerous other medals and \nawards.\n  Private First Class West understood the values that set America apart \nhave been paid for by freedom's defenders, and he wanted to join their \nranks. In a letter to his church that arrived on the day he died, Coty \nurged his friends at home to ``sleep well tonight . . . because tonight \nwe stand guard on the wall, and no one will get through to hurt you.''\n  That kind of courage to stand up to any enemy, that strength of \nspirit, made Coty West one of America's finest sons.\n  Coty grew up amidst the rolling hills of Berea, KY, surrounded by a \nloving family, a circle of friends, and a devoted young wife. All of \nthese members of Coty's community hold special memories of him, from \nwhen he was a little boy to the day he left for Fort Hood.\n  It was in Berea, when Coty was only 4 years old, that he told his \nparents he and his brother Ben would go out and dig for treasure. His \nparents told their young treasure hunters to be safe and stay within \nsight. Imagine their surprise when Coty and Ben returned home with a \ncollection of 14 antique silver dollars and some antique jewelry they \nhad dug up in the yard.\n  Coty's family was important to him. They remember him gallantly \nsaddling up and taking out his horse at the age of 8, in a saddle as \nbig as he was, desperately trying to be brave, when he must have been \nscared to death.\n  And the time he and his younger sister Sheri enrolled in a hunting \nsafety course so they could get their hunting licenses. The younger \nSheri bested Coty by 10 points on the test, a fact he was never allowed \nto live down.\n  Coty and his family especially enjoyed taking road trips. They would \ntravel to NASCAR races, State parks, and Civil War battlefields. It was \nsomething the family cherished, especially as the kids grew up. It gave \nthem a way of all getting back together again.\n  On July 5, 2006, Coty married Jennifer Gregory in a military ceremony \nnear her home in Greenville, KY. His father later wrote that ``the \nceremony really fit Coty, as it was beautiful, it was country, and it \nwas military.'' Jennifer remembers her husband as ``an angel . . . and \nperfect.'' I am certain Coty felt the same about her.\n  After graduating from Estill County High School, Coty worked in his \nfamily's energy and construction business as an operator and foreman. \nHe was certain, though, that his career lay in the military. His father \ndescribes Coty as neither a hawk nor a dove, but a soldier. He viewed \nhis job as protecting those he loved and waging war on those who would \nharm them.\n  Early on in his military career, Coty became aware of the financial \nburden combat could have on his fellow soldiers. He also felt for those \nwith little or no family, who lacked the messages from home that so \noften sustain a young soldier.\n  So Coty began a charity to help his fellow soldiers going to Iraq. \nHis efforts evolved into ``Coty and Friends,'' a circle of military \nfamilies and supporters who would send soldiers needed supplies before \ntheir deployment.\n  But Coty never lived to see his plans come to fruition. He was killed \nbefore the first box of Coty and Friends supplies arrived in Iraq. The \ngroup's efforts still continue, in his memory.\n  The night Coty was deployed to Iraq, the last thing he told his \nfamily was: ``I love you all, I know you love me, I am good at my job, \nand I will see you soon.''\n  Coty leaves behind a beloved family. He is missed and cherished by \nhis wife, Jennifer Gregory West, his mother, Rene Brandenburg, his \nfather, Bill West, his stepmother, Mary Ann West, his sister, Sheri \nMiller, his brothers Dee, Matt, and Ben West, his grandparents Rufus \nWest and Jessie Mae Brandenburg, and many others.\n\n  Coty West understood the price of freedom. He wanted his family to be \nsafe here at home, and he saw that they would be, as he and his fellow \nsoldiers stood guard on the wall. He gave of himself so others could \nenjoy what he fought to protect.\n  The Coty and Friends charity still brings his family together, and it \nstill sustains our brave sons and daughters in Iraq who stand guard on \nthe wall, so that others may live in peace and security.\n  This country will never forget PFC Theodore West's sacrifice. Neither \nwill the soldier in Iraq who opens a Coty and Friends care package \ntonight. I ask the Senate to send their thoughts and prayers to the \nWest family, who continue to give to their country, even after they \nhave already given so much.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are all thankful for those comments \ngiven by our Members about the extraordinary bravery and heroism of our \nmen and women who serve in the Armed Forces of our country. All of us, \nday after day, salute their courage and their dedication to the \ncountry, and it reminds us of our responsibility of making sure we are \ngoing to get the policy right in Iraq.

Mr. President, we find ourselves now in the middle of \nJune, and it is important, as we move through the legislative agenda--\nand more on that next week--that we pause for a few moments and take \nstock about where our country is in terms of the economy of this Nation \nand take stock about where our country is with regard to working \nfamilies in this Nation.\n  We often get tied up on particular pieces of legislation, but I think \nall of us are very mindful it is the working families of this Nation \nwho have made America great. If America is great--and it is great--it \nis because of working families in all parts of our Nation.\n  We are mindful of our recent history: of those extraordinary men and \nwomen who lifted our Nation out of the Great Depression of the 1920s \nand the 1930s; the extraordinary exploitation of workers that took \nplace, even prior to that time and during that period of time; and the \nstruggle workers had in order to have a voice in the decisionmaking \npart of this Nation, in the workplace as well as in governmental \npolicies, that influenced the conditions by which they worked. It was a \nlong, continuing struggle. It was a long, continuing struggle, with a \nloss of life and blood that was shed and with battles that were \nfought--physically fought.\n  Out of the end of it came the trade union movement, which has made \nsuch a difference in terms of the life of this country, the fairness of \nthe country, the economic fairness and economic justice of the Nation.\n  It has always impressed me--as one who has been a sponsor of the \nincrease in the minimum wage, with a number of our colleagues--that \neven though many of these union members are making a good deal more \nthan the minimum wage, that any time issues about the working \nconditions of fellow Americans who are at the short end of the economic \nladder arise, they are always out there. They are always there. They \nare always not only speaking for but in support of their fellow workers \nin this country.\n  That was seen in this last year in the six different States that had \ninitiatives about the increase in the minimum\n\n[[Page S8279]]\n\nwage, where the representatives of the trade union movement were out \nthere going door-to-door, working with other families, shoulder to \nshoulder, to try to indicate and reflect that this Nation wanted to \nmake sure that work paid, that those on the short end of the economic \nladder--primarily women--were going to be able to receive a decent wage \nfor a decent hour's work.\n  We need to recognize, again, the majority of women who are out there \nreceiving the minimum wage have children, so it is a children's issue, \nit is a women's issue. It is a civil rights issue because so many of \nthose who earn the minimum wage are men and women of color. Most of \nall, it is a fairness issue. Americans understand fairness.\n  What we have seen over the more recent years is enormously \ndistressing and disturbing because we have seen that those efforts of \nthe trade union movement are targeted by unscrupulous employers and \ncompanies who are bent upon destroying the trade union movement and to \nmove us back into a different time and a different circumstance for \nthose workers.\n  We saw, in fact, it took 10 years for us to get an increase in the \nminimum wage. The minimum wage was purchasing, at the end of those 10 \nyears, perhaps less than at any time in the history of the minimum \nwage. We have seen it reflected in the policies of this administration, \nwhen they cut about 6 million workers out of overtime and when they \nrefused to include Davis-Bacon provisions for the restoration of the \nbuildings and constructions down in the gulf coast because of Katrina \nand with a whole series of additional kinds of activities. We see the \ncourts, as well, striking down protections in the last few weeks--\nprotections for an increase in the minimum wage and overtime pay for \nhomecare workers. We see the Supreme Court also effectively striking \ndown equal pay for women. There is really an assault--an assault--on \nworking families.\n\n  As we look back at the history of this country, what really \nreflects--these are general statements and comments, but let's look at \nwhat were the circumstances and what were the conditions I speak about. \nIf you look at 1947 to 1973--and we are looking at the economic growth \nin the United States of America; this is the Economic Policy \nInstitute--and you look over this chart and you see each segment of the \nAmerican economy is all growing, virtually at the same rate. This was \n1947 to 1973. America was growing together. This is extraordinary \nbecause we know we just came out of World War II. We had mobilized 16 \nmillion of our fellow citizens, and that had an extraordinary impact, \nand we had to retool the whole domestic economy and still we were able \nto see the growth in the United States of America move along at a \nsimilar kind of growth pattern so that all Americans and those at the \nlowest end of the economic ladder moving just a little bit faster, a \nlittle bit faster than some of those in the top 20 percent.\n  Then, from 1973 up to the year 2000, we find a new political \nphilosophy taking place in this country. These were the policies we \nwere going to see, the very dramatic and significant tax cut policies, \nthe economic policies that took place in the 1980s and after, with the \nRepublicans. We look at this and we see the level of growth between \n1973 and 2000, and we see the lowest economic growth growing at the \nlowest rate and on up to those at the top growing the fastest--in a \nnumber of instances, growing three or four times faster than those at \nthe lowest. That is a direct result of economic policies by primarily \nthe Executive and Congress, which advantages those individuals at the \ntop of the economic ladder and disadvantages those at the bottom.\n  If we look at what has been happening over the last 5 years, we see \nthose at the lowest end of the economic ladder are now not only not \nmoving up but falling further and further behind, and those top 1 \npercent--not the top 20 percent, but the top 1 percent--have been \nmoving up so dramatically. So we are having a divided America.\n  Now, let's see what is the one factor that has had the greatest \ninfluence. This is an interesting chart because, remember, we talked \nabout 1947 and how we all grew together. Look at this. We had the \nincrease in productivity, that is the increase in workers' output, \nfinding more efficiencies, more effectiveness, and we also found a \ncorresponding increase in the wages. American workers were \nparticipating in the increased productivity, and with that \nparticipation all during this 20-year period, the American economy and \nAmericans were growing together--growing together, not apart. We ask \nourselves: Do we want to be a divided nation, or do we want to be one \nnation with one history and one destiny?\n  Then look what happened during the latter period. This is at a period \nof peak union membership. Wages and productivity rose together. America \nwas on the road to prosperity, and all Americans were participating, \nand the trade union movement played an important role to ensure \nfairness in the workplace. Now we find that the unions are declining. \nAnd what happens correspondingly? As the unions decline, the workers \nfall further behind. Here we have real wages from the 1970s to 2000 \nvirtually stagnant, and the increasing productivity which grew at 206 \npercent more than wages. What does that demonstrate? It demonstrates \nthat we have seen the extraordinary growth in the profits. We find \nworkers' wages have basically stabilized, but corporate profits grew up \nto 63 percent. Wages were down here, and profits were at the top during \nthe same period of time that workers and unions are being attacked and \nattacked and attacked.\n  From 1947 to the early 1960s, right in here, we had effectively what \nwe call the card checkoff, which is the subject of the legislation we \nwill be voting on next Tuesday. Interestingly, the card checkoff was in \neffect all during this period of time: from 1941, 1946, 1956, right up \nto 1966. We had the card checkoff then.\n  The legislation we will be voting on next Tuesday has already been in \neffect and been utilized. We will hear a lot of statements on the floor \nof the Senate about a process and a procedure which is irregular and \nfraught with problems and complexities, but the fact is, we had it in \nuse in the United States of America all during the period where we had \neconomic stability and economic growth, and the Nation was growing \ntogether. Then, as the National Labor Relations Board changed and the \nSupreme Court and businesses got geared up, they effectively eliminated \nthe card checkoff.\n  We have seen what has been happening in the workplace, and this \nindicates how abuses have skyrocketed. So when we had the checkoff, we \nhad economic growth, we had economic prosperity, and America growing \ntogether. That is what we want. That is what next Tuesday morning is \nabout--to restore this period of time when America, with the checkoff, \nwas able to ensure economic growth and prosperity for workers across \nthe board. That is what we are looking for.\n  Now, you say: Well, what are all these abuses you talk about? That is \nan easy word to use, but what are we really talking about? What we are \ntalking about are these kinds of abuses which are the everyday abuses \nbeing used in the workplace.\n  First of all, the workers face too many roadblocks to try to get a \nunion. Over here, workers who lead the union effort are fired. I will \ngive examples and illustrations of that.\n\n  Then, the employer challenges the election results at the NLRB. So \neven if they have a successful vote for the union, too many of all of \nthose results are challenged in the NLRB.\n  Then, the employer appeals the ruling often in court.\n  Then, the employer stalls and refuses to bargain for a first \ncontract.\n  If you look at what has been happening in the courts, you will find \nmore have been upholding the National Labor Relations Board when they \nhave found against the workers.\n  Then, after 1 year, the employers, if they are able to delay, can \nseek to stop recognizing the union, and workers have to start all over \nagain.\n  This is a pattern. This isn't a unique situation. This is what is \nhappening now.\n  This is what is happening. The employees are fired in one-quarter of \nall the private sector union organizing campaigns. One-quarter are all \nfired. One in five workers who openly advocate for a union during an \nelection campaign is fired.\n  Now, it is fair enough to ask--in 2005, here is the employer abuses \nchart. In\n\n[[Page S8280]]\n\n2005, 30,000 workers received backpay after the National Labor \nRelations Board found that employers had violated their rights--30,000 \nin 1 year alone. That means employers at some time during the year \nfired or violated the rights of 30,000 people--30,000. That is 30,000 \nwe are talking about who are being treated unfairly.\n  Now, the question becomes, do workers really want to join? Are we \ntalking about something that is a real problem or not?\n  Here is 1984 to 2005. Workers want unions more than ever, but can't \njoin them. The percentage of nonunion workers who want a union is up 23 \npercent. The percentage of workers in a union is down 6.5 percent. So \nyou would think with those kinds of indicators we would be able to have \na clear pathway where people would have an opportunity to join, but \nthat is not the case. What we have seen is out across the countryside, \non a wide range of different kinds of issues, this is what is happening \nacross the countryside for the average family in this country.\n  We find that gas is up 79 percent. We find medical expenses are up 38 \npercent. College tuition is up 43 percent. We find that housing is up \n40 percent, and wages effectively are stagnant or up only 4 percent.\n  The survey we earlier saw about the numbers of people who wanted to \njoin the unions show that over half of the workers--more than 60 \nmillion workers--would join a union if they could, but they cannot.\n  Now, we have given some of the flow lines and the statistics, but \nthese charts show what happens to some real people: ``I was fired,'' \nErron Hohrein, former boilermaker from Front Range Energy. This is a \npicture of him.\n\n       They forced us to attend meetings. They threatened that if \n     our campaign was successful, our paychecks may suffer. \n     Managers would follow me around the workplace at all times. \n     They would not permit other workers to talk to me. They \n     isolated me from my coworkers. Within days after the union \n     election was certified by the National Labor Relations Board, \n     I was fired.\n\n  This gentleman worked in that plant and found all kinds of safety \nconcerns and raised the safety concerns to the employers and was told \nto keep quiet, even though he believed those kinds of safety matters \nwere endangering the lives of the people with whom he was working. When \nhe found that the employer was unwilling to try and address some of \nthese safety conditions, he said: I am going to try and form a union. \nThen he had the following circumstances: within days after the union \nelection was certified, he was fired. So this is happening out there. \nThese are examples of the 30,000.\n  Anna Calles, who is a laundry worker in North Carolina:\n\n       The union was the only way to have better pay, good health \n     insurance and equality, not discrimination. Cintas will never \n     improve working conditions on its own free will. When we \n     tried to organize, management told us that we would lose our \n     jobs. The workers are scared. The NLRB has not been able to \n     help much. We have had to wait three years to get a decision.\n\n  Delay, delay, delay, delay.\n\n       Cintas has appealed the NLRB's ruling that the company \n     committed extensive violations of workers' rights.\n\n  So Anna and her coworkers are still waiting for justice.\n  These are real-life stories. It is quite clear why individuals want \nto be able to join the unions.\n  These are the figures which show that union members get better wages. \nThese are Department of Labor statistics which show that workers are \ngoing to be able to have a modest increase 30 percent more--than those \nwho are nonunion.\n  If we look at particular sectors of our economy--this is an \ninteresting chart. A union job means higher wages for women and for \npeople of color. Again, we are talking about equity in this country. We \nare talking about fairness in this country.\n  This is what unions do in terms of equity and in terms of fairness. \nIf you look at women, the difference it makes in terms of helping, it \nis more than 31 percent; nonunion, if you are talking about African-\nAmericans and Latinos--all of them are inevitably much better off. If \nyou have the freedom to choose the union, it lifts the workers out of \npoverty. This is the Federal poverty line, this black line across here \non the chart. Look at this. These are the national figures for these \nparticular industries: cashier, childcare, cook, and housekeeper. If \nthey are nonunion, they are below the poverty line.\n  If you are a cashier and a member of a union, you are just above it, \na little less than $25,000. We are talking about people who have a \nsense of dignity and pride and desire to do a good day's work. These \nare men and women of pride. We are talking about $20,000 to $25,000 a \nyear. For childcare, the difference at a union wage is just about at \nthe Federal poverty level. If you are a cook, it is a little above the \npoverty level. For a housekeeper, it is just above it also.\n  This is a commitment to try to make sure we are not going to have our \nfellow Americans living in poverty. We are talking about people who \nwant to work, can work, and will work. That chart is about as clear an \nindication of the difference, if they have an opportunity to join.\n  Mr. President, I will mention a couple of companies that have \nrecognized the card check process. Some employers have been remarkably \nenlightened and say: We are going to let our workers, if they choose, \nhave a checkoff, and we will recognize them. That used to be the way \nthe law went. A number of companies, including Cingular Wireless, have \nsupported that concept. This person said:\n\n       Management didn't pressure us to try to interfere. We \n     didn't attack the company and they didn't attack us. We were \n     focused on improving our jobs and making Cingular a better \n     place to work.\n\n  This is Rick Bradley:\n\n       We believe employees should have a \n     choice. . . . We make that choice available to them results . \n     . . in employees who are engaged in the business and who have \n     a passion for customers.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 final \nminute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the purpose of this is to show that when \nAmerica has been at its best and strongest, we all grow together. When \nwe find out that America is divided--and the principal reason for this \ndivision is demonstrated with these charts; it is so often because \nemployers have assaulted and attacked the rights of workers and their \nrepresentatives over this history. We want to try to bring America back \ntogether again and make it stronger from an economic point of view.\n  A final chart shows that in Ireland, which has the one of the \nstrongest economies in Europe and a high rate of union membership and \nstrong annual growth, a partnership of decency and fairness goes hand \nin hand. I hope the Senate recognizes that on Tuesday when we vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8280-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8280-S8283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share some general comments on \nwhere we are with regard to immigration and, really, American workers. \nI am pleased to see my colleague, Senator Kennedy, here. I know he \nbelieves strongly in the minimum wage and in union contracts and \nstrikes and that kind of thing to get wages up. I will just say to my \ncolleague that the real thing which drives wages, which helps working \nAmericans be able to get higher wages and better benefits, is when \ntheir product or their labor becomes more valuable.\n  In this debate last year, I raised that question. I see my former \nchairman of the HELP Committee--the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee--Senator Enzi. Senator Kennedy now chairs that \ncommittee. When Senator Enzi chaired it, we had a hearing in September \nof 2006 with economists and experts to discuss the impact on working \nAmericans, middle-class workers, the wages they receive as impacted by \nimmigration. I don't think there was a single dissent in that \ncommittee--everyone agreed that large influxes of low skilled immigrant \nlabor bring down the wages of the American workers that compete with \nthem. And the Judiciary Committee last year also had one hearing on the \nmatter in April of 2006. Witnesses at that hearing also agreed \nunanimously that the wages of working class Americans are adversely\n\n[[Page S8281]]\n\nimpacted by large flows of immigrants into our country. How could it be \notherwise? That is a basic economic principle--when supply goes up, the \nprice goes down. When demand goes up and supply remains the same, the \nprice goes up.\n  When I raised this point on the floor, Senator Kennedy, during the \nimmigration reform debate last year, responded to me. His solution was \nthat we should raise the minimum wage. I responded that it is not my \ngoal to have American citizens making $7 an hour; my goal is to create \na free market economy where their labor is worth $12, $15, $18, or $25 \nan hour. These wage levels are being seen by workers in nonunion \nbusinesses in Alabama right now. We absolutely don't need to go back to \na system that allows self-interested union organizers to force people \ninto unions when they are already making higher wages then they have \never made before, as they are in Alabama. I absolutely don't believe \nthat unions are the way to see us make progress on wages. But I am \nconcerned that the net effect of large flows of immigration is that \nwages are being brought down. It is not responsible to have immigration \npolicies that depress the wages of American workers.\n  Some of the immigrants are legal, but most are not legal. Together, \nthey are pulling down wages of the Americans that compete with them in \nthe labor market. We have had expert testimony to that effect. I cite \nto my colleagues a professor at the Kennedy School at Government at \nHarvard University, himself a Cuban refugee, George Borjas. He says \nthat working wages for Americans have been pulled down by as much as 8 \npercent in the areas where immigration is highest. That is a \nsignificant amount. Instead of going up in a booming economy, wages \nhave gone down. Alan Tonelson, a research fellow from the U.S. Business \nand Industry Council Educational Foundation testified that from 2000 to \n2005, in job categories where competition from illegal immigrants is \nthe highest, real wages--those adjusted for inflation--went down, even \nthough demand for labor was going up. How could it be otherwise? Don't \nwe believe in a free market? Does any farmer doubt that if more cotton \nand corn were brought into this country, the price of their product \nwould go down? Certainly we know that. We deal with that issue every \nday in the Senate, and we understand it. Why that base economic free \nmarket principle would be denied and overlooked when it comes to how \nimmigration effects the labor market is beyond my understanding.\n  So, sure, immigration is important. We are not trying to stop \nimmigration. Immigrants are overwhelmingly good people, they are hard \nworkers, and they want to make a better life for themselves and their \nfamilies. But, we have to ask ourselves, what levels and types of \nimmigration serve our national interest? How can we make sure our \nmiddle-class workers are not having their incomes substantially reduced \nin a time when the growth and prosperity of our nation should be \nputting part of the high profits being made into their pockets? We can \nmake sure that lower and middle class Americans are benefitting from \nout surging economy if we do this immigration bill right. This bill \ndoesn't do that, and that is why I oppose it.\n\n  I had a wonderful day yesterday with President Bush. We disagree on \nthis issue. He made the comment in my hometown of Mobile that a Texan \nfriend of his once said if we agree 100 percent on every issue, then \none of us would not be needed. Well, we don't agree on this issue, but \nhe has a good vision for America. He believes we need to do something \nabout immigration and he has high ideals about it. He wants to fix our \nimmigration system and he wants to fix it comprehensively.\n  I have said repeatedly, in the last 2 years of debate, that we do \nneed a comprehensive fix, we need a guest worker program that actually \nwill work and be effective, one that is responsive to the needs of the \nmarket without depressing the wages of the American worker. I have said \nthat we need to replace the lawless system of immigration we now have \nwith a lawful one, one that serves our national interests, and by that \nI mean the interests of the American worker and the long-term national \ninterests of our country.\n  Sadly, I do not believe that the bill before the Senate comes close \nto creating a lawful system that serves our national interests. The \nSenate bill is a 750-page document that was plopped down here after \nonly 48 hours of notice, without any committee hearings this year. It \nlacks cohesive policy goals. It is a political baby-splitting document \ncrafted by politicians who were focused on the need to write something \nthat could pass, rather than a document produced by professionals and \nexperts and economists and law enforcement officials focused on how to \ncreate a system that will be honest and will work. That is what the \ndebate is all about. Will the Senate bill actually work. So my \ndisagreement with the legislation is not what it aspires to do, if I \nbelieved that it would do what it aspires to do--to secure the border \nand restore the rule of law then I'd be supportive of the bill.\n  You will hear my colleagues come to the floor and talk about their \nmama and grandma and that they emigrated from country X and we are all \nblessed because overwhelmingly, except for Native Americans--even their \nancestors at one time came here--we are all descendants of immigrants. \nI want to be clear. Those of us opposed to the Senate bill are not \nagainst immigration. Instead, we want to do it right so that it serves \nthe immigrants who come to America and serves America by selecting \nthose who can be most benefited by the American experience and who will \nmost benefit America.\n  We are indeed, I am afraid, moving to legislation that would repeat \nthe error of 1986 in which amnesty was given and enforcement never \noccurred. Three million people were given amnesty then. Now we have 12 \nmillion people asking for amnesty again. What is the problem with the \nlegislation? Let me share some thoughts.\n  First, under this legislation, the number of legal immigrants to be \nallowed into our country and to be given permanent legal status within \nthe next 20 years will double. The legal number will double. Do you \nthink most Americans understand that? I don't.\n  Let me briefly mention the history of immigration in our country.\n  From 1820 to 1879, we had what was called the great continental \nexpansion, where people moved out toward the west. One hundred and \nsixty thousand came a year. Then it dropped off significantly.\n  From 1880 to 1924, they called it the great wave of immigration. \nImmigration averaged 580,000 people a year, a big movement of people \ninto our country, and we continued to expand westward in our Nation. \nThen immigration again began to drop off, particularly during the \nDepression, and people's wages were down.\n  The period of 1925 through 1965 is sometimes referred to as the stop-\nand-settle period. During that time, immigration was at 180,000 a year, \nand the large great wave of immigrants that came in the decades before \nwere assimilated into America. They became productive, mastered the \nlanguage, and became part of a settlement and an assimilation that was \nimportant for our country.\n  In 1965, we developed the new system of immigration now known as \nchain migration, which resulted in about 500,000 immigrants a year up \nuntil 1990.\n  Since 1990, however, the number doubled, and it has been about 1 \nmillion a year. Since 2000, I suggest, counting the illegal flow, it \nhas been at least 1.5 million a year, which is the highest rate of \nimmigration in the history of our country.\n  This bill would basically double legal immigration and do very little \nto stop the illegal flow. This gives us no time for a stop-and-settle \nperiod but perpetuates the record high rates of immigration for an \nindefinite period. That is where we are historically, and we ought to \nunderstand that. I don't think anybody would dispute, basically, what I \njust summarized for you.\n  Let me explain how the Senate bill will double legal immigration. \nUnder current law, 23.4 million immigrants, including 19.6 million \ngreen cards and 3.8 million workers, would be admitted and here in year \n2027. But under the Senate bill, the numbers would be 47 million \nimmigrants, composed of 38.1 million green cards, twice the 19.6 \nmillion green cards that would be issued under current law, and 8 \nmillion, almost 9 million temporary workers on top of that. That number \nof temporary\n\n[[Page S8282]]\n\nworkers would be here on an annual basis. Some would have to leave \nevery year and return every year but that is the potential number.\n  I am certain most Americans do not believe that doubling of the \nimmigration levels in America is what was being discussed when people \nwere promised comprehensive immigration reform. Doubling the legal \nrate, I believe, is contrary to the impression given by the bill's \nsponsors. People are not being told that reform means this kind of \nincrease. In fact, I would think most people are expecting that \nimmigration reform means we will reduce the rate of immigration which \nalready is at the highest this Nation has ever had.\n  So this kind of knowledge, when it gets out to people, fuels cynicism \nabout what Congress is doing, it fuels anger at the voters. I repeat, I \ndon't think their anger is focussed at immigrants. I think it is \nfocused at those of us in Congress who promised we were going to create \na lawful system that would bring some control to our borders, and it \nends up doubling the number of immigrants that come lawfully. That is \npart of the problem. Some people get mad at the talk shows. All the \ntalk shows are doing is telling the truth, that people did not state \nclearly when they promoted this bill for passage. People ought to be \ncynical and they ought to be upset about that, in my view.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business \nfor an additional 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is what this is all about. I was under the \nimpression that when the bill promoters came forward from their secret \nmeetings, they thought they had produced a bill that was going to give \nus a a lawful system of immigration. Didn't you hear that? Isn't that \nwhat you expected to be part of the product we would pass, that amnesty \nwould be given but we would have a lawful system in the future, right? \nThis is important. Isn't that what we were basically told by the people \nwho produced this document, the 750-page bill they plopped down here \nwithout hearings a few weeks ago?\n  The sad fact is that the bill language does not keep the promises of \nits drafters. According to the Congressional Budget Office, a \nnonpartisan group that works for the Congress that helps us analyze \nlegislation, Cost Estimate released on June 4: Implementing the bill's \nenforcement and verification requirements will only ``reduce the net \nannual flow of illegal immigrants by one-quarter.''\n  So that is a 25-percent reduction, approximately 2 million over 20 \nyears. Twenty-five percent, do you think that is enough of a result for \ncomprehensive reform? But wait, there is more. CBO also estimates that \nthe bill's temporary worker provision will add approximately 1 million \nillegal visa overstays over the same 20 years. The bill will add an \nadditional number of illegal overstays, more illegal overstays than \nunder current law. That is because we already have a lot of temporary \nworker visa programs, and when you create new ones that will bring in \nmore temporary workers, then more people are going to stay illegally.\n  CBO goes on to say this in their careful analysis:\n\n       Other aspects of the legislation are likely to increase the \n     number of illegal immigrants, in particular through people \n     overstaying their visas from the guest worker and H-1B \n     programs. CBO estimates--\n\n  This is their report--\n\n     that another 1.1 million people would be added by 2017 as a \n     result of the guest worker program, about half of them \n     authorized workers and dependents, the remainder the result \n     of unauthorized overstays. That figure would grow to 2 \n     million by 2027.\n\n  Twenty years from now. The net result is that according to CBO, a \nmere 1.3 million less illegal immigrants will enter this country and \nlive in this country in 2027 than would be expected under current law, \nwhere we expect 10 million under current law to come illegally.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       CBO expects that the enforcement measure and the higher \n     number of overstayers would on net diminish the number of \n     unauthorized immigrants by about 500,000 in 2017 and about \n     1.3 million in 2027.\n\n  What that means is when you take the 25-percent reduction of \nillegality at the border and an increase in visa overstays illegality, \nit comes out, according to their numbers, to only a net 13-percent \nreduction in illegality.\n  So we are going to double the legal number, see, and as a result we \nare only going to get a 13-percent reduction in illegality.\n  I say to the Members of the Senate, that is not what we are getting \npaid to do, that is not what we promised to do, that is not what we \nshould do. That is not acceptable. I wish it were not so. I wish we had \nlegislation before the Senate that would do better job at reducing \nillegal immigration, that would comprehensively fix our illegal \nimmigration, but we don't.\n  I have been warning my colleagues about this and pointing out the \nflaws in the bill, and other Senators have pointed out flaw after flaw. \nWe have this official report that indicates we have only a 13-percent \nreduction in illegality, and it is not right. We cannot pass such a \nbill and then go to our constituents and say we did something good for \nyou, we fixed a broken system. We just cannot do that.\n\n  I urge my colleagues, no matter how much they want to see our \nimmigration system reformed, no matter how much they have hoped that \nthis legislation would be the vehicle to do it to consider my comments \nbefore you vote. A careful reading of this bill indicates it will not \ncreate the system they are envisioning, and we should not pass it.\n  Once again, didn't the promoters of the legislation promise more than \nthis, that it would actually secure our border, that it would end \nlawlessness? Isn't that what they promised? Isn't creating a lawful \nimmigration system for America a national imperative? Isn't it \nsomething we must do? No wonder the American people are cynical and \nangry.\n  Another promise we were given when the bill was introduced, and \nprobably while it was being prepared, was that we would move to a \nmerit-based system; that we would do a better job of identifying those \npeople who apply to our country who have the greatest potential to \nflourish in America and do well. Canada does this. Sixty percent of the \npeople who come to Canada come based on a merit-based competition. If \nyou speak English or French, if you have some education, if you have \nspecial skills Canada can utilize, you get more points and you compete \nwith others who apply. So they attempt in this fashion to serve the \nnational interest. A move toward more skill based immigration is what \nCanada has done, and they are very happy with it. Australia does it. \nNew Zealand does it. Other countries operate their immigration system \nin this fashion. They still provide immigration slots for refugees, as \nthey always have, and if the United States moved to this system, we \nwould still have humanitarian based immigration as well. We would not \nend those programs.\n  We were told that moving the United States to a Canadian or \nAustralian immigration system might happen in this new bill. I was very \ninterested in it because I urged my colleagues last year to have a \npoint system or a merit based system in the bill. Nothing was even \ndiscussed about it last year and there was no hint of it in the bill \nthat was offered then. So when I was told it was being considered this \nyear, that presented some hope.\n  Unfortunately, the merit-based system that actually made it into the \nbill does not commence in any effective way at the passage of the bill, \ninstead it will not increase the percentage of immigrants who come to \nAmerica based on skills until 9 years after passage of the bill.\n  In 2006, employment-based or skill-based immigration made up 22 \npercent of our immigrant flow. In 2006, we only had 12 percent. So, \nrecently, skill based immigration has made up 12 percent to 22 percent \nof annual immigration. As I stated before, Canada has 60 percent and \nAustralia has 62 percent skill based immigration.\n  Under the Senate bill, skill-based or merit-based immigration will \nmake up about 18 percent of the total immigration levels for the first \n5 years. That is not even as high as we had in 2005. Then, for the \nyears 6 through 8 after the bill passes, merit immigration will drop to \n11 percent of the total annual immigration level, lower than the 12 \npercent we had in 2006. Even when the\n\n[[Page S8283]]\n\npercentage finally increases after the ninth or tenth year, it only \nrises to as high as 36 percent based on skilled immigration, which is a \nlittle more than half of what the Canadian system now has.\n  I don't think that is a strong enough move, and it is a strong \ndisappointment to me that this is the case.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Wyoming, the ranking member of \nthe HELP Committee, is here. I will not go on at greater length. I \ncould do so because what I am pointing out to my colleagues today is \nfundamental flaws in this legislation. It is those fundamental flaws \nthat one or two amendments are not going to fix.\n  The difficulty we have with amendments is the bill's sponsors, the \ngroup that was in the grand bargain coalition, have agreed that anyone \nwho submits an amendment that changes any substantial part of the \nagreement they reached in secret somewhere without hearings, without \ninput from the American people, will have their amendment voted down. \nThey basically have said that publically and have told that to me \npersonally. They say: Jeff, I like your amendment, I think it addresses \na valid criticism. But, we met and we reached this compromise, and I am \ngoing to have to vote against it because we made a pact and we are \ngoing to stick together to make sure we move this bill through the \nSenate without any real changes.\n  That is what they have said on the floor of the Senate. They said: \nThis violates our compromise. I am sorry, Senator, we can't vote for \nit. They ask their colleagues to vote the amendment down because it is \na killer amendment, one that will harm their deal. They claim that if \nthe amendment passes, the compromise will fail, and the whole bill will \nfall apart. Jeff, we have told you what we are going to do. Take it or \nleave it. Vote for it or vote against it.\n  That is fundamentally what has been said, and that is not right. That \nis not what this Senate is about. If they had a bill that would \nactually work, I may be irritable with the way it was produced and \nbrought to the floor procedurally, but maybe I would be able to support \nit. Instead, I can only judge how valuable the bill is based on what it \nsays and whether or not it will work. CBO says it will not work. I \nbelieve it will not work. I believe we are going to have another 1986 \nsituation where we provide amnesty without enforcement. I believe we \nare again going to send a message around the world that all you have to \ndo is get into our country illegally and one day you will be made a \ncitizen.\n  There is another concern that I have not talked about much so far, \nbut it is critical. I can show you why the Z visa and the legal status \nthat is given to illegal alien applicants 24 hours after they file an \napplication for amnesty will provide a safe haven and a secure identity \nfor people in our country who are here unlawfully and who are actually \nmembers of terrorist groups. The bill provides them, without any \nserious background check, lawful identity documents that they can then \nutilize to get bank accounts, to travel, and do potentially fulfill \ntheir dastardly goals.\n  In fact, Michael Cutler, a former investigator with the immigration \nenforcement agency wrote an article in the Washington Times today \ntitled ``Immigration bill a No Go'' discussing that very point. In \ncareful detail, he explains the utter failure of this bill to protect \nus from terrorism.\n  In addition to stating that the bill would not reduce illegality, CBO \nalso found out it is going to cost the taxpayers. You are used to \nhearing that the bill will make money for us, help us and make the \nTreasury do better, all claims that I have strongly disputed. But the \nway CBO scored the bill this year, it is going to be over $20 billion \nin costs in the next 10 years and may be closer to 30, and those costs \nto the Treasury will increase in the out years. That is because under \nthis system, we are going to legalize millions of illegal immigrants \nwho are uneducated, many illiterate even in their own countries, and \nstatics tell us that they will draw more from the Treasury than they \nwill ever pay in. I just tell you, that is what they say. And the \nnumbers get worse in the outyears, dramatically worse. In fact, the \nHeritage Foundation has said, based on the amnesty alone--and I don't \nknow if these numbers are correct but they were done by Robert Rector \nand he has been known to be very correct on many occasions--based on \nthe amnesty alone, based on the educational levels and the income \nlevels of the people who would be given amnesty, the cost to our \ncountry would amount to $2.6 trillion during the retirement periods of \nthe people who came here illegally and would be given amnesty under the \nbill.\n\n  So that is a stunning number. I can't say with absolute certainty it \nis correct, but that is what we have been told, and we should be \ntalking about it and studying it. We also know this: The net deficit \ncaused by the bill according to the CBO score will grow each year after \nthe first 10 years. They have said so themselves at last August's \nBudget Committee Hearing chaired by Senator Allard.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I hope my colleagues will study \nthis bill carefully. I hope the Senate will reject it, not approve it. \nI hope we will do a better job in the future.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for his \nsteadfast effort to inform the Senate and other people about the flaws \nof the immigration bill. It is a bill that was put together by a \ncoalition. It didn't go through committee. I have never seen a bill \nthat passed this body that didn't go through a committee. That is \nbecause people put together the bill by bringing together their own pet \nprojects and one saying to the other: I don't like your part, but if \nyou will put my part in there, I will vote for your part and we will \nstick together to the bitter end. And that is usually what happens to a \nbill like that, it is a bitter end.\n  I don't think people are paying attention to their phone calls, their \ne-mails, and other things they are getting if they stick steadfast with \nthat bill. But that is not what I am here to talk about today.\n  I am here to voice my strong opposition to the grossly misnamed \nEmployee Free Choice Act. It should be called the Union Intimidation \nAct.\n  For generations, this body has faithfully protected and continually \nexpanded the rights of working men and women. Today, however, the \nproponents of this legislation would do exactly the opposite and would \nstrip away from working men and women their most fundamental democratic \nright--the right to a secret ballot. That is right. This bill would \nstrip away the right to a secret ballot.\n  If the Democratic Party stands behind that principle, they should \nhave to change their name. You can't strip away the right to a secret \nballot from people of the United States or, hopefully, anywhere in the \nworld. For generations now we have guaranteed to all workers in our \ncountry the right to choose whether they do or do not wish to be \nrepresented by a union. That is very often a critical decision for most \nemployees, one that entails significant legal and practical \nconsequence. It is a fundamental matter of individual choice and an \nessential right in the workplace.\n  Given its importance, we have secured that right through the use of \nthe most basic and essential tool of the free and democratic people--\nthe private ballot. The private ballot is the way those of us who live \nin a free society select all of those we would ask to represent us. \nEveryone in this Congress was selected by a private ballot, and \nAmerican citizens wouldn't have it any other way. That is why it is so \nastonishing to me the majority is trying to take us to this bill, this \nUnion Intimidation Act.\n  Under this bill, the rights and safeguards for a private ballot would \nno longer apply when employees decide whether they want the union to be \ntheir exclusive representative in the workplace. It is a very \ndisturbing development when this body, which has no greater purpose \nthan the preservation of our democratic rights, would choose to tell \nthe working men and women of this country that democracy will stop at \nthe factory gate.\n  To make it even more astonishing, some of the very people now pushing\n\n[[Page S8284]]\n\nthis antidemocratic agenda are on record previously recognizing both \nthe importance of the private ballot and the fallibility of just \nsigning cards with the intimidator over your shoulder. In 2001, the \nlead sponsor of this misguided legislation in the House, along with 15 \nof his then-colleagues, wrote a letter to the Mexican Government \nregarding its labor laws in which they noted:\n\n       The secret ballot election is absolutely necessary in order \n     to ensure that workers are not intimidated into voting for a \n     union they might not otherwise choose.\n\n  Now, what would prompt legislators in both Houses of Congress to \nlecture foreign governments on the necessity of private ballot union \nelections in their respective countries while simultaneously voting to \ndeprive workers in this country of the same right?\n  In 1998, two of the AFL-CIO's most prominent unions argued to the \nNational Labor Relations Board that:\n\n       The National Labor Relations Board supervised election \n     process is a solemn occasion conducted under safeguards to \n     voluntary choice. Other means of decision-making are not \n     comparable to the privacy and independence of the voting \n     booth. The secret ballot election system provides the surest \n     means of avoiding decisions which are the result of group \n     pressures and not individual decisions.\n\n  What could possibly convince us to become partners in hypocrisy by \njoining these same unions and their surrogates when they now claim that \nwe would strip workers of the right to decide the question of \nunionization in their own workplace by private ballot?\n  The view that the private ballot is the best way to determine \nemployee choice and that alternatives such as card check are fatally \nflawed is not only shared by our colleagues across the aisle and labor \nunions, it is consistent with the views of the Federal Judiciary. The \nU.S. Supreme Court, along with the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has \nuniformly, and over the course of decades, held that the private ballot \nis the best, most reliable, most democratic means of determining \nemployees' free choice in the matter of unionization, and that all \nother methods, most particularly--most particularly--card signing are \ninherently flawed and unreliable.\n  With regard to signed cards, the Supreme Court noted that:\n\n       Cards are not only unreliable because of the possibility of \n     threats surrounding their signing, but because they are \n     inherently untrustworthy since they are signed in the absence \n     of secrecy and the natural inclination of most people to \n     avoid stands which appear to be nonconformist and \n     antagonistic to friends and fellow employees.\n\n  I wonder how many people here and how many people who might be \nlistening have had somebody, a friend or somebody they are a little \nafraid of, bring them a petition to sign. How many people turned down \nthat opportunity to sign that petition? I will bet not many.\n  With respect to the importance of the private ballot, one Federal \nCourt of Appeals put it best when it observed that its preservation \nmattered simply because ``the integrity and confidentiality of secret \nvoting is at the heart of democratic society, and this includes \nindustrial democracy as well.''\n  That is what the judges say. So then what would make us reject the \nconsistent--consistent--reasoning of the Federal Judiciary compiled in \na host of rulings authored by scores of judges and accumulated over \ndecades of time?\n  Finally, we should remember the cynicism of those who seek this \nlegislation when they imperiously claim, ``We don't do elections,'' as \nif the democratic process was somehow beneath them. The source on that \nis Michael Fishman, the president of the Service Employees \nInternational Union, the largest property services local. Or when they \narbitrarily dismiss fundamental employee rights by claiming, ``There's \nno need to subject the workers to an election.'' The source on that is \nBruce Raynor, the general president of UNITE HERE. When labor leaders \nact like despots and tyrants, why would we conceivably make common \ncause with them?\n  There is no end to the fundamentally disturbing questions this \nlegislation raises. Since this legislation was introduced, a host of \nclaims have been made in an ultimately futile attempt to answer these \nquestions. We need to stop and ask ourselves: What could possibly be \nthe justification for this radical departure from our democratic \ntradition?\n  First, we have been told the current law is broken and that the \nsystem of private ballot elections is somehow rigged against labor \nunions. As proof positive of this claim, we have cited the fact that \nlabor unions currently represent only 7\\1/2\\ percent of the private \nsector workforce, where at one time they represented 30 percent of the \nworkforce.\n  At least in this instance the proponents of this legislation have \ngotten their facts and their statistics right, a notable departure from \nthe avalanche of misinformation and completely inaccurate data that has \ncharacterized their side of this debate. However, what they have gotten \nentirely wrong is the notion that the decline in union representation \nlevels has anything whatsoever to do with some infirmity in the law. \nThose who make this claim conveniently forget to mention that the law \nwhich they complain about today is identical to the law in effect when \nunions enjoyed their greatest organizing success and their highest \nlevels of private sector membership.\n  The National Labor Relations Act, the statute which governs private \nsector unionization and which this legislation would radically change, \nhas been substantially amended only twice in over 70 years--in 1947 and \nin 1959. The process of deciding the question of unionization by the \nuse of a government-supervised private ballot election among all \neligible employees has been unchanged for over six decades. This was \nthe law and this was the process when union membership levels were at \n25 or even 35 percent of the workforce. No one complained then that the \nlaw or the private ballot process was broken. No one ever claimed that \neither was so unfair or one-sided that we should change them by \nstripping away the employees' democratic rights.\n  As this chart shows, over the course of the last six decades, private \nsector union membership has declined steadily, but the law has remained \nthe same. There is no doubt that the decline has been real, but \norganized labor and the supporters of this legislation need to look \nelsewhere for the cause of that decline since there is no connection \nbetween the law that has remained the same for 60 years and the steady \ndecrease in union membership levels that have happened over that same \ntime.\n  Second, we are told even if there is no infirmity in the law, \nemployers now violate it with impunity and, therefore, unions cannot \npossibly win elections supervised by the National Labor Relations Board \nlike they used to.\n  That claim is entirely erroneous. The reality is, when unions choose \nto participate in a fair, private ballot process, they are more than \nable to secure the support of eligible employees.\n  In fact, the success rate for unions in secret ballot organizing \nelections is at historically high levels. The union win rate in initial \norganizing elections has been over 50 percent for 10 straight years. \nThat is an unprecedented run. Even more unprecedented is the fact that \nthe union win has increased each and every year for the past 10 years \nin a row. That is what this chart shows. Unions have never before \nenjoyed such a run of increasing electoral success as they have over \nthe last 10 years. In the last 2 years unions have won a record of \nnearly 62 percent of initial organizing elections. This, too, is \nhistorically unprecedented.\n  Before anyone buys the phony claim about how the election process has \nsuddenly become unfair, they need to not only realize that union \nelectoral success is at record highs, they also need to compare the \npast. For example, the unions won organizing elections over 62 percent \nof the time in the last 2 years, and averaged winning nearly 56 percent \nof the time over the last ten years. During the decade of the 1980s, \nthe average union win rate was less than 50 percent. So it is going up. \nFor example, in 1982, unions won less than 45 percent of the time. The \nsame is true for the decade of the 1970s, when unions again averaged \nlosing more often than they won.\n  Yet, despite union election win rates that were dramatically lower \nthan the record highs of the past 10 years, and despite the fact that \nfor many of those years the Democratic Party held the majority vote in \none or both Houses of Congress, no one had the audacity to even propose \nthat we should strip away from American workers the most fundamental \nguarantee of a free society--the right to a secret ballot. When\n\n[[Page S8285]]\n\nDemocrats were in charge before, they didn't even suggest that.\n  Now, the truth is, where unions choose to participate in a democratic \nprocess and make their case to the workers in an atmosphere of open \ndebate, the system is fair and they are more than capable of success. \nTheir unprecedented level of recent success plainly makes this point. \nMoreover, it does not remotely justify changing a process that has \nworked for more than 60 years. It certainly does not justify any change \nthat strips workers of their democratic rights. In light of organized \nlabor's unprecedented electoral success over the last 10 years, this \nbill is like a baseball hitter who is on a decade-long hot streak and \nbatting .620, insisting that the game is unfair and that the pitcher's \nmound has to be moved back.\n\n  The claim that the employers are violating the law with increased \nfrequency and making fair elections impossible is equally incorrect. In \nfact, the incidents of even alleged but unproven employer misconduct \nhave actually dropped steadily and dramatically over the last 10 years.\n  That is what this chart shows. The current rate of alleged employer \nunfair labor practices represents a drop of nearly 24 percent compared \nto 1990; a staggering 42 percent when compared to 1980.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ENZI. I see there is another Senator left to speak here. I have a \nlot left to say. This is a very important issue. A lot more needs to be \nsaid when we are faced with a proposal to take away away the right to a \nsecret ballot in a bill deceptively called the Free Choice Act. It \nshould correctly be called the Union Intimidation Act.\n  I will reserve the remainder of my remarks and speak again a little \nlater.

Madam President, as we debated energy and immigration \nissues in this body for the last 3 weeks, there has been palpable \nanxiety that we all see in our States, we all see in our homes, about \nour economy and about the future of the middle class--the squeeze on \nthe middle class, the declining or stagnant wages of way too many \nmiddle-class households. In 2005 the real median household income in \nAmerica actually went down 3 percent, from the year 2000. In Ohio it \nwas down almost 10 percent. The average CEO makes 411 times the wage of \nthe average worker; in 1990 the average CEO made 107 times as much. We \nknow what has happened.\n  More important, we need to look at what has happened to wages in this \ncountry in a historical sense in the last 60 years. From 1947 to 1973, \nwhen our country, after World War II, was growing, you can see how \nwages grew among different people in our economy. The bar on the left \nis the lowest 20-percent wage earners, up to the highest 20-percent \nwage earners.\n  So those are the lowest wages. The lowest incomes in our country saw \ntheir wages grow the fastest of any one of those groups.\n  From 1973 until 2000, you can see the increase. Every group still \nincreased, but growth changed sharply. The lowest 20 had the lowest \neconomic growth; the highest 20 percent had the highest. I would add, \n1973 was the year we went from a trade surplus in our country to a \ntrade deficit. In other words, before 1973, we exported more goods in \nterms of dollars, in terms of value, than we imported.\n  Since 1973, that number has gone the other way. It has gone \ndramatically the other way in the last 10 or 15 years. Now, since \nPresident Bush took office in 2000, we have seen an even greater change \nin income for all Americans. The lowest 20 percent had an annual \ndecrease, as I mentioned earlier, but so did the second quintile, the \nmiddle, the slightly upper middle, and the top 20 percent all had \nincome decline. The only group that had an income increase in this 5-\nyear period or so was the top 1 percent.\n  We have seen clearly that our economy is not working the way it \nshould for middle-class Americans. That is why there is such anxiety \namong middle-class Americans. That is why so many of us who were \nelected for the first time, including the Presiding Officer, to the \nSenate in the year 2006, we knew of that anxiety and talked about \nmiddle-class issues: about health care, education, about jobs, about \ntrade, about income.\n  Here is the real story. Since around the time of the trade deficit, \nthe trade surplus prior to 1973 turning into the trade deficit, we have \nseen wages and productivity go like this. For many years, from World \nWar II, for about 25 years, if you were a productive worker, your wages \nreflected your productivity. In other words, the more money you created \nfor your employer, the more you shared in the wealth you created.\n  That was the American way. That is how you build a middle class. You \nare more productive and you share in the wealth you create. But \nsomething happened in the early 1970s. Again, in 1973 we went from a \ntrade deficit to a trade surplus. We can see from about that time on, \nthat productivity in this country kept rising, but wages in our country \nhave been relatively flat.\n  One other thing happened, in addition to in 1973 going from a trade \nsurplus to trade deficit, that was the time with the most pronounced \ndecline in unionization. As Senator Kennedy pointed out earlier today, \nas we have seen fewer people who are organized into unions, we have \nseen more stagnation of wages, even with productive workers\n  With the decline in unionization and with the trade deficit, wages \nhave stayed relatively flat. That is why we need a very different trade \npolicy. That is why we need the Employee Free Choice Act.\n  I might point out the Employee Free Choice Act does not abolish the \nsecret election process. That would still be available. The bill simply \nenables workers to form a union through majority signup, if they prefer \nthat method. So workers under current law may use the majority signup \nprocess only if their employers say yes. We think workers should make \nthat determination, that we either want an election or we would like to \ndo the simple card check. That will, in fact, increase unionization. We \nwill also see that it will mean more mirroring of productivity in \nwages.\n  I would like to shift for a moment to some of my earlier comments \nabout how in 1973, as we went from trade surplus to trade deficit, some \nof the things that happened in our economy. We know, going back not \nquite as far as 1973, only 15 years ago, the trade deficit in this \ncountry was $38 billion the year I first ran for the House of \nRepresentatives down the hall.\n  Today, the trade deficit in our country exceeds $700 billion. It has \ngone from $38 billion to $700-plus billion. President Bush, the first, \nsaid $1 billion in trade deficit translates into 13,000 jobs--$1 \nbillion in trade deficit translates into 13,000 jobs. So do the math. \nWe now have a $700 billion-plus trade deficit. We know what kind of \nhavoc that wreaks on Steubenville, Toledo, and Portsmouth, Marion and \nMansfield and Springfield and Xenia and Zanesville and all of these \ncommunities that were industrial towns that have had such damage done \nto their communities. They have had plant closings, they have had \nlayoffs. Every time a plant closes, it means fewer firefighters, fewer \npolice officers, fewer teachers in the public schools. We know what \nthat does to our quality of life.\n  So the answer from the Bush administration, as we passed NAFTA and \nPNTR with China and CAFTA and every other trade agreement, as this \ntrade policy has clearly failed, is: Let's do more of it. Let's do more \ntrade agreements.\n\n[[Page S8286]]\n\n  So now the President is likely going to bring in front of this body a \ntrade agreement with Peru and a trade agreement with Panama. The \nPresident's U.S. Trade Representative, Susan Schwab, an honorable \nwoman, straightforward, candid when you talk to her about this, she \nsays: Yes, but now we have environmental and labor standards in these \ntrade agreements.\n  But there are a couple of problems with that. First of all, we do not \nyet. We have not seen the text of the agreements. We have not seen, in \nfact, nor are we at all certain, that the labor and environmental \nstandards will be inside the agreements; they may be side agreements. \nWe tried that once with the North American Free Trade Agreements. The \nlabor and environmental standards were outside the agreements. They \nwere in a special side agreement, and they had virtually no impact. \nWhere we had a trade surplus with Mexico when NAFTA was signed a decade \nand a half ago, now our trade deficit with Mexico is some $70 billion.\n  That same trade situation has exploded to a huge trade deficit with \nCanada also. So clearly we know in our communities how many plants have \nclosed and companies have and jobs have moved to Mexico.\n  So the second thing we know about Jordan, about the trade agreements \nwith Peru and Panama, the proposed agreements, is that the Secretary \nsays they will enforce these labor and environmental standards as they \nunveil them, again not specific, not in writing yet.\n  The lesson again from this administration is when Congress, in the \nyear 2000, passed the Jordan trade agreement, there were strong labor \nand environmental standards in that agreement. But when his U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, Mr. Zoelleck, assumed his position at USTR, Mr. \nZoelleck sent a letter soon after to the Government of Jordan saying he \nwas not going to, because of the dispute resolution, he was not going \nto enforce the labor and environmental standards.\n\n  Jordan has since pretty much become a country of sweatshops, where \nBangladeshi workers, many workers imported from Bangladesh work at \nsubstandard wages and terrible conditions in sweatshop-like atmospheres \nand use Jordan as an export platform.\n  All of that tells me our trade policy simply is not working. If we \nare going to get serious about building the middle class--we spent a \nlot of time yesterday in Senator Enzi's committee, and Senator \nKennedy's committee, we passed legislation on higher education, the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act, passed bipartisanly. \nSenator Enzi showed great leadership, as did Senator Kennedy and \nothers. We need to do better to make education affordable for the \nmiddle class.\n  We need to do better with health care and better with prescription \ndrug benefits. We need to continue to keep up with the minimum wage. We \nraised the minimum wage earlier this year. All of those things are \nimportant. But at the same time, two of the most important things that \nthis body needs to do is to pass the Employee Free Choice Act to give \nthe tens of millions of workers in this country who want to join a \nunion the opportunity to organize and bargain collectively because it \nwill mean higher wages and higher benefits. History absolutely proves \nthat.\n  The other thing we need to do is to understand we need a very \ndifferent trade policy, not more of the same, not Panama, not Peru, not \nColombia, the way these agreements are written, not South Korea, the \nway that agreement is written, but agreements that serve the middle \nclass, that lift up workers in the United States and lift up workers of \nour bilateral trading partners. Because we know that our trading \npolicies will not be judged effective until the poorest workers in the \npoorest countries in the world are not just making products for \nAmericans to use but that those workers are actually able to buy those \nproducts themselves.\n  We have seen that. Where we do trade right, we know it can work. We \nhave clearly seen a trade policy that has failed. It is important, as \nthis Congress looks at the trade agreements coming forward, Panama and \nPeru, and looks at trade promotion authority, legislation that may come \nin front of this body sometime this summer, that we keep our eye on \nlooking at what has failed in trade policy and what has worked.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8286-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8286-S8288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I am fascinated to listen to some of these \ndiscussions to find out we can change the balance of trade if we took \naway the right of employees to decide by secret ballot if they do or do \nnot wish to be represented by a union.\n  I also heard the argument, that pay and benefits would go up if we \ntook away the Democratic right to a secret ballot. Fascinating. \nFascinating. But, also, not true. You cannot take away rights from \npeople in America and expect them to be happy about what is happening \nto them.\n  Now, I did see the Senator from Ohio in some national news broadcasts \nthanking one of the major unions for putting the Democrats in power; \nand, as a result, saying that they were willing to bring up this bill \nthat would take away the right to a secret ballot. I don't think that \nis how things are supposed to work in America.\n  I began earlier and talked about several of the problems with taking \naway this right to a secret ballot under the Employee Free Choice Act--\nlegislation that I believe should properly be called the Union \nIntimidation Act because that is exactly how it is going to work.\n  Previously I was discussing this myth rampant employer misconduct; \nand noted that contrary to these claims even allegations of misconduct \nhave dropped significantly.\n  The truth is that the National Labor Relations Board scrupulously \nmonitors the behavior of all parties during the entire period of a \nunion-organizing campaign. Any misconduct by an employer that \ninterferes with the employees' free choice in the election process is \nautomatic grounds, automatic grounds, to set aside and rerun an \nelection.\n  Now such misconduct not only includes any employer unfair labor \npractice, but it also includes even less serious transgressions, such \nas an employer's inadvertent failure to provide the union with the \nnames and home addresses of all of its eligible employees in a timely \nmanner.\n  Every word that is uttered and every act that takes place during a \nunion organizing campaign is subject to National Labor Relations Board \nreview and scrutiny. If a party's words or conduct, clearly including \nthe commission of any unfair labor practice, in any way disturbs the \n``laboratory conditions'' required for an election, the NLRB is \nempowered to set aside the election and require it to be rerun.\n  However, the fact is only about 1 percent of the National Labor \nRelations Board elections are rerun each year because of the misconduct \nof either employers or unions. So you notice I am not saying this is \nall one-sided, that there are two sides to it. There are some that are \nset aside because of union misconduct.\n  Now, just like the number of unfair labor practice charges, this \nfigure, has been steadily declining as well. The secret ballot election \nand entire union election process is remarkably fair, heavily \nscrutinized and monitored and tightly regulated.\n  Where an employer acts improperly over the course of a union campaign \nand adversely affects the outcome of the election, the National Labor \nRelations Board has full authority to set aside that election and order \nit to be rerun.\n  In addition, in those instances where an employer engages in \nmisconduct that has the effect of dissipating a union's card majority, \nthe law already allows the National Labor Relations Board to certify \nthe union and require the employer to recognize and bargain with that \nunion. This has been the law for nearly 40 years. The claim that \nemployers are increasing violating the law is totally inaccurate.\n  What unions and their supporters would like--indeed, what they hope--\nto accomplish by this legislation is to characterize any expression of \nopposition to unionization as misconduct and choke it off. Fortunately, \nhowever, we do not live in a totalitarian country. We live in a country \nthat protects free speech and fosters the open debate of ideas. It is \nfor those reasons, rooted in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,\n\n[[Page S8287]]\n\nthat current law does permit employers and employees that oppose \nunionization certain limited free speech rights. Even these, however, \nare strictly limited and closely monitored. The supporters of this \nbill, however, would seek to strip away even these limited democratic \nrights and to kill off any opportunity for free speech and open debate \nin the workplace. We cannot oppose totalitarian behavior abroad while \nsanctioning it in America's factories.\n  Thirdly, we are told that even if the law is not broken, even if fair \nelections are the norm, and even if employers do not violate the law as \nerroneously claimed, that union membership levels have been steadily \ndeclining and therefore the law must be changed. That is why they are \ntrying to offer this early Christmas gift to union bosses. This is the \nonly argument which proponents of this legislation have made that is at \nleast based on fact. However, its fundamental premise is shockingly and \nradically wrong and represents a complete reversal of Federal labor \npolicy.\n  It has never been and it should never be the role of the Federal \nGovernment to maintain or increase the level of unionization. That is a \nmatter of free choice for individual employees, not a matter of \nGovernment mandate. The role of the Federal Government in private \nsector labor-management relations has wisely and for generations been \none of neutrality. Our appropriate role has not been to guarantee \nunionization; it has been to guarantee free choice by employees. Our \nappropriate concern must always be the process, not the outcome.\n  When it comes to guaranteeing free choice and providing fair \ndecisional processes, the history of government and society tell us \nunmistakably that the best means to achieve that end is through the use \nof a private, secret ballot. The proponents of this bill are not \nconcerned about employee free choice at all. They are concerned solely \nwith giving organized labor a way to stop their decades-long membership \ndecline, the loss of membership dues money, and the loss of the \npolitical leverage such money buys.\n  This legislation is a transparent payback to organized labor--maybe \nnot too transparent. I have been watching television, and that is \nexactly what has been said to the union leaders who came to DC. \nCatering to special interests is a disturbing enough phenomenon in \nWashington, but when the cost of such catering is the loss of \nemployees' fundamental democratic right, the practice is just shameful.\n  I want to be sure all my colleagues know that the consequences of \nthis bill's enactment would be far greater than merely increasing union \nmembership. The bill the majority is asking us to consider today does \nmore than take away Americans' right to vote on whether they want to \njoin a union; it also upends the enforcement balance of the National \nLabor Relations Act and can destroy the ability of employers to control \ntheir workplace. In some cases, it also eliminates the ability of \nunionized employees to have a vote on accepting an employment contract.\n  The balance struck by the National Labor Relations Act drafters so \nmany decades ago included a remedial system that is intended to make \nwhole or repair any damage done by violations of the act. Instead, this \nbill will inject a tort-like system into workplace relations, and we \nall know how well the tort system works. Instead of encouraging speedy \nresolution of disputes before the National Labor Relations Board, this \nbill will drag them into the Federal court. The result will be a \nFederal court system even more clogged with litigation and delayed \nresolution of workplace disputes.\n  The bill also applies a stronger set of penalties, but only against \nemployers. Even though unions face an annual average of almost 6,000 \nclaims of harassment, intimidation, and coercion, it should come as no \nsurprise that the bill's drafters see unfair labor practices as a one-\nsided affair.\n  The last part of the bill I would like to discuss is perhaps the part \nwhich worries me the most, and that is the imposition of mandatory \nbinding interest arbitration. When employees decide to unionize, the \nfirst order of business is to negotiate a collective bargaining \nagreement with the employer. This agreement can cover every aspect of \nthe workplace, including pay, hours, time off, working conditions, \nhealth and retirement benefits. Typically, a committee of union leaders \nnegotiates with the employer, and once an agreement is reached, all of \nthe unionized employees have the right to ratify the agreement. If they \nreject it, the union and employer go back to the negotiating table. \nUnder this bill, these negotiations will be halted after a mere 90 days \nand a Government arbitrator will be called in to impose a contract on \nall parties. The workers would lose their right to ratify that \nagreement, the employer would have to comply with the terms of the \ncontract even if it crippled the business plan, and the contract would \nbe binding for 2 years.\n  This is a radical departure from the tradition of private sector \ncollective bargaining in which parties to the contract, not some third \nparty, make the terms of their own labor agreement. If this becomes the \nlaw of the land, we can expect the parties in labor negotiations to \ntake radical positions to set themselves up for arbitration. This is \nbecause usually, the arbitration decision comes down in the middle of \nhowever far the parties are separated. So you have both parties taking \nradical stands, delaying until there is an arbitrator, and nobody \nhaving a part in the final say except the arbitrator. Again, while the \ncurrent system encourages cooperation, this bill imposes conflict.\n\n  There is another side effect of this provision. Because a 2-year \ncontract would be imposed on the parties, employees would lose the \nright to decertify or vote out the union for a period of at least 2 \nyears. This would be the case even when they did not approve of the \ncontract or where they originally signed union cards not knowing what \nthey meant or even under pressure. I have no way of knowing whether \nthis consequence was intended by the bill's drafters, but I can \ncertainly guess.\n  Another little hidden gift to organized labor in this bill is that \nunder this legislation, there would be no private ballot vote when a \nunion was attempting to get into the workplace; however, a private \nballot vote would be required to let the employees get out of the \nunion. Seems like you ought to be able to just get 51 percent to sign \nthe card, and it could be done the other way too. But no. That alone \nshould make it clear that the only intended beneficiary of this bill is \norganized labor bosses and that its proponents could care less about a \nworker's democratic rights.\n  To put it simply, this bill is an attempt to rig the system, deny \nemployers any opportunity to present their views on unionization, and \nprevent employees who may oppose unionization from speaking to \ncoworkers. It would impose a union on employees based on unverifiable \nevidence of a majority, severely limit employees' ability to get out of \na union once they are in, and stack the penalties against the employer. \nThis may be the perfect recipe to end labor's decades-long losing \nstreak, but the only winners will be union bosses and their political \nallies. Not American workers.\n  I have listened to the speeches over the last couple of days as this \nbill has been promoted as something essential. Again, I am fascinated \nthat the Democratic Party wants to take away the democratic principle \nof the secret ballot. One mythical reason they mentioned is that a \nprivate ballot election supposedly stalls the process. The fact is, \naccording to 2006 NLRB statistics, once a certification petition is \nfiled, there is a median of 39 days to an election, and 94.2 percent of \nall elections are conducted within 56 days.\n  Another myth out there is that the private ballot election silences \nprounion workers. Here are the facts: All employees have a guaranteed \nright to discuss their support of unionization and to persuade \ncoworkers to do likewise while at work. The only restriction is the \nreasonable one that they not neglect their own work or interfere with \nthe work of others when doing so. Employees have the unlimited right to \ncampaign in favor of unionization away from the workplace. For example, \nthey, along with union organizers, can visit employees at their homes. \nIn fact, the law requires that employers provide unions with a list of \nemployee names and home addresses for just such a purpose.\n  Employee speech is virtually unregulated. In an effort to gain \nsupport for unionization of employees and unions, for that matter, they \ncan promise, can\n\n[[Page S8288]]\n\npressure, can provide financial incentives such as waiving union fees, \nand can spread false claims, distortions, and misrepresentations, all \nwith no consequence. By contrast, the employer speech is strictly \nlimited, closely monitored, and regulated. Employers cannot lawfully \nvisit employees at their homes. Employers can't even invite an employee \ninto certain areas of the workplace to talk about unionization. \nEmployers cannot promise and cannot make any statement that could be \nconstrued as threatening, intimidating, or coercive. Such behavior is \nstrictly unlawful for the employer.\n  The other side says the Employee Free Choice Act, which I call the \nUnion Intimidation Act, allows workers to have an election if they want \none. We just heard that argument. The fact is, we have a body around \nhere--a couple hundred researchers at the Library of Congress--that \ndoes research in a nonpartisan manner. They look at the facts and pass \nthem on to us. They were asked about employees being able to have an \nelection if they want one under this bill. The Congressional Research \nService disagrees with their supposition. They read the bill's words \nthat say ``the board shall not direct an election'' the way most \nreasonable people would read them. In a memo to me which was entered \ninto the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing \nrecord, CRS wrote:\n\n       An election would be unavailable once the board concludes \n     that a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit has \n     signed valid authorizations designating an individual or \n     labor organization as its bargaining representative.\n\n  The Democrats' own witness at the HELP Committee hearing in March \nadmits that it is not true that any one employee who prefers to vote by \nsecret ballot election can secure such an election. That is their own \nwitness saying: Not true. It was Professor Estlund who said that in \nresponse to a question for the record.\n  Essentially, private ballot elections will only take place under H.R. \n800 if the union chooses to have one by submitting authorization cards \nfrom less than 50 percent of the workers. As a practical matter, that \nwill never happen. If union organizers cannot get enough cards in a \npublic, coercive, intimidating signing campaign, they just don't bother \nwith an election.\n  Another myth: The Employee Free Choice Act, which I call the Union \nIntimidation Act, would increase health care and pension benefits. We \nheard that a few minutes ago. Wishing or asking doesn't make it so. \nHealth insurance, like higher wages and benefits, cost money. Unions \ndon't have to contribute a single penny toward those costs. In fact, \nsince unionized operations are less efficient, they make paying for \nthose things more difficult. They don't take into consideration the \nbusiness plan and how to continue the business.\n  Comparing union wages versus nonunion wages nationwide is also \ninherently misleading since union workers are concentrated in \ngeographic areas and industries where the wages and benefits of all \nworkers are generally higher.\n  Another myth: Workers seeking to form unions are routinely fired; one \nin five is fired; one in five is fired every 20 minutes.\n  OK. Let's look at the facts on that. To begin with, under current \nlaw, it is illegal to terminate or discriminate in any way against an \nemployee for their union activities. If this occurs during an \norganizing campaign, the National Labor Relations Board not only \nremedies the violation, it is also empowered to set aside and rerun the \nelection since the necessary ``laboratory conditions'' for a valid NLRB \nelection have not been met. However, that occurs in less than 1 percent \nof all elections, and that number has been steadily decreasing.\n  That is not the end of the NLRB's authority under current law. If the \nNational Labor Relations Board finds a fair election is not possible, \nthey can certify the union regardless of the vote and order the \nemployer to bargain.\n  Yesterday, we heard this same myth repeated, and it is based on three \nphony analyses by stridently prounion researchers, who often make a \nseries of wholly unfounded assumptions and routinely misuse statistical \ndata.\n  The first analysis arrives at its conclusions by taking the number of \nNational Labor Relations Board reinstatements offered each year, \nassuming that half occur in the context of an organizing campaign, and \nthen dividing that number into some completely mythical and arbitrary \nnumber of ``union supporters''. Now, even if the first assumption was \nright, it is the number of supporters that matters. The lower the \nnumber, the more dramatic it looks. This number, however, is completely \nmade up. There is no factual basis for determining this number.\n  Here are the facts. In 2004, for example, nearly 150,000 employees \nwere eligible voters in National Labor Relations Board elections. Using \ntheir assumptions, there were only about 1,000 reinstatement offers \nthat year. That is not 1 in 5; that is 1 in 150. Even that is likely \nvery high since the vast majority of these offers are settlements which \ndo not account for the fact that many of these terminations may have \nbeen perfectly lawful. Moreover, since unions won over 61 percent of \nthese elections, their supporters amounted to at least 90,000.\n  Now, the second ``analysis'' uses the National Labor Relations \nBoard's backpay figures as the basis for this claim. Here is the \nproblem. The vast majority of those backpay claims do not arise in the \ncontext of an organizing campaign. They do not involve union employee \nterminations. And they do not single out union supporters. Most involve \nbargaining violations with already-established unions. In 2000, for \nexample, two-thirds of the backpay number involved a single case that \nhad absolutely nothing to do with an organizing campaign.\n  The third study consisted of stridently prounion researchers calling \nunion organizers about campaigns they conducted over a short period of \ntime in an isolated geographic area. The ``statistics'' relied on were \nnothing more than untested anecdotes.\n  So as this discussion continues, we are not going to allow incorrect \nand distorted numbers, and misused and misinterpreted data to obscure \nwhat is really at issue here. This is about taking away the right for \npeople to have a secret ballot. Again, I want to reiterate that while \nthis bill may be grossly misnamed as the Employee Free Choice Act, it \nhas absolutely nothing to do with preserving free choice. In fact, it's \njust the opposite. How would you like to have someone come into your \nhouse with two or three people--one of them being very big--and \npressuring you to sign a union card? Would you feel a little \nintimidated? Most people certainly would. Would you sign because you \nfelt pressured, because you just wanted to have people stop bothering \nyou, or because you didn't want to offend a co-worker or friend? Most \npeople would. However, under this bill all a union would have to do is \nobtain 51 percent this way and it is automatic.\n  Once the total reaches 50 percent, there is no latitude. These claims \nthat employees could still have an election under this bill are simply \nnot true. Oh, yes, there is this extraordinarily deceptive claim that a \nunion could stop at 49 percent and ask for an election. That is simply \nnonsense. Why would a union ever do that. More importantly, how could \nemployees make the union stop under 50 percent. They can't. And the \nunions certainly won't stop--with one percent more they have guaranteed \nmembers, and guaranteed dues. Do you really think they'd risk that in a \nsecret ballot where someone who signed under pressure would have the \nright to change their mind and vote their real beliefs? Why would a \nunion ever do that? Guaranteed union members and guaranteed dues. Do \nyou really think union organizers would actually risk that by giving \nemployees a truly free choice? I do not think so.\n  It is a fundamental democratic principle to have a secret ballot. The \nproponents of this legislation would do exactly the opposite and strip \naway from working men and women this most fundamental democratic right. \nThe proponents of this bill ought to change the name of their party if \nthey continue to advocate this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last night the Senate worked late to \nproduce an energy bill. I believe it is a good bill. It does not \ncontain all I had\n\n[[Page S8289]]\n\nhoped it would. Obviously, I regret that we were not able to go ahead \nwith a vote on a renewable energy or electricity standard and also that \nwe were not able to invoke cloture on the tax title of the bill. \nNonetheless, I do think the bill will make important contributions to \nour energy security. I am proud to have worked on it with my \ncolleagues.\n  Much has been said about the bill, and I am not going to debate the \nissues involved again today. We spent 9 days debating the bill and \nfilled many pages of the Congressional Record with that debate. But I \nwould like to thank the many members of the Senate staff who have \ninvested such long hours and enormous effort over the last couple of \nmonths to make this bill possible.\n  In the hurry to get the vote accomplished last night, it was not \npossible to express appreciation to these staff members whose \nassistance was absolutely invaluable.\n  First and foremost, I thank Bob Simon, the staff director of our \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources. His knowledge of the issues, \nhis wise counsel, and his tireless energy were invaluable to me and to \nthe Senate, in my view.\n  I also, of course, thank Sam Fowler, our general counsel. He was \ninvolved at every step in the development and the passage of the \nlegislation. The work product we have finished with out of the Senate \nis much better for his involvement.\n  In addition, I thank Allyson Anderson, who worked on the carbon \nsequestration title and geothermal issues; Angela Becker-Dippmann, who \nkept track of the 350 or more amendments that were filed on the bill; \nPatty Beneke, who worked hard on the oil and gas leasing and public \nlands issues; Tara Billingsley, who worked on the biofuels title; \nMichael Carr, who worked on coal and transportation issues; Deborah \nEstes, who worked on the efficiency title; Leon Lowery, who labored \nmightily on the renewable energy standard or electricity standard; \nJonathan Epstein, who worked on the science issues; Scott Miller, who \nhelped on biomass and tax issues; and Cathy Koch of my personal staff \nand the staff director of the finance subcommittee on energy taxes, who \nplayed such a large role in crafting the tax amendment.\n  I also thank the rest of the professional staff of the committee, who \npitched in to help when called upon: David Brooks, Paul Augustine, \nJonathan Black, Mike Connor, David Marks, Jorge Silva-Banuelos, Al \nStayman, and Bill Wicker; our support staff: Mia Bennett, Amanda Kelly, \nRachel Pasternak, Britini Rillera, and Gina Weinstock.\n  Also, we have four excellent interns working with the committee this \nyear: Kristen Meierhoff, Ben Robinson, Jodi Sweitzer, and Matt Zedler.\n  I also express appreciation for the work of the minority staff of the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, and specifically: Frank \nMacchiarola, who is the Republican staff director; Judy Pensabene, who \nis the Republican chief counsel; Kathryn Clay and Kellie Donnelly.\n  I commend the Senate Finance staff who worked so tirelessly to craft \na tax package that would have been an invaluable complement to the \nauthorizing legislation. Senate Finance staff on both the Democratic \nand Republican sides of the aisle worked in concert to forge a \nbipartisan package and did that under the direction of Senators Baucus \nand Grassley. I acknowledge their excellent efforts. The staff includes \nPat Bousliman, Ryan Abramam, Jo-Ellen Darcy, Elizabeth Paris, Pat Heck, \nMark Prater, John Angell, Bill Dauster, and Russ Sullivan, of course, \nthe staff director.\n  I also thank Tom Barthold and the entire staff of the Joint Committee \non Taxation, who helped us greatly, particularly with the tax package \nthat was offered as an add-on to this bill.\n  Finally, I express my gratitude to the majority leader's staff. I \nhave expressed my gratitude to the majority leader many times for his \nleadership in getting this bill to the floor and getting it passed \nthrough the Senate, but let me also thank the majority leader's staff \nand very able floor staff: Marty Paone, of course, the secretary for \nthe majority; Lula Davis, the assistant secretary; Chris Miller, the \nmajority leader's senior policy adviser; and all the other members of \nthe staff, on both sides of the aisle, who worked very hard to see this \nhappen.\n  To each of them, I extend my heartfelt thanks.\n  Shakespeare lamented how ``oft good turns Are shuffled off with such \nuncurrent pay.'' I think if he were speaking today, he would probably \nsay: Are shuffled off with such inadequate pay as a simple thank you.\n  So uncurrent or inadequate though it may be, our thanks is owed to \nall of the many staff members on our committees and in our personal \noffices whose hard work and professional assistance have made this \nlegislative accomplishment possible. I am very grateful to each of them \nand wanted to acknowledge their contribution today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded,\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, it is my understanding that roughly 30 \nminutes remains allocated between the Senator from Utah and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business with 10-\nminute grants.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nrespond to some remarks made by the distinguished majority leader \nearlier today. The majority leader listed accomplishments he believes \nthe new majority has accomplished during the 6 months that new majority \nhas been in power. He talked about homeland security funding, the SCHIP \nprogram, appropriations, the budget, Iraq, Attorney General Gonzales, \nand the Energy bill.\n  One of the things I admire about the majority leader is that he is a \nvery good advocate. He knows how to put a good face on the facts. But I \nwish to suggest to my colleagues here that in reality, the current \nstate of affairs in the Senate is not nearly as rosy as the majority \nleader would have us believe.\n  We spent nearly 2 weeks trying to craft an energy bill that would \nrelieve some of the pressure on American consumers when they fill up \ntheir tanks or go to pay their electric bills. Unfortunately, the bill \nthat was offered will not provide a single watt of new energy or a \nsingle drop of new oil. Instead, we saw amendments that would have \nimproved the bill in this area defeated time and time again. Moreover, \nit will actually raise prices for consumers.\n  This bill, in fact, that was passed last night is bad energy policy \nbecause it will raise energy prices for consumers. It will enact, if \nfinally signed into law, price controls, returning us to the failed \nenergy policies of the 1970s and the 1980s, which produced shortages, \ngas lines, and other severe economic dislocation. This energy bill \npassed by the Senate last night will increase costs for American energy \ncompanies. It will force them to do more of their investment outside of \nthe continental United States, and it will increase--not decrease but \nincrease--our dependence on foreign sources of oil and gas, primarily \nfrom dangerous parts of the world and enemies of our country. It will \nenact unattainable Federal mandates. It will reduce the Nation's \nability to compete in the global market against much larger state-owned \nenergy companies for reserves around the globe. Finally, it will \ncontinue the prohibition on expanding the domestic production of oil \nand natural gas.\n  Instead of trying to work through these problems in a bipartisan way \nto try to actually bring results and solutions that make sense, the \nmajority leader chose instead to file cloture on the bill, which means, \nof course, to close off debate and to force a vote so we could speed \nthrough it without resolving the predicament Americans will continue to \nfind themselves in, with high prices at the pump and when they pay \ntheir utility bills each month. Last night, I am sorry to report, this \nbody approved this ineffective--and perhaps even harmful--legislation.\n\n[[Page S8290]]\n\n  Why, I might ask, were we so quick to pass this bill before we could \nturn it into something that might actually help the American consumer? \nWell, as it turns out, the reason we were in such a big hurry to close \noff debate and to stop our work before we could actually provide some \nrelief to the American consumer when they pay their utility bills or \nwhen they fill up their gas tanks is because we have to turn to a bill \nthat big labor regards as their single most important legislative \nagenda, and that is to eliminate the right of prospective union members \nto the secret ballot. That is right. The bill we are moving to next \nbecause we didn't have enough time to finish the energy bill to \nactually provide some meaningful relief for American consumers is \ndesigned to help labor unions intimidate workers into the decision of \nwhether to unionize.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle are demanding that the \nU.S. Government strip workers of the right to a secret ballot when it \ncomes to the decision of whether to join a labor union. As a matter of \nfact, they have deceptively named this bill the ``Employee Free Choice \nAct.'' This is anything but a matter of employee free choice because it \nwould deny workers the freedom of choice, exposing them to intimidation \nand manipulation that comes from anything other than a secret ballot. \nThis bill ought to be called the ``Employee NO Choice Act.'' It \nprovides opportunities to bully workers into joining labor unions, \nstripping them of the valuable right to a secret ballot.\n  Why in the world would we move from one of the most pressing problems \nconfronting our country today--literally a national security problem \nrelating to our dependence on foreign oil--and failing to address the \nmost pressing concerns that most Americans feel each day because of \nhigh gas prices and high electricity prices? Well, apparently, the \nanswer is to turn to a partisan matter such as avoiding the secret \nballot for union members.\n  Some of those who have given support to those across the aisle have \nattempted to provide the rationale. One explanation given last fall was \nthat ``the Democrats are beholden to labor and must pass the Employee \nFree Choice Act.''\n  Unfortunately, this has the simple feel of political payback for \nefforts made by labor to provide Democrats control of Congress last \nNovember. I cannot see any other logical explanation for the timing and \ninterruption of one of the most important pieces of legislation \nCongress will consider this year. In fact, just last week, the majority \nleader's spokesman explained that ``we need to make clear to the \nAmerican people that we are following through on the promises we made \nin November.''\n  Madam President, I am not alone in my hesitation about this bill \nstripping American workers of a fundamental right. Just a few short \nyears ago, Democratic Members of Congress, including the author of the \nHouse version of this bill, wrote to officials in Pueblo, Mexico, to \nurge use of secret ballot in union elections. In that letter, those \nDemocrats set forth the reasons secret ballots are essential. They \nsaid:\n\n       We feel that the secret ballot is absolutely necessary in \n     order to ensure that workers are not intimidated into voting \n     for a union they might not otherwise choose. . . .\n       We feel that the increased use of the secret ballot in \n     union recognition elections will help bring real democracy to \n     the Mexican workplace.\n\n  I agree with the letter, but I disagree with this bill, which would \nstrip workers of this valuable and fundamental right. Why would our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle want to give big labor the \npower to intimidate, potentially, American workers? Why urge free \nchoice and democracy in the international workplace, while offering no \nchoice to American workers?\n  I am afraid the answer is clear. Union memberships have declined. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, union membership is down \nfrom 20 percent of the workforce in 1980 to just 12 percent now. Less \nthan 8 percent of private sector workers belong to a union today.\n  As a recent Washington Times editorial explains:\n\n       Card-check unionization has quickly become the only way big \n     labor seems to increase membership these days.\n\n  Big labor helped elect Democrats in the 110th Congress. In fact, \nunion PAC contributions to Federal candidates increased 11 percent from \n2004 and are higher than any other industry grouping.\n  The Center for Responsive Politics found recently that since 1989-\n1990, labor unions have comprised 6 of the top 10 political donors to \nFederal candidates and political parties, ranging from the AFSCME, to \nTeamsters, to the Service Employees Union.\n  This has all the earmarks of political payback, plain and simple. \nThis should not be the reason we have taken up valuable time on the \nfloor of the Senate--to deal with political payback. Now is not the \ntime to repay political favors, when the Senate has a seemingly endless \nlist of more pressing and urgent matters to solve. True free choice in \nany election only comes with the secret ballot. I think we all \nintuitively understand that. Union elections are no exception.\n  American democracy must preserve an employee's right to a secret \nballot when deciding union representation. We should not even be \nconsidering this bill, but if forced to, we should oppose it.\n  I also want to point out on this front, in case you don't believe \nthis matter is motivated by pure politics, that the majority leader \nscheduled a vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to the immigration \nbill immediately following the procedural vote on the secret ballot \nbill on Tuesday. So no matter what happens on the vote to proceed to \nthe union payback bill, we will not actually be considering that \nlegislation--even if we were to vote to go to it. How can this exercise \nbe categorized as anything other than a waste of the Senate's time?\n  I wish I could report that this is the first time our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, who control the Senate calendar, have held \nvotes that waste time and divert attention from issues that are much \nmore important. As America struggles with record prices at the gas \npump, and our broken immigration system is in desperate need of reform, \nthe new leadership of this majority believes the Senate should spend \nmore time and energy on a nonbinding and purely political resolution on \nthe Attorney General. I think that is unfortunate. Unfortunately, it is \nalso indicative of the priorities we have seen.\n  Since taking control of the Congress 6 months ago, our colleagues \nhave refused to address needed reforms of entitlement programs. The \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, better known as SCHIP, that the \nmajority leader said would greatly expand and provide benefits to \nindividuals--unfortunately, we have not taken that matter up. In fact, \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle have transformed this \nprogram designed to help children in need of having health insurance to \none that would cover adults and children who are part of families \nmaking double the income the program started with. Instead of children \nof modest economic means, it has been expanded now as a new Government \nentitlement, leading the way more and more to a single-payer, \nGovernment-run system out of Washington, DC.\n  The majority leader also pointed out successes relating to the \nbudget, while highlighting that the 109th Congress didn't even pass a \nbudget. What the majority leader didn't say is, this budget \ncontemplates the single largest tax increase in American history.\n  If the majority leader believes passing a tax-and-spend budget that \nincludes the largest tax increase in history, does nothing to control \nentitlement spending, and explodes the debt is an accomplishment, well, \nit may be an accomplishment for tax-and-spenders, but it certainly was \nnot an accomplishment for the American people. This budget was not an \naccomplishment for middle-class families and American entrepreneurs who \nwill get socked with the highest tax increase in our Nation's history.\n\n  This budget was not an accomplishment for our children and \ngrandchildren, who will have to deal with the consequences of this \nbody's refusal to reform entitlement spending--a fiscal tsunami that we \nall know is coming. If we do nothing about entitlement spending, we \nsoon will not have a dime to pay for anything else except four\n\n[[Page S8291]]\n\nthings: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and part of the interest \non the debt.\n  This budget was certainly not something to be proud of. It includes \nmore money than what the President asked for and doesn't eliminate a \nsingle wasteful Government program. It adds to our Nation's debt, and \nit raises taxes on middle-class families.\n  To date, this Congress, under the new majority, has failed to send \nany meaningful legislation to the President's desk for signature. \nInstead, the majority leader pulled the immigration bill from the \nfloor, delayed consideration of an energy bill, ultimately passing a \nbill that will fix none of the current problems, and pursued political \nresolutions aimed at weakening the President, at the expense of \nstrengthening our Nation.\n  Only one of the ``six for '06'' initiatives that our Democrat \ncolleagues heralded when they got elected to the majority have become \nlaw, due in part to their lack of bipartisanship and cooperation.\n  Their agenda so far has included passing a budget with the largest \ntax increase in American history; increasing spending on wasteful \nprograms; they have sought to micromanage the war rather than to give \nour commanders and soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines on the ground \nthe opportunity to actually succeed; they forced our troops to shoulder \npork barrel projects and made them wait 117 days to get a bill to the \nPresident that he would sign--an emergency spending bill that would get \nnecessary relief to our troops in a time of war; they sought to raise \nthe minimum wage without protections for small businesses; they have \nhampered the 9/11 Commission recommendations with paybacks to unions; \nthey forced taxpayers to fund embryonic stem cell research under \ncircumstances that many Americans would find crosses a moral line, by \ntaking life in order to conduct scientific research; they have \nundermined a successful Medicare prescription drug plan in favor of a \nGovernment-run health care plan, and opposed market-based solutions.\n  My friends across the aisle have had a rough go of it during their \nfirst 6 months in the majority. They would have you believe, and the \nmajority leader would have you believe, from his comments earlier \ntoday, that they have not been able to accomplish anything because of \ntheir narrow majority here.\n  In truth, however, the blame lies with the incredibly partisan way in \nwhich the majority has conducted themselves. They have refused to \ncooperate with this side of the aisle to accomplish many good things \nfor the American people, instead filing a record number of cloture \nmotions and bringing this body to a halt--40 times so far this \nCongress, compared with 13 during the same period of time in the 109th \nCongress, 9 in the 108th, and only 2 in the 107th Congress.\n  I am here to urge our colleagues in the majority to discard the \napproach they have attempted so far, which is to ram legislation \nthrough a closely divided body without compromise. This has not worked \nfor them so far, and it will not work for them in the future. Even more \nimportant, it will not work to solve the problems of the American \npeople.\n  In order to do the job the American people sent us here to do, we \nhave to work together. As my Democrat colleagues have pointed out many \ntimes in the past, we are not the House. We must continue to look at \nall issues that are vital to the American people. We must compromise on \nthose issues in good faith to do our very best, and we must put an end \nto the time we are wasting on such divisive, partisan issues, such as \nfrivolous votes of no confidence against the current administration and \npayback to big labor for November favors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman).

Mr. President, I rise in fierce opposition to the horribly \nmisnamed Employee Free Choice Act.\n  When I first came to the Senate, I thought the 1977-1978 labor law \nreform bill we turned back was bad public policy. The bill we are \nconsidering moving to the floor, H.R. 800, is far worse.\n  Where is the free choice for employees in this horribly misnamed \nEmployee Free Choice Act? In all my years in the Senate, I have to say \nthat the title of this bill is the most misleading of any I can recall. \nThis bill doesn't give rights to employees; it takes away the rights of \nemployees and replaces them with the rights of union bosses.\n  Back in 1977 and 1978, when we fought the labor law reform bill, \nthere were 62 Democrats in the Senate and only 38 Republicans. But we \nwere able to defeat that bill by one vote. Thank goodness we did \nbecause this would be a far different country today.\n  This bill would more aptly be named the Union Bosses Free Ride Act \nbecause it would allow union organizers to skip the efforts of having \nto convince employees to vote for union representation in secret ballot \nelections to gain certification as the exclusive bargaining \nrepresentative. Then it would allow union negotiators to skip the \nefforts of bargaining for a first contract. Instead, unions need only \nmake a pretense of collective bargaining for an initial union contract \nbefore turning to the Federal Government, which can for 2 years impose \nthe wages, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment \nbinding on employees, without employees' ratification or approval--\nbinding on the employer as well, without the employer's ratification or \napproval.\n  Is this what my colleagues want to support--eliminating secret ballot \nelections and mandating Government certification of a union based on \nunion-solicited authorization cards? Is this what my colleagues want to \nsupport--the Federal Government writing the binding contract terms for \nprivate sector wages, benefits, and other terms and conditions of \nemployment? That is what this bill does.\n  Apparently, it is not what the American public want us to support. \nAccording to a January 2007 poll by McLaughlin and Associates, 79 \npercent of the public opposes this bill, including 80 percent of union \nhouseholds, 80 percent of Republicans, and 78 percent of Democrats.\n  When asked: ``Would you be more or less likely to vote for a Member \nof Congress who supported this bill?'' the response was 70 percent less \nlikely.\n  Recent polls also suggest that 87 percent of voters, almost 9 out of \n10, agree that every worker should continue to have the right to a \nfederally supervised, private-ballot election when deciding whether to \norganize a union. The same survey found that 79 percent, that is 4 out \nof 5 voters, oppose efforts replace the current private-ballot system \nwith one that would simply require a majority of workers to sign a card \nto authorize organizing a union. There was virtually no variation in \nreply among Republicans, Democrats, or Independents in this survey; \nthis sentiment rings true across the board.\n  Likewise, in a 2004 Zogby International survey of union workers, it \nwas found that the majority of union members agree that the fairest way \nto decide on a union is for the government to hold a private-ballot \nelection and keep the workers' decisions private. In the same survey, \n71 percent of union members agreed that the current private-ballot \nprocess is fair. The survey also found that 84 percent of union workers \nstated that workers should have the right to vote on whether or not \nthey wish to belong to a union.\n  It is hard to believe that we are seriously considering a bill to \ndeny workers a secret ballot vote so soon after the national elections, \nand our own elections, given our Nation's history in promoting secret \nballot elections for the disenfranchised members of society through the \nsuffragette and civil rights movements. This is especially true \nsince we are fighting for the opportunity of individuals around the \nworld to have the democratic right to a secret ballot election.\n\n  Apparently, even congressional cosponsors of the bill acknowledge \nthat it would be bad policy to take away secret ballot union \nrepresentation elections, at least for workers in Mexico. In a 2001 \nletter to Mexican Government\n\n[[Page S8292]]\n\nofficials, the House sponsor of H.R. 800, 16 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives including one then-member who now serves in this body, \nwrote:\n\n       We understand that the private ballot is allowed for, but \n     not required by Mexican labor law. However, we feel that the \n     private ballot is absolutely necessary in order to ensure \n     workers are not intimidated into voting for a union they may \n     not otherwise choose.\n\n  If private ballot elections are absolutely necessary for workers in \nMexico, why aren't they necessary here? That is what you have to ask.\n  The answer is simple. Union bosses are more successful under card \ncheck. Recently, according to official NLRB statistics, unions have won \nover 60 percent of NLRB-supervised secret ballot union representation \nelections. In other words, they are winning the vast majority of \nelections on secret ballot. They want to win all of them, and that is \nwhy they support this card-check approach. At least by political \nelection standards, that 60 percent is a high mark. But not for union \nbosses. Statistics show that under a card check, unions win \napproximately 80 percent of the time, and an even higher percentage \nwhen the employer remains neutral and does not communicate with \nworkers, as employers are permitted to do under the section 8(c) free \nspeech provision of the National Labor Relations Act.\n  In effect, forced employer neutrality would be the result of card \ncheck under H.R. 800, since union organizers would control the timing \nof the election by quietly securing a majority of signatures--50 \npercent plus 1--among a group of employees, large or small, determined \nby the union organizer, and then springing the demand for certification \nupon the employer and the NLRB. The result would, in effect, silence \nthe employer and thus deny employees the right to be fully informed \nabout the particular union seeking their support.\n\n  Under this bill, the role of the NLRB, which has such a proud history \nof conducting secret ballot union representation elections, would be \nreduced to that of handwriting analysts checking to make sure that \nemployees' signatures were not forged, and determining whether the \ngroup of employees designated by the union constitutes an appropriate \nunit. Remember, under NLRB law, the unit petitioned for does not have \nto be the appropriate unit, or the most appropriate unit, but only an \nappropriate unit for bargaining where the employees share a community \nof interest. Thus, in effect, the union organizer can select a group of \nemployees that are most easily organized by means of card check, force \nNLRB certification by designating ``an'' appropriate unit, and then \nforce a government-imposed first contract, the terms of which could \nincorporate employer obligations affecting the employer's entire \noperations, such as contract provisions barring subcontracting of work.\n  In effect, H. R. 800 is push-button unionism.\n  Under this bill, to force union representation, union organizers only \nhave to get employees to sign union authorization cards, which the \nSupreme  Court has an ``inherently unreliable'' indicator of true \nemployee support due to peer pressures, intimidation and coercion.\n\n  Would the unions like the employers to have the same right, to be \nable to go privately and intimidate employees as the union organizers \nwill do and get 50 percent plus 1 to throw the union out? Not on your \nlife.\n  In fact, as one court stated with regard to card check authorization, \n``It would be difficult to imagine a more unreliable method of \nascertaining the real wishes of employees than a card check unless it \nwere an employer's request for an open show of hands. The one is no \nmore reliable than the other.'' NLRB v. Logan Packing Co., Fourth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  Some supporters of the bill have asserted that the bill does not \neliminate secret ballot elections. But if they simply read the bill, it \nprovides just the opposite. Just so we are clear, quoting from the \nbill:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, \n     whenever a petition shall have been filed by an employee or \n     group of employees or any individual or labor organization \n     acting in their behalf alleging that a majority of employees \n     in a unit appropriate for the purposes of collective \n     bargaining wish to be represented by an individual or labor \n     organization for such purposes, the board shall investigate \n     the petition. If the board finds that a majority of the \n     employees in a unit appropriate for bargaining has signed \n     valid authorizations designating the individual or labor \n     organization specified in the petition as their bargaining \n     representative and that no other individual or labor \n     organization is currently certified or recognized as the \n     exclusive representative of any of the employees in the unit, \n     the board shall not direct an election but shall certify the \n     individual or labor organization as the representative \n     described in subsection.\n\n  How can one say with a straight face that card check for union \nrepresentation is any more protective than a private ballot election \nwhere employees may be solicited, intimidated, and coerced, subtly or \nnot so subtly, to sign union authorization cards by fellow employees \nduring nonwork hours and nonwork areas at the workplace, or by outside \nunion organizers at the employees' homes or at the union hall or simply \non the street or at the plant gates.\n  How is card check more of a free choice than the long-established and \nhard-won employee protections of a private ballot election, which is \nsupervised, monitored, and shielded by Government officials of the \nNational Labor Relations Board, who are present at the voting booth to \nprevent improper electioneering and misconduct by representatives of \neither labor or management?\n  The compulsory, first contract, interest arbitration is even a \ngreater departure from sound national labor policy because it destroys \nfree collective bargaining.\n  Under this bill, to force an initial union contract, union \nnegotiators only have to make a pretense of bargaining for 90 days \nbefore calling on federal mediation for 30 days. If not resolved, the \ncontract then must go to a federally appointed arbitrator who will \nwrite the employment terms binding on the employees and the employer \nfor 2 years. That is long enough to sour employees on the federally \nimposed terms of employment, and long enough to bankrupt an employer or \nmake it so noncompetitive that it decides to close operations and do \nbusiness elsewhere--perhaps and probably overseas.\n  How can one say with a straight face that it is an employee's free \nchoice to have the Federal Government write the terms of employment \nthrough compulsory interest arbitration by a federally appointed \narbitrator? Under this bill, the arbitrator has unfettered authority to \nimpose the wages, benefits, terms and conditions of employment of an \ninitial union contract, which is then binding on employees and their \nemployers for two years, without the employees even being able to \napprove or ratify those terms as they can under current law? How is \nthat employee free choice? How is that open collective bargaining?\n  And how is it an employee's free choice then, by operation of the \ncurrent contract bar doctrine, to prevent those employees from \nchallenging the union's continuing majority support by an NLRB \nsupervised secret ballot election?\n  This bill is not about employee free choice. It is about union \nleaders calling in their political chits in order to increase \nmembership, and being able to deny workers the protections of an NLRB-\nsupervised secret ballot election.\n  It is about union leaders then being able to get the Federal \nGovernment to impose wages, benefits, terms and conditions of \nemployment and deny workers the right to ratify or approve the first \nunion contract that will govern their employment for 2 years.\n  This is a huge and radical change in national labor policy, which the \nbill's sponsors are trying to foist on American workers and employers \nwithout even the benefit of a committee mark-up. Imagine, with only one \nday of committee hearings, completely rewriting and reversing over 70 \nyears of national labor policy by injecting the Government into private \nsector collective bargaining through compulsory arbitration. The \nFederal Government steps in, not where the parties voluntarily agree to \nsuch intervention, but by congressional mandate, by operation of law, \nwhether the parties agree or not.\n\n  That is not the way national labor policy is designed to work. This \nis not how it worked when the original Wagner Act was enacted in 1935, \nand in all subsequent amendments including the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. \nConsistent with the decisions of every NLRB in Democratic as well as \nRepublican administrations--and enforced by every federal\n\n[[Page S8293]]\n\ncourt including the Supreme Court, it has been bedrock national labor \npolicy that the Federal Government must not set the terms of the \nprivate employment contract. The role of the Federal Government through \nthe NLRB and the courts has been to establish the rules for good faith \nbargaining. And the law does not require agreement, nor does it require \na contract, so long as the parties bargain in good faith. Those sound \nnational labor policies are destroyed under H.R. 800, which ignores \nwhether the parties are bargaining in good faith and mandates a first \ncontract binding on both sides.\n  This bill does not require a finding by the NLRB or the courts that \nthe parties have failed to engage in good faith bargaining. Although \nmisguided and bad policy, at least the 1977-1978 labor law reform bill \naddressed union complaints about the difficulty of reaching agreement \non first contracts by first requiring a finding by the NLRB that the \nemployer was guilty of bad faith bargaining. Then, the so-called make \nwhole remedy proposed was to pay wages equivalent to a BLS index of \naverage hourly manufacturing wages for the period of the employer's \nrefusal to bargain. That, in my opinion, is not something Congress \nshould endorse.\n\n  But to show you how truly extreme the current bill is, under H.R. 800 \nthere is no requirement of a finding that the employer had violated the \nNational Labor Relations Act by failing to bargain in good faith on an \ninitial contract. The employer may have negotiated completely in good \nfaith, and the parties need not have even reached an impasse in \nnegotiations, to trigger the supreme sanction of having the Government \nstep in and write the contract. The only trigger is when the parties \nhave been unable to agree on a contract after 90 days of negotiations \nand 30 days of federal mediation. In effect, we are legislating that it \nis an unfair labor practice for an employer not to reach agreement on a \nfirst contract within 90 days of bargaining and 30 days of mediation, \nand that unless you agree to the union's terms the penalty is that the \nFederal Government will appoint an outside, third party to impose a \ncontract on you for 2 years. Now that is not American.\n\n  Think of the effect of all this on the Nation's small business \ncommunity. Informed of union certification because of card check, \nsuddenly dragged to the bargaining table within 10 days of the union's \ndemand, and most likely never having engaged in collective bargaining \nbefore, the small business owner will be confronted with professional \nunion negotiators insisting on wages, benefits, terms, and conditions \nperhaps beyond the small business owner's ability to accept and remain \ncompetitive. But unless the small business owner agrees, the Federal \nGovernment, through a federally appointed arbitrator, will step in and \nwrite the contract.\n  Do we want the Federal Government writing private sector contracts? I \ndon't think so. I cannot stress enough my concern about the bill's \nprovision for first contract compulsory interest arbitration, \nespecially as it would affect small business. That is even worse than \nthe card check scheme to begin with, but without the card check scheme, \nyou can't get to this.\n  It is close to socialism to mandate that the Federal Government, \nthrough federally appointed arbitrators, should dictate private sector \nwages, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment. These \nare not simply my words and my concerns. Let me quote from the Nation's \nleading basic textbook on arbitration, Elkouri & Elkouri, ``How \nArbitration Works,'' the sixth edition, 2003, which is published by the \nAmerican Bar Association's section of labor and employment law with \neditors representing labor and management.\n  The Elkouri text states:\n\n       Compulsory arbitration is the antithesis of free collective \n     bargaining.\n\n  The text then lists several reasons against compulsory arbitration.\n\n       Broadly stated, that: First, it is incompatible with free \n     collective bargaining; second, it will not produce \n     satisfactory solutions to disputes; third, it may involve \n     great enforcement problems; and fourth, it will have damaging \n     effects on economic structure.\n\n  The text continues.\n\n       Compulsory arbitration is a dictatorial and imitative \n     process rather than a democratic and creative one.\n\n  Summarizing the arguments against compulsory arbitration, the text \nconcludes:\n\n       Compulsory arbitration means governmental--politically \n     influenced--determination of wages and will inevitably lead \n     to governmental regulation of prices, production, and \n     profits; it threatens not only free collective bargaining, \n     but also the free market and enterprise system.''\n\n  Can you imagine being a small business owner, especially the owner of \na family business, confronted with the choice of capitulating to a \nskilled union negotiator's unreasonable demands after 90 days of \nbargaining? Imagine the business being, in effect, turned over to a \nFederal arbitrator to impose whatever wages, benefits, terms, and \nconditions of employment the arbitrator chose to impose, as Elkouri \nstates, ``affected by the arbitrator's own economic or social theories, \noften without the benefit or understanding of practical, competitive \neconomic forces''?\n  Is that what we want to do to our small business community, much less \nto larger businesses, whose issues for bargaining are even more \ncomplex? Since there are no limits on what an arbitrator may impose \nthrough interest arbitration, it is conceivable that the terms could \ninclude participation in an industry's underfunded multiemployer \npension plan, for example, something which could eventually force an \nemployer into insolvency.\n  Lost in what little debate we have had on this bill is the unfairness \nof its provisions for anti-employer punitive sanctions. Once again, \nthese provisions in the bill are a radical departure from the balance \nof traditional national labor policy which for over 70 years has \nconfined the act to ``make whole'' remedies, and, at least since the \n1947 Taft-Hartley Act, has tried to maintain a balance of the remedies \nfor union unfair labor practices and employer unfair labor practices.\n  H.R. 800 provides, for the first time, punitive rather than remedial \nsanctions under the National Labor Relations Act and contains only \nanti-employer sanctions. That is, H.R. 800 contains revolutionary \npunitive sanctions only against employers. Regardless of how corrupt \nthe union may be, there are no sanctions possible against the union.\n  It provides for increased damages against employers in the form of \nback pay and liquidated damages equal to two times that amount for \nanti-union discrimination from the initiation of a union organizing \ncampaign and until the first collective bargaining. These increased \ndamages are clearly punitive, not remedial and not designed to make \nwhole an employee for anti-union discrimination. Nowhere in H.R. 800 \ndoes the law provide for such punitive sanctions against union unfair \nlabor practices.\n  In addition to back pay, the bill provides civil penalties against \nemployers of $20,000 for each violation. Since each unfair labor \npractice charge filed against employers or unions often contains \nallegations of multiple violations, the $20,000 civil penalty could \nmultiply several times for a single charge. Of course, under the bill, \nthe $20,000 simple penalty applies only against employers. How fair is \nthat? Nowhere does H.R. 800 provide civil monetary damages against \nunions where they commit unfair labor practices against employees.\n  Finally, the bill provides for a mandatory injunction against \nemployers' alleged acts of anti-union discrimination, including--and I \nam reading from H.R. 800--allegations that the employer:\n\n       (1) discharged or otherwise discriminated against an \n     employee; (2) threatened to discharge or to otherwise \n     discriminate against an employee; or (3) engaged in any other \n     unfair labor practice that significantly interferes with, \n     restrains, or coerces employees in the exercise of their \n     rights guaranteed in section 7.\n\n  This is, in other words, the right to organize, bargain collectively, \nand engage in concerted activities such as strikes.\n  Supporters of the bill argue this provision mirrors the act's section \n10(I) injunction against unions which is mandatory when unions engage \nin secondary boycotts affecting neutral parties. Of course, therein \nlies the reason for the injunction. By current definition a section \n10(I) injunction applies only where a neutral third party is involved \nand the injunction is designed\n\n[[Page S8294]]\n\nto prevent harm to the public where labor disputes are expanded to \nthose employers not directly involved in such disputes.\n  That is not the type of unfair labor practice against an employee \nduring the course of a union organizing campaign, where a make-whole \nremedy of reinstatement with full back pay is available.\n  Mandatory injunctions are extraordinary penalties, especially \ninvolving small businesses, since they involve expensive Federal court \nlitigation. As such, the threat of a mandatory injunction--which, for \nexample, would mandate the employer reinstate the employee during the \ninvestigation and prosecution of the injunction--could operate to \nsilence the employer from communicating its views regarding \nunionization. This is the employer's right under section 8(c) of the \nNational Labor Relations Act.\n  There has been much said recently by supporters of H.R. 800 about \nemployer misconduct during union organizing campaigns and collective \nbargaining for a first contract. This has been used to justify the \nradical provisions of H.R. 800 denying workers of private ballot union \nelections, increasing anti-employer sanctions, as well as compelling \ninterest arbitration of first contracts.\n  Unfortunately, much of what has been said is simply untrue or \nexaggerated and based on flawed information and studies of dubious \nquality. I cite as an example one fatally flawed study conducted by \nCornell Law School Professor Kate Bronfenbrenner. It is frequently \ncited regarding the firing of union organizers in over one-quarter of \nunion organizing campaigns. The study is based on a survey of union \norganizers for their opinion as to how often organizers are fired \nduring a union organizing campaign. That hardly constitutes an \nobjective, unbiased sample, and such anecdotal opinions hardly \nconstitute the type of factual, statistical information we have the \nright to expect before radically changing over 70 years of national \nlabor policy.\n  Also, supporters of H.R. 800 claim from an NLRB report that over \n31,000 employees received back pay annually and thus presumably were \nfired during union organizing campaigns, which represent one worker \nfired every 17 minutes. That figure grossly misapplies the report and \nits basis. In fact, that number includes a very high percentage of \nworkers who were already represented by unions, some for many years, \nwho were being paid back pay because their employer took some \nunilateral action, such as contracting out work, without consulting \ntheir union. Therefore, a high percentage of such back pay had \nabsolutely nothing to do with union organizing campaigns, and \nsupporters of H.R. 800, who must know better, are simply using this \nstatistic to exaggerate their claims. Also, supporters of H.R. 800 \nignore the more accurate number that according to the NLRB's most \nrecent annual statistics only 2,000 employees were ordered reinstated \nby the Board.\n  As we debate over whether or not to deny private ballots to workers \ndeciding whether or not to unionize, it is my hope that we will be able \nto at least hold fast and true to the facts. And there should be full \ndebate on these facts, not simply a cursory one-day hearing, bypassed \nmarkup and we move straight to the floor. We must not rely on slogans, \nanecdotal stories, and questionable secretly-commissioned and selective \nstatistics about alleged unfair labor practices.\n  In conclusion, those on the other side of this debate have advanced--\nwith fervor--several misleading arguments about the so-called Employee \nFree Choice Act. I look forward to a debate on the facts of this \nlegislation. We should debate. Let each side be passionate. And of \ncourse we will disagree; but let us be respectful. Most importantly, \nlet's make sure that this is an honest debate.\n  As we enter this debate we should not be fooled by the misinformation \nfrom supporters of the bill:\n  They claim that employers coerce employees to vote no on \nunionization. The truth is that in less than 2 percent of cases is it \nfound that an employer has inappropriately interfered in a union \norganizing election.\n  They claim that under the current system unions are not able to win. \nThe truth is that unions won 62 percent of the National Labor Relations \nBoard elections in 2005--the last year where a complete set of \nstatistics exists.\n  They claim that the use of a card-check system is the best, most \nreliable and fair way of judging employees' true intentions of \nunionizing. The truth is that the use of a card-check system is an \ninherently unreliable indicator of an employee's true sentiments which \nlead me to a few other truths on their misleading reliability claim. \nThe truth is that the card acquisition process is unregulated, meaning \nthere is no check on potential undue influence when gathering cards; \nthe truth is that we have found that intimidation, coercion, and \npressure tactics can be--and usually are--used to obtain signatures; \nthe truth is that often, bounties and financial incentives are paid to \nunion organizers to obtain signatures on cards; the truth is that \nintentional deception and misrepresentation are often used by unions \nwhen obtaining cards; and the truth is that employees are often induced \nto sign cards by promises of higher pay, better benefits, and waivers \nof fees--of course the same employees are not made aware of the \npotential risks and costs of unionization. And finally, they claim that \nAmerican workers want to form unions using a card check system.\n\n  The truth is that according to a recent poll 79 percent of Americans \noppose the elimination of private ballots when voting in union \norganizing elections.\n  Senators should be aware this is not a free vote! The bill is not \npassed this year, or is passed but vetoed, it will put those of us who \nvoted for it on record as supporting a radical change in national labor \nlaw and labor policy. It will put us in support of a system which \ndenies workers a secret ballot election, which has been the bedrock \nunderpinning of national labor policy--the crown jewel of the National \nLabor Relations Board.\n  A vote for this bill, or for cloture, will put us on record as \nagainst free collective bargaining on first contracts and in support of \na political, government-dictated system of compulsory interest \narbitration where a federally-appointed arbitrator will dictate the \nwages, benefits, terms and conditions of employment binding on \nemployees without their even having a vote to approve those terms.\n  And it will put us on record as supporting an unbalanced system of \nremedies where employers are subject to punitive sanctions, rather than \nremedial make whole remedies while ignoring sanctions for union unfair \nlabor practices.\n  In the end, H.R. 800 will hurt workers and will take away rights they \ncurrently have under federal labor law.\n  In the end, it will hurt employers, leading some to look elsewhere to \ndo business and foreign investment to turn elsewhere rather than the \nUnited States.\n  We will be on record, and we will be reminded of our vote today in \nfuture congresses. We must vote no on cloture, just as we should vote \nno on the bill.\n  Mr. President, I hope my statement reflects why this is such a \nhorribly misnamed and bad bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8294-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8294-S8295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WELCOME TO WYOMING'S NEW SENATOR\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, minutes ago a new Senator for the State of \nWyoming was officially appointed by the Governor of Wyoming, and I want \nto welcome Dr. John Barrasso, now Senator Barrasso, and introduce him \nto the Senate.\n  John is an extremely capable person who has gone through a selection \nprocess that involved 30 people who were interested in serving as \nSenator. He went through an interview process and a selection process \nand was one of three people given to the Governor from whom to select. \nThe Governor gave each of the people a list of 42 issues of critical \ninterest to the State of Wyoming and interviewed each of them and made \na selection on that basis. Dr. John Barrasso was the selection.\n  I am very excited about this. I am excited about having a full roster \nfrom Wyoming. I have known John for many years. I was pleased that he \nran for the State Senate. He worked on a lot of conservative issues \nthere. He was a\n\n[[Page S8295]]\n\nhard worker, and he was extremely efficient. In fact, one of the \namazing things to me was that he was able to answer every e-mail almost \nimmediately and to keep his desk clean. It is different from the way I \nworked when I was in the Wyoming legislature and it is much different \nthan the way my desk looks here. So his efficiency is unmatched, and he \nhas great knowledge of Wyoming and the issues that are important in \nWyoming, which include energy, and of course health. He is an \northopedic surgeon and will make a big difference in our health care \ndebate back here.\n  He is quiet but efficient and has worked across the aisle in Wyoming, \nand I am sure he will continue to do that here, much the way Senator \nThomas and I have done. We have always worked as a team, the Wyoming \ndelegation, and he will become a very strong team member.\n  I want to congratulate the Wyoming Republican Party on the process \nthey went through. I want to particularly congratulate Fred Parady, who \nis the State chairman, for the way he walked into some fairly uncharted \nwaters, particularly for that many people who were interested. He did \nan excellent and fair job, and one that was timely so we would be able \nto get to this point. He did an outstanding job.\n  I congratulate the Governor for the care and concern he gave and the \nway he went about his job and the comments he made as he did that job \nand as he introduced the new Senator. I think Wyoming can be a good \nexample for the rest of the Nation to follow.\n  Of course, no one is going to be able to replace Craig Thomas, but \nworking with John, we can ensure the representation of Wyoming in the \nSenate will remain second to none.\n  John has had some interesting things he has worked on in Wyoming. He \nis extremely well known across the State because he has been doing \nvirtually a nightly television spot helping people to help their own \nhealth and has given tips for a number of years doing that. I have no \nidea how many years he has also been the host for the Jerry Lewis \ntelethon for Wyoming and has raised innumerable dollars for that great \ncause, and he does it so easily and so naturally and is such a great \nspeaker.\n  Of course, he is very pleased that both of his children, Pete and \nEmma, have graduated from high school. Emma graduated this year. So he \nhas gotten to watch them grow up in a very involved way through the \nyears, and now that they are going to college, he can come to \nWashington, and I know he and his family are very excited about it and \nare great participants.\n  So I welcome the newest member of the Senate and let everyone know we \nare looking forward to a great team and his extreme capability.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8295-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8295-S8297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PASSAGE OF H.R. 6\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend from Hawaii, the \nchairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, for \nsponsoring this amendment that was added to energy legislation last \nevening.\n  This energy legislation seeks to expand the Nation's supply of \nrenewable biofuels and to begin moving our base of transportation fuel \ntoward renewable energy. Across America, including in my State of North \nDakota, American farmers have the ability to grow abundant supplies of \ncorn and energy crops from which ethanol and other transportation \nbiofuels can be manufactured. However, our Nation's ability to produce \nan abundant supply of transportation biofuels will be of no use if we \nare not able to transport these biofuels to the population centers \nwhere they are needed. Today, due to the special qualities of biofuels, \nthere are no pipelines that can move them to market. Thus, \ntransportation is dependent primarily on trucks and rail, except in \nthose rare cases where water transportation is available between the \nareas where the biofuels are produced and consumed.\n  Last week, the Government Accountability Office released a report \nentitled ``Biofuels--DOE Lacks a Strategic Approach to Coordinate \nIncreasing Production with Infrastructure Development and Vehicle \nNeeds.'' The summary of the report states, in the second paragraph:\n\n       Existing Biofuel distribution infrastructure has limited \n     capacity to transport the fuels and deliver them to \n     consumers. Biofuels are transported largely by rail and the \n     ability of that industry to meet growing demand is uncertain.\n\n  If our Nation is to realize the potential of sustainable, \ndomestically produced transportation fuels, we can have no uncertainty \nconcerning whether the rail industry can transport the amount of \nbiofuels that the Nation will be producing. Therefore, Senator Inouye \nand I have joined in this amendment which calls for a joint study by \nthe Secretaries of Energy and Transportation. The study will consider \ntwo primary issues and a number of related issues. First, will there be \nsufficient railroad infrastructure to move the amount of biofuels the \nNation will be producing? Second, will that railroad transportation \noccur in a competitive environment in which the cost is reasonable and \nthe service is reliable?\n  Ensuring adequate, reliable, and cost-effective rail transportation \nfor ethanol and other transportation biofuels that will become so \nimportant to the Nation is an essential element of the Nation's policy \nto move toward sustainable, domestic supplies of energy. I thank my \nfriend from Hawaii, the chairman of the Commerce, Science and \nTransportation Committee, for joining with me to pursue this study, and \nI look forward to working with him to ensure that our national rail \nsystem is adequate, reliable, and competitive.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, yesterday the U.S. Senate passed \ncomprehensive energy legislation that will set the course for our \nnational energy security in the decades to come. The members of this \nbody were able to reach important conclusions regarding the need for \nincreased corporate average fuel economy standards, improved energy \nefficiency for buildings and appliances, a national standard to help \naccelerate the development of renewable fuels, and carbon sequestration \ntechnology to capture carbon emitted through the burning of coal. The \nEnergy bill approved by the Senate truly represents a shift toward a \ncomprehensive, responsible, and focused national energy policy.\n  Not to be forgotten in establishing this policy are America's small \nbusiness owners. There are nearly 26 million small businesses in this \ncountry--nearly 26 million business owners that are focused on keeping \ntheir doors open and putting food on the table for their families. And \nwhile climate change and national energy security sometimes seem like \ndistant threats compared to rising health care costs and staying \ncompetitive in an increasingly global economy, small business owners \nare telling us that energy costs are indeed a concern. The National \nSmall Business Association recently conducted a poll of its members, \nasking how energy prices affected their business decisions. Seventy-\nfive percent said that energy prices had at least a moderate effect on \ntheir businesses--with roughly the same number saying that reducing \nenergy costs would increase their profitability. Despite these numbers, \nonly 33 percent have invested in energy efficiency measures.\n  In March of this year, I convened a hearing in the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship to look at what small businesses can do \nto confront global warming. We learned over the course of that hearing \njust how much can be done to help small businesses become energy \nefficient. We also learned just how little the current administration \nis doing. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that small \nbusinesses consume roughly 30 percent of the commercial energy consumed \nin this country--that is roughly 2 trillion kBtu of energy per year, \nand it's costing small business concerns approximately $29 million a \nyear. Through efforts to increase energy efficiency, small businesses \ncan contribute to America's energy security, help to combat global \nwarming, and add to their bottom line all at the same time.\n  Last night, I worked with Senator Snowe to include two amendments to \nH.R. 6 that will go a long way toward helping small business owners \nbecome more energy efficient. These amendments, which together \nrepresent the provisions included in S. 1657, the\n\n[[Page S8296]]\n\nSmall Business Energy Efficiency Act of 2007, require the Small \nBusiness Administration, SBA, to implement an energy efficiency program \nthat was mandated in the 2005 Energy Policy Act. To date, the SBA has \ndragged its feet in implementing a program that could help small \nbusiness owners to become more energy efficient. Administrator Preston \nshould implement this important program today, and this bill directs \nhim to do so.\n  Second, this legislation establishes a program to increase energy \nefficiency through energy audits at Small Business Development Centers, \nSBDCs. The Pennsylvania SBDC currently operates a similar program, and \nhas successfully assisted hundreds of businesses to become more energy \nefficient. As a result of the program, six of the eight winners of the \n2006 ENERGY STAR Small Business Awards given by the EPA went to \nPennsylvania businesses. This program should be replicated so that \nsmall businesses across the country have the same opportunity to cut \nenergy costs through the efficiency measures.\n  Third, the SBA Administrator is authorized to guarantee on-bill \nfinancing agreements between businesses and utility companies, to cover \na utility company's risk in entering into such an agreement. The \nfederal government should encourage utility companies to pursue these \nagreements with businesses, where an electric utility will cover the \nup-front costs of implementing energy efficiency measures, and a \nbusiness will repay these costs through the savings realized in their \nenergy bill.\n  Fourth, the legislation creates a telecommuting pilot program through \nthe SBA. The Administrator is authorized to establish a program that \nproduces educational materials and performs outreach to small \nbusinesses on the benefits of telecommuting.\n  Finally, the legislation encourages increased innovation by providing \na priority status within the SBIR and STTR programs that ensures high \npriority be given to small business concerns participating in energy \nefficiency or renewable energy system research and development \nprojects.\n  As a nation, we have much to do to secure our future energy supply \nand to solve the international crisis that is global warming. Last \nnight's approval of H.R. 6 demonstrates this body's will to set the \nright course, and America's small business owners should know that \nCongress is providing them with the tools they need to join the \ncrusade.\n  Mr. President, last night, we successfully passed comprehensive \nenergy legislation which included a significant increase in fuel \neconomy standards. For far too long, this has been the third rail of \nenergy policy. It has been one of Washington's great failures in \nleadership. But thanks to a bipartisan effort on the part of so many of \nmy colleagues, these new requirements will cut automobile carbon \nemissions dramatically and will help put our country on a path toward \nenergy dependence. The oil savings from the CAFE provision alone will \nultimately total 1.2 million barrels per day by 2020.\n  When we first established CAFE standards for passenger cars and \ntrucks in 1975, within 10 years we increased fuel economy by 70 percent \nand decreased our oil dependence from 36 percent to 27 percent. Ever \nsince then, we have been stuck in neutral. The fuel economy of the \naverage new passenger vehicle is lower today than it was 10 years ago.\n  We now have overcome the forces of inertia, and our country is now \npoised to at last revolutionize the way we drive. I am proud of the \nbipartisan commitment to this issue, which was demonstrated with \nhistoric vote. I particularly would like to thank my colleagues, \nSenator Inouye and Senator Stevens, for their leadership on this issue.\n  I was proud to cast my vote in support of this important bipartisan \nenergy legislation, which will dramatically increase our use of \nrenewable fuels, incentivize energy efficiency, reduce our oil \ndependence, and address the growing threat of climate change. This bill \ntruly puts us on a path toward a cleaner, healthier, and more secure \nenergy future.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Energy bill \nthat passed with my support. The bill increases biofuels production \nfrom the current mandate of 7.5 billion gallons in 2012 to 36 billion \ngallons by 2022. The bill also establishes new appliance and lighting \nefficiency standards in Government buildings and includes Federal \ngrants and loan guarantees to promote research into fuel-efficient \nvehicles, including hybrids, advanced diesel and battery technologies.\n  I was pleased that this bill included my very important NOPEC \namendment, an amendment that passed with the support of 70 Senators. \nThe NOPEC amendment will hold OPEC member nations to account under U.S. \nantitrust law when they agree to limit the supply or fix the price of \noil in violation of the most basic principles of free competition. It \nwill authorize the Justice Department--and only the Justice \nDepartment--to file suit against nations or other entities that \nparticipate in a conspiracy to limit the supply, or fix the price, of \noil. In addition, it will specify that the doctrines of sovereign \nimmunity and act of state do not exempt nations that participate in oil \ncartels from basic antitrust law. Further, it will give our Government \na much needed tool to fight back against the selfish price-fixing \nconspiracy of OPEC members, a conspiracy that significantly raises the \ncost of gasoline and other essential energy products to millions \nconsumers every day.\n  I was also pleased that this bill included an amendment I offered \nthat would allow small manufacturers to access awards under the \nAdvanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive title. Considering \nthat small manufacturers that employ roughly 75 employees or less \ncontribute 29.5 percent to all value added to automobiles, it made \nsense that they should have the opportunity to get these awards.\n  I was disappointed that the Energy bill didn't include provisions to \nrequire utilities to provide 15 percent of their electric power from \nrenewable sources by 2020. The reduction in the use of fossil fuels to \ngenerate electricity would have strengthened our national energy \nsecurity by diversifying our sources of electric generation. Also, the \nbill did not include an energy tax package that would have created \nincentives for renewable power, biofuels, plug-in hybrids, clean coal \nand other technologies.\n  Taken together, this bill allows the United States to become more \nenergy efficient in a cost effective and responsible way.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss our efforts to \naddress the energy challenges that are facing our Nation today and the \nsolutions we need for tomorrow. I am pleased that the Senate last night \npassed a comprehensive energy bill that moves our Nation forward.\n  We all know how important energy is to our economy, our families, and \nour quality of life. The high cost of energy is putting a painful \nsqueeze on every sector of my home State: Commuters notice every time \nthey fill up the tank; businesses are struggling with the higher costs \nof transportation; industry is feeling the impact of higher energy \ncosts, and farmers feel the pain both in the price of fuel and \nfertilizer.\n  The question is, what are we going to do about it? It is clear there \nare no silver bullets.\n  It is going to take smart policies, carried out consistently over \nmany years, to begin to change the way we use and save energy.\n  Overall, I believe we must focus on several priorities, including: \nmaking America more self-reliant so we are less dependent on foreign \nsources of energy; using innovation to meet our energy needs in \ncreative ways; supporting conservation to reduce our energy demands; \ninvesting in education so we can cultivate the scientists, researchers, \nand workers of the new energy future; and protecting consumers from \nunscrupulous energy manipulators.\n  Before I turn to those specific priorities, I want to share with the \nSenate some of the innovative things that leaders in Washington State \nare doing to meet our energy needs.\n  Washington State is moving forward on renewable sources of energy \nlike wind energy.\n  In April, I had an opportunity to visit the Hopkins Ridge Wind Farm \nin Columbia County, WA. This is a Puget Sound energy facility that has \n83 wind turbines. When they are running at peak capacity, they can \ngenerate enough energy on an average basis to supply about 50,000 \nhomes.\n\n[[Page S8297]]\n\n  In fact, the Ports of Longview and Vancouver in southwest Washington \nhave become a gateway for bringing wind energy components into the \nUnited States. I have been able to support their work through the wind \nenergy tax credit. Last year, I got to visit the Port of Longview and \nsee how our longshoremen expertly handle these massive turbines.\n  Washington's agriculture community is stepping up and embracing \nrenewable sources of energy. This Spring, I was in Colfax, WA, for a \nroundtable discussion with farmers, and energy was a big part of the \ndiscussion.\n  I can tell you that Washington State farmers are poised to become \nactive players in the renewable energy market. We talked about ways to \nhelp them make the transition into biofuel crops.\n  And there are other innovative projects. In Gray's Harbor, we are \nmoving forward with a biodiesel plant. It will be a new home for \nWashington state biofuel production, a new source of jobs for the \npeople of Grays Harbor County, and a new way to combat high gas prices. \nAnd in the Tri-Cities, we are moving forward with a new research center \non biofuels and bioproducts.\n  In my home State of Washington, we have also been testing some \ncutting edge technology that puts information into the hands of \nconsumers so they can make informed decisions about how--and when--they \nuse energy.\n  With the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and other partners, I \nhelped kick off a GridWise demonstration project to test smart \nappliances. These appliances give consumers the power to decide when to \nrun them based on the cost of energy. For example, your thermostat \ncould indicate to you when heat costs are at a premium. Or you could \nset your dryer to run only when energy is a certain price.\n  We all know that the cost of energy fluctuates throughout the day. \nUnfortunately, today's consumers don't know the real cost of energy at \nany given time. So it is hard for them to make informed energy choices.\n  These innovative appliances were tested for a year in 150 homes, a \nwater-pumping station and a commercial building. The results are \nimpressive. Researchers found that giving consumers these tools helps \nsave energy and reduce demand on the electricity grid. They found that \nreal-time pricing can also alleviate the need to build a new \nsubstation.\n  So I am really proud of the innovative work that is already underway \nin Washington State, and both Senator Cantwell and I believe it can \nserve as a model for the progress we can make in the rest of the \ncountry.\n  Now I would like to turn to my energy priorities and some of the \npositive steps that this bill takes.\n  My first priority is to help make America more energy self-reliant. \nHere at home we have tremendous demand for energy and that demand is \ngrowing. Unfortunately, today we are still too dependent on foreign \nsources of energy, particularly oil. That dependence affects our \nsecurity and our relations with other countries. We need to reduce our \ndependence, and we can do that through some of the measures in this \nbill. This bill includes a renewable fuels standard that will increase \nour use of renewable fuels, including biofuels like cellulosic ethanol \nand biogas. It also includes tighter CAFE standards for our auto \nindustry, and it increases the number of bioresearch centers focused on \nbiofuel. This bill will also help us diversify our fuel sources by \npromoting alternative fuels, such as ethanol, biogas, and biodiesel.\n  I am disappointed that important tax incentives, which would spur the \ndevelopment of renewable electricity, increase the production of \nalternative transportation fuels, and help homeowners who make their \nproperties more energy efficient, were blocked in a procedural effort \nby the minority. I am hopeful that these important investments will be \nrestored as this legislation moves forward.\n  Second, we need to use innovation to help meet our energy needs. This \nbill will help move forward our innovation agenda by increasing \nresearch and development funding for new technologies. It authorizes \nfunding for research in States with low rates of ethanol production. \nThis investment could help Washington get off the ground in the area of \ncellulosic ethanol. This bill also boosts research in carbon capture \nand storage. We are doing some interesting work on that at PNNL in my \nhome State, and I am pleased to support further research.\n  Third, we need to be more aggressive about conserving energy. It is \neverything from choosing compact fluorescent light bulbs and energy \nefficient appliances to consolidating errands so you make fewer trips \nin your car. Through this bill, the Federal Government will lead by \nexample by using energy efficiently and employing conservation \npractices. It includes, as I mentioned, higher CAFE standards on our \nvehicles, which will help conserve gasoline. It will promote efficient \nlighting technologies, efficient vehicles and advanced batteries.\n  Fourth, we need to expand education so we have the scientists, \nresearchers, and workers to help us reach a new generation of energy \ninnovation.\n  The existing and new technologies that we will deploy to increase our \nself-reliance are complicated, and we need to make sure we have a well-\ntrained workforce that is able to implement these forward-thinking \ntechnologies. This entails both continuing education for our current \nworkforce, but also training the workers of tomorrow. We must provide \nthese training programs while our young people are still in our \neducational system.\n  In my home State of Washington, several universities are addressing \nthese needs by offering curriculums in this area. For example, Gonzaga \nUniversity in Spokane has a transmission line worker training program.\n  Central Washington University in Ellensburg wants to teach its \nstudents how to operate the efficiency technologies of the future. I \nthink we should support these efforts by ensuring funding for programs \nlike these. I am pleased that this legislation calls out this important \nissue.\n  In Washington State, we are also working to educate the next \ngeneration of energy innovators.\n  Washington State University, the Pacific Northwest National \nLaboratory, and the State of Washington have worked together to create \nthe Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Laboratory in Richland.\n  This is a pioneering research center where researchers will develop \ntechnology to turn biomass into energy and products. It will have \nteaching laboratories and classrooms and is located on WSU's Tri-Cities \ncampus.

Mr. President, every day millions of men and women \nacross America get up and go to work. Their labor--whether it is \nbuilding bridges or selling groceries, programming computers or \ncleaning homes--is what makes this country great.\n  Their work is the foundation of our economy and of our communities \nand families. Over 100 million Americans rely on their jobs to keep a \nroof over their heads and put food on the table, pay their doctor's \nbills, save for their children's college tuition, and retire in \ndignity. But all of that can be threatened in an instant when serious \ninjury or illness strikes.\n  Fourteen years ago, we passed the Family and Medical Leave Act to \nenable employees to take up to 12 weeks\n\n[[Page S8298]]\n\nof unpaid leave each year to care for themselves or a seriously ill \nfamily member. For the first time, employees could meet their \nresponsibility to their loved ones without risking their jobs. It was \nlandmark legislation--the first bill signed into law by President \nClinton in 1993--and tens of millions of families are healthier and \nmore secure because of it.\n  But for millions of Americans, the ability to meet their family \nhealth needs is still out of reach. Most American families can't afford \nto take unpaid leave because it means they will miss even one weekly \npaycheck. They need every week's income to meet the rent, pay the \nelectricity bill, and feed their families. A serious illness shouldn't \nmean choosing between caring for a sick child, spouse or parent, or \nsuffering a financial catastrophe.\n  That is why I strongly support the Family Leave Insurance Act. This \nlegislation will fill a serious gap in the Nation's health policy. It \nbuilds on the Family and Medical Leave Act by providing a safety net \nfor the average working family.\n  Under this vital legislation, employees would be eligible for up to 8 \nweeks of paid benefits while they care for their families. With such \nbenefits, workers would not be forced to choose between the families \nthey love and the paychecks they need.\n  Most important, the program targets the employers and workers who \nwill most benefit from the program. Lower income workers, who are least \nable to afford time off from their jobs, would be eligible for up to \n100 percent of their weekly income. Smaller employers would have the \noption to participate--and would receive special incentives for doing \nso.\n  This is an idea whose time has come. California has led the way with \nits paid leave program, which has been a great success. Other State \nlegislatures around the country are considering it as well.\n  The Family Leave Insurance Act is just one of the important new \npolicies we should adopt to help America's working families. We also \nneed to address the nearly half of American workers who don't receive \npaid sick days at work--and millions more who cannot take paid time off \nto care for their families.\n  That is why I will continue to fight for the Healthy Families Act, \nwhich will provide up to 7 paid sick days a year to workers, to help \nthem meet immediate and short-term health needs not covered by the \nFederal Leave Insurance Act.\n  I commend my colleagues, Senator Dodd and Senator Stevens, for their \nleadership on this issue. This legislation, together with the Healthy \nFamilies Act, removes the risk that a sudden illness in the family will \ndevastate a worker's financial well-being. Hard-working American \nfamilies deserve no less.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Family Leave Insurance Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8298-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the plague of gun violence is one that \naffects our society on many levels. Across the country people are \ncalling out for a change in our Nation's gun policies. A recent \narticle, The Battle Over Illegal Guns, in the June issue of Ladies' \nHome Journal Magazine, is a case in point. This article detailed the \ntragic death of Wake County, NC sheriff's department investigator Mark \nTucker, and provided yet another example of a pervasive problem in our \ncountry that has not yet been addressed.\n  On February 12, 2004, Mark Tucker returned home from work to eat \nlunch. As he left his house to return to work, he noticed an unfamiliar \ncar with an open trunk parked in a field near his home. He drove over \nto investigate it. As he stepped out of his unmarked patrol car, an 18-\nyear-old young man pulled a gun out of the trunk of the unfamiliar car. \nThe teenager, who was on probation for breaking into cars, stated he \nhad only intended to engage in a little target practice that day. \nHowever, because he was on probation, he was not legally allowed to \npossess a firearm. When he saw Mark's badge he panicked, killing Mark \nwith a single shot.\n  Because the teenager had a felony record, he was not legally \npermitted to purchase a gun himself. In order to circumvent this, he \nsimply had a friend fill out the required Federal paperwork for him at \nthe gun dealer. This type of transaction, when one customer stands in \nfor another who is not legally able to purchase a weapon, is known as a \nstraw purchase. According to a 2000 report by the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ATF, straw purchases are the most \ncommon source of crime guns. Approximately half of the 1,530 \ntrafficking investigations examined in the report involved stand-in \nbuyers.\n  Though Federal law enforcement officials have increasingly teamed up \nwith local officials over the past few years to increase prosecution of \nfirearm-related crimes, not enough attention is being focused on the \nsource of the problem. According to the ATF, nearly 60 percent of the \nguns used in crimes can be traced to just over 1 percent of this \nNation's licensed gun dealers. Five out of six of these guns are \nobtained illegally.\n  This article not only detailed the tragic events which occurred in \nWake County, it illustrated a problem that plagues our society. \nNegligent dealers and straw purchasers indirectly threaten the security \nof our communities by facilitating the transfer of dangerous firearms \nto potential criminals who may use them in violent crimes. We must do \nmore to help our Federal, State and local law enforcement officials \nkeep guns out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them. Simply \nput, Congress needs to take up and pass sensible gun legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8298-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8298-S8299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAN\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the international community's effort to \npress Iran to suspend its nuclear enrichment has been virtually \ngrounded as of late and there does not seem to be a way out. This \ndeadlock is of great concern to me--particularly because of the threat \nIran poses to our national security strategy but also because I do not \ntrust this administration to make the right choices when it comes to \nour safety and security.\n  As a known sponsor of international terrorism, and in light of \nPresident Ahmadinejad's belligerent statements calling for Israel to be \n``wiped off the map,'' we must redouble our efforts to ensure Iran is \nno longer allowed to violate international treaties, does not develop \nnuclear weapons, and does not become any more of a threat to our \nnational security than it already is.\n  History has taught us that we cannot ignore the stated intent of \nthose who seek to destroy other nations. A nuclear Iran would be a \ngrave threat to the region, to Israel, and to the entire international \ncommunity but that does not mean we should act rashly or act alone. \nIndeed, recent history has also shown that we are at our strongest--and \nmost secure--when we are part of a strong multilateral team.\n  And yet, the Bush administration's saber-rattling flies in the face \nof any effort to legitimately build consensus for effective dealings \nwith Iran. Our allies at the United Nations have worked with us in the \npast to support a resolution sanctioning Iran but they may not be \nwilling to work with us again if these confrontations in the Persian \nGulf become habitual occurrences. Such threats are stunningly \ncounterproductive as they embolden Iranian hardliners to dig in their \nheels, undermine our multilateral commitments, and jeopardize our \nnational security significantly.\n  Iran's ability to sniff out and exploit fissures within the \ninternational community and use it to their advantage should not be \nunderestimated. Knowing this, it is in the interest of our national \nsecurity to ensure there is strong unanimity among our allies at the \nUnited Nations. Critical to this effort is cooperation from Russia and \nChina. To ensure they are on board, this administration must prioritize \nrobust diplomacy with these two countries to ensure they are on board \nand engaged. Without them, there can be no real headway.\n  Just last month an International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, report \nsaid that Iran has not suspended its enrichment activities and we must \ntake this claim very seriously. We must work with our allies to take \nconcerted, decisive action to break this stalemate. The Security \nCouncil must speak with one voice and send a clear signal that \ncontinued defiance of the international community will not be \ntolerated.\n\n[[Page S8299]]\n\n  It is essential that all U.N. member states and the international \ncommunity, more generally, continue to condemn the violent and defiant \nrhetoric of Iran's President. If his aggressive words go unchecked it \ncould signal approval of the Iranian regime's determination to \nundermine its international obligations.\n  This Congress can also take critical steps to stop or slow Iran's \nnuclear enrichment, but we will not be effective in doing so unless we \nacknowledge that the United States must be in lock-step with the \ninternational community if we are to overcome decades of mistrust and \nongoing threats to our national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8299-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On May 12, 2007 in New York, NY, Omar Willock attacked Roberto \nDuncanson, a gay man, on the street in Crown Heights. Willock allegedly \nyelled anti-gay slurs at Duncanson when they passed each other on the \nstreet. Later, Willock encountered Duncanson again and started a fist \nfight, eventually stabbing Duncanson. Willock is being held without \nbail and is charged with a hate crime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8299-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8299-S8300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WELCOMING THE MINNESOTA NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to welcome the \nbrave and courageous members of the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 34th \nInfantry back to Minnesota today. For nearly 2 years, these troops have \nselflessly and honorably served our State and our Nation, demonstrating \na level of commitment and sacrifice beyond anything our country could \nask of them.\n  To welcome these soldiers home properly, it is important to roll the \ncalendar back to September of 2005, when these men and women learned \nthat they would soon deploy to Iraq for a 12-month mission. The news \nwas difficult for a lot of Guard troops and families in our State. Many \nof them had already been deployed on active duty to Bosnia or Kosovo \nsince September 11, and they knew how hard it would be to say goodbye \nonce more to their families, friends, and communities.\n  Because of their previous service, many of these troops were not \nrequired to go to Iraq. They had already answered the call to defend \nthis great land, and they could have let others take their turn this \ntime, but that is not the spirit of the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the \n34th Infantry. Instead, with the same commitment that their unit has \nshown since the Civil War, these troops donned their uniforms, made \ntheir arrangements, kissed their moms and dads, husbands, wives, and \nchildren goodbye, and returned to the fray to serve their country.\n  For 6 grueling months, these soldiers conducted their mandatory \n``uptraining'' on the other side of our country at Camp Shelby in \nMississippi and Fort Polk in Louisiana. And just like their Minnesota \n1st infantry comrades who mustered at Fort Snelling 144 years earlier, \nthe 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 34th Infantry received ratings of \n``outstanding,'' ``excellent,'' and ``perfect'' on their various \ntraining demonstrations throughout the winter of 2005.\n  In March of 2006, when the unit had already been away from home for \nhalf a year, it was time to travel the 6,000 miles to the Middle East \nand Iraq. Before they left, I had the pleasure of attending their \ndeparture ceremony in Mississippi alongside my colleagues of the \nMinnesota congressional delegation and our Governor. There were steaks, \nmusic, beer cans, smiles, flags, hugs, and sadly, a lot of tears.\n  But there was one clear thing everyone had in common that day at Camp \nShelby: Pride. Pride in serving their country. Pride in defending our \nfreedom. Pride that their loved one was going to perform their duty in \na manner consistent with the finest traditions of the U.S. military.\n  And off they went. Different units and different companies fanned out \nin locations across Iraq. Some of them in Fallujah and Taqaddum in \nAnbar Province, some at Camp Scania near Nippur, and the largest number \nat Camp Adder in Talil.\n  And the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 34th Infantry didn't take much \ntime to make an impact on the ground. By the end of May, when the ink \non their transfer authority had barely dried, the 1st Brigade Combat \nTeam of the 34th Infantry had already built a reverse osmosis water \nplant for the people of al-Feiz. It would be the first of many success \nstories they would accomplish and be proud of.\n  Over the course of the next few months, the 1st Brigade Combat Team \nof the 34th Infantry endured the trials of a unit at war. With every \nsuccessful patrol, there was a longing for far away loved ones. For \nevery completed reconstruction project, there was anticipation of a \nreturn trip home. And on the hardest of days, there was the mourning of \na fallen comrade.\n  And so it went with these selfless soldiers through the end of 2006 \nand into 2007. When the New Year broke, it brought with it a new energy \nand a refocused eye on their March 2007 return. But their March return \nwas not to be, as the story of these men and women veered onto a \ndifferent path.\n  On January 10, of this year, these soldiers and their families \nendured a shock that none of them expected. Afternoon reports from CNN \nand Fox News began to trickle through our State and Nation, indicating \nthat the unit would be extended until this summer. When the official \nword from the Pentagon confirmed this fact later that day, it shook all \nof us to our core and left us with more questions and concerns than we \ncould find answers to.\n  But like Minnesotans always do, they somehow found a way to move \nforward. The support of their families strengthened them. The spirit of \ntheir communities rallied around them. And the countdown from January \nto July gradually went from months to weeks to days while the moment \nthat seemed like it would never get here finally did: Their return.\n  Their deployment kept them in Iraq 25 days longer than any other unit \nserving in this war. During their time, they drove over 4,500 round \ntrip convoy missions completing 99 percent of them on time. That's over \n2.2 million miles of convoys in Iraq from the south central part of the \ncountry to the Jordanian and Syrian borders. And I don't think anyone \nneeds a reminder of the dangers of IEDs on these convoys, but just for \nthe record, this unit discovered over 350 of them before they were \ndetonated. In other areas they fought al-Qaida and provided critical \nsecurity to our military bases, saving countless lives of their \ncomrades in arms.\n  They also worked hard to win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi \npeople. In their time in Iraq, the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 34th \nInfantry completed over 90 reconstruction projects from water and \npowerplants to road construction and media expansion.\n  And now, after nearly 2 years of sacrifice and dedication, on behalf \nof a grateful State and Nation we have the privilege to welcome these \nfine men and women back to the North Star State. With their return will \ncome new challenges. As MAJ John Morris, Chaplain of the Minnesota \nNational Guard, often says, we have to support our troops before, \nduring, and after their deployments. I look forward to joining with my \ncolleagues in the Minnesota delegation to do our part to energize the \nState to bring these troops all the way home.\n  I have no doubt there will be plenty of handshakes, hugs, and welcome \nhome ceremonies across our State in the coming days and weeks for this \nadmirable group of Americans. I hope I am there to personally welcome \nhome as many as I can, but because I know I can't make it to all of \nthem--and because I would rather they get home and\n\n[[Page S8300]]\n\ngo fishing than spend their time talking to me--I want to express in \nthe Record the eternal appreciation I have for the service of the 1st \nBrigade Combat Team of the 34th Infantry.\n  You gave up time, income, and family togetherness. You risked \neverything so all our lives could be safer and more free from fear. \nWhen your Nation called you to serve, you didn't take a poll, you \ndidn't equivocate, you didn't even question why. You served because you \nwere called to and you did your duty with perseverance, excellence and \nstrength. Your active duty service is now complete, but our debt of \ngratitude will never end. On behalf of all Minnesotans, we welcome you \nhome.\n  Thank you and may God Bless you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8300-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    150TH ANNIVERSARY OF R MARKET\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 150th \nanniversary of Colorado's oldest family-owned business--the R Market \nin the town of San Luis, in Costilla County, CO. My family has ranched \nand farmed in the San Luis Valley for five generations just a few miles \nwest of San Luis. I grew up knowing the R Market as one of the \ntreasures of the valley, a great symbol of our shared history and \nheritage.\n  Colorado was built upon the ingenuity, hard work, and entrepreneurial \nspirit of people like Don Jose Dario Gallegos, who traveled from the \nSan Luis Valley by mule train over the Santa Fe Trail to trade centers \nin St. Louis and Independence, Missouri. Don Dario Gallegos was among \nthe founders of the town of San Luis in 1851 and helped establish some \nof the first water rights in the area. The irrigation ditches--or \nacequias--that he and the settlers dug are still in use today.\n  When Don Dario Gallegos opened his store in San Luis in 1857, \nColorado was still a young territory, and statehood was nearly 20 years \naway.\n  Though the physical foundation of Don Jose Dario Gallegos's original \nadobe structure would be destroyed in an 1895 fire, the people of San \nLuis came together to form the indestructible foundation rooted in a \ncommitment to community and family that sustains the R Market to this \nvery day.\n  It is this commitment that the people of San Luis will celebrate on \nJune 30, 150 years after the original R Market opened its doors. I \ncongratulate the Gallegos descendants--who still own and operate the \nmarket--and the people of San Luis on this momentous anniversary.\n  I have a painting of the R Market hanging in my Washington, DC, \noffice. It serves as an everyday reminder of the place I come from--a \nplace where community and family mean everything, a place where the \nspirit of Colorado was born and continues to thrive. I am honored to \nrepresent that place and the people who come from it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8300-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO GEORGE M. VAN TASSEL\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to George M. \nVan Tassel, who passed away on Monday, June 18, 2007. For 13 years, \nGeorge served as mayor of my hometown, Tuscaloosa, AL. He was a \npersonal friend of mine and along with the entire town of Tuscaloosa, I \nmourn his passing.\n  In the 1930s George moved south from New York to attend the \nUniversity of Alabama School of Law. There, he met a fellow student, \nJuarine Berrey, with whom he quickly fell in love. They married in \n1934. Several years after his gradation in 1939, George was drafted by \nthe U.S. Army to serve in the European theater during World War II. On \nD-Day, George was among the soldiers who landed on the beach at \nNormandy, France.\n  Upon returning to the States, George began his law practice. In 1956, \nhe was elected to serve as mayor of Tuscaloosa, filling the unexpired \nterm of mayor Hal McCall. Although George oversaw many changes that \ntook place in Tuscaloosa during his three terms as mayor, perhaps his \nmost notable achievement was his initiative to dam the North River and \ncreate a 5,885-acre water supply reservoir we call Lake Tuscaloosa.\n  In 1969, George decided not to run for reelection. An avid hunter and \nfisherman, he wanted more time to enjoy his hobbies. He returned to the \nlaw, managing a successful practice until he retired at age 75.\n  George is loved and will be missed by his daughter, Linda Ayers of \nTuscaloosa, and his son, George M. Van Tassel, Jr., of Birmingham. He \nwas an inspiration to many and will be remembered for his dedication \nand many contributions to the city of Tuscaloosa. I ask this entire \nSenate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life of George M. Van \nTassel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8300-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE WESTERN BALKANS AS \n       DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13219 OF JUNE 26, 2001--PM 19\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to improve the \nmanagement of medical care for members of the Armed Forces, to improve \nthe speed and efficiency of the physical disability evaluation system \nof the Department of Defense, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to proudly join my friend and \ncolleague Senator Blanche Lincoln in the introduction of the \nServicemembers' Healthcare Benefits and Rehabilitation Enhancement Act \nof 2007.\n  In March, I was able to visit one of Maine's returning soldiers who \nhas been assigned outpatient care at the Walter Reed Army Medical \nCenter. We spoke about the many issues and obstacles faced by our \nwounded troops as they struggle not only to recover from their \ninjuries, but to prepare themselves for their future. During our \nmeeting, this soldier covered many of the pitfalls faced by troops as \nthey confront the bewildering processes of medical and physical \nevaluation boards without the benefit of anyone to advocate on their \nbehalf. In fact, he aptly described the process as an ``adversarial'' \nsystem that onerously demands wounded soldiers to provide the ``burden \nof proof'' for their claims.\n  In response, we have crafted this legislation in order to remedy a \nvariety of flaws that currently plague the military health care system, \nincluding: inequitable disability ratings, a lack of advocacy within \nmilitary outpatient facilities, inadequate mental health treatment, and \ninefficient transition from the DOD to the VA.\n  First off, our bill would address the concerns I have heard from a \nnumber of returning troops from my home state of Maine and across this \nNation who have gone without the proper advocacy and case management \nfor medical benefits during their stay at military outpatient \nfacilities. It is inexcusable that our returning heroes are often \nforced to navigate the esoteric physical disability evaluation system, \nPDES, within an adversarial atmosphere.\n  The measure we are proposing would require the Secretary of Defense \nto provide each recovering servicemember in a military medical \ntreatment facility with a medical care manager who will assist him or \nher with all matters regarding their medical status, along with a \ncaseworker who will assist each servicemember and his or her family in \nobtaining all the information necessary for transition, recovery, and \nbenefits collection. Further, provisions we included will create a DOD-\nwide Ombudsmen Office to provide policy guidance to, and oversight of, \nombudsman offices in all military departments and the medical system of \nthe DOD. Only then, will our returning servicemembers recover within an \natmosphere that is based upon advocacy.\n  Additionally, recent news reports and independent analysis have \nrevealed troubling statistics regarding rampant inaccuracies within the \nmilitary disability ratings system. According to Pentagon data analyzed \nby the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission, since 2000, 92.7 \npercent of all disability ratings handed out by physical evaluation \nboards, PEBs, have been 20 percent or lower. Under the current policy, \nthose who receive disability ratings under 30 percent and have served \nless than 20 years of military service are discharged with only a \nseverance check, deprived of full military retirement pay, life \ninsurance, health insurance, and access to military commissaries.\n  Further evidence of a troubled disability ratings system shows that \nsince America went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq, fewer veterans have \nreceived disability ratings of 30 percent or more, inferring that the \nDOD may have lowered the ratings for injured troops who would have \notherwise received a host of lifelong benefits. On top of that, it \ncurrently takes an average of 209 days for troops to complete the PDES \nprocess by receiving notification of potential discharge and a \nsubsequent disability rating.\n  As a means of fixing these blatant flaws within the military \ndisability ratings system, this legislation consolidates the physical \nevaluation system by placing the informal and formal physical \nevaluation boards under one command, as a method of streamlining and \nexpediting the process. Our troops deserve timely care and efficient \ntreatment upon their return home, and therefore, no recovering \nservicemember should be forced to endure lengthy delays in a medical \nhold or holdover status due to bureaucratic inefficiencies.\n  The bill also requires that physicians preparing each individual \nmedical case for all PEBs report multiple diagnosed medical impairments \nthat, in concert, may deem a servicemember to be unfit for duty. Under \nthe current system, the U.S. Army, for example, only rates physical \nimpairments that individually cause a servicemember to be deemed unfit \nfor duty, ultimately dismissing ailments that may significantly hinder \na servicemember's ability to continue his or her service in the \nmilitary or find gainful employment in the civilian sector.\n  Over the past year, the American public has also become acutely aware \nof the effects of traumatic brain injury, TBI, which has become the \nsignature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, affecting \nthousands of returning servicemembers. Therefore, it is now more \nimperative than ever for both the DOD and the VA to implement mental \nhealth treatment policies that accurately diagnose and adequately treat \ndebilitating mental health injuries among our injured troops.\n  Our bill addresses these issues by including a provision that \nrequires all servicemembers who are expected to deploy to a combat \ntheater to receive a mental health assessment that tests their \ncognitive functioning within 120 days before deployment, a mental \nhealth assessment within 60 days after deployment, to include a \ncomprehensive screening for mild, moderate, and severe cases of TBI. \nAdditionally, all servicemembers will receive a third mental health \nassessment at the time of their predischarge physical.\n  The measure we are putting forward today also aims to update the \ncurrent disability ratings system used by the military and the VA to \ninclude the effects of TBI and post traumatic stress disorder, along \nwith any other mental health disorders that may affect our Nation's \nreturning warriors. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs would be required \nto issue a report to Congress detailing a plan to update the Veterans' \nAdministration Schedule for Ratings Disabilities, VASRD, to align its \ndisability ratings to more closely reflect the effects of mental halth \ndisorders, including TBI and PTSD on the modern workforce.\n  The Servicemembers' Healthcare Benefits and Rehabilitation \nEnhancement Act of 2007 also calls on the Secretaries of Defense and \nVeterans Affairs to provide Congress with a report detailing plans to \nincrease the role of eligible private sector rehabilitation providers \nfor assisting the VA in providing comprehensive post acute inpatient \nand outpatient rehabilitation for TBI and PTSD, if in certain instances \nthe VA is unable to provide such services.\n  The Veterans Health Administration is, unequivocally, the foremost \nexpert in providing mental health treatment for our recovering \nservicemembers, yet in varying circumstances, the VA may require \nadditional health care coverage in remote areas. All of our returning \nheroes, despite the severity of their mental health ailments, or their \nlocation geographically, deserve every\n\n[[Page S8304]]\n\navailable option for rehabilitative services, to ensure that they never \ngo untreated.\n  Additionally, to help ease the transition from the military health \ncare system to the VA system, both the DOD and the VA must adopt and \nimplement a unified electronic medical database. Interagency database \ncompatibility would not only increase medical efficiency, but it would \nsignificantly ease the transition into civilian life for injured or \nretiring servicemembers who deserve timely and effective health care. \nTherefore, our legislation establishes and implements a single \nelectronic military and medical record database within the DOD that \nwill be used to track and record the medical status of each member of \nthe Armed Forces in theater and throughout the military health care \nprocess, and will be accessible to the VA through the Joint Patient \nTracking Application, JPTA. This electronic records system will be \nidentical to the VistA system, currently used by the VA, which has \nserved as a model of excellence for electronic medical databases among \nour Nation's health community.\n  I have nothing but the utmost respect for those brave Americans who \nserved in uniform with honor, courage, and distinction. The obligation \nour Nation holds for its servicemembers and veterans is enormous, and \nit is an obligation that must be fulfilled every day. We must always \nremain cognizant of the wisdom laid forth by President George \nWashington, when he stated, ``The willingness with which our young \npeople are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall \nbe directly proportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of \nearlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country.''\n  At a time when over 600,000 courageous men and women have returned \nfrom combat in both Iraq and Afghanistan, I believe it is now up to \nCongress to do everything in its power to answer the call of our men \nand women who have nobly served our Nation in uniform, to ensure that \nthey receive the heroes' treatment they rightly earned and rightly \ndeserve. Again, I want to thank my colleague, Senator Lincoln, for her \nassistance in making this a stronger bill and bringing it before the \nSenate. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 1684. A bill to establish the Return of Talent Program to allow \naliens who are legally present in the United States to return \ntemporarily to the country of citizenship of the alien if that country \nis engaged in post-conflict or natural disaster reconstruction, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, two of the greatest challenges we face \ntoday are how to address the needs of postconflict countries, and \ncountries that are suffering from large-scale natural disasters. These \nare critical issues, and ones that we cannot afford to get wrong, for \nthe sake of the people living in those nations, and for the sake of our \nown security.\n  On the post-conflict front, a recent commission organized by the \nCenter for Strategic and International Studies and the Association of \nthe U.S. Army found, to no one's surprise, that ``failed states \nmatter--for national security as well as for humanitarian reasons. If \nleft to their own devices, such states can become sanctuaries for \nterrorist networks, organized crime and drug traffickers, as well as \nposing grave humanitarian challenges and threats to regional \nstability.''\n  Currently, the most obvious case in point is the reconstruction of \nIraq. In addition to Iraq, unfortunately, we can talk about many other \nstates that are either unstable, or are tenuously recovering from past \nconflicts including Afghanistan, East Timor, Kosovo, Haiti, and the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\n  Earthquakes, floods, drought and landslides often have the most dire \nimpacts in developing countries that are the least equipped to respond. \nThe countries ravaged by the 2004 tsunami are recovering, but there is \nstill a long way to go: Indonesia lost over 150,000 people, with half a \nmillion left homeless. In India, almost 20,000 people lost their lives \nand 2.79 million people were affected, losing homes, land, and \nlivestock. The tsunami set back development in the Maldives by 20 \nyears, devastating the country's economic backbone and tourism \nindustry.\n  We need comprehensive, and creative, strategies to help countries \nrebound from conflicts or natural disasters. One such strategy is to \nallow, and indeed encourage, immigrants to the United States to use \ntheir skills, talents, and knowledge to help rebuild their native \nlands. The diaspora is an extraordinary collective resource. These \nindividuals know the communities. They know the culture. They know the \nlanguage, more than any contractors, and more than any humanitarian \nworkers from the outside, no matter how well-trained they may be or how \nmuch expertise they may have.\n  So today, I am introducing legislation, as I did in the last \nCongress, that would create a ``return of talent'' visa program.\n  The idea is simple: to allow legal immigrants in the United States to \nreturn home to help with reconstruction efforts, without jeopardizing \ntheir immigration status. Legal permanent residents will be able to \nreturn temporarily to their countries after a conflict or a significant \nnatural disaster to help rebuild, without their time out of the United \nStates affecting their ability to meet the requirements for U.S. \ncitizenship.\n  Under current law, a legal permanent resident who wants to apply for \nU.S. citizenship is required to be physically present in the United \nStates for at least half of the 5 years immediately preceding the date \nof filing the naturalization application.\n  This residency requirement could be particularly difficult to meet \nfor those who have family and friends in their countries of origin who \nare in desperate need of help, and whose skills are especially in \ndemand to help their countries of origin rebuild, for example, \nteachers, engineers, translators, and health care workers. We should \nnot stand in their way of returning, bringing their talent and \nexpertise home, and helping them help others at a time of greatest \nneed.\n  This legislation would encourage skilled and committed individuals to \nreturn to their countries of origin to revive the business, industry, \nagriculture, education, health and other sectors that have been \nweakened or destroyed after years of conflict or devastating disasters.\n  The program would apply to immigrants from countries where U.S. Armed \nForces have engaged in armed conflict or peacekeeping, or countries \nwhere the United Nations Security Council has authorized peacekeeping \noperations in the past 10 years. Immigrants from countries which \nreceived funding from the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance \nalso would be eligible to participate in the program.\n  Estimates of the number of individuals who could participate in this \nprogram are relatively low. For example, the United States admitted \n4,749 Afghani and 4,077 Iraqi immigrants in 2005 who are now legal \npermanent residents eligible to pursue U.S. citizenship. Immigrants \nfrom Indonesia numbered 3,924 and Bangladesh, 11,487 in the same year. \nYet while the program would have a small impact on the U.S. \nnaturalization process, the contributions of even a few hundred \nindividuals could have a tremendous positive effect on reconstruction \nwork.\n  At this moment the Senate is seized with finding a resolution to the \nmassive and critical question of immigration reform. A return of talent \nprogram would fit well with whatever decisions we reach because, simply \nput, everybody wins: The United States is able to support badly needed \nrebuilding efforts without increasing foreign aid; immigrants are able \nto use their skills and resources to help communities without \ndisrupting their path to U.S. citizenship; and communities abroad that \nare recovering from conflict and disaster receive much-needed \nassistance.\n  A return of talent program is an important piece of our overall \nstrategy to stabilize and rebuild countries torn by conflict and \ndevastated by natural disaster. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8305]]\n\n                                S. 1684\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 252\n\n       Whereas the historical ties between the United States and \n     the Indonesia go back to the period of Indonesian struggle \n     for independence and the early years of its independence in \n     1945;\n       Whereas the constitutionally required ``free and active'' \n     foreign policy of Indonesia has largely resulted in a close \n     relationship with the United States, and this relationship \n     reflects the growing connections between the developed and \n     the developing world;\n       Whereas, following the effects of the Asian financial \n     crisis in 1998, Indonesia has instituted numerous democratic \n     reforms, including--\n       (1) amending the country's constitution in order to be more \n     democratic and transparent;\n       (2) holding the country's first ever direct presidential \n     election in 2004 and direct, nationwide local elections \n     starting in 2006; and\n       (3) giving the judicial branch independent administrative \n     and financial responsibility for all courts in 2004;\n       Whereas the government of President Susilo Bambang \n     Yudhoyono, the first directly elected President of Indonesia, \n     is strongly committed to strengthening the country's \n     democracy and remains focused on developing good governance \n     and promoting and protecting human rights, civil liberties, a \n     free press, and a vibrant civil society;\n       Whereas the Government of Indonesia continues to reform its \n     military in accordance with internationally accepted \n     democratic principles;\n       Whereas Indonesia signed a peace agreement in August 2005 \n     ending the conflict in Aceh, met its obligations under the \n     agreement, oversaw the return of normalcy to Aceh, and held \n     free, transparent, and peaceful elections for local \n     government leaders in December 2006;\n       Whereas the Government of Indonesia has worked and \n     continues to work toward peaceful solutions to other internal \n     conflicts, including Papua, with concern for the welfare and \n     security of the entire population;\n       Whereas, in parallel with the recovery of Indonesia's \n     economic and political stability following the 1998 Asian \n     financial crisis, the country has regained its pivotal role \n     in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and \n     continues to work toward a secure, peaceful, and vibrant \n     Southeast Asia, particularly by proposing successfully the \n     ASEAN Security Community, the ASEAN Economic Community, and \n     the ASEAN Socio-cultural Community;\n       Whereas the Government and people of Indonesia have endured \n     several terrorist bombings, have shown resilience in the \n     fight against international terrorism by apprehending and \n     bringing to justice numerous perpetrators, and remain open to \n     international cooperation in this area;\n       Whereas the Government of Indonesia, together with the \n     Governments of Malaysia and Singapore as fellow littoral \n     states and user-countries, has maintained and is further \n     strengthening efforts to secure the important international \n     shipping lane in the Malacca Strait;\n       Whereas, as shown in international fora, the Government of \n     Indonesia remains committed to addressing the problems \n     related to the control of the spread of weapons of mass \n     destruction;\n       Whereas the Government of Indonesia has deployed a military \n     battalion to support the United Nations Interim Force In \n     Lebanon (UNIFIL) peacekeeping operations, and as the world's \n     largest Muslim democracy, has made important contributions to \n     the facilitation of various dialogues among Islamic factions \n     in the Middle East; and\n       Whereas, though the Government of Indonesia has shown \n     significant progress in the areas of democracy, good \n     governance, human rights, and counter terrorism, there \n     remains much to be done and many reforms yet to be \n     implemented: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the progress made by the Government of \n     Indonesia in its efforts to promote democracy;\n       (2) expresses ongoing support for further democratic reform \n     in Indonesia and the efforts of the Government and the people \n     of Indonesia toward developing good governance;\n       (3) encourages the Government and the People of Indonesia \n     to continue working to ensure the promotion and protection of \n     human rights, civil liberties, a free press, and a strong \n     civil society in Indonesia; and\n       (4) encourages the President, the Secretary of State, and \n     other officials of the United States Government to continue \n     assisting the Government of Indonesia in its efforts to \n     promote democracy and ensure the liberty and welfare of the \n     people of Indonesia.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as a Member of the Senate who has traveled \nevery year to Southeast Asia and met frequently with government leaders \nfrom that region when they visited the United States, I believe America \nhas great interests in that region, and that we need to pay more \nattention here in Washington, DC and across the Nation, to our allies \nand partners in Southeast Asia.\n  This region, economically, politically, strategically important, it \nis our 5th largest in total volume trading partner. Serving as a \ncornerstone to SE Asia and the lynchpin to its stability, prosperity \nand security lie in Indonesia.\n  When I have asked leaders from all over Southeast Asia how they are \ndoing, they always include a reference to Indonesia. Indonesia is the \nworld's largest Muslim country and as a democracy, that makes it the \nlargest Muslim democracy as well.\n  On the darker side, it is also a key country in what many in the \nintelligence community, and I agree, is the second front in the war on \nterror that we confront. It is home to the Islamist terrorist group, \nJemah Islamiya, which next to al-Qaeda, is one of the greatest threats \nto American security and peace in the world.\n  Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has been executing an \nambitious agenda for anti-corruption, political and economic reform. He \nrepresents Indonesia's best hope for continuing down a path towards \nstability, prosperity, pluralism, democracy and security. Such a path \nis not only in our own economic interests, but is also essential to \ncontrol the terrorist threat and the reach of al-Qaeada and Jemah \nIslamiah in Southeast Asia.\n  Since the fall of President Suharto, the Indonesian people have \nelected three new presidents, impeached one, and experienced several \npeaceful transfers of power. They have held direct elections of a \npresident. They have amended their constitution in order to\n\n[[Page S8307]]\n\nbe more democratic and transparent. They have given the judicial branch \nindependent administrative and financial authority. They continue to \nreform their military in accordance with democratic, civilian-\ncontrolled principles.\n  They have recently provided a battalion to support the UNIFIL forces \nin Lebanon; and Indonesia was recently cited by Freedom House as \nSoutheast Asia's only truly ``free'' nation.\n  But despite all the progress being made, we in Congress seem to \ncontinue to look for every transgression to put our relationship on \nhold and move it backwards.\n  The truth is that as a country, Indonesia has made truly remarkable \nprogress in a very short period of time. As such, they deserve \ncontinued support and engagement, not restrictions and retractions.\n  We should recognize the accomplishments of the Indonesian people and \nencourage them in their pursuit of a successful transformation to a \ndemocratic nation.\n  This is why I, along with my distinguished colleague Senator Inouye, \nam proud to introduce a resolution recognizing Indonesia's \naccomplishments and the increasingly mutually beneficial relationship \nbetween Indonesia and the U.S.\n  As an archipelago of over 200 million people, if Indonesia were \nsuperimposed over the top of the United States, it would span from \nFlorida to Alaska. The size of Indonesia and the fact that they have \n17,000 islands at low water, 13,000 at high tide, presents a tremendous \nchallenge in defending its borders and dealing with potential terrorist \nactivities on its distant islands or remote jungles.\n  The Indonesian armed forces are a necessary partner in this battle. \nWhen Jemah Islamiah bombed the Bali nightclub in 2002, killing 202 \npeople, Indonesia's military, policing and intelligence capabilities \nwere in poor condition. Of late however, Indonesia's security forces \nhave ``gained the upper hand,'' according to the Economist, June 16th, \n2007 with the capture and arrest of some of Jemah Islamiah's top \ncommanders.\n  Leadimg the fight against terror is Indonesia's new police unit 88, \nwhich was set up with the help of American and Australian Security \nforces. Among the terrorists captured was Abu Dujana, one of \nIndonesia's most wanted terrorists. Dujana apparently took over as \nmilitary leader of JI when their former leader and bomb maker, Azahari \nHusin, was in 2005 killed and had earned the dubious honor of being \nnamed the most wanted terrorist in the country. And over the last 12 \nmonths, the Indonesians have captured or killed 47 terrorists, \nincluding several key leaders.\n  The article also went on to say. . . .\n\n       No large-scale attacks have taken place since 2005. With \n     the help of their Australian and American counterparts, \n     Indonesia's national police have greatly improved their \n     tracking of militants and have rounded up some of JI's top \n     leaders.\n\n  In the recent past, there have been various forms of restrictions on \nour relations with the Indonesian military in light of terrible abuses \nthat were committed by the TNI in East Timor. However, our \nreinstatement of military relations and the restoration of \nInternational Military Education & Training or IMET, has resulted in \ncontinued positive trends.\n  It is interesting to note that the current President, when he was a \nmilitary leader, was in the last class of IMET leaders from Indonesia \nto come to the United States. He, in his own person, demonstrates the \nappreciation of civilian control. Some in this body and the other body \nwant to impose new restriction to hinder, not help, the productive \ninfluence our military can and has had on the TNI.\n  We must expand and continue to improve our relations with the TNI, \nnot restrict and retract. IMET provides for adherence to the Code of \nMilitary Justice, civilian of the military, respect for human rights, \nand proper treatment of population principles that should be instilled \nin military forces.\n  Further, IMET establishes important relationships and alliances among \nour military leaders and commanders of friendly foreign forces. It \nassures they understand how to conduct military or relief operations \ntogether. and, it keeps the U.S. engaged in a region where China is \nincreasingly, extending its influence. When I visited the North Western \nprovince of Ache, right after the Tsunami, the fact that their military \nhad not trained with us caused us great military operational \ndifficulties.\n  Some in Congress apparently want to reimpose sanctions on IMET \nparticipation because of the past and perceived military abuses, but as \nWalter Lohman, Director of Asian Studies at the Heritage Foundation, \nhas said:\n\n       accountability for past human rights abuses and the proper \n     role of the militia are legitimate. But the United States \n     needs to get to a point where it addresses these concerns \n     with the same respect it affords other democratic partners, \n     like the Europeans or the Japanese\n\n  Many leaders in that region have told me, privately, they believe \nU.S. active engagement and association with their countries is \nessential to stop China from extending hegemony over the region. \nWhether China is viewed as a threat or an opportunity, they are \nactively courting their neighbors in SE Asia; They are sending official \ntrade missions, signing trade agreements and investing their large \nreserves in securing sources of energy and natural resources. Make no \nmistake about it, they are aggressively building up a military force \nnavy capable of extending beyond the straits of Taiwan.\n  The opportunities and the challenges related to China seeking to \nextend its influence over Southeast Asia should concern us both \neconomically and militarily. States of Southeast Asia, notably \nIndonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia, control the important Malacca \nStraits; Straits through which one quarter of all the shipping in the \nworld passes and one half of the petroleum products carried by ocean-\ngoing vessels pass.\n  Beyond those interests, it remains my thesis that we should pay \nattention to Southeast Asia--particularly Indonesia--as the second \nfront in the war on terrorism.\n  Indondsia represents the best hope for fostering a moderate Islam \nthat recognizes the true peaceful nature of that religion in opposition \nto the radical terrorist-inspiring versions of Islam.\n  With Southeast Asia and its large Muslim population, we have an \nopportunity through constructive forms of engagement; to ensure they \nbecome a solid foundation for peace, security and economic prosperity \nin this critical part of the world. Whether it is more peace corps \nvolunteers, education initiatives, leadership exchanges, IMET or \nsending Navy ships such as the USS Mercy and USS Peleliu on \nhumanitarian missions to the region.\n  We can do it without the need for massive military actions such as \nthose we have undertaken in Afghanistan and Iraq to root out the \nterrorists and in those cases, the governments that harbored them. In \nother words, more sandals on the ground now, will prevent having to put \nboots on the ground in future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support countries like Indonesia in their \npath towards peace, democracy and pluralism, as opposed to restricting \nand pushing them towards more radical, terrorist-inspiring versions of \nIslam.\n  I ask or behalf of Senator Inouye and myself that the resolution be \nsent to the desk and ask that it be referred appropriately.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the articles \nfrom the June 16th Economist and from Walter Lohman of the Asian \nStudies Center at the Heritage Foundation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Economist, June 16, 2007]\n\n                      Wounded But Still Dangerous\n\n       When Jemaah Islamiah (JI), a South-East Asian Islamist \n     group, bombed nightclubs on the Indonesian island of Bali in \n     2002, killing 202 people, it exposed the poor state of the \n     country's anti-terrorist intelligence and policing. And the \n     attack did not seem to lead to much improvement. The bombers \n     struck again in 2003, at an American-run hotel in Jakarta, \n     and in 2004 at the Australian embassy there. In 2005 they \n     returned to Bali to attack three tourist restaurants. Of \n     late, however, Indonesia's security forces seem to have \n     gained the upper hand over JI.\n       No large-scale attacks have taken place since 2005. With \n     the help of their Australian and American counterparts, \n     Indonesia's national police have greatly improved their \n     tracking of militants and have rounded up some of JI's top \n     leaders. This culminated on June 13th with confirmation that \n     they had\n\n[[Page S8308]]\n\n     arrested Abu Dujana, a JI leader whom police had recently \n     begun to describe as their ``most wanted''.\n       Mr. Dujana is said to have fought in Afghanistan and \n     hobnobbed with Osama bin Laden. He is believed to have taken \n     charge of one of JI's military wings, and control of its \n     weapons and explosives, after the death of the group's chief \n     bombmaker, Azahari Husin, in a shoot-out with police in 2005. \n     It has even been suggested that Mr. Dujana is JI's emir, or \n     paramount leader. Another leading figure, Noordin Muhammad \n     Top, is still on the run. But the capture of Mr. Dujana and \n     several other terrorists in recent days follows the discovery \n     of a huge arsenal of guns and bomb-making materials in March. \n     It marks a ``very significant'' blow against JI, says Sidney \n     Jones, in Jakarta for the International Crisis Group (ICG), a \n     think-tank.\n       Indonesia's arrests came shortly after Singapore revealed \n     that it was detaining four JI members, arrested between last \n     November and April, and freeing five detained earlier who had \n     ``responded positively to rehabilitation''. However, the \n     Philippines' army admitted last weekend that another JI \n     leader, known as Dulmatin, suspected of involvement in the \n     2002 Bali bombs, had again escaped its clutches. The army \n     believes he is hiding in the Tawi-Tawi Islands, off Borneo. \n     He and other fugitives in the southern Philippines are \n     suspected of teaching local Islamist militants how to make \n     bombs.\n       Indonesia's recent policing successes are a tribute to two \n     new units set up after the 2002 bombings. One, which has \n     stayed out of the spotlight, is an intelligence-gathering \n     task-force. The other, Detachment 88, is a high-profile anti-\n     terrorist squad, trained by American and Australian federal \n     police in making arrests and gathering forensic evidence. \n     Since their formation Indonesia's terror-fighting \n     capabilities have ``come on in leaps and bounds'', says Nigel \n     Inkster, an analyst at the International Institute for \n     Strategic Studies in London and until recently the deputy \n     head of the British external-intelligence service, M16. \n     Indonesia's army and its domestic-intelligence agency, BIN, \n     are not much good at anti-terrorism work, says Mr. Inkster, \n     so until the new police units were formed, foreign agencies \n     had no competent Indonesian counterparts.\n       Despite Detachment 88's successes, Ms. Jones says the unit \n     is too small. When it raids terrorist bases it must rely on \n     help from Brimoh, a poorly trained paramilitary-police unit. \n     In January, for example, the two forces combined to storm a \n     JI hideout on Sulawesi, an Indonesian island plagued by \n     conflict between Muslims and Christians. Fifteen suspected \n     militants and one policeman died. An ICG investigation found \n     that the heavy casualties made local Muslims see extremists \n     as victims. Such incidents are counter-productive, \n     encouraging civilians to shelter JI militants.\n       Another worry is lenient sentencing by Indonesia's courts. \n     JI's spiritual leader, Abu Bakar Basyir, was let out of jail \n     after serving 26 months of a 30-month sentence for his \n     alleged involvement in the 2002 bombings. The courts later \n     overturned his conviction altogether. The country's prisons, \n     riddled with corruption and incompetence, may serve as \n     recruiting and training centres for JI. Bringing terrorism \n     convicts together in a specially built new jail, as is \n     planned, may simply make the job of JI's ``tutors'' easier.\n       For all the success in tracking down JI's military leaders, \n     the group's current plans and the extent of its network \n     remain something of a mystery. Unlike many terrorist groups \n     worldwide, JI lacks an overground political wing to elaborate \n     its demands. A study by the ICG last month reckoned the group \n     may still have around 900 members. But the scale of its \n     recruitment in universities and Islamic boarding schools in \n     unclear. There are signs that, as its bomb-planting and fund-\n     raising activities are more successfully curbed, the group is \n     simply turning to cheaper and easier forms of terrorism, such \n     as assassinations.\n       Along with the arrests and the seizure of weapons in March, \n     Indonesian police found a handwritten diagram showing that JI \n     operatives on Java, Indonesia's most populous island, had \n     been reorganised into a sariyah (possibly meaning \n     ``platoon''), implying that this was part of a new military \n     structure covering South-East Asia. But there have recently \n     been few signs of activity outside the group's Indonesian \n     heartland. Last week a general in Thailand's military-backed \n     government implied that Cambodian Muslims linked to JI were \n     somehow involved in the insurgency in Thailand's mainly \n     Muslim southern provinces. But he backtracked after the \n     Cambodian government furiously denounced his comments.\n       There has been little recent evidence that JI or, for that \n     matter, al-Qaeda, has a hand in the Thai south's rising \n     violence. But it is just the sort of strife-torn place, full \n     of alienated, angry Muslims, where those seeking to organise \n     jihad find fertile ground. Police have pruned JI's top ranks. \n     But its roots may still be spreading.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Economist, June 16, 2007]\n\n                              Street Life\n\n       Filthy children and fingerless lepers, tapping on car \n     windows and pleading for ``paisa, khana'' (cash, food), hang \n     around every busy traffic junction and market in Delhi. \n     Begging in Delhi is illegal though few are locked up. But if \n     the authorities have their way, it will soon be wiped out, as \n     part of a big clean-up before the capital hosts the \n     Commonwealth Games in 2010.\n       Plans to obliterate other familiar features of Delhi ahead \n     of the games are controversial. A ban on some 300,000 stalls \n     selling freshly cooked snacks has enraged well-off foodies \n     and the poor alike. Animal-rights activists protested when \n     hundreds of unruly monkeys were rounded up and shut in cages. \n     A new scheme to herd the city's stray cows into a vast dairy \n     complex will doubtless anger many cow-revering Hindus.\n       A radical plan to corral Delhi's beggars, in contrast, has \n     provoked little reaction. After an order from the High Court \n     that begging be stamped out, a report commissioned by Delhi's \n     Department for Social Welfare recommends that beggars be \n     rounded up by a special police squad and placed in beggar's \n     homes, which resemble jails more than hostels. The report, by \n     academics at the University of Delhi, also wants the public \n     to be educated about the ``evils of alms-giving'', which \n     ``promotes parasites''.\n       The report entailed the fullest survey ever conducted of \n     Delhi's beggars. It offers revealing insights into their \n     earning potential. Of the 58,570 beggars counted, 5,003 were \n     interviewed in depth. Nearly half the adults earned between \n     50 and 100 rupees ($1.20-$2.40) a day, not much less than the \n     income of many daily wage labourers. About 3% said they \n     earned 100 to 500 rupees a day.\n       Tales of high-earning beggars have often been used in India \n     to justify intolerance. But the survey also hints at the \n     underlying injustices. One-third of adult beggars were \n     disabled; 88% said they had no skills; almost all were \n     migrants from other parts of India--mostly the poor northern \n     states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh--and had taken up begging \n     because they could not find work.\n       More than one-third were under the age of 18, like Mohammed \n     Alam, a ten-year-old orphan, who left Bihar with his aunt and \n     uncle a month ago. On arriving in Delhi, Mohammed's aunt \n     found a job ironing clothes; the boy, whose polio has left \n     him with a deformed leg and a limp, works a busy traffic \n     intersection for five hours at a stretch, earning between 10 \n     and 20 rupees. The rest of the time he spends at home (``in \n     that park over there''). He has not been to school since he \n     was seven, he says, his small face a complete blank.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Economist, June 16, 2007]\n\n                             A Museum Boom\n\n       Cities and towns across China are rushing to build museums. \n     These are not the dour edifices of the Mao era that until \n     recent years were the dreary repositories of the nation's \n     historical treasures. Governments, and even some individuals, \n     are lavishing huge sums on vast and exotic new buildings. \n     Sadly, this does not imply a new-found respect for history.\n       In 1977, a year after Chairman Mao's death, there were only \n     300-odd museums. Most of them were little more than displays \n     of Communist Party propaganda. Within a decade, say official \n     press reports, the number had grown to nearly 830. By the \n     turn of the century there were more than 2,000 of them. By \n     2015, officials estimate, there will be around 3,000.\n       Beijing alone now has at least 131 museums, up from 96 a \n     decade ago. In January the Stalinist-looking National Museum \n     overlooking Tiananmen Square was closed down for a three-year \n     makeover costing $330m. Last year saw the formal opening of \n     the city's new Capital Museum, which cost more than $160m. \n     Shanghai is fast catching up. It plans to have 150 museums by \n     2010, up from 106.\n       Local governments, caught up in what the Chinese press call \n     a ``museum fever'', are vying to outdo one other with \n     architectural wonders. Most are paid for out of government \n     budgets. But near the city of Chengdu, in south-western \n     China, a local businessman, Fan Jianchuan, opened a 33-\n     hectare (82-acre) museum complex two years ago. Its exhibits \n     are boldly revisionist, highlighting the contributions made \n     by the Kuomintang, the party's enemy, in the anti-Japanese \n     war of the 1930s and 40s.\n       Officials worry that the museum boom is getting out of \n     control. The country has a dearth of people qualified to run \n     them. Local governments are often unwilling to subsidise \n     running costs, forcing museums to rely on ticket sales. \n     Prices are often too high for many ordinary townspeople.\n       The museum fad is a refreshing contrast to the culture-\n     destroying ethos of Mao's rule. But the penchant for \n     vandalism still lurks. This week Qiu Baixing, a deputy \n     minister of construction, said historical architecture and \n     cultural sites were being ``devastated'' by rapid urban \n     construction. He even compared this to the destruction \n     wrought by Mao's Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution. \n     The museums may look splendid, but, around them, history is \n     being pulverised.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        Adjusting to the Reality of a Newly Democratic Indonesia\n\n                           (By Walter Lohman)\n\n       Jakarta, June 18, 2007--In Washington, inertia often \n     carries the day on even the most anachronistic policy ideas. \n     Congress proved this axiom on June 5 when appropriators in \n     the House of Representatives slashed and conditioned the \n     Administration's request to provide military assistance to \n     Indonesia.\n       Indonesia today is a large, vibrant democracy and a key \n     piece of the geostrategic puzzle in Asia. It is also among \n     the United\n\n[[Page S8309]]\n\n     States' most important partners in the War on Terror. \n     Approached wisely, the U.S.-Indonesian relationship embodies \n     a convergence of interests on values, geopolitics, and \n     security that is rare among U.S. relationships in the \n     developing world.\n       The House Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign \n     Operations has charted a strikingly unwise course. Under the \n     leadership of Representative Nita Lowey (D-NY), it has \n     covered its collective ears to the history of the last decade \n     and has forged ahead with a policy that ignores reality and \n     the vital American interests at stake in the region.\n       Military assistance to Indonesia first became a matter of \n     contention in Washington following the Dili Massacre of 1991, \n     in which hundreds of protestors in East Timor were murdered \n     by the armed forces of East Timor's erstwhile ruler, \n     Indonesia. The debate was stoked in 1999 by the scorched \n     earth reaction of Indonesian troops and pro-Indonesia \n     militias to East Timor's overwhelming vote in favor of \n     independence. For good reason, these unconscionable abuses \n     strained relations between the United States and Indonesia.\n       But since 1999, the world has been turned upside down. An \n     emerging, unstable democracy then, Indonesia is now a \n     flourishing democracy. In October 1999, Indonesia elected a \n     president--albeit indirectly--for the first time in 50 years. \n     Five years later, an astounding 350 million votes were cast \n     in three national elections--inc1uding a direct election for \n     president.\n       The final round of the 2004 presidential election, \n     involving 117 million voters and 77 percent of eligible \n     voters, was the largest single election day in history. Among \n     the many remarkable facets of Indonesia's democracy, the 2004 \n     elections produced 61 women members of the 550-seat lower \n     house and 27 out of 128 in the upper house.\n       Acknowledging that elections do not necessarily equal \n     democracy, it should also be pointed out that Indonesians \n     have taken to vigorously exercising their civil liberties. \n     There are 16 political parties, hundreds of newspapers and \n     magazines, independent television and radio outlets, and \n     countless web sites commenting on Indonesian politics. Lively \n     political debate reverberates across many forums and media. \n     According to Freedom House, Indonesia is the freest country \n     in Southeast Asia. Symbolic of Indonesia's progress, in \n     2005, Indonesian President Bambang Susilo Yudhoyono \n     visited the site of the 1991 Dili Massacre to pay his \n     respects. The East Timorese Prime Minister reciprocated by \n     telling his countrymen to ``Forget the past and look to \n     the future.'' Today, Indonesia and East Timor enjoy a \n     close, cooperative relationship due in major part to the \n     effort of former president and independence-hero Xanana \n     Gusmao.\n       The same week that House appropriators were taking \n     Indonesia to task, in fact, the current president of East \n     Timor, Jose Ramos Horta, was in Jakarta echoing the same \n     sentiment offered by his government in 2005, saying, ``The \n     important thing is we don't allow ourselves to be hostage of \n     the past but look forward with courage.''\n       Despite its searing, up-close experience in the 1990s, East \n     Timor has come to peace with Indonesia. Yet, its well-meaning \n     supporters in the U.S. Congress seem unable to acknowledge \n     new realities.\n\n\n                Strategic Concerns for the United States\n\n       Two other things have changed since 1999.\n       First, the meteoric rise of China has made the presence of \n     a strong, U.S.-friendly ASEAN--the association of 10 \n     Southeast Asian nations on China's strategic doorstep--a \n     critical U.S. interest. Indonesia, straddling waters that \n     accommodate half of the world's commercial cargo transit, is \n     an important part of U.S. geopolitical calculations in its \n     own right. But, as a nation of 235 million people and 17,000 \n     islands, it is also ASEAN's indispensable power.\n       Every day, China becomes a more effective competitor for \n     the region's interests. Particularly since 2002, its focus in \n     Southeast Asia has shifted from its territorial claims in the \n     South China Sea to lavishing the region with diplomatic \n     attention. Without due vigilance, commitment, and wise policy \n     choices, the time is not far off when the U.S. role as \n     guarantor of regional security and stability will be up for \n     grabs. The United States needs friends in the region; and \n     Indonesia, by wholeheartedly embracing universal democratic \n     ideals, has made being friends as easy as any nation in the \n     world.\n       Second, the United States is six years into waging the good \n     fight on global terrorism. Indonesia and the U.S. share \n     fundamental interests in this war. Indonesians themselves \n     have been victims of terrorism. Terrorists have directed \n     major acts of violence against the country's tourism industry \n     and foreign communities, killing many innocent foreigners as \n     well as Indonesians.\n       For many years, the terrorists have sought to inflame \n     sectarian divisions in the same way that al-Qaeda has done so \n     effectively elsewhere in the world. Terrorists have also \n     sought to establish training beachheads in Indonesia's far-\n     flung territories. But the terrorists in Indonesia are \n     losing: There have been no major acts of terrorism in \n     Indonesia since October 2005. Moderation is in the DNA of \n     Indonesia's national character. Certainly, there is a battle \n     going on for Indonesia's soul, as is being waged in much of \n     the Muslim world.\n       But in Indonesia, the extremists are faced with an \n     extraordinarily resilient foe in Indonesia's famously \n     syncretic, diverse, and tolerant culture. Congress can help \n     strengthen the Indonesian government's hand through \n     assistance and partnership, or it can hamper it by caveating \n     its assistance. Indonesia will fight the war against terror \n     without the United States; but American cooperation certainly \n     improves its prospects. It is in the national interest for \n     the United States to be there for its natural partners.\n       None of this is to suggest that the United States does not \n     have differences with Indonesia. Indeed, Representative \n     Lowey's concerns about accountability for past human rights \n     abuses and the proper role of the military are legitimate. \n     But the United States needs to get to a point where it \n     addresses these concerns with the same respect it affords \n     other democratic partners, like the Europeans or the \n     Japanese.\n       Limiting and legally conditioning military-to-military \n     relations is not the best way to address differences; it is a \n     page from the past. The recent action by House appropriators \n     is counterproductive and damaging to vital American interests \n     in Asia.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Bond in \nsubmitting a resolution, which recognizes the mutually beneficial \nrelationship between the United States and the Republic of Indonesia.\n  Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country, the third \nlargest democracy, and the most populous Muslim nation. It possesses \nextensive natural resources, and a considerable amount of trade passes \nthrough the straits of Malacca. Without question, Indonesia is a \nvaluable partner to the United States in the global war on terror.\n  Indonesia has made great strides in continuing to democratize and \ndevelop its civil society as well as rule of law, particularly under \nthe leadership of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. This resolution \nacknowledges many of the Government's positive reforms and encourages \nthe Republic of Indonesia to continue its commitment to human rights, \ndemocratic principles, and good governance.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that my colleagues will join me in \nrecognizing this very important nation in Southeast Asia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8309-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8309-S8310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 40--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF \nOBSERVING THE NATIONAL DAY OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS ON JANUARY 11 \n OF EACH YEAR TO RAISE AWARENESS OF AND OPPOSITION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Obama, and \nMr. Lugar) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                             S. Con Res. 40\n\n       Whereas the United States has a tradition of advancing \n     fundamental human rights;\n       Whereas because the people of the United States remain \n     committed to protecting individual freedom, there is a \n     national imperative to eliminate human trafficking, including \n     early or forced marriage, commercial sexual exploitation, \n     forced labor, labor obtained through debt bondage, \n     involuntary servitude, slavery, and slavery by descent;\n       Whereas to combat human trafficking in the United States \n     and globally, the people of the United States and the Federal \n     Government, including local and State governments, must be \n     aware of the realities of human trafficking and must be \n     dedicated to stopping this contemporary manifestation of \n     slavery;\n       Whereas beyond all differences of race, creed, or political \n     persuasion, the people of the United States face national \n     threats together and refuse to let human trafficking exist in \n     the United States and around the world;\n       Whereas the United States should actively oppose all \n     individuals, groups, organizations, and nations who support, \n     advance, or commit acts of human trafficking;\n       Whereas the United States must also work to end human \n     trafficking around the world through education;\n       Whereas victims of human trafficking need support in order \n     to escape and to recover from the physical, mental, \n     emotional, and spiritual trauma associated with their \n     victimization;\n       Whereas human traffickers use many physical and \n     psychological techniques to control their victims, including \n     the use of violence or threats of violence against the victim \n     or the victim's family, isolation from the public, isolation \n     from the victim's family and religious or ethnic communities, \n     language and cultural barriers, shame, control of the \n     victim's possessions, confiscation of passports and other \n     identification documents, and threats of arrest, deportation, \n     or imprisonment if the victim attempts to reach out for \n     assistance or to leave;\n       Whereas although laws to prosecute perpetrators of human \n     trafficking and to assist\n\n[[Page S8310]]\n\n     and protect victims of human trafficking have been enacted in \n     the United States, awareness of the issues surrounding human \n     trafficking by those people most likely to come into contact \n     with victims is essential for effective enforcement because \n     the techniques that traffickers use to keep their victims \n     enslaved severely limit self-reporting; and\n       Whereas the effort by individuals, businesses, \n     organizations, and governing bodies to promote the observance \n     of the National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness on January \n     11 of each year represents one of the many examples of the \n     ongoing commitment in the United States to raise awareness of \n     and to actively oppose human trafficking: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress supports the goals and ideals of \n     observing the National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness on \n     January 11 of each year and all other efforts to raise \n     awareness of and opposition to human trafficking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8310-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1867.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con.

Res. 40\n\n       Whereas the United States has a tradition of advancing \n     fundamental human rights;\n       Whereas because the people of the United States remain \n     committed to protecting individual freedom, there is a \n     national imperative to eliminate human trafficking, including \n     early or forced marriage, commercial sexual exploitation, \n     forced labor, labor obtained through debt bondage, \n     involuntary servitude, slavery, and slavery by descent;\n       Whereas to combat human trafficking in the United States \n     and globally, the people of the United States and the Federal \n     Government, including local and State governments, must be \n     aware of the realities of human trafficking and must be \n     dedicated to stopping this contemporary manifestation of \n     slavery;\n       Whereas beyond all differences of race, creed, or political \n     persuasion, the people of the United States face national \n     threats together and refuse to let human trafficking\n\n[[Page S8312]]\n\n     exist in the United States and around the world;\n       Whereas the United States should actively oppose all \n     individuals, groups, organizations, and nations who support, \n     advance, or commit acts of human trafficking;\n       Whereas the United States must also work to end human \n     trafficking around the world through education;\n       Whereas victims of human trafficking need support in order \n     to escape and to recover from the physical, mental, \n     emotional, and spiritual trauma associated with their \n     victimization;\n       Whereas human traffickers use many physical and \n     psychological techniques to control their victims, including \n     the use of violence or threats of violence against the victim \n     or the victim's family, isolation from the public, isolation \n     from the victim's family and religious or ethnic communities, \n     language and cultural barriers, shame, control of the \n     victim's possessions, confiscation of passports and other \n     identification documents, and threats of arrest, deportation, \n     or imprisonment if the victim attempts to reach out for \n     assistance or to leave;\n       Whereas although laws to prosecute perpetrators of human \n     trafficking and to assist and protect victims of human \n     trafficking have been enacted in the United States, awareness \n     of the issues surrounding human trafficking by those people \n     most likely to come into contact with victims is essential \n     for effective enforcement because the techniques that \n     traffickers use to keep their victims enslaved severely limit \n     self-reporting; and\n       Whereas the effort by individuals, businesses, \n     organizations, and governing bodies to promote the observance \n     of the National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness on January \n     11 of each year represents one of the many examples of the \n     ongoing commitment in the United States to raise awareness of \n     and to actively oppose human trafficking: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress supports the goals and ideals of \n     observing the National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness on \n     January 11 of each year and all other efforts to raise \n     awareness of and opposition to human trafficking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8312-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ROOSEVELT CAMPOBELLO INTERNATIONAL PARK COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. REID.

I failed--and I \napologize--to mention two of the most important people for getting that \npassed, two staff members.\n  Chris Miller, who works in my office, is such a wonderful, hard-\nworking public servant. Chris is originally from Detroit. He has worked \nin Congress for 20 years, 18 years with the Senate. He worked for \nSenator Jeffords and for me on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. His work ethic is unsurpassed. He has become a resource for \nthe entire Senate, Democrats and Republicans. During the Energy bill, \nstaff members came to him and some Members themselves came to him, \nasked where we were. He gave them information as to where we were, \nwhere we were going. Chris has a master's degree from the University of \nMichigan. That is in natural resource management. He has a bachelor's \nalso from the same institution in political science. I told him \npersonally last night, after the bill passed, how much I appreciated \nhis hard work. I want the record spread with the fact that he is an \nexemplary employee.\n  I also want to talk about someone I have worked with over the years \nbecause he has been in the Senate for a long time, and that is Bob \nSimon. Bob has a Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry from MIT in 1982. He is a \nperson with a wide range of knowledge. Before coming to the Senate \nabout 14 years ago or so, he worked at the Department of Energy and the \nNational Research Council for the National Academies of Science and \nEngineering. He has served in a variety of science- and technology-\nrelated positions in the Senate since 1993. He became a staff director \nfor the overall committee the month the Democrats won the majority. He \nworks very well with Senator Domenici, the ranking member and until \nrecently the chairman of that committee.\n  He is really a good person, works so hard--another example of people \nwe have here on Capitol Hill who are here because they believe in \npublic service. That is why he is here. He is a person who works \nextremely hard, and his work on this bill was instrumental to its \npassage.\n  I ask if the distinguished Republican leader has anything to say?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. Let me \njust make the point that we have recently adopted S. Res. 250, which \ncondemns the military junta in Burma and calls for the immediate and \nunconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi. The State Peace and \nDevelopment Council, which rules Burma, is a truly outrageous, pariah \nregime that deserves universal condemnation. I only wish there were \nmore countries that would join us in publicly criticizing the regime \nand in taking action to help bring about positive change in this \ntroubled nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/22/senate-section/article/S8312-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 25, 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.
