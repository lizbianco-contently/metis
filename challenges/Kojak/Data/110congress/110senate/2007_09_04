Mr. President, under the order that was entered, the Senate \nwill conduct a period for morning business for 60 minutes, with the \ntime controlled between the two sides as I read. Following this period \nfor morning business, the Senate will proceed to the Military \nConstruction and VA appropriations bill. This is a very critical, \nimportant message for our military and for our veterans. I hope we can \nconsider this bill in a very expeditious manner.\n  At approximately 2:30 this afternoon, the Senate will proceed to \nexecutive session and consider the Nussle nomination for a period of 3 \nhours. The chairs and ranking members of the Budget and Homeland \nSecurity Committees will each be recognized as indicated in the matter \nI just read before the Senate. There will be 30 minutes, as indicated, \non each side, with Senator Sanders controlling 1 hour. A vote on the \nnomination is expected to occur about 5:30 this afternoon.\n  I spoke with the distinguished Republican leader this morning and \nindicated what we were going to accomplish before we leave for the \nJewish holiday, which is 1 week from this Wednesday--1 week from \ntomorrow.\n  We are going to take up and complete the Nussle nomination this \nafternoon. Prior to that being completed, Senators Jack Reed and Kay \nBailey Hutchison, who are the managers of the appropriations bill that \nwill come\n\n[[Page S11000]]\n\nbefore the Senate, will manage that bill. It is an extremely important \npiece of legislation. We are going to do our very best to complete that \nbill and then move to Foreign Operations. I don't know how anyone can \nobject to the foreign operations matter because it is hundreds of \nmillions of dollars under what the President requested. It is something \nthat is extremely important. The President feels very strongly about \nthis legislation, and we should move forward on it.\n\n  Following that legislation, we are going to move to the \nreconciliation matter which deals with education. I told my friend, the \nsenior Senator from Kentucky, that we may have to work this weekend, or \npart of this weekend, the reason being, as I mentioned, we have two \nappropriations bills, and they should move quickly. We have a statutory \ntime on the reconciliation matter dealing with education.\n  Next week, everyone should understand we are going to have votes \nMonday morning--Monday morning. It is a very short week, and we are \ngoing to take up next week the Transportation appropriations bill. In \nlight of all the attention focused on the deteriorating infrastructure \nof this country, that is a very important piece of legislation, and we \nneed to complete it.\n  The Jewish holiday starts sundown on Wednesday. It was originally my \nintent to work until sundown on Wednesday, but a number of my Jewish \ncolleagues indicated they have to travel. Especially Senator Lieberman \nneeds to be in Connecticut prior to sundown. So we are going to \ncomplete our voting on Wednesday by 1 o'clock. We will work past that \ntime on matters perhaps, if we can complete the Transportation \nappropriations bill by that time, but we are going to stop voting \naround 1 o'clock on Wednesday.\n  Then, of course, we have other business to do. After that, we have to \nmove to the matter dealing with Iraq. We have Defense authorization. I \nhave spoken with my friend, the Republican leader, about different ways \nwe could set up moving forward on that legislation. We don't have \nanything determined yet, but we are trying to do that. My wish and my \ndesire is to move forward and have a number of votes set up so there \nare 50-vote margins. We will not ask for that now. I will give the \ndistinguished Republican leader adequate time so we can have a UC \ndealing with that matter.\n  I will, during the course of the speech I am going to give today in a \nfew minutes, Mr. President, ask unanimous consent that we can go to \nconference on SCHIP. I hope we can do that. I have again spoken with \nthe Republican leader about that matter.\n  Before I get into my remarks, I ask through the Chair if my friend \nhas anything he needs to know or maybe questions I can answer regarding \nthe schedule.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's call \nthis morning. He basically covered the items he has gone over. We will \nbe cooperating, to the maximum extent possible, to move forward with \nthe work in the Senate. I, such as he, will have an opening statement \nas we begin this session shortly after the majority leader completes \nhis statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11000-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JOHN WARNER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I begin my remarks on this fall calendar in \na position of wanting to get a lot of business done. But first I wish \nto make a few remarks about two of our most distinguished colleagues, \nSenator Warner of Virginia and Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts.\n  A few days ago, Senator Warner announced he will not seek reelection \nwhen his term ends, which is in 2008. John Warner's career in public \nservice began when he was 17 years of age when he enlisted in the U.S. \nNavy during World War II. He did not have to enlist. His father was a \ndistinguished physician in Virginia. He did it because it was the right \nthing to do.\n  After an honorable discharge, he, again feeling the call of duty, \ninterrupted his law school studies to join the Marine Corps during the \nKorean war. Keep in mind, both times, when he joined the Navy and then \nthe Marines, we were at war. During the Korean war, he rose to the rank \nof captain.\n  John Warner is a patriot. If you look up ``patriot'' and \n``patriotism'' in the dictionary, it says one who loves his country and \nsupports its interests. That is John Warner by definition.\n  When John Warner returned home after the Korean war, he was appointed \nUnder Secretary of the Navy and later became Secretary of the Navy \nbefore beginning his five terms in the Senate.\n  His work on the Armed Services Committee is certainly legend. His \nability to work with Senator Levin has been something I have watched \nand admired and many times complimented both of them for--their ability \nto work together, many times on issues that were very difficult to work \ntogether on. They always worked together, always looked out for each \nother.\n  In addition to the work he did on the Armed Services Committee, I \nwatched firsthand his brilliant work on the Intelligence Committee but \nvery firsthand his work on the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nFrom the time I came to the Senate, I worked with John Warner on that \ncommittee. I was chairman of that committee on two separate occasions. \nDuring the period of time I worked with Senator Warner, I was in the \nmajority, and other times he was in the majority. To John Warner, it \ndidn't matter.\n  I can remember the first big Transportation bill we did. We did one \nevery 5 years. What a great example he set for everybody as one of the \nsenior members of that committee. He worked with conservatives, he \nworked with liberals, he worked with Democrats, and he worked with \nRepublicans.\n  To show his ability to do the right thing, one needs look no further \nthan his own State of Virginia. There was a hotly contested race for \nthe Senate for the State of Virginia. John Warner supported the \nDemocratic candidate rather than the Republican candidate. That is the \nkind of person he is.\n  I have such great admiration for John Warner. He is, in my opinion, \nwhat a public servant should be. He is a gentleman and has served the \npeople of Virginia and our Nation with distinction for 30 years or \nmore. Senator Warner's impact on this institution will not be \nforgotten. I will sorely miss his warmth and friendship. My wife Landra \nand his wife Jeanne are friends. They have been working together. Every \nyear the Senate spouses have a First Lady's luncheon. Two years ago, my \nwife was chairperson of that. Last year, she was. They are good friends \nand we will miss them a lot. They are a wonderful couple. I have to say \nJohn Warner is top of the line. I have so much admiration for him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11000-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11000-S11001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SENATOR KENNEDY'S 15,000TH VOTE\n\n  Mr. REID. I also want to say a few words about another one of the \nSenate's most distinguished and legendary Senators, and that is Ted \nKennedy. The last day of our session was extremely frantic. We were \ntrying to do certain things. Well, we had a lot we were trying to get \nfinished, not the least of which was the domestic spying measure, which \nwas so intense. So we had a lot of votes during that week, and that day \nwe had votes, but in the rush to close the session a milestone occurred \nthat went unremarked and it should not have. But that is the way things \nare here in the Senate sometimes. Senator Kennedy cast his 15,000th \nvote--15,000 votes. He cast his 15,000th rollcall vote the day we \nadjourned for summer vacation.\n  There is very little I can say to fully honor Senator Kennedy for his \n45 years of Senate service. He has been someone whom I have followed so \nvery long. And to think that I have the opportunity to serve with one \nof the Kennedys is very important to me. My office, right across the \nhall here, has a letter I received in 1961. Senator Kennedy had not \nbeen inaugurated as yet, but he had been elected and he was working \nfrom where we have our Tuesday luncheons, the LBJ Room. That was his \noffice before he became President. He sent me a letter. I was at Utah \nState University and I formed the first Young Democrats Club in the \nhistory of the State. It might not sound like much, but to me it was \nimportant at the time and President Kennedy recognized that by writing \nme a letter.\n  I am so grateful for the service of the Kennedys and what they have \ndone for\n\n[[Page S11001]]\n\nour country. We have had two of Senator Kennedy's brothers who have \nbeen assassinated. He had a brother who was killed during World War II. \nSo Senator Kennedy deserves more attention than I have given him here \ntoday, but I have so much admiration and respect for him for what he \nhas done for me.\n  He has this great public persona, but for those of us who work with \nhim, he is a man with a lot of humility. He is always willing to step \nback into the shadows and let others get the attention. His record of \nspeaking for civil rights, education, working people, senior citizens, \nand people with disabilities is unparalleled. And as to his ability to \nwork together, no one can testify to that more than the current \nPresident Bush in the White House. The legislation President Bush has \nbeen fortunate enough to pass has been landmark legislation with which \nSenator Kennedy has helped him. So I value Senator Kennedy's wisdom and \nleadership and, most of all, his friendship, and certainly recognize \nand congratulate him on his 15,000th rollcall vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11001-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11001-S11002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PAST AND PRESENT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, August was a time for us to leave Washington \nfor a while, spend time listening to and reconnecting with our friends, \nneighbors, and constituents back home. Someone this morning on the \ntelephone asked me what I remember most about the August recess, and I \nsaid I think it is best represented in an extended conversation I had \nwith someone on the telephone at my home in Searchlight. You can look \nout my windows and see for miles. There is a range of mountains called \nTimber Mountains. They do not match the Rockies or the Sierras, but to \nme they are important. During the summertime, there are storms there \nall the time. They do not last very long, but they are beautiful to \nsee. I was telling my friend that is what I remember most, talking on \nthe telephone and trying to explain to my friend what I saw out there. \nWe call them cloudbursts. It rains so hard you can't see the mountains, \nand the lightning is coming frequently. It is beautiful to watch. It is \nwhat nature is all about, and that is what I remember most about my \ntrip home this August.\n  But it certainly was a chance for me, and for all of us, to ignore \nthe pundits and hear from the people of the State we represent. I \ntraveled this past month to many places in Nevada, and the message I \nheard was very clear: Nevadans want us to do something about the high \ncost of energy and start reversing the damage that nonrenewable fuels \nare causing our environment. They want us to help them find affordable \nhealth care solutions so low-income kids can get regular checkups, so \nsenior citizens can pay for their medicine, and everyone, rich or poor, \ncan afford health insurance. We are pushing 50 million people with no \nhealth insurance. They want us to fight the skyrocketing cost of a \ncollege education.\n  Above all, Nevadans want us to finally bring the war in Iraq to a \nresponsible end. They want us to take our brave troops out of another \ncountry's intractable civil war so we can rebuild and refocus our \nmilitary on the grave and growing challenges we face throughout the \nworld. These concerns are, of course, not unique to Nevada. I know my \ncolleagues are hearing the same warnings in every corner of our \ncountry, the same concerns I have heard and more. I want to share with \nmy friends in Nevada and all Americans that we hear you. We share your \nconcerns and your sense of urgency, and we are working every day to \nreach these goals.\n  When this new Congress began in January, we knew the challenges ahead \nof us, but the expectations were even greater than the challenges. We \nstarted the year with an ambitious agenda for introducing 10 bills on \nthe first day. Now, as we begin our busy fall calendar, we have made \nprogress on almost every one of those. Coming into the previous work \nperiod, we have already sent to the President the first raise in the \nFederal minimum wage in more than 10 years; the recommendations of the \n9/11 Commission, after having been pushed aside for years; the toughest \nethics and lobbying reform in history, which today is on its way to the \nPresident. We passed a bill to give the hope of stem cell research to \nmillions of Americans who suffer, and we will soon attempt once again \nto override the President's veto. We believe we are only one vote short \nof being able to override that veto.\n  We passed disaster relief for the gulf coast, western wildfires, and \nfarmers who have suffered drought and other disasters. We provided \nfunds for our troops and National Guard with the equipment they need, \nfor example, the Mine Resistant Combat Vehicles, to do their jobs more \nsafely. We passed a bill to finally hold the administration accountable \non Iraq with real benchmarks for progress.\n\n  We have been able to do a number of important things dealing with \nIraq, even with Senator Johnson ill. We were sometimes in a minority. \nOne of our colleagues, who is one of the most loyal Democrats we have \nand have ever had, our nominee for Vice President, the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, votes with the President \non the Iraq matters most every time, even though he votes with us on \neverything else. We were many times in the hole 49 to 50. So what we \nwere able to do was certainly very good. I applaud the few Republicans \nwho helped us. We were able to pass a bill to send to the President \nthat he had to veto.\n  We also passed a balanced budget which restores fiscal discipline and \ncuts taxes for working people. Of course, we wish we could have done \nmore in Iraq, but we did the best we could, with a pay raise and better \nhealth care for our troops, who are being asked to shoulder a larger \nburden than ever before.\n  This past work period we added to that list other accomplishments: \npassing the Energy bill, which included, among other things, raising \nCAFE standards, fuel efficiency, for the first time in 25 years. We \nhaven't sent that to the President yet because we need to work out our \ndifferences with the House.\n  We reauthorized the Higher Education Act to give Americans the \nlargest expansion of student financial aid since the GI bill. As I \nindicated in my opening statement, we are going to finish that this \nweek and send it on to the House.\n  Beginning debate on the Defense authorization bill on September 17, \nwe will make critical investments to address troop readiness problems \nin the military caused by what we believe is mismanagement of our Armed \nForces.\n  These legislative accomplishments will make a real difference for \nworking families, students, senior citizens, and those who protect us \nat home and abroad. Our progress makes one thing clear: when you put \npartisanship aside, we can do great things for the American people. But \nwhen partisanship divides us, our work suffers.\n  For all our success so far this year, we have done more than people \never expected. Now, we could have done a lot more than that, but \nRepublicans have sought to block our progress, it seems sometimes at \nall costs. We could have reduced the cost of prescription drugs, but \nRepublicans filibustered that. We could have passed comprehensive \nimmigration reform, but we only got 12 Republican votes. We could have \nensured our troops received sufficient rest and time home between \ndeployments--that was the Webb amendment--but once again we were \nblocked by most of the Republicans.\n  The minority has forced 42 cloture votes already this year, many on \nlegislation that wasn't even controversial. I hope the delay and \nstalling is in the past, and that the minority has proven they can make \nus go to cloture but it hasn't accomplished anything. I hope we can \nmove forward in a less burdensome manner.\n  Our progress has been in spite of those efforts. When we have worked \ntogether across the aisle, the record speaks for itself. We know it can \nbe done because we have done it already. Today, I reach out to my \nRepublican colleagues on every piece of legislation. I hope and expect \nthe minority will reciprocate so we can move beyond hyperpartisanship \nand obstruction to keep making the kind of progress the American people \ndeserve. We must do this because the issues we now confront deserve \nnothing less.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee has reported 11 of the 12 annual \nappropriations bills. We plan to devote\n\n[[Page S11002]]\n\nconsiderable time this work period to these bills. I have indicated we \nare going to do three before we take our break for the Jewish holidays. \nWe have already done Homeland Security appropriations. If we do that, \nwe would wind up doing a third of all the bills we need to do, which is \nprogress.\n  So in the next 2 weeks, it is my hope we can complete the bills I \nhave talked about. Each of these bills was reported out of the \ncommittee unanimously, or nearly unanimously, and I hope bipartisan \ncooperation continues on the floor.\n  We must move forward on a number of other issues. The Children's \nHealth Insurance Program is a bill that received wide bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate. I hope we can complete that. It is important \nthat we do that. I know just a few people can cause a lot of trouble \nhere. Both the distinguished Republican leader and I realize that.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 976\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives \na message from the House on H.R. 976, the CHIP legislation, the Senate \ndisagree to the House amendment, if appropriate, and insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses, and that the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the message has not yet been received; \ntherefore, the request is a little premature. We would need to consult \nwith our colleagues on this when they receive the request from the \nHouse; therefore, for the time being, I would object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, above all, every day we must continue to \nfight for a sensible, responsible path out of Iraq in order to restore \nAmerica's national security. Later this month, President Bush will \nissue a report on the state of the war that Congress required of him. \nWe hope he will use this report as an opportunity to finally do the \nright thing and begin to change the core U.S. mission and begin \nreducing U.S. forces in Iraq. We will receive this report with an open \nmind. We will consider the White House findings carefully and \nthoughtfully, but we must remember the President's report comes after \nmore than 4 years of war, with almost 3,800 dead American soldiers, \nsailors, marines, and airmen, tens of thousands more injured, and \nAmerican taxpayers having to foot a bill of more than half a trillion \ndollars.\n  President Bush will send General Petraeus to Capitol Hill to \ntestify. There is not one Member of this body who does not respect \nGeneral Petraeus. He is a good man and a good soldier. But Senator \nBiden said over the weekend that there are not 12 Senators out of 100 \nwho support the war as it is now being conducted--not 12. He said that \nover and over again. I agree with Senator Biden.\n\n  But the President cannot hide behind the generals. This is George \nBush's war. He is responsible for the mistakes and missteps that leave \nour troops mired in a civil war with no end in sight.\n  The mission has not been accomplished. When he said ``Bring 'em on,'' \nthat was the wrong thing to say. According to the President when he set \nforth his escalation policy, the purpose of the troop increase was to \ngive the Iraqis space and safety to forge political progress--to build \na sustainable government and provide for their own security.\n  None of this has happened. Take, for example, the LA Times today, the \nheadline: ``Troop Buildup Fails to Reconcile Iraq,'' or today's GAO \nreport, which tells us the President's strategy has failed to achieve \n15 of 18 key benchmarks. Sectarian strife is deepening and violence \nshifting. Last month was the deadliest for the Iraqi people in the \nhistory of the war. Contrary to the assertions of the President, Iraq's \nleaders have not honored the sacrifices of our troops by taking \nmeaningful steps toward building a country that can stand on its own. \nThat is not our troops' fault, nor is it a problem our troops can \nsolve. It is an Iraqi political problem, not a U.S. military problem. \nWe cannot continue to sacrifice American lives, deplete our Treasury, \nand weaken our national security in pursuit of a goal that the Iraqi \npeople themselves show no interest in achieving.\n  Meanwhile, al-Qaida is resurgent, and we all know Osama bin Laden \nremains at large. There are countless stories that highlight the human \ntoll this war has taken. Let's look to Nevada for one.\n  As I was flying back, I was stunned by reading in the Las Vegas Sun \nnewspaper a heartbreaking story of Army PFC Travis Virgadamo, 19 years \nold, in his second tour of duty in Iraq. He loved his country. He loved \nserving in the military. That is what he always wanted to do. Yet after \nmonths of serving in Iraq, as he described it, ``being ordered into \nhouses without knowing what was behind strangers' doors, walking along \non roadsides fearing the next step could trigger lethal explosives''--\nthose were his words--he left. He tried to get help. He came back, told \nhis parents he did not want to go back. He told his military superiors \nhe didn't want to go back. He was given medicine. The newspaper \nreported it was Prozac. As I said, he sought therapy, mental health \ncare while overseas, but last week the military informed his family he \ncommitted suicide. He was 19 years old.\n  Last year, the Veterans Affairs Department reported that more than \n56,000 veterans of Iraq have been diagnosed with mental illness. We \nhave heard countless examples of our troops receiving inadequate mental \nhealth care, and in many cases being sent back into battle, like this \nyoung man, PFC Travis Virgadamo.\n  My heart goes out to his family. They are quoted in the paper, as to \nwhat he said when he was trying to stay here and not go back. They have \nsuffered so much. We owe them a change of course.\n  Many of my Republican friends have long held September is the month \nfor a policy change in Iraq. Those who opposed our early efforts asked \nfor time and patience to let the war continue. The calendar has not \nchanged. It is September. We have reached this goal. It is time to make \na decision. We can't continue the way we are. We cannot afford it \nmilitarily and financially.\n  We will soon hear, as I have indicated, from the President and his \ngenerals what we know already, political progress has failed. Now it is \ntime for our Republican colleagues--I so admire and appreciate those \nwho have joined us in the past. For example, on the Webb amendment we \ngot 57 votes. With Senator Johnson coming back we need two more \nRepublican votes to do the right thing: When you go to Iraq for 15 \nmonths, you stay home for 15 months. That is what Webb did. That is why \nwe picked up Republican votes. We need two more Republican votes.\n  It is time for our Republican colleagues to join with us, to stand \nfor our troops and the American people to responsibly end this war; to \ndo things that will change it.\n  I began with words of tribute for two of our most distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Warner and Kennedy, one Democrat, one Republican, \nboth firmly committed to progress, progress for our country. They \nrecognize and they have shown it can only be accomplished by \nbipartisanship. All of us appreciate the Herculean efforts of Senator \nKennedy, working with Democrats and Republicans alike on immigration, \nLeave No Child Behind, and Medicare. The work that Senator Warner has \ndone for years, especially on the Defense authorization bill, on a \nbipartizan basis--I appreciate it; many of us do. The country \nappreciates it. The people of Virginia appreciate Senator Warner's \ncourage to stand up to the President of his own party and reach across \nthe aisle to reach a responsible end to this war. As we tackle the \nchallenges ahead, the outstanding work of these two great Senators \nought to be our compass.\n  I am confident and hopeful all 100 of us will follow their lead and \nkeep America moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11002-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11002-S11003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

He came to the Senate at age 30. He \nhas been here quite a while and made an enormous contribution to our \ncountry. We congratulate him on achieving this milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11003-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11003-S11004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETURN FROM THE AUGUST RECESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as we resume our business here in the \nSenate, we do so in the hope that we have learned some lessons over the \nlast 8 months. The chief lesson we should have learned, in my view, is \nthat the culture of the endless campaign may win headlines, but it \ndoesn't win much beyond that.\n  None of us is so naive as to think that the life of an elected \npolitician doesn't involve politics--obviously it does. But we also \nknow that making laws often demands leaving the politics aside. The \nbitter debates over the war in Iraq and a thin list of significant \nlegislative achievements so far in the 110th Congress are all the proof \nof that we need.\n  That's the lesson of the last 8 months--that if we expect to \naccomplish anything here we need to lower the political temperature. \nAnd it is urgent as we return here today that we do just that.\n  Cooperation is as important on routine business as it is on \ncontentious things. We are now just 4 weeks away from the beginning of \nthe new fiscal year, and we have not sent a single one of the twelve \nannual appropriations bills to the President's desk. This almost \ncertainly means we will soon be looking at an appropriations train \nwreck here in the next few weeks, followed by a continuing resolution \nto keep the Government running.\n  This isn't the way it's supposed to be. Indeed, it was not all that \nlong ago that Democrats themselves were denouncing Republicans for \ndoing this very thing.\n  Faced with the same situation last year, the current assistant \nmajority leader railed against the notion of a continuing resolution, \naccusing Republicans, as he put it, ``of failing to do the most \nfundamental job Congress is expected to do.'' I think the assistant \nmajority leader had that right. He said that calling the 109th Congress \na do-nothing Congress would be an insult to the original do-nothing \nCongress of 1948. And he vowed to finish the unfinished business of the \nlast Congress.\n  Yet now, as Democrats enter the ninth month poised to make the very \nsame mistake we did, we have not heard a note of self-criticism from \nthe other side. This kind of selective criticism might work on the \ncampaign trail. But it's a clear recipe for frustration and defeat in \nthe Senate. We need to get these bills passed and over to the \nPresident's desk for a signature. And relentless partisanship is not \ngoing to do that.\n  The most heated politics have been reserved, of course, for the war. \nSo if we are going to correct course, we will need to start there. The \nCongress voted in May to have General Petraeus report back this month \non progress in Iraq, and the Congress should listen to what he says, \nwithout prejudice, when he gets here.\n  This is not a baseless hope. We have seen some of the sharpest early \ncritics of the general's new military strategy defending it in recent \nweeks after seeing for themselves the impact it has had in former al-\nQaida strongholds like Anbar Province.\n  Republicans welcome this kind of honest reassessment. As more \nDemocrats have the courage to acknowledge the good news as well as the \nbad news in Iraq, we all have reason to hope for the kind of \ncooperative legislative strategy that has been lacking until now.\n  The political path the majority has often chosen over the last 8 \nmonths has reduced us at times to theatrics on the war. It has left us \nscrambling on appropriations. And it threatens to prevent us from \naddressing a number of other vital issues that the American people \ndon't want us to put off. We need to act, cooperatively, before it is \ntoo late to address these issues within the limited time we have.\n  Time is short, and the list is long. We need to act on a farm bill by \nthe end of the month. We need to act on vital free trade agreements and \non the debt limit ceiling, which we will reach sometime in early \nOctober. We need to extend the FISA legislation.\n  More than 40 tax provisions expire at the end of this year. We need \nto extend them before it is too late, and we can only do it if we \nresist calls to pay for them with equally unpopular offsets.\n  The other side tends to look at the budget in terms of Newtonian \nphysics: They think every cut calls for an equal and opposite hike. Yet \nwe have seen that this is not the case, with money now flooding into \nthe Treasury at record rates since the 2001 and 2003 cuts. We should \nacknowledge the facts and continue this prosperity without imposing new \npain on taxpayers who responded to this relief by growing this economy.\n  The current alternative minimum tax relief is current no more--it \nexpired at the end of last year. In the last three Congresses, we \nextended this relief before the Fourth of July recess so taxpayers knew \nwith certainty the relief would be there. Yet here we stand, after the \nAugust recess, with no sign of any effort to extend it again--no bill \nreported by committee, not even a markup scheduled.\n  Unless this relief is extended, 20 million new taxpayers will face \nthis punishing tax when they file their returns next year. They need to \nknow if Democrats are going to make good on their promise to let all \nthe provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax bills expire. We are willing to \nwork together on this issue, but again, cooperation will mean resisting \ncalls for draconian tax increases to provide relief from a tax which \nwas never intended to affect so many families.\n  The Senate will soon be asked to confirm a new Attorney General. Some \nMembers of this body will be tempted to turn the confirmation process \ninto another occasion for seeking political advantage. Democrats have \nrightly noted that the Justice Department's work is too important to \nlanguish without leadership at the top.\n  And they have promised that if the President's nominee puts the rule \nof law first, they will avoid confrontation. They will prove they mean \nit by not looking to secure commitments from the nominee as a condition \nof his or her confirmation, other than that he or she will faithfully \nenforce the law.\n  Attempts to exact political promises and precommitments would be \ninconsistent with the goal of restoring the Justice Department to full \nstrength as quickly as possible.\n  Nor should the confirmation of a new Attorney General be used as an \nexcuse to slow down circuit court nominations, starting with Judge \nLeslie Southwick.\n  The average number of circuit court confirmations during the final 2 \nyears of similarly situated presidencies is 17. We have fallen off pace \nto approximate that standard.\n  At this point, the Senate has only confirmed three circuit court \nnominees--three. The Senate can begin to make much needed progress in \nthis area by confirming Judge Southwick. The Judiciary Committee voted \nto send his nomination to the Senate before we broke for recess and he \ndeserves a vote and he deserves it soon.\n  In my view, the Democratic majority has wasted too much time in the \nfirst months of this session playing politics instead of legislating. \nThe working days we have left in this session are too few to be \nsquandered. We need to put aside the political path and come\n\n[[Page S11004]]\n\ntogether to get some work done. The clock is ticking. It is getting \nlate. But it is not too late. There is no better time to shift course \nthan now.\n  The political path has been perhaps most in evidence on many of the \nIraq votes we have had. More of the same will only delay the \ncooperative work we need to create a policy aimed at protecting \nAmerica's vital long- and short-term security interests in the Persian \nGulf and Iraq.\n  A good first step away from the political path would be to get the \nDefense appropriations bill to the floor of the Senate in the next week \nor two and get funding to our forces in the field. Appropriations \nshould be an urgent priority for us, as Democrats insisted when they \nwere in the minority. Republicans are ready to start fresh, to begin \nagain, in order to get many important and necessary things accomplished \nin the coming days and weeks. We will call on our friends on the other \nside to do the same.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11004-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11004-S11005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SENATOR WARNER\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, last Friday the senior Senator from \nVirginia announced that he would not seek reelection to the Senate. I \nspeak today, therefore, in tribute to Senator John Warner.\n  I have known John Warner for nearly 30 years. In 1978, the people of \nMontana and Virginia sent us both to the Senate for the first time. I \nthank the people of Montana and Virginia for giving me the opportunity \nto serve with John Warner. The election of 1978 brought 20 new Senators \nto the Senate. From that class, many Senators moved on to other \npursuits: Bill Armstrong, David Boren, Rudy Boschwitz, Bill Bradley, \nBill Cohen, David Durenberger, Gordon Humphrey, Roger Jepsen, Nancy \nLandon Kassebaum, Larry Pressler, David Pryor, Alan Simpson, Donald \nStewart.\n  From that class, three have gone to their final rest. We all recall \nthe memory of colleagues now departed: Jim Exon, Howell Heflin, Paul \nTsongas. May their memories serve as a blessing.\n  From that class, four remain in the Senate: Thad Cochran, Carl Levin, \nthis Senator, and John Warner.\n  As a young man, John Warner fought forest fires in Montana. Very \noften when I am talking to John, he recalls those times in Montana. His \neyes brighten up. He very much reminisces about how much he enjoyed \nspending time in the State. Whether it was fighting fires or whether it \nwas around Bozeman, MT, it comes to him very clearly when he talks \nabout Montana in his early years.\n  At the age of 17, John Warner joined the Navy to fight in World War \nII, part of the ``greatest generation.'' John Warner is one of five \nWorld War II vets left in the Senate. He shares that distinction with \nDanny Akaka, Danny Inouye, Frank Lautenberg, and Ted Stevens.\n  John Warner went to college on the GI bill. Then he entered the \nUniversity of Virginia law school. But when the Korean war broke out, \nJohn Warner, with his intense sense of patriotism, interrupted law \nschool to fight for his country again. This time he served as an \nofficer in the Marine Corps.\n  After returning from Korea, John Warner finished law school, clerked \non the court of appeals, worked as an assistant U.S. attorney and \nworked as a lawyer in private practice. He returned to public service \nin 1969 as Under Secretary of the Navy. Then, in 1972, he succeeded our \nformer colleague, John Chafee, as Secretary of the Navy. He represented \nthe Defense Department at the Law of the Sea talks in Geneva.\n  In the Senate, John Warner has served as chairman of the Rules \nCommittee. He has served as chairman and ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee. He has come to be known as one of the Congress's \nmost influential voices on matters of national defense.\n  But I have come to know John Warner on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. John Warner and I have worked together on that \ncommittee for more than 20 years. I joined the committee in 1981 and \nJohn joined in 1987. There, for most of that time, both of us have \nworked together as chairman and ranking minority member of one \nsubcommittee or another.\n  We worked together on transportation bills. Those are the bills with \nsuch colorful names as ISTEA, TEA-21, SAFET-LU. For a while, we were \nchairman and ranking minority member of the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Subcommittee. We worked on at least four renewals of the \nWater Resources Development Act.\n\n  I remember fondly working closely with John on the transportation \nlegislation in 1997 and 1998, TEA-21. We worked with our late \ncolleague, John Chafee. The three of us were a wonderful team. You will \nnot believe the chemistry with which the three of us worked together. \nWe decided early on we would stick together as a team: John Warner, \nbasically the Southern donor States; John Chafee, basically the New \nEngland States; and I, representing in some sense the Western donee \nStates. We represented the three major components who put together the \nTransportation bill.\n  We stuck together. We worked together. I mean we worked together. \nThere is a lot of talk about we needing less partisanship around here. \nI have to tell you, John Warner, John Chafee and I, we sat down and \nworked things out. We had a terrific staff working for us, John, \nmyself, and John Chafee. We were all together in John Chafee's office, \nsometimes in John Warner's office, deciding what was best on how to get \na highway bill together.\n  It was a wonderful opportunity working in that office, working \ntogether. There were countless long days, many very long nights. You \nlearn a lot about a person when things get tough, when the rubber meets \nthe road. But I have to tell you, in our case, when anything was a \nlittle bit difficult, we did not ever get personal, did not get upset, \ndid not ever attribute ulterior motives to anybody; we decided we were \ngoing to figure out how to get it done.\n  As I said earlier, there was a certain chemistry that came together \nwith all six of us working together, my staff, his staff, their staffs, \nand the six of us all together. It was wonderful.\n  I think I learned a lot from watching John Warner and John Chafee, \ntoo, for that matter. They were two of the same. They both served as \nmarines, and they both were Secretaries of the Navy. But John Warner \nwas a person who listens. He sat there and listened; I had a point; \nJohn Chafee had a point. In other negotiations I have been in where \nJohn Warner has been there, John Warner is going to listen. John Warner \nwill listen and say: ``Okay, that is interesting. Let's see how we can \nmake that work.'' I might say also he is a very skilled statesman in \nthat he cut to the core of matters pretty quickly.\n  Not a lot of fuss or muss, never got wrapped around the axle in \ndetails, when things kind of got off tangent in the wrong direction, \nbut got to the core of the matter. He came to the core of the matter. \nHe would sum it all up in a very wonderful, sort of statesmanlike, \nsolid way, as only John can. We all sat there saying, ``Yes, that is \nabout it. That is right.'' That is kind of what John said. ``That is \nprobably right. We will go on from there.'' I learned a lot from John \nWarner. I hope I can use that in later years.\n  Both leaders spoke about how John Warner is not partisan, and it is \ntrue. I hope, frankly, that as we finish this year and next year, a lot \nof us remember the tone and the style with which John Warner conducts \nhimself.\n  It is also very important to mention John Warner spoke up \ncourageously in the State of Virginia; he did not support his party's \nnominee for the Senate. That was a gutsy thing to do, but he did it in \na very civil way, not in a negative way, not in a partisan way. He \nspoke his mind about what was right. It was very courageous and also \nthe tone made his message and his belief that much more important \nbecause people saw he was not personal, people saw he meant it, people \nsaw he was courageous and he was doing what he thought was the right \nthing to do.\n  The same is true with respect to Senator Warner's decision about the \nwar in Iraq. It is not the party line, John's statements. He is saying \nwhat he thinks is right. He is saying what he thinks is the right thing \nto do. It is not partisan. It is courageous and said in a very civil \ntone.\n  That is why people have called him a consensus builder. It is why \npeople\n\n[[Page S11005]]\n\noften say he has a potential for bipartisan collaboration. I stand here \nsaying I appreciate John Warner. When I got the news he was not going \nto seek reelection, I thought to myself this institution will be losing \na great man. He is a wonderful person.\n  I hope all of us, when we finish these next 15 months or so working \nwith John, thank John for what he is and also use John as a kind of \npoint of departure, saying: ``I wish to be more like John Warner. I \nwish to do what is right; I wish to be courageous; I wish to be civil; \nand I wish to do what people of our States ask us to do.'' I salute \nJohn Warner.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11005-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               LABOR DAY\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, yesterday Americans of all ages, from all \nsegments of society, from hundreds of occupations and professions, \ncelebrated something uniquely American: Labor Day.\n  Our workers, tens of millions of hourly wage earners and hundreds of \nthousands of entrepreneurs, farmers and managers, tradesmen and \nsaleswomen, our workers have built a middle class larger, broader, and \nmore prosperous than any in world history.\n  They all have one thing in common: They are increasedly more \nproductive, creating greater wealth and larger profits than ever for \ntheir employers. Yesterday, the Columbus Dispatch reported that \naccording to the International Labor Organization, American workers are \nthe most productive in the world.\n  The average U.S. worker produces more than $63,885 of wealth each \nyear. But increasingly, American workers have not shared in the wealth \nthey have created, in wages, in health benefits, in a meaningful \npension, that highly productive workers in our country used to enjoy.\n  Ohio workers are fighting back to build a decent standard of living \nto provide opportunities for our children and to construct a more \nprosperous and egalitarian society.\n  But our Nation and my State have struggled; struggled in part because \nof the Federal Government's wrongheaded trade policy and tax policies, \nwhich all too often encourage investors to move jobs overseas, and in \npart because of a drifting State Government in Columbus which fell \nshort in educating our young people and did little to erect a \nmanufacturing policy to prepare for our future.\n  In the spirit of Labor Day, let me share the stories of a handful of \nhard-working often heroic Ohio workers who are making a difference. Dee \nDee Tillman and Carlos Sanchez participated in the negotiations \nrepresenting 1,200 janitors in Cincinnati, 1,200 men and women who are \nworking hard, raising their children, contributing to their community, \nand earning not much more than the minimum wage.\n  Joined by their colleagues, they and their union reached an agreement \nwith Cincinnati office building owners. Over the next 4 years, 1,200 \njanitors in Cincinnati will get a $2.95-an-hour raise, health benefits \nand vacation pay for the first time and a small pension.\n  At the other end of the State, in Mentor, Roger Sustar speaks out \nevery day for American manufacturing. He recognizes businesses similar \nto his, small manufacturing companies, are vital to the economic \nsecurity and the national security for our country.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to eulogize a \nfriend and a former member of the Senate family, Kent Shearer, who died \non August 23.\n  Kent Shearer and I were boyhood friends from our early days in \nRussell, KS, when we were debaters at the high school. Kent was a great \nintellect. At the time when his colleagues were playing marbles, Kent \nwas studying and talking about the Peloponnesian wars. During our high \nschool days, Kent and I were colleagues in our freshman year debating \nthe subject on the negative: resolved that individual income should be \nlimited to $25,000 annually. Shows you how times have changed.\n  Kent and I were on two high school debating teams which won the State \nchampionship. In 1945, Russell was a small school with fewer than 400 \nstudents. We competed with schools our size, then moved the next year \nto the big-school category, where high schools had several thousand \nstudents across Kansas, finished in second place, and lost by a \nspeaker's ballot. Then, in 1947, we were on the team that won the State \nAA championship with the big schools.\n  Kent was the outstanding debater in Russell High. He won the Kiwanis \naward, went on to the University of Kansas, where he was Phi Beta \nKappa, was the winner of the Perdue National Invitational Debate \nTournament, competed in the West Point National Tournament, served then \nin the Judge Advocate General's office, and settled in Salt Lake City, \nUT in 1958, until 1997, when Alice, his wife, passed away, and he then \nmoved to Portland, OR.\n  A few years back, Kent came to join me, working on the Senate staff. \nHe worked for 3 months. It was an honor and a pleasure to have my \nlongstanding friend Kent Shearer work with me in the Senate. He brought \na level of legal insights and erudition which was rare for a Senate \nstaffer. But then Kent himself might have been a Senator had his career \npath taken one different shift. That was in 1994, in January, when the \nstaff was being organized on the President's Commission to investigate \nthe assassination of President Kennedy, commonly known as the Warren \nCommission. We had one spot left among the young lawyers on the staff. \nThe Commission was recruiting lawyers from all over the country in \norder to avoid having the Washington establishment conduct the \ninvestigation out of concern that there might be some thought of a \ncoverup if the same crowd in Washington did the investigation. There \nwas concern about the integrity of Washington then as now. The staff \nwas recruited from all over the country. We had lawyers from Des Moines \nand Denver and Cleveland, Philadelphia, New York, Los Angeles. I called \nup Kent and urged him to apply for the position. Unfortunately, he \ncouldn't do so because of his own career plans at that time. I think \nhad Kent accepted a position as assistant counsel to the Warren \nCommission and come to Washington, his career might have been parallel \nto mine.\n  Kent was active in Utah politics, was chairman of the State \ncommittee, was instrumental in the campaigns of Senator Garn and \nSenator Hatch and\n\n[[Page S11006]]\n\nworked for Senator Bennett's father, also a Senator. He worked with \nSenator Robert Bennett, very close to the political establishment of \nthe State of Utah, a friend to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, Michael Leavitt, and would have been well suited for the U.S. \nSenate. Had Kent come to the Senate, we would have had three Senators \nfrom Russell, KS, since Senator Dole's hometown is Russell, while I was \nborn in Wichita and moved to Russell at the age of 12. Kent would have \nfit in this establishment very well. He would have been a credit to the \nSenate.\n  On August 30, Steve Mills, who was also Kent's colleague for the \ndebate tournaments, and I went to Salt Lake City to participate in \nKent's funeral services. He was a great American. He had a knack for \nwriting, contributed extensively to the newspaper in Washington on \ncolumns. He was a brilliant man, an outstanding lawyer, and a really \ngreat American.\n  I have taken a few moments today to eulogize him because his record \nis worth noting for the permanent record in our Congressional Record, \nespecially since he was a member of the Senate family, even though for \nonly a 3-month period.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following obituary printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Kent Shearer\n\n       Kent Shearer, 1929-2007. Kent Shearer, age 77, died \n     peacefully August 23, 2007, in Portland, Oregon. Kent was \n     born October 5, 1929 in Ellsworth, Kansas to William Shearer \n     and Agnes (Phillips) Shearer and was married to Alice Neff in \n     Russell, Kansas; January 25, 1952. Preceded in death by wife, \n     Alice and daughter Lorraine (Lori). Survived by son Edward \n     (Bo) and his wife Renee Montmorency, grandsons Samuel and \n     Beau of Portland, Oregon and sister Jane Shearer of Kansas \n     City, Kansas. Kent graduated from Russell High School in \n     Russell, Kansas with honors. He participated in the debate, \n     drama, and forensics program and won two State Championships \n     in debate. He attended Kansas University and earned a degree \n     from the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences with Phi Beta \n     Kappa honors. He continued with debate on the KU varsity \n     team, winning many individual tournaments across the country, \n     including the National Invitational Tournament and twice \n     being invited to participate in the West Point Nationals. In \n     1954, Kent received his law degree from Kansas University and \n     entered the Army Judge Advocates Corps where he served until \n     1957. Kent and Alice made their home in Utah from 1958 until \n     Alice's death in 1997. Although a lawyer by trade, Kent's \n     passion throughout his life was Utah politics and the \n     Republican Party. He was an active organizer of the Salt Lake \n     County and Utah Young Republicans during the 1960s and 1970s \n     and served as the Utah State GOP Chairman from 1971 to 1973. \n     Kent was a key behind-the-scenes member of many political \n     organizations and campaigns (including Alice's political \n     career as a Salt Lake City Council member). He penned a much \n     discussed and anticipated column in The Enterprise Newspaper \n     on a wide range of topics for over 30 years. After Alice's \n     death in 1997, Kent moved to Portland, Oregon to be close to \n     his son's family. He pursued an intellectual retirement, \n     spending his time reading, writing and providing all the \n     answers to his grandsons' many questions. Kent's \n     accomplishments were many. However, all pale in the light of \n     his sharp mind and quick wit, his basic sense of decency and \n     the many people he touched throughout his life. He will be \n     missed by all who knew him. Funeral services will be held at \n     St. Marks Cathedral, 231 East 100 South, Salt Lake City on \n     Thursday, August 30, 2007 at 1 p.m. Following the service, a \n     reception in Kent's honor will be held at the Alta Club, 100 \n     E. South Temple, Salt Lake City.

Mr. President, I seek to pay tribute to an outstanding \neducator. As the Senate takes up the appropriations bills--it soon will \ntake up the bill on funding for education--it is appropriate to focus \non the importance of education in our society.\n  My brother, my two sisters, and I have been able to share in the \nAmerican dream because of our educational opportunities. My father had \nno formal education. My mother only went to the eighth grade, when she \nhad to leave work to help support her family where her father had died \nin his mid-40s of a heart attack. But because of their love for \neducation and recognition of its importance, their children have \nbenefited from great educational opportunities.\n  Our health is our No. 1 capital asset. Without good health, none of \nus can do anything. And our No. 2 capital asset is education. Without \neducation, there are severe limitations. I say this in the context of \npaying tribute to Ada Mae Groetzinger Haury, the Russell High School \ndebate coach.\n  She came to Russell in the fall of 1945, in her early 20s, having \nrecently graduated from college herself. She brought a level of \nintensity to high school debating, which level of intensity was \nunparalleled in my educational experience. We had a class in debate at \n9 o'clock in the morning. Then she would sit at 4 o'clock and have \nanother round of debate, again at 5, again at 7, and again at 8 \no'clock. And she would judge the debates. In retrospect, it seems \nsurprising that somebody would have done that. Each member of the \ndebating team debated twice in 1 day, once in the class at 9 and once \nin the other lines.\n  The analytical process in working through the debate topics--one of \nwhich was national health insurance, another of which was lowering the \nvoting age to 18--was great for high school students. Our high school \ncoach, Ms. Groetzinger, emphasized a smooth delivery. If anybody \nfaltered during the course of a 10-minute speech or a 5-minute \nrebuttal, that individual was likely to be rated fourth. She rated \neverybody on every day of the debates.\n  It was not only the first team which excelled, but it was the second \nteam which also excelled. We went to one tournament at Salina High \nSchool, a town about 70 miles east of Russell, and the second team did \nbetter in the preliminary rounds than the first team. The second team \nadvanced to the semifinals, and the first team, which I was on, sat and \nwatched the proceedings because they had done better than the first \nteam.\n\n  One year everybody on the debating team went through one tournament \nundefeated. So it was a very remarkable background in analysis, in \norganization, in extemporaneous speaking, and very good training for \nthe practice of being a trial lawyer, very good training for being a \nSenator, very good training for the questioning which we do in the \nvarious committees where we serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11006-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11006-S11007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO TOM KELLY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. When Ada Mae Groetzinger left Russell High in the spring \nof 1946, Tom Kelly became the debate coach. Tom Kelly had not had \nexperience as a debate coach. He was the drama coach. He directed the \nschool plays ``Lost Horizon'' and ``Nothing But The Truth,'' and was \nvery adept at that. But having inherited an extraordinary group of high \nschool debaters, Tom Kelly was our coach when we won the State AA \nchampionship in the spring of 1947.\n  With the experience he gained at Russell High School, he then went on \nto Hutchinson Junior College, where he won national championships and \nwas an outstanding teacher in his own right.\n  He gave two lectures to us which have carried forth with me to this \nday. Every Friday, when we would prepare to go to a debate tournament, \nMr. Kelly would organize the students and start to tell us about the \nforthcoming trip. His slogan was ``Don't choke up in the clutch.'' That \nmeans: Don't get too nervous to do your job. ``Don't choke up in the \nclutch.'' We would go to the tournament, characteristically come back \nhaving won the tournament, and on Monday he would again address the \nhigh school debaters and say: ``Don't rest on your laurels.'' Those \nwere Tom Kelly's words, which have carried through to this day.\n  I made these comments and was reminded of the outstanding educational \nexperience from those two high school debate coaches as I reflected on \nthe events going to Salt Lake City for Kent Shearer's funeral. This \npast May, over the Memorial Day recess, Kent Shearer, Steve Mills, Gene \nBalloun, and I--the four debaters on the high school team--paid a visit \nto Ada Mae Groetzinger, who is since married and is now Ada Mae \nGroetzinger Haury, in her retirement home in Newton, KS.\n  It was a good event to have the four of us get together. At that \ntime, Kent was not feeling well. He suffered from emphysema. It was a \ngood occasion for the group to get together with our high\n\n[[Page S11007]]\n\nschool coach just a few months before Kent passed away.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11007-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11007-S11009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nFOREIGN TRAVEL TO UNITED KINGDOM, FINLAND, RUSSIA, TURKEY, POLAND, AND \n                                 FRANCE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, during the last 2 weeks of August, I had \noccasion to travel to Europe to discuss with a variety of foreign \nleaders subjects of mutual concern. The highlight of the trip was \nvisiting the museum in Warsaw on the Jewish uprising, which occurred on \nAugust 1, 1944. That was a time when the Allies were making substantial \nprogress, with the invasion of Normandy having occurred on June 6, \n1944. The Soviets were coming in from the east, and the uprising was a \nvaliant, heroic effort by the Jews in the Jewish ghetto to upset the \nNazi tyranny. Regrettably, it failed.\n  But for anyone who has any doubt about the Holocaust or about the \nbrutality of the Nazis in putting down the Jewish people, the 6 million \nJews who died--and you have preposterous statements coming forth with \nsome regularity, most recently from the President of Iran, doubting the \nexistence of the Holocaust--a visit to the museum in Warsaw on the \nJewish uprising will certainly quell any doubts.\n  The facts are established there, with the documentation, with people \nspeaking, those who survived, to tell the grim tale of the Nazi \nbrutality and the existence of the Holocaust.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my \nreport be printed in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n Report on Foreign Travel to United Kingdom, Finland, Russia, Turkey, \n                 Poland, and France, August 18-29, 2007\n\n       Mr. President, I have sought recognition to report on \n     foreign travel, as is my custom, I made to England, Finland, \n     Russia, Turkey, Poland, and France from August 18 to August \n     29, 2007. I was joined by my wife Joan, my aide John Myers, \n     Major Benjamin M. Venning, United States Marine Corps, and \n     Commander John Clayton, United States Navy.\n\n\n                             united kingdom\n\n       On August 18, we departed Newark Liberty International \n     Airport, Newark, New Jersey. Our first stop was in London, \n     England, where we landed at Heathrow International Airport \n     after a flight of just over 6 hours. Upon arriving in London, \n     we were greeted by Richard Bell, First Secretary, U.S. \n     Embassy, London.\n       Mr. Bell briefed me on a number of important issues ongoing \n     in the United Kingdom and with new Prime Minister Gordon \n     Brown. Terrorism is the large problem in the U.K. and is \n     becoming more complex as terrorist threats are now \n     increasingly coming from their own citizens. Further, many \n     Britons have a negative perception of the United States due \n     to the war in Iraq and the continued detainment of \n     individuals in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n       After a brief overnight stay, we traveled to Helsinki, \n     Finland.\n\n\n                                finland\n\n       Upon arriving in Helsinki on August 19, we were greeted by \n     Ambassador Marilyn Ware and Greg Thome, Political Section, \n     United States Embassy Finland.\n       We had lunch with Ambassador Ware, originally of Lancaster, \n     Pennsylvania, at which I was briefed on a number of issues. \n     First, we discussed the recent disagreement between Estonia \n     and Russia, in which Estonia moved a statue honoring Russian \n     soldiers who died in World War II from a park to a military \n     cemetery. Russians were not pleased by this action and the \n     Russian government reportedly ignored the harassment of \n     Estonian officials in Russia. Finland played a leading role \n     in gathering European Union support for Estonia regarding \n     this matter. The Finnish effort resulted in a statement from \n     the European Union in support of Estonia's action.\n       Secondly, we discussed Ambassador Ware's efforts to improve \n     the energy diversity in Finland and surrounding areas. She is \n     working to organize a symposium with regional energy \n     officials to improve energy development in Finland.\n       We then discussed Finnish efforts to take a greater role in \n     NATO and the United Nations. While Finland is not a member of \n     NATO, it is a preferred partner. Currently, there are 240 \n     troops serving in Lebanon, 105 in Afghanistan, 450 in Kosovo, \n     and 80 in Bosnia. There is a great sense of pride in Finland \n     that they are playing an important role in problem areas \n     around the world.\n       Following the briefing, I headed with Ambassador Ware to \n     the Parliament Building to meet with Speaker of Parliament \n     Sauli Niinisto. We discussed the prospect of Finland becoming \n     a member of NATO, to which the Prime Minister believed that \n     more time would be needed if such a thing were to happen. As \n     Finland shares a large border with Russia, there is great \n     hesitation to taking an action which Russia opposes. However, \n     there is a strong desire for Finland to continue as a \n     preferred partner in NATO and to increase their role in NATO \n     Rapid Forces.\n       Speaker Niinisto also noted concern among some Finnish \n     people about the war in Iraq. He suggested that it would have \n     been wiser to have the United Nations more involved after \n     Saddam Hussein was removed from power. I noted that I do not \n     believe that the United States would have received that \n     support from the United Nations. Though if there had been \n     better intelligence on weapons of mass destruction, we might \n     not have gone into Iraq.\n       That evening, I had dinner with Prime Minister Matti \n     Vanhanen at his home on the Baltic Sea. We were joined by \n     Ambassador Ware, State Secretary Risto Volanen and European \n     Union Affairs Advisor Riina Nevamaki. We discussed a number \n     of important topics. The Prime Minister offered hope that the \n     United States could remove troops from Iraq, though he would \n     not suggest a timetable for doing so. He also offered support \n     for Turkey entering the European Union, stating that doing so \n     would bind the Turkish people to Democratic values. However, \n     Turkey faces obstacles to becoming part of the European \n     Union; specifically they must address concerns regarding \n     human rights and freedom of the press. I was interested to \n     learn that Prime Minister Vanhanen also serves on his city \n     council in his home city of Nurmiyarvi.\n       We also discussed John Morton, a great Pennsylvanian of \n     Finnish descent. A member of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court \n     and Delegate to the Continental Congress, John Morton cast \n     the deciding vote in favor of the United States Declaration \n     of Independence. This important figure in American history \n     provides an excellent example of the importance of Finns in \n     America.\n       On Monday, August 20, we attended a breakfast hosted by \n     U.S. Ambassador Ware at her residence. The breakfast was \n     attended by a distinguished group of individuals including \n     Minister of Justice Tuija Brax, Chief Justice of the Supreme \n     Court Pauliine Koskelo, Kimmo Sasi, Chairman of the \n     Parliament's Constitutional Law Committee, and Pertti \n     Salolainan, Chairman of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs \n     Committee. I was interested to learn that the judicial system \n     in Finland is a non-political system and there are far less \n     ideological conflicts than in the United States. We also \n     discussed the need for the United States to be more engaged \n     in the Middle East and conduct bilateral discussions with \n     Iran.\n\n\n                                 russia\n\n       From Helsinki, we traveled to St. Petersburg Russia, where \n     Consul General Mary Kruger and Consular Officer Doug O'Neill \n     met us.\n       That afternoon, I met with a group of U.S. business \n     executives including American Chamber of Commerce--Russia \n     President Andrew Somers, American Chamber of Commerce--St. \n     Petersburg Chapter Executive Director Maria Chernobrovkina, \n     American Chamber of Commerce--Russia Vice President Tatiana \n     Ragnzina, American Chamber of Commerce--Russia Communications \n     Director Guy Archer, U.S. Department of Commerce Principal \n     Communications Officer Keith Silver, General Director \n     International Paper--St. Petersburg Larry Booker, Citibank--\n     St. Petersburg Commercial Director Ruslan Belyaev, EMC \n     Software Director Igor Agamirzian, and Boyden Managing \n     Partner Julia Nikitina. U.S. companies play an important role \n     in the economy of Russia employing 200,000 Russians. I \n     questioned the group about the level of government corruption \n     and how it affects their companies. They responded that \n     corruption has been drastically reduced; Russia is \n     encouraging foreign investment; and companies that are \n     investing are experiencing considerable growth.\n       Following that meeting, I met with the representatives of \n     non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Those in attendance \n     were Boris Pustyntsev, Citizens Watch, Vladimir Shnitke, \n     Memorial, and Ella Polyakova, Soldiers' mothers. Ms. \n     Polyakova explained the abuse that new members of the \n     military are facing, specifically the injuries to Roman \n     Rudakov, who as the result of beatings had to have most of \n     his intestines removed and has been systematically mistreated \n     by military and government.\n       They also noted their concern with a new Russian law that \n     allows the government to place requirements for reporting and \n     registration of NGOs. The requirements being placed on these \n     organizations are extensive and burdensome. Mr. Pustyntsev \n     explained that he was required to provide correspondence from \n     the last 14 years. There is great concern that this will \n     reduce the number of NGOs and harm human rights progress that \n     Russia has made.\n       On Tuesday, August 21, we were fortunate to examine the \n     country's rich cultural heritage. We toured the Petershof \n     Palace, the summer home of Peter the Great. We then \n     visited the Hermitage Museum, one of the best museums for \n     Russian and European art in the world. The museum is \n     located in the former winter home of the Czars.\n       On August 22, we departed St. Petersburg for Moscow, where \n     we were greeted by James Melville, Charge d'Affaires Ad \n     Interim, Kathleen Doherty, Deputy Minister Counselor, and \n     U.S. Department of Justice Resident Legal Advisor Thomas \n     Firestone. I was briefed on issues of concern by them. Habeas \n     corpus is gaining more prevalence in Russia with more cases \n     being appealed and more defendants being released on those \n     appeals.\n\n[[Page S11008]]\n\n     However, the detention rate continues to be very high even \n     with the presumption of innocence.\n       Russia is currently dealing with the highly publicized \n     trial of Mikhail Khodorovsky, CEO, Yukos Oil Company. He was \n     arrested and sentenced to jail for 8 years for tax evasion, \n     fraud, and money laundering. Some believe this was an effort \n     to silence a political opponent of President Vladimir Putin. \n     While he was found guilty of these crimes it is likely that \n     there are many others that could be brought forward on \n     similar charges and his political opposition to President \n     Putin increased the scrutiny of him.\n       Russia is undergoing an economic boom and that has led to \n     high approval ratings for government officials. With this \n     economic upturn and prosperity, human rights concerns are not \n     at the forefront of societal concerns. If the economic \n     increase continues it may lead to a greater political \n     interest in human rights and general support for charitable \n     interests.\n       That afternoon I met with Deputy Minister of Justice \n     Nikolay Savchenko and representatives of the Ministry. First, \n     I asked the Deputy Minister if Russian authorities could \n     implement a wire tap without judicial authorization. He \n     replied that the system for wire tapping is similar to the \n     United States. To receive approval for a wire tap you must \n     meet certain standards and receive a court order. While there \n     are no statistics for usage, it is an important and necessary \n     measure.\n       I then questioned the Deputy Minister about the \n     advisability of the U.S. entering Pakistan to apprehend Osama \n     Bin Laden if we have information on his location. The Deputy \n     Minister asked that I offer my opinion first, which I did, \n     explaining that the U.S. should first approach President \n     Musharraf to seek approval for such action, but if not given, \n     then a preemptive action is warranted under international law \n     if there is cause to conclude that an attack by Iran is \n     imminent. The Deputy Minister noted that the problem is both \n     political and legal, but if there is proof of an imminent \n     attack then he would agree with me.\n       We then discussed the case of Mikhail Khodorovsky who is \n     currently appealing his conviction to the European Court of \n     Human Rights and the impact that will have on his case in \n     Russia. As a ratifier of the European convention on human \n     rights, he may have his case heard there, but a decision in \n     his favor by the European Court of Human Rights will not \n     vacate the Russian judgment. However, the European Court of \n     Human Rights may order the Russian government to pay monetary \n     damages.\n       That meeting was followed by a meeting with representatives \n     of U.S. based NGOs. Those in attendance were Second Secretary \n     Political Section U.S. Embassy Russia Daniel Wartko, USAID \n     Russia Deputy Director Erin Krasik, Elena Panifilova of \n     Transparency International, National Democratic Institute \n     Program Officer Ian Woodward, Carnegie Endowment for \n     International Peace Director Rose Gottemoller, Ford \n     Foundation Moscow Office Representative Steven Solnick, \n     International Republican Institute Russian Country Director \n     Joe Johnson III, USAID Russia Senior Advisor for Legal \n     Affairs Jonathan Kamin, and USAID Russia Legal Advisor Zoya \n     Kaitova. The representatives, similarly to those in St. \n     Petersburg, were very concerned with the new Russian law that \n     regulates NGOs. The NGOs have provided the required \n     information including future plans for their respective \n     organizations and they continue to inform the government of \n     their actions, but not asking permission. While the \n     organizations have not had any problems, there is great angst \n     that the information that they are providing now will be used \n     against them in the future to shut them down.\n       The American Chamber of Commerce hosted a breakfast on the \n     morning of Thursday, August 23. A number of representatives \n     of U.S. companies attended including American Chamber of \n     Commerce--Russia President Andrew Somers, American Chamber of \n     Commerce--Russia Vice President Tatiana Ragnzina, American \n     Chamber of Commerce--Russia Communications Director Guy \n     Archer, Merrill Lynch Head of Russia Global Markets Bernie \n     Sucher, Air Products General Manager Eastern Europe Vaclav \n     Harant, Sun Microsystems Managing Director Chris Morris, \n     Microsoft General Manager in Russia Birger Steen, Archer \n     Daniels Midland Company Director Vladimir Myrikov, and Alcoa \n     Russia President William J. O'Rourke, Rohm and Haas Country \n     Manager Michael Shukov, Backer & MacKenzie Partner Eugene \n     Arievich, Boeing Director of International Trade Policy \n     Business Strategy and Marketing Commercial Airplanes, \n     Keystone Foundation for Children and Families General \n     Director Maria Dolbunova, Keystone Foundation for Children \n     and Families President Dennis Felty, and GE Money Bank Russia \n     President and CEO Richard Gaskin. We discussed patent \n     protection in Russia, which had previously not been observed \n     but is now beginning to be upheld. Russia is starting \n     to prosecute intellectual property violators, bringing \n     those individuals to trial and a guilty verdict is \n     resulting in a jail sentence or compensation to the \n     intellectual property holder.\n       We also discussed the strong growth of the Russian economy \n     and the freedoms that Russians are experiencing as a result. \n     The U.S. company representative expressed concerns about a \n     recent U.S. law increasing the taxes of Americans living \n     abroad. This discourages companies from hiring well qualified \n     Americans who will have to be paid more to compensate for \n     that tax.\n       I then went to the Supreme Court Building of the Russian \n     Federation, to meet with Justice Stanislov Razumov of the \n     Supreme Court. The Russian Supreme Court has 125 Justices, \n     with three justices at one time presiding over primarily \n     appellate cases. I asked Justice Razumov what occurred if a \n     group of three Justices differed on a ruling from another \n     three judges on a case before them. He said that a dissenting \n     judge has the right to issue a separate dissenting opinion. \n     He also explained the mechanism by which the Supreme Court \n     provides guidance to lower courts, in the absence of a system \n     of case precedent. The Justices sit in plenary session where \n     they summarize cases, offer direction on cases they have \n     ruled on and vote on issues of disagreement. I then asked him \n     if they have votes that are so many one way to so many for \n     another. He said there is usually not a problem reaching \n     majority consensus in the plenary sessions and that the \n     dissenting vote is rarely more then 5 to 7 percent.\n       We then discussed the role of the Russian Supreme court in \n     ruling on cultural issues that are the subject of legal \n     disputes such as abortion, assisted suicide, and race. I \n     learned that the jurisdiction of the Russian Supreme Court is \n     different from that of the United States. Those decisions are \n     made by lower courts. If an individual believes that a law is \n     unconstitutional or does not comply with federal regulation, \n     then that case is taken to the Constitutional Court.\n       I then asked Justice Razumov if President Putin or other \n     government officials can order a wire tap in cases of \n     terrorism. He replied that he cannot without a court order \n     and citizens must be protected.\n       We then visited the Novodevichy Convent, a beautiful site \n     that housed a number of Russia's royal families, and Red \n     Square.\n\n\n                                 Turkey\n\n       On Friday, August 24, we traveled to Ankara, Turkey, where \n     we were met by Charge d'Affaires Nancy McEldowney. This was \n     an important day in Turkey as the parliament had its second \n     vote for President. The Parliament votes three times for \n     President unless a candidate receives a majority of votes \n     before that. Foreign Affairs Minister Abdullah Gul won the \n     election on August 28, though he did not obtain the majority \n     necessary to win on this day. I was scheduled to meet with \n     Foreign Affairs Minister Gul, but because we were delayed \n     departing Moscow by the airport authorities, we were not able \n     to meet.\n       We immediately traveled to the United States Embassy for a \n     brief discussion of issues of importance in Turkey. Iraq is \n     on the top of the list of concerns. Turkey does not want the \n     United States to leave in the near future to prevent the \n     destabilization of Iraq. Further, Turkey supports the current \n     boundaries in Iraq and opposes creation of three states. The \n     Turkish people are also greatly concerned about S. Res. 106 \n     and H.R. 106, which would recognize the actions by Turkey \n     against Armenia in 1915 as genocide.\n       We then went to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs \n     Building where I had lunch with Ministry of Foreign Affairs \n     Ambassador Undersecretary Ertugrul Apakan. The Undersecretary \n     voiced his support for the United States to remain in Iraq as \n     he would like to see the United States achieve success there, \n     for if the United States fails, then Turkey has failed. I was \n     intrigued by the possibility of United Nations military \n     assistance in Iraq. The Undersecretary believes that the U.N. \n     can bridge the views between the Shitte, Sunni and Kurds in a \n     peaceful manner. The possibility also remains that the U.N. \n     could provide an umbrella for troops to assist in the \n     stabilizing of Iraq. The entrance of U.N. troops may also cut \n     down on the insurgent anger directed at the United States.\n       On August 10, 2007, the U.N. Security Council adopted \n     Resolution 1770 to extend the United Nations Assistance \n     Mission for Iraq for one year and to provide assistance \n     regarding political dialogue and national reconciliation. The \n     Mission will also work to facilitate dialogue between Iraq \n     and other countries in the region. It is important for \n     neighboring countries to support Iraq in efforts to reduce \n     conflict and to build a functioning government. Turkey is \n     currently working to hold a convention with other countries \n     in the region to discuss problems facing Iraq. The countries \n     involved would include Syria, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, \n     Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, \n     Yemen, Iraq and Turkey. Also invited would be the United \n     Kingdom, France, China, Russia, United States, Germany, \n     Canada, and Japan.\n       The Undersecretary then explained the Turkish opposition to \n     S. Res. 106 and H.R. 106. He did offer support for a joint \n     history commission regarding the issue and Turkey would \n     accept the use of the term genocide if that is what the \n     evidence states.\n       I then met with Special Envoy for Iraq, Ambassador Oguz \n     Celikkol. With the Ambassador we had a brief discussion \n     regarding the war in Iraq. I stated to the Ambassador that I \n     had voted for $100 billion in funding in support of the war, \n     but I must see a light at the end of the tunnel to continue \n     supporting funding. I informed him of my town hall meetings \n     across Pennsylvania during the first two weeks of August \n     where I met 4,000 people many of whom we are adamant about \n     leaving Iraq. The Ambassador repeated the importance of the \n     United States remaining in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S11009]]\n\n       We then departed on a 45-minute flight to Istanbul where we \n     were greeted by Peter Barte, our State Department control \n     officer.\n       In Istanbul, we visited the Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, \n     and the Grand Bazaar with Filiz Ozer, Professor of Art \n     History and Architecture at Istanbul Technical University and \n     Sevil Sezen, Cultural Affairs Specialist, U.S. Consulate \n     General.\n\n\n                                 poland\n\n       The morning of Sunday, August 26, we traveled to Warsaw, \n     Poland and were met by David Van Cleve, First Secretary, \n     United States Embassy of Poland.\n       We were fortunate to have the opportunity to tour Warsaw, \n     specifically the areas related to Warsaw's WWII and Jewish \n     history. We toured old town Warsaw, which was rebuilt after \n     World War II to its original beauty, the monument to the \n     Warsaw Uprising and the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, commemorating \n     the Jews who fought against the Nazis. We then visited the \n     Jewish cemetery, with more then 200,000 graves including many \n     who perished in World War II.\n       That evening we had dinner with Ambassador Victor Ashe, \n     Senator Shelby, and Embassy and Senate staff at the \n     Ambassador's residence.\n       On August 27, we visited the Warsaw Rising Museum, a unique \n     museum that examines Poland in WWII, specifically the Polish \n     uprising and the Home Army. The facility is extremely \n     interactive with a recreated sewer system, which the Polish \n     Home Army used to travel through Warsaw and evade the Nazis. \n     The facility also had a number of documents from that time \n     including a pamphlet that was air dropped in Warsaw \n     encouraging the Home Army to wear markings that would \n     indicate that they are part of an army, so that the Nazis \n     could be prosecuted for war crimes by the United States.\n       I was particularly impressed with the story of Tadeusz \n     Ruman, a member of a flight crew that dropped supplies in \n     Warsaw to aid the Home Army. During the flight, their plane \n     suffered heavy damages from attacks and lost two engines. \n     After the drop of the supplies they had to pass over \n     mountains, which they only cleared by a few feet. After \n     taking attacks and injuries, the crew made it to Brindisi, \n     Italy, however, upon landing they realized that their brakes \n     had been damaged and were unable to stop. Taking quick action \n     they were able to steer the B-24 Bomber into vines and rocks \n     to bring the plane to a stop, a harrowing tale that displayed \n     the effort that the Allies made to assist the Polish Home \n     Army.\n       I was then briefed by Ambassador Victor Ashe, Deputy Chief \n     of Mission Kenneth Hillas, Political Counselor Mary Curtin, \n     Economic Counselor Richard Rorving, Counsel General Philip \n     Min, Public Affairs Counselor Ed Kulakowski, Defense Attache \n     Col. Richard Runner, and FBI Attache Jay Bienkowski. The \n     Polish economy is doing very well with annual increases of 6 \n     percent. While this is below the increases of Russia and \n     other Baltic countries it is very encouraging given the \n     stable market environment in Poland for businesses, which is \n     not as strong in those other countries.\n       The relationship between the United States and Poland is \n     strong with left and right wing political groups, despite the \n     opposition to the Iraq war. The proposed missile defense \n     system in Poland is a point of ongoing discussions, with \n     Polish representatives desiring to speed up discussions. \n     Poland is putting forward a number of troops to assist the \n     United States in Iraq and Afghanistan, with 900 in Iraq and \n     1,200 in Afghanistan. While Poland is looking to reduce the \n     number of troops in Iraq, they may consider increasing the \n     number in Afghanistan.\n       I was scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Anna Fotyga, \n     but could not do so because we left Wednesday early to return \n     to the U.S. to attend the funeral of a close friend. I spoke \n     to her by phone. I informed her of the United States' \n     appreciation for Poland sending troops to Iraq and \n     Afghanistan. I asked for her assessment of having the \n     United Nations involved in Iraq and if Poland would \n     consider sending additional troops to Iraq if it was under \n     the United Nations banner. She replied that she would have \n     to defer to the President, Prime Minister, and Minister of \n     Defense on that issue.\n       I met with Andrzej Duda, Deputy Minister of Justice, a \n     impressive 35-year-old gentleman. We discussed the \n     prosecutorial system in Poland which is similar to the United \n     States as Prosecutors are responsible for cases in a \n     geographical area. Prosecutors are required to graduate from \n     law school, serve a 3-year internship with a senior \n     Prosecutor, and then pass an exam.\n       I asked the Deputy Minister about crime in Poland. He \n     informed me that there are several hundred murders a year in \n     Poland, but less then one thousand. He also informed me of \n     the decreasing juvenile crime problem in Poland. While \n     juvenile crime is still a problem the improving economy of \n     Poland is increasing wages and employment, providing youth \n     with quality jobs. Poland as a member of the European Union \n     does not have the death penalty and has not used it since \n     1987.\n       I then questioned him about the use of terrorism and \n     wiretapping in Poland. The Deputy Minister noted that he has \n     not been involved in any terrorism cases, though the Ministry \n     is working with the United States on this important issue. He \n     believes wiretapping is a critical tool against crime. When I \n     asked him about the ability of government official's ability \n     to use wire tapping with out a judge's approval he stated \n     that it was not possible.\n\n\n                                 france\n\n       We departed for Paris, France that evening, where we were \n     met by our Control Officer Kim Krhounek and Logistics Control \n     Officer Chanh Nguyen.\n       On Wednesday, August 29, we were briefed by Ambassador \n     Craig R. Stapleton at the United States Embassy on a number \n     of issues. We were also joined by Deputy Chief of Mission \n     Mark Pekala, Political Minister Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt, \n     Economic Minister Counselor Stuart Dwyer, Consul General \n     Catherine Barry, Public Affairs Minister Counselor James \n     Bullock, Defense Attache Col. Raymond Hodgkins, Foreign \n     Commercial Service Minister Counselor Raymond Connan, and \n     Head of Office Regional Affairs Michael Altoff.\n       We discussed new French President Nicolas Sarkozy and what \n     his views will mean to the United States. President Sarkozy \n     wants a culture of success in France. He is seeking to reform \n     the country and make it the leading country in Europe.\n       President Sarkozy views himself as pro-American, and has \n     stated that he wants to help the United States in Iraq. This \n     is likely to be through economic development and not through \n     placing troops in Iraq. On the possibility of France \n     providing troops for a United Nations military force, there \n     is little optimism. However, there may be an opportunity for \n     France to increase its assistance through NATO by training \n     Iraqi soldiers and policemen.\n       Regarding Iran, the French support diplomatic efforts to \n     prevent Iran from securing nuclear weapons capability. In \n     fact, France may be willing to take actions on this issue \n     outside of the United Nations Security Council.\n       From the Embassy we departed for Charles De Gaulle \n     International Airport and returned to the United States.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the absence of any Senator seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw that suggestion.

Mr. President, I rise today during morning business to \ntalk about a trip I made to Iraq. I think the Acting President pro \ntempore made a similar trip during the August recess. I want to make a \nfew points regarding that trip.\n  I know a lot of people talk about these trips, and they talk about \nthe fact that they are choreographed and short term. I do want to say \nmy comments are in the context of many hours of committee hearings the \nActing President pro tempore and I have both sat through in Foreign \nRelations and Armed Services and many other ways developing the \nbackground prior to being in Iraq.\n  I know, again, much is said of these trips. I will say I do not think \nthere is anything--and the Chair probably would attest to the same--\nlike being there on the ground yourself and seeing firsthand our \ntroops, seeing our military leaders, seeing leaders of the Iraqi \nGovernment, and also seeing many of the tribal leaders, the sheiks who \nactually lead in these various areas throughout the country.\n  I wish to make three points, and then I wish to urge something in \nconclusion.\n  No. 1, I think the Chair would agree with me the professionalism and \ncommitment of our men and women in uniform is absolutely overwhelming. \nThe way they conduct themselves on our behalf would almost lead you to \nemotion just in seeing the way they do what they do on our behalf. I \nhave noticed that both in State, as I have traveled the State as our \nmen and women prepare, but certainly even more so on the ground there \nin Iraq. I am indebted to them. I know the Acting President pro tempore \nand all Americans are indebted to the way they conduct themselves, \nregardless of how we may feel about the conflict that is underway.\n  Secondly, I do not think there is any question that we have had \nmilitary gains on the ground. I realize that is uneven. But I think \nthere is no question what General Petraeus, General Odierno, and others \nhave done on the ground, in beginning the work in a bottoms-up \napproach, where we work with tribal leaders there on the ground to \nsecure their own areas, is the right approach. I do not think there is \nany question we are seeing the results of that approach.\n  It seems as if a light has gone on where, No. 1, the tribal leaders, \nthe sheiks, and others there on the ground are realizing that we are \nthere not as occupiers but we are there as enablers.\n\n[[Page S11010]]\n\nWe want to enable them to be able to secure their own destiny. We want \nto leave that country other than providing the basic support they may \nneed on an ongoing basis.\n  Secondly, the terror, if you will, al-Qaida and some of the other \nmilitant groups have wreaked on these villages has caused them to want \nto band together with us and again try to make sure they do everything \nthey can to cause their villages to be peaceful. For that reason, we no \ndoubt are seeing gains on the ground as it relates to security.\n  I think the third thing we would all agree with is the central \nGovernment itself has not made the gains we would have hoped more \nsecurity on the ground would have enabled them to do. I think most \ndelegations that went there met with various Iraqi officials. I know I \nmet with both a Shia and a Sunni deputy president there on the ground \nand talked with them about the lack of benchmarks we had hoped they \nwould all meet.\n  Obviously, we also are aware the Prime Minister is meeting with the \nPresident and two deputy presidents on a daily basis to try to reach \nsome type of reconciliation so they can move forward on these important \nissues. But the fact is, those benchmarks have not been made in a way \nthat we here in the Government would like to have seen them approached \nand progress made.\n  Our soldiers have been outstanding. There is no doubt that military \ngains on the ground have occurred, and the central Government has not \nconducted itself in a way that we would have liked to have seen happen.\n  In the next week or so we are going to see a number of reports, but \nmost important, obviously, to me anyway, is the report General Petraeus \nand Ambassador Crocker will put forward. I urge my fellow Senators on \nthe floor to listen to what is going to be said. Obviously, there are \npeople here who have a lot invested in various amendments or proposals, \nand there is a human trait we want to see our own proposal, if you \nwill, be the one people in the Senate and our country adopt.\n  But let me state I do not think there is any question that the \nPetraeus plan is going to discuss redeployments. It is going to discuss \nbringing men and women home from Iraq based on the successes we have \nhad on the ground in recent months. I do not think there is any \nquestion we have seen a change in mission take place on a province-by-\nprovince basis. In other words, one of the things we debated heavily in \nprevious debates this year on Iraq was changing the mission of our men \nand women in uniform. Yet we are seeing this occurring province by \nprovince, as tribal leaders are able, working with our military \nleaders, to take the lead in their own security. So we are seeing that \nchange in mission.\n  I say to my fellow Senators, let's listen. I think we have an \nopportunity in the Senate for Democrats and Republicans to come \ntogether around a plan that would unify our country in such a way as we \nare able to bring our country together around what is happening in \nIraq. I do not know what the details of the Petraeus plan will be. My \nguess is he and others today are actually calibrating what the exact \nredeployment ought to be and what the timing of that ought to be to \nactually make sure we do not lose the successes we have had on the \nground. But my guess is, there will be redeployments, and I think those \nwill be gradual, again, to build on the successes we have had--again, a \ncontinual and gradual change in the mission underway in Iraq.\n  I am of hope, of great hope--and maybe it is my newness to the Senate \nthat gives me this optimism still, but I have great hopes that if we \nwill all listen to the reports that are being given, and not to those \npeople who wish to see us divided, I think we in the Senate have an \nopportunity to come together around a proposal in Iraq that gives us \nthe opportunity to build on the successes we have had and to change the \nmission of our men and women so over time what we are doing is \nbasically supporting the operations of the Iraqis as they continue \ntheir move ahead, hopefully, toward a more secure Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown).

Mr. President, on behalf of the Appropriations Committee, I \ncall up an amendment in the form of a committee substitute which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2656.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring the fiscal year 2008 \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs, and related agencies \nappropriations bill to the Senate. This is a unique bill for many \nreasons, not the least of which is it is the first appropriations bill \nthat will be considered under the requirements of S. 1, the Honest \nLeadership and Open Government Act of 2007. On August 2, 2007, the \nSenate approved S. 1 by a vote of 83 to 14, clearing the measure for \nthe President's signature. When signed by the President, this ethics \nreform legislation will significantly improve the transparency and \naccountability of the legislative process.\n  Although the White House has requested the Senate not submit the \nlegislation to the President until he returns from his overseas \ntravels, I wish to assure Senators we intend to abide by the \nrequirements of S. 1 during the consideration of this bill. The \nlegislation requires that the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction \ncertify that certain information related to congressionally directed \nspending be identified and that the required information be available \non a publicly accessible congressional Web site in a searchable format \nat least 48 hours before a vote on the pending bill.\n  The information required includes identification of the \ncongressionally directed spending and the name of the Senator who \nrequested such spending. This information is contained in the committee \nreport numbered 110-85, dated June 18, 2007, and has been available on \nthe Internet for over 2 months.\n  In addition, pursuant to the standards required by Chairman Byrd and \nSenator Cochran, letters from each Member with a congressionally \ndirected spending item in this bill or accompanying report are \navailable on the Internet certifying that neither the Senator, nor his \nor her spouse, has a pecuniary interest in such spending item.\n  I am submitting for the Record the certification by the chairman of \nthe Committee on Appropriations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S11011]]\n\n\n       Senator Byrd: I certify that the information that will be \n     required by S. 1, when it becomes law, related to \n     congressionally directed spending, has been identified in the \n     Committee report numbered 110-85, filed on June 18, 2007, and \n     that the required information has been available on a \n     publicly accessible congressional website in a searchable \n     format at least 48 hours before a vote on the pending bill.\n\n  Mr. REED. Before yielding to Senator Hutchison, I would like to thank \nChairman Byrd and Senator Cochran for their leadership in bringing this \nbill to the floor. Also, I would like to thank the ranking member of \nour subcommittee, Senator Hutchison, for her support and assistance, \nher knowledge and experience on the subcommittee, and her dedication to \nveterans and the military have been tremendous assets in developing \nthis bill. I am particularly pleased to bring the bill to the floor \ntoday in anticipation of welcoming Senator Johnson back. He is our \nsubcommittee chairman. He will return tomorrow. This bill is a \ntestament to Senator Johnson's tenacity in the face of adversity and to \nhis leadership, even though as he recuperated, he was involved in the \nprocess and proceedings and he too shared the deep concerns of the \nNation's military families and our Nation's veterans. I am deeply \nhonored to be managing this bill on the floor for him.\n  I yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to first thank the Senator from \nRhode Island for allowing me to speak before he gives his major talk \nabout the bill itself because of time constraints. I appreciate that. \nIt was very nice of him to do that.\n  Let me first say it has been very helpful--it has been terrific--\nworking with the Senator from Rhode Island. He was, as he said, \nsubstituted. This was thrown at him early this year. I know it is \nsomething he wanted to do because he has a great record serving in the \nmilitary himself, but to step in for Senator Johnson because of his \nillness was a great thing that Senator Reed was able to do, and he has \ndone a great job. I might add that his able staff has had a lot of \nexperience on this bill and were also very helpful. Tina Evans, B.G. \nWright, and Chad Schulken have been subcommittee staff members for a \nlong time--longer than any of us, I might say--and it has been very \nhelpful to have that knowledge and experience working with us. Of \ncourse, my own staff, Dennis Balkham, Christine Heggem, Yvonne Stone, \nand Sean Knowles have also contributed greatly to this complicated \nbill. It is a big bill that affects all our veterans and our military \npersonnel because we do deal with military construction as well as \nveterans affairs.\n  This bill, I think, balances all the needs that are necessary very \nwell. We have to take into account, of course, the Active-Duty \nservicemembers in making sure they have the military construction they \nneed to do the job we are asking them to do. The Guard and Reserve, \nwhich I will mention later, is well funded in this bill, and it is \nsomething we must do because they are carrying such a huge burden in \nthe war against terror. Local communities, family members of \nservicemembers, and taxpayers all have a part in balancing any \nappropriations bill and especially this one.\n  This bill does address the infrastructure requirements as well as \nhealth care and benefits of our veterans. We hope to move it \nexpeditiously across the floor today, I think because Senator Reed and \nI have worked so well on the bill that we have solved most of the \nissues that have come forward, and I believe we have done a good job in \nfunding everything that was necessary.\n  Let me mention a couple of the main points. This subcommittee, with \nSenator Feinstein and myself, were instrumental in the rebasing effort \nthat has occurred in the Department of Defense. We are bringing back \n70,000 of our troops from overseas to be able to train in the United \nStates. This was part of an overseas basing commission bill that \nSenator Feinstein and I cosponsored that was adopted by Congress and \nresults in 70,000 troops coming back--mainly from Germany and South \nKorea.\n  That also has had an impact on military construction because we found \nwhen we went overseas that there were training constraints in the bases \noverseas. We had capacity in America for better training and better \nopportunities for families. So in this bill we had to address the needs \nof the military construction for those troops that will be moving back \nhome over the next 5 to 6 years.\n  In addition, Congress has the responsibility to fund the BRAC. We \nhave a time limit for the Department of Defense to implement BRAC. That \nrequires building not only in the places where troops will be moving in \nand facilities that will be needed for additions to bases, but also to \ntake care of the needs of bases that are going to be closed. We did \nfully fund BRAC, and I am pleased that we did. It was our \nresponsibility to do it because we put a deadline on the Department of \nDefense for the implementation of BRAC. We certainly have to do the \nrequired construction in order to meet the deadline.\n  Army modularity: We are changing the concept. There are smaller \nfighting units now. We have accommodated that modularity effort through \nour military construction efforts. Of course, in the global war on \nterror, which is the major overlying conflict that is going on today \nwith our military personnel, we certainly have to meet the needs of \nthose who are being trained and are going to be deployed in the war on \nterror, and we have to take care of their families.\n  The military construction section of the bill provides over $21 \nbillion for construction projects, and it is very strong. It is very \nimportant in our transformation effort that we have increased the end \nstrength of the military, as well as changed the types of fighting \nunits that we will have in the military. So that has also provided \nrequirements for different military construction. We are doing exactly \nwhat we should be doing in the bill, and we worked very closely with \nthe authorization committee to assure that their priorities and our \npriorities were the same.\n  I am very pleased that we also have addressed the needs of the Guard \nand Reserve. I have to say--and I think everybody who knows the subject \nwould agree--that the funding needs of the Guard and Reserve have not \nbeen well represented in the Department of Defense budget submission in \nthe past because of other high priorities for our defense dollars. But \nthe Guard and Reserve are doing so much in the war on terror. They are \nbeing deployed and redeployed. We need to make sure they have the \nfacilities and support they need to fulfill their very vital function \nin the war on terror.\n  The other part of this bill, which is a major responsibility, is, of \ncourse, the Department of Veterans Affairs. The veterans affairs \nportion of the bill has many good features. As we move forward in the \nprocess, I am committed to continuing to work with my colleagues to \nmake sure that every dollar is spent wisely and efficiently to serve \nthe needs of our veterans. We have expanded resources to treat the \ntypes of injuries and illnesses that our veterans are facing today. We \nare doing more in mental health and trying to help people with post-\ntraumatic stress syndrome.\n  We are trying to make sure our facilities are kept up. We have a huge \nbuilding program. Minor construction will be $751 million. Major \nconstruction will be $727 million. It is going to be a major effort to \nmake sure these facilities are cutting edge.\n  Severe trauma and brain injury is another area we are addressing more \nfully in this bill than we ever have before. Also, research into \nprosthetics and the use of artificial limbs is another important focus \nbecause we know more of our young soldiers are losing limbs, and we \nneed to make sure we are doing the very best for them to be able to \nlead normal lives.\n  We are doing more research into gulf war illness and, as well, \ngeriatric care for the older veterans. These are critical needs. We \nwill never quit looking for answers, and this fully funds the research \nfor the areas in which we need to do more and better for our veterans.\n  We must continue to adapt to the types of injuries that our warriors \nexperience in the different theaters in which they serve. We must also \nprepare for future weapons, such as chemical and biological, that may \nbe used against our soldiers.\n  Mr. President, I think every Member of Congress shares in the desire \nto fairly compensate, medically treat, and\n\n[[Page S11012]]\n\nhonor the veterans who have sacrificed and borne the responsibility of \nmilitary service. The VA provides health care free of charge to address \nany and all service-connected illnesses or disabilities, mental or \nphysical, including those conditions which may manifest decades after \nmilitary service.\n  The VA also provides health care free of charge to low-income \nveterans regardless of service-connected disability or illnesses. We \nalways have--and always will--take care of our Nation's veterans.\n  In summary, this Congress has shown its resolve time and again to \ncare for our men and women in uniform, as well as the more than 7 \nmillion veterans in America. We owe them our gratitude. We owe them \nwhat they deserve, and that is that we take care of their needs.\n  I appreciate working with Senator Reed. I appreciate that we have \ndone everything we could with the dollars we had. I will just note that \nPresident Bush has said if the bill stays as it is now, he plans to \nsign it so that we can implement it quickly. But I do hope as we go \nthrough the conference process and finish the bill on the Senate floor \nthat we will keep to the intention of the bill, that we will make sure \nwe stay within the guidelines we have.\n  We have added $4 billion above the President's request already. That \nmoney is allocated, so there will be relatively few changes I think we \nshould make if we are going to expeditiously send the bill to the \nPresident for his signature and assure that he will sign it.\n  Once again, I thank Senator Reed and his able staff for accommodating \nme and allowing me to make my statement. I look forward to getting this \nbill out tomorrow and on to the President very soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the substitute \namendment be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as thus amended, \nbe considered as original text for the purpose of further amendments; \nand that no points of order be considered waived by this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend Senator Hutchison for her hard \nwork and that of her staff. She has been a very positive and laudable \nmember of the committee. She has vast experience, having served on the \ncommittee many years, and has made a major contribution to this \nlegislation, and she should be acknowledged for that contribution.\n  Mr. President, this is a critically important piece of legislation, \nand I hope that the Senate will act on it expeditiously. Both the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and the veterans service organizations \nhave urged prompt action on this bill, and the President himself has \ncited the importance of not delaying crucial funding for our Nation's \nveterans and military forces.\n  The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill \nfunds urgently needed investments in the facilities in which our \nmilitary forces and their families live and work and train for battle. \nIt also provides funding for the benefits and medical care acutely \nneeded by our Nation's veterans.\n  The bill before the Senate today provides a total of $109.2 billion \nin funding, including $64.7 billion in discretionary funds. In all, the \ndiscretionary funding is $4 billion over the President's budget \nrequest. As Senator Hutchison said, the President is prepared to sign \nthe legislation as it is.\n  Funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs totals $87.5 billion, \nof which $44.5 billion is for mandatory programs and $43 billion is for \ndiscretionary programs, an increase in discretionary funding of $3.6 \nbillion over the President's budget request.\n  We have independently determined additional needs for military \nconstruction and veterans affairs, and we found a responsible way to \nmeet these additional needs.\n  More than 70 percent of the increase--$2.6 billion--is for the \nVeterans Health Administration. This increase will allow the Department \nof Veterans Affairs to dedicate additional resources to deal with \nspiraling health care needs for veterans, including the urgent needs of \nIraq and Afghanistan war veterans. Chief among needs, in terms of \nwidespread impact, is the treatment of traumatic brain injury and post-\ntraumatic stress disorder.\n  The extent of these problems among returning veterans--and the strain \nthat the treatment of them is placing on the Veterans health care \nsystem--is only now coming to be fully understood. The Defense \nDepartment estimates that as many as 30 percent of returning Iraq and \nAfghanistan war veterans suffer from traumatic brain injury or post-\ntraumatic stress disorder--or both. This is a startling statistic and a \nlooming crisis that needs to be addressed immediately.\n  The urgency of this problem was among the top findings cited in the \nreport of the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning \nWounded Warriors, better known as the Dole-Shalala Commission. The \ncommission's report, which was released earlier this summer, spotlights \nthe need to aggressively prevent and treat post-traumatic stress \ndisorder and traumatic brain injury, including preparing for the long-\nterm consequences of these injuries.\n  Many of the veterans wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan will require \nyears, if not a lifetime, of medical care from the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. And this new influx of veterans is occurring at a \ntime when the veterans from previous wars are aging and requiring \nsubstantial increases in medical services as well as long-term care.\n  It is vital that the Department of Veterans Affairs have adequate \nresources to address these emerging and unanticipated requirements \nwithout draining funds from other needed and high priority programs, \nsuch as long-term care for aging veterans.\n  Unfortunately, for too long, the President's Office of Management and \nBudget has ignored the financial impact of the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan on the Department of Veterans Affairs, and has continued to \npenny pinch the Department's budget.\n  As a result, the Department of Veterans Affairs has struggled over \nthe past several years--often unsuccessfully--to keep pace with the \nrising demands for veterans health care. It has been Congress that has \nhad to lead in providing the resources to bail out the Department when \nits projected health care costs fell abysmally short of the mark. And \nit has been Congress that has led the effort to provide the Department \nwith more resources for mental health care programs at a time when the \nrequirement for such services is soaring.\n  I am pleased to report that the bill before the Senate today corrects \nthe deficiencies of the past and provides the necessary investment to \nguide the Department into the future.\n  And there is more good news for veterans in this bill. This \nlegislation provides $1 billion over the President's budget request for \nminor construction and nonrecurring maintenance of veterans hospitals \nand clinics. Last February--after the President submitted his fiscal \nyear 2008 budget request and after the deplorable conditions at Walter \nReed Medical Center were revealed--the Veterans Affairs Department \nreleased a report identifying roughly $5 billion worth of deficiencies \nin its facilities system-wide. If we do not want to see another Walter \nReed horror story in veterans' facilities, we need to move aggressively \nto correct these deficiencies, and the funding in this bill will allow \nthe Department to do so.\n  The bill also includes $131 million to hire at least 500 new claims \nprocessors to reduce the growing backlog of veterans' disability \nclaims. The Veterans Benefits Administration currently has a backlog of \nalmost 400,000 pending claims, with the average claim taking almost 6 \nmonths to process. In testimony before the Senate Veterans Affairs \nCommittee in March, the GAO highlighted the need for the VA to take \nsteps to reduce the existing backlog of claims and improve the accuracy \nand consistency of decisions. This bill takes dead aim at correcting \nthose problems.\n  I know, as all my colleagues do--because we get the calls in our \nState offices from veterans who need help and have an unusually long \ntime in which their claim is being processed--that sometimes the claims \nare rejected and have to be resubmitted or are pending\n\n[[Page S11013]]\n\nappeals. All of this is going to be corrected, and it is going to help \nthe people who need help, veterans who need access to the veterans \nsystem quickly and efficiently, and we hope this bill will do that.\n  On the military construction side, which is the other major provision \nin our legislative agenda, the bill provides $21.2 billion. While this \nis a substantial increase over last year's funding level, it should be \nnoted that more than half of the budget request was to fund the 2005 \nbase realignment and closure program and the President's Grow the Force \nInitiative. For military construction associated with conventional \nmission requirements, the budget request, following the trend of the \npast 5 years, was basically flatlined, but we have two major \ninitiatives--the BRAC of 2005 and the new initiative of the President \nto increase principally the size of the Army--and those initiatives \nhave required additional funding.\n  The Senate bill fully funds the President's $8.2 billion request for \nBRAC 2005 and for his Grow the Force Initiative, and it increases \nfunding for the regular military construction program by nearly $400 \nmillion over the President's request. Especially in a time of war, we \nmust not skip on funding the basic infrastructure needed to support our \nmen and women in uniform.\n  The Senate bill also provides $320 million--that is $100 million over \nthe President's budget request--for the BRAC 1990 legacy program. This \ngoes back to the prior BRAC in 1990.\n  It is important that the Government keep its commitment to the \ncommunities affected by prior BRAC rounds and ensure that environmental \ncleanup of closed military installations is completed as thoroughly and \nrapidly as possible. Although it has been nearly 13 years since the \nlast round of closures under the previous BRAC rounds, the backlog and \nenvironmental cleanup remains at $3.5 billion. At the current rate, it \nwill take decades to return some of that property to a safe and usable \ncondition. In the meantime, affected communities cannot use much of the \nland on which these bases sit.\n  I am particularly pleased that this bill adds $234.6 million above \nthe President's budget request for Guard and Reserve military \nconstruction projects. The Guard and Reserve are central components of \nour Nation's military forces. Yet the President's request for military \nconstruction to support these components has been steadily declining. \nThe Senate bill corrects that deficit.\n  Because of the enhanced scrutiny of earmarks under the requirements \nof S. 1 and the guidance of Chairman Byrd and Senator Cochran, it is \nimportant to understand how the military construction portion of this \nbill is funded. The vast majority of military construction funding is \nproject based. That means Congress cannot correct deficiencies in the \nPresident's budget request simply by increasing the top line of \nindividual accounts. Military construction funding is allocated by \nproject and by law. Each and every major construction project must be \nindividually authorized and individually funded. The President's \nmilitary construction budget request is composed primarily of earmarked \nprojects, and congressional increases to the budget request must also \nbe earmarked for specific projects.\n  The 2008 Senate bill includes 665 individual earmarks, of which 580 \nwere requested by the President. The staff of the Military Construction \nand Veterans Affairs Subcommittee worked diligently to identify every \nearmark in the Senate bill. Every Senator was required to submit to the \ncommittee both a written request and a letter of financial interest \nbefore a request would be considered. Moreover, the military \nconstruction title of this bill is developed in close coordination with \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, and every congressionally directed \nproject in the appropriations bill is authorized in the Defense \nauthorization bill. The process could not be more open and aboveboard.\n  It has been reported that the Senate bill harbors $6.5 billion in \nundisclosed earmarks, which comprises the funding for construction \nprojects in the BRAC 2005 account. This characterization reflects an \nunfortunate misunderstanding of the BRAC account which I am pleased to \nclarify for the record.\n  Unlike the regular military construction program, the BRAC account \ndoes not require line-item authorization and appropriation for \nindividual projects. Instead, the account receives lump-sum funding \nfrom which the Defense Department develops a spending plan to implement \nthe recommendations of the Base Closure and Realignment Commission. \nNeither Congress nor the Defense Department has the authority to \ndeviate from the Commission's recommendations. It is the policy of this \ncommittee to not earmark or accelerate funding for specific projects \nwithin the BRAC account because of the complicated domino effect of \nclosing and realigning facilities among installations. Thus, each of \nthe BRAC 2005 projects identified in the committee report was \ndetermined by the administration, in accordance with the BRAC law. The \naccount includes no congressional earmarks.\n  I regret that due to a lack of understanding of the BRAC process, the \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill has been \nused as a poster child for undisclosed earmarks. Such an assertion is \ninaccurate on its face, but to correct any lingering misconceptions, I \nhave prepared a list of the 189 BRAC 2005 projects that were published \nin the report accompanying the bill, annotated to show that each \nproject, since it was funded through the President's budget request, \nwas requested by the President.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the list printed in the Record so \nthere can be no question as to the origin of these projects.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11014]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS04SE07.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S11015]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS04SE07.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S11016]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS04SE07.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S11017]]\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, it has been a remarkable process putting \nthis bill together, principally because of the staff of the \nsubcommittee on both sides. I wish to particularly thank Christina \nEvans, B.G. Wright, and Chad Schulken for the majority, and Dennis \nBalkham, Chris Heggem, and Yvonne Stone for the minority for their hard \nwork and cooperative effort to produce this bill.\n  I believe the 2008 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Bill is an excellent piece of \nlegislation, one that is needed now, not later. It is needed to fund \nprograms that are crucial to our national defense, to the defense of \nthe Nation, and to the well-being of our veterans. I hope and urge that \nthe Senate quickly pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                        Nomination of Jim Nussle\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the August recess has given us all an \nopportunity to return to our constituents and reconnect with the people \nof our States and listen to what is on their minds, not just what we \nhear inside the bubble in Washington, DC. For my part, the issues I \nencountered wherever I went in Texas were concerns about the economy, \nabout jobs, about Government spending. Many people are concerned, and \ngiven, unfortunately, the recent history of the Congress and the budget \nthat has already passed, I don't blame them for their concerns. There \nare some very real reasons they should remain concerned about taxing \nand spending in the Congress.\n  Mr. President, you will recall that in 2001 and 2003, when \nRepublicans were in the majority, Congress passed well-timed tax relief \nthat helped the economy overcome the fallout from corporate accounting \nscandals of the late 1990s, the bursting of the tech bubble, and the \nhorrific attacks of September 11, 2001. This well-timed and important \ntax relief put money back into the pockets of working families all \nacross America, in the pockets of small businesses and entrepreneurs, \nand as a result, the economy has bounced back in an incredible and \nimpressive way. Items such as bonus depreciation and the $100,000 \nexpensing have allowed entrepreneurs and small businesses to grow, not \nonly helping their owners and their families but also creating jobs for \ntheir community.\n  We doubled the child tax credit for working parents. We provided tax \nrelief to all taxpayers from higher marginal tax rates. We reduced the \nmarriage tax penalty and protected millions of taxpayers from the \nalternative minimum tax. We also provided capital gains and dividends \ntax relief for small investors, which have helped increase economic \nactivity and fill the Government's coffers.\n  We continue to benefit from this tax relief we are enjoying by seeing \n8.2 million new jobs created, nearly 6 years of uninterrupted economic \nexpansion, and surging tax revenues that have far outpaced projections \nand helped lower the deficit. In fact, last month, the Congressional \nBudget Office reported that the budget deficit will fall by more than \none-third this year and is almost $20 billion lower than its previous \nestimate. Meanwhile, it was reported that the economy grew by 4 percent \nlast quarter alone.\n  Unfortunately, there are some on the other side of the aisle who want \nto fix what is not broken and roll back the progress we have made with \nthe tax relief passed in 2001 and 2003. Instead of talking about tax \nrelief for hard-working Americans, there are those who are talking \nabout raising taxes on Americans. Instead of talking about supporting \nthe American entrepreneurial spirit, some are talking about expanding \nthe size of Government and increasing Government spending.\n  First, we passed a budget a few months ago that contemplated the \nlargest tax increase in our Nation's history, not as a result of the \nvote of Members of the Congress but by allowing the temporary tax \nprovisions I mentioned a moment ago to expire without taking a single \nvote. This budget stacked the cards against taxpayers by making it \neasier for Washington to raise taxes. Then the Senate considered tax \npolicies on a so-called Energy bill that produced no new domestic \nsources of energy. Instead, it would have reinforced America's \ndependence on foreign energy sources. At the same time, we have seen \nlegislation pass that raises taxes that especially hits low- and \nmiddle-income individuals hard.\n  Next, we saw proposals rejected that would have forced Congress to \nerr on the side of the people by making it more difficult for the \nSenate to raise taxes. For example, a 60-vote point of order against \nlegislation that raises income taxes that overwhelmingly passed the \nSenate but was later stripped out during the conference committee on \nthe budget.\n  In addition, some on the other side of the aisle have proposed to \nraise the Federal gas tax at a time when the price of gasoline remains \naround $3 a gallon. They have also proposed legislation that slaps what \nI believe could accurately be called a competition tax on America's \nentrepreneurs and small businesses by making it more difficult to keep \ncapital at home and to attract capital from abroad. After all, capital \nformation is the lifeblood of domestic job creation.\n  Finally, some have actually advocated rolling back the 2001 and 2003 \ntax relief that has done so much good for American businesses and \nprovided my home of Texas with historically low unemployment rates.\n  As this chart shows, American workers will have to work 79 days just \nto pay for their Federal taxes this year. And that, of course, is on \ntop of the 41 days to pay their State and local taxes--which we can see \nfar exceeds any other category, whether it is housing and household \noperation or health and medical care or transportation, clothing, or \nother items. They are far exceeded by the Federal tax bite taken out of \nthe average taxpayer's paycheck.\n  We have been treated to an interesting debate during the Presidential \nprimaries already to see how leading Presidential candidates compare on \nvarious tax issues. We have seen proposals from the top Democratic \ncandidates to actually raise the individual tax rate to 39.6 percent \nfrom 35 percent. We have seen proposals from the top Democratic \ncandidates to tax private equity, carried interest at higher ordinary \nincome rates, and we have seen a proposal to preserve the death tax.\n  On the other hand, top Republican candidates have proposed to \npreserve the tax cuts, including the 35 percent top rate, preserving \nthe lower capital gains rate for carried interest, and we see on the \nbottom the difference in the way the top Democratic candidates for \nPresident and top Republican candidates for President would treat \ncapital gains and other taxes.\n  Invariably, it seems as if the differences are between those who \nwould take more of a tax bite out of the hard-earned income of the \nAmerican taxpayer and spend more on Federal Government and those who \nbelieve the people who earn the money deserve to keep more of what they \nearn. This tax relief has given rise to an unprecedented expansion of \nthe economy and job creation beyond some of our wildest dreams.\n  The politics of tax and spend has unfortunately crept back into \nWashington and threatened to undo a lot of good work that has been done \nover the past several years. One rather confusing example is the recent \npassage of the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. This bill increased the CHIP budget by 300 percent, \neffectively raising taxes to cover the expenditure. But this program \nhas also increased the scope of CHIP coverage to include families of \nfour with an income of more than $80,000, some 400 percent of the \npoverty level. This creates the double standard of such families being \nin need by CHIP standards but wealthy under the Tax Code. Our laws \nshould never contain such a ridiculous double standard.\n  This battle for higher taxation and fiscal irresponsibility is \nnowhere more evident than it is with the confirmation of Jim Nussle as \nthe head of the Office of Management and Budget, a nomination we will \nbe voting on later today. Despite the progress and economic boom that I \nhave described, many Members of Congress are fighting against this \nnomination, even though this former chairman of the House Budget \nCommittee was a major architect of these successful tax policies which \nI have described. The House majority leader even remarked that from\n\n[[Page S11018]]\n\n2001 to 2006 Congress had ``pursued the most fiscally irresponsible \npolicies.'' And while our current economy seems to contradict that \nstatement, the American taxpayer must certainly disagree.\n  Congressman Nussle has a long and well-established history of \nfinancial responsibility and is considered by many to be a leading \nexpert on budget issues and the Federal budget process. Congressman \nNussle has worked hard to try to pass meaningful earmark reform, even \nbefore it became a popular political rallying cry. He was instrumental \nin writing the welfare reform bill, and he successfully passed six \nbudgets. Finally, Congressman Nussle has been repeatedly praised for \nhis work on taxes by national organizations such as Americans for Tax \nReform, the National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government \nWaste, the Council for the Committee on Government Reform, and the \nNational Tax Limitations Committee.\n  As we move forward, the last thing we should do is to reverse the \npolicies that have helped bring around America's economy, reduced the \ndeficit and put more money in the pockets of Americans. Indeed, we must \npursue economic policies that encourage growth and protect the \ninterests of America's taxpayers. The best way to do that is by \nmaintaining the tax relief that has already helped millions of hard-\nworking Americans and by confirming Jim Nussle as head of the Office of \nManagement and Budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. KYL. In just a few minutes, we are going to start the discussion \nof the confirmation of Jim Nussle as head of the OMB--the Office of \nManagement and Budget. And since a lot of what he has to work with in \nterms of budget depends upon decisions we make in the U.S. Congress, I \nthought it might be a good time to review some of the economic news and \ninformation that has been coming out over the course of the last \nseveral days and weeks. The majority of this information is very \nencouraging for our future, and I will go through briefly and explain \nwhy it matters.\n  It shows, first of all, that we had 4 percent economic growth in the \nsecond quarter of this year. That is phenomenal and well above the \nhistorical average. Continuing low unemployment; now it is 4.6 percent. \nMore than 8 million jobs have been created in the course of the last 5 \nyears. And though the stock market has been up and down in recent \nweeks, it is still growing at better than 7 percent this year, which is \nvery good. In fact, since 2003, the stock market has grown at an \naverage of 12 percent, which is at about the historical average of the \nstock market. The poverty rate has declined to 12.3 percent. By \ncontrast, for example, under the Clinton administration, it averaged \n13.3 percent, so it is 4 percent lower than it was during that time.\n  Clearly, the economic growth that has characterized our economy \ngenerally has benefitted many segments of our society. Nearly 70 \npercent of Americans now own their own homes. That is higher than at \nany time, for example, during the previous administration. And the \naverage home price has increased by more than 50 percent since 2001, \nmeaning that a home worth $200,000 in 2001 is, on average, worth about \n$300,000 today. That kind of appreciation for housing has obviously \nincreased the wealth of American homeowners by literally billions of \ndollars.\n  Those are just some of the numbers, Mr. President, but I think they \nillustrate a very important point, and that is that success in the \neconomy is not an accident, first of all. We in Washington need to \nappreciate that we don't create success. That is created by the \nAmerican people--the entrepreneurs, the people who work hard, and the \nthousands, millions, literally, of decisions made every day in working \nthrough our free market economy. But government can also have a big \nimpact on whether that success exists or not by decisions we make \nrelating to regulatory and tax-and-spend policy. And what we do here, I \nthink one would have to acknowledge, can have a big impact on the \ndecisions that working Americans and investors make in their economic \nlives.\n  It is now undeniable that one of the key factors in the economic \ngrowth that I referred to earlier is the 2001 and 2003 tax relief \npassed by the Republican Congress and signed by President Bush, and it \nhas been a big boon to the economy.\n\n  Let me explain what we have done to create the conditions for growth, \nin other words. We have rewarded work and investment through lower tax \nrates. We have refused to punish success by taxing the rich even more. \nWe have given small businesses financial incentives to grow and to add \njobs to the economy, and we have encouraged investors to move their \ncapital around efficiently so that businesses can get the money they \nneed to grow.\n  We need to continue to encourage hard work, savings, and investment. \nWe need to protect the pocketbooks of working families and the cash \nregisters of the small businesses by protecting them against tax \nincreases. And, frankly, we need to stop wasteful Washington spending \nbecause when Washington goes on a spending spree, the next thing that \nhappens is politicians start looking to raise taxes.\n  Now, what are the economic plans of the Democrats by comparison? Are \nthey also aimed at encouraging growth? I would, unfortunately, say, no, \nI don't think so. Under the budget that was passed, the Democrats will \nraise taxes by $716 billion. Those new taxes would discourage \ninvestment, punish hard work, and block jobs from being created. And \nrepeatedly this year the Democratic Congress has overspent the budget. \nThe war supplemental included billions in agricultural pork projects. \nThe omnibus continuing resolution included billions in extra spending, \nand the appropriations bills that have passed out of the House of \nRepresentatives and are being considered in the Senate are all over the \nPresident's budget request. This is going to make Jim Nussle's job a \nlot more difficult.\n  And how do the tax-and-spend plans of the Democrats help economic \ngrowth? The answer is simple: not at all. The fact is, my Democratic \ncolleagues rarely talk about economic growth. They don't claim the $716 \nbillion in new taxes would be a boost to the economy, of course, \nbecause it wouldn't. Instead, they advocate new taxes and new spending \nprograms and just assume that economic growth will occur regardless of \nwhether they bust the budget and raise taxes on the American people.\n  It pains me to say it, but I don't think these folks understand why \neconomic growth matters to the average family. Otherwise they wouldn't \nbe proposing this kind of counterproductive policy. Let's look at what \nwould happen if we abandoned the current economic policies that have \nenabled our economy to grow in the last quarter, as I said, at over a 4 \npercent clip.\n  If the economy is not expanding, there will be very few new jobs. \nMost obvious and painful are the job losses. If the economy is \ncontracting, people will be losing their jobs. And there is a \nmultiplier effect. When one worker loses his job, his family and \ncommunity suffer. All the money he or she has been earning was either \nbeing spent or invested. Now, the people relying on those dollars \nsuffer as well. Those who keep their jobs will see very little wage \ngrowth, cuts in their benefits, such as health care, longer work hours, \nfor example, more people working multiple jobs and spending even less \ntime with their families.\n  You can see the multiplier effect of this kind of economic loss. And \nthere is a flip side. Without economic growth, there is no expansion of \nexisting business facilities, such as expansions to factories, which \nwould lead to more local jobs. No new businesses. For the most part, \nyou don't see large-scale business startups during economic downturns. \nAnd it is not just the potential worker for that company who loses out, \nit is the supplier and vendor and every business partner who would also \nhave the opportunity to thrive if\n\n[[Page S11019]]\n\nthe conditions were better. And your retirement suffers. Retirement \nsavings don't grow; 401(k)s and pensions and savings accounts remain \nstagnant and can even lose money. Even your Social Security suffers \nbecause government depends on economic growth for increased revenues. \nWith lower Social Security tax receipts, the date when the Social \nSecurity trust fund goes bankrupt gets even closer.\n  You can talk about these multiplier effects all day. They are very \nreal. And that is why we have to support policies that strengthen \neconomic growth and assure that American families continue to have \nopportunity rather than problems. Economic growth drives higher tax \nrevenues to the State and local and Federal Government. The economic \ngrowth since the Republican tax cuts went into effect has led to \ndramatic increases in State and Federal income taxes. Think about it--\nwe lowered taxes on everyone, but our Federal revenues to the Treasury \nhave increased. That just doesn't happen in times of recession. Just \nthe opposite occurs--there are lower tax revenues.\n  Even at the local level, with schools, for example, and cities--the \nroads, the police, the libraries, the parks--all of these things depend \nupon collecting tax revenues. Economic growth is essential at all \nlevels of government. So if you care about good schools, for example, \nyou care about economic growth.\n  Let me talk just one more little bit about the increase in taxes \nbecause this is one of the key factors that can inhibit economic \ngrowth, and it is one that concerned me most about the budget that was \npassed by the Democrats. The plan, as I said, is to repeal the 2001 and \n2003 tax rate reductions--that tax relief. Every American benefitted \nfrom those tax cuts, so this would be a big mistake for two reasons.\n  First of all, everyone received some benefit. Even those who didn't \npay taxes received money back from the Federal Government, and we \ncreated a new 10-percent bracket for the very lowest bracket of \ntaxpayers so they wouldn't have to pay as much in taxes. So it wasn't \njust people at the upper economic stratum that benefitted. It was all \nAmericans, including even some who didn't pay taxes.\n  Second, everyone benefitted not just because of the specific relief \nthey got but because the economy grew. It was John F. Kennedy who said, \nin 1963, in supporting the tax rate cuts that he proposed at that time, \nthat a rising tide lifts all boats. What he meant by that was as \neconomic growth continues, it helps everybody in our society--more jobs \ncreated, wages increased, business investment increased, and money put \nback into the communities. So even if we just passed the tax relief for \nlower income people, our economy would still be hurt. Our priorities \nshould be about encouraging economic growth and preventing a recession. \nHigh taxes and spending send us in exactly the wrong direction.\n  Well, Mr. President, let me conclude with this thought. We still have \nchallenges, obviously. We are fighting a global war against Islamic \nextremists. It is enormously costly. But that is another reason we need \na strong economy, so people have good jobs and our government has the \nrevenue it needs to address that conflict.\n  While overall inflation is extremely low, in certain specific areas, \nsuch as gasoline prices, they are too high. So we need to work on \ncreating energy independence and look at the viability of alternative \nfuels. We face rising health care costs with insurance premiums that \ncontinue to rise. This is a big issue, and obviously we are working on \nit. But Republicans know that Americans don't want radical changes that \nturn our health care into some kind of Washington-run bureaucratic \ngovernment program--a one-size-fits-all. We need patient-centered \nhealth care in this country. We can debate about these specific \nsolutions to these other problems, but without a vibrant and growing \neconomy producing more and more wealth, any of those things will be \ndifficult to address. We can help solve these problems, but the last \nthing an American family needs is the economic policies that would \nresult in higher taxes, more spending, and all of the devastating \nconsequences of economic recession.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11019-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11019-S11038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF JIM NUSSLE TO BE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND \n                                 BUDGET\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Jim Nussle, of \nIowa, to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 3 hours \nof debate on the nomination, with 2 hours equally divided between the \nchairman and ranking member of the Budget and Homeland Security \nCommittees, and 1 hour under the control of the Senator from Vermont, \nMr. Sanders.\n  Who seeks recognition? The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are now considering the nomination of \nCongressman Jim Nussle to be the next Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget. I will vote against the confirmation of Mr. \nNussle. I have informed him this morning that I would cast that vote.\n  I do not make this decision lightly. I like Jim Nussle. I worked with \nhim when he was the House Budget Committee chairman. We have always had \na good personal relationship. But this goes beyond a personal \nrelationship; this is a question of the fiscal policy of the United \nStates. Congressman Nussle would be quick to tell you that he has been \nan architect of this fiscal policy. Of course, the key architect has \nbeen the President of the United States, but Mr. Nussle has been a \nstrong ally of the President in constructing this fiscal policy. I \nbelieve it is a profound mistake for this country and one that simply \nmust be changed. To send a signal, I will cast my vote in opposition to \nthe confirmation of Mr. Nussle.\n  Let me say, I voted to move his nomination through the Budget \nCommittee. I said at the time that he is clearly qualified, which he \nclearly is. He is, after all, the former chairman of the House Budget \nCommittee. But this is a question of what policy do we pursue for the \nfuture. Congressman Nussle has indicated that in fact he is proud of \nthe policy that has been put in place. That is where we profoundly \ndisagree. I believe this is a consequential vote, to send a signal on \nwhat we believe the fiscal policy of the United States should be, going \nforward.\n  Here is the record. When the President came into office he inherited \na surplus. In fact, there was a projected surplus at the time of almost \n$6 trillion over the next 10 years. We all know what happened. The \nPresident turned that into massive and record deficits, in fact, the \nlargest deficits in our history. Part of that was because the President \nincreased spending and increased it rather dramatically. He increased \nit from $1.9 trillion a year to $2.7 trillion, almost a 50-percent \nincrease. We know Iraq was one part of that. He told us at the time \nthat he engaged our forces in Iraq that that would cost about $50 \nbillion; the whole enterprise in Iraq would cost some $50 billion. \nInstead, we are at $567 billion and counting. He has already asked for \nanother $50 billion which would take us over $600 billion committed to \nIraq, 12 times the President's original estimate.\n  At the same time that spending has gone up dramatically, revenues of \nthe country have basically stagnated and stagnated over a 6- or 7-year \nperiod. Going back to 2000, you can see that real, inflation-adjusted \nrevenues of the United States were just over $2 trillion. We didn't get \nback to that amount until last year. This year we are anticipating \n$2.13 trillion in real revenue.\n  Spending is up dramatically. Real revenue has stagnated. The result \nis deficits and debt have soared and that is precisely what has \nhappened. Here is the debt of the United States during this period. We \nhave gone from $5.8 trillion at the end of the first year of the \nPresident's time in office to $8.9 trillion in 2007. That is a stunning \nincrease in debt.\n  Unfortunately, increasingly it is financed from abroad. This is \nforeign holdings of U.S. debt. You can see we have gone from a combined \ntotal when this President took over of just over $1\n\n[[Page S11020]]\n\ntrillion of U.S. debt held by foreign entities, and look what has \nhappened during this 6 years of this administration. He has more than \ndoubled foreign holdings of our debt.\n  Some of our friends will say that is a sign of strength. I don't know \nin whose mind that is a sign of strength. Owing more countries more \nmoney doesn't strike me as a sign of strength. In fact, here is the \nlist of the 10 top holders of U.S. debt. Japan we now owe over $600 \nbillion; we owe China over $400 billion; we owe the United Kingdom \nalmost $200 billion; we owe the ``Oil Exporters'' $120 billion; we owe \nBrazil, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and--my favorite--\nthe Caribbean Banking Centers. We owe them almost $50 billion as of \nnow.\n  I am always amused to hear our colleagues say they have done this \nwith a tax policy that has increased the progressivity of the tax \nsystem. I don't know what calculation would lead to you that \nconclusion. The fact is, in 2006 alone, those earning over $1 million a \nyear got on average a tax cut of almost $120,000--for that year alone. \nSomebody earning less than $100,000 got less than $700 in tax cuts.\n  Again, those earning over $1 million a year--and I have nothing \nagainst people being successful financially. I am all for it. I wish \nthe success of this country were more broadly shared. That would be a \ngood thing. That would be a positive value. But I must say our friends \non the other side are incredibly focused on helping the very wealthiest \namong us, so they chose a tax policy that gave, on average, to those \nearning over $1 million a year a tax cut approaching $120,000 in 1 \nyear. That is not my idea of broadly shared tax policy, or one that is \nfair and equitable.\n  In fact, we know the cost of the President's tax cuts for 2007 alone, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, is $205 billion. That is \nmore than the projected deficit. So for this year the President's tax \ncuts that go overwhelmingly to the most wealthy among us are totally \nand completely responsible for the deficit.\n  The President's answer is more tax cuts. Here is what we are told \nwill happen if the additional tax cuts the President is seeking and the \ncurrent tax cuts are extended. The additional debt that will result is \nthe red part of this chart. The green part of the chart is the debt if \nthe tax cuts expired or are paid for.\n  I heard our colleagues on the other side say the budget passed by the \nDemocrats had big tax increases. No, it did not. There was no \nassumption of a tax increase of any kind in the budget we passed. In \nfact, we had very dramatic tax relief, tax relief for middle-class \ntaxpayers, the continuation of the middle-class tax cuts, as well as \nestate tax reform. We assumed that things would be paid for--not with \ntax increases but by closing tax loopholes, by going after the tax \ngap--the difference between what is owed and what is paid--by closing \ndown abusive tax shelters. That is precisely what we ought to be doing \nin this country to stop the tax scams that have exploded.\n\n  I have also heard that the economy is performing splendidly. The \nproblem with that is if you compare this recovery to the nine previous \nrecoveries since World War II, what you see is dramatic \nunderperformance. In fact, if you look at real revenues you find we are \n$86 billion short of the typical recovery since World War II.\n  If we look at job creation, we see we are lagging behind the typical \nrecovery since World War II by 7.6 million private sector jobs.\n  On real business investment, the pattern is the same. We are 63 \npercent behind the typical recovery since World War II, in terms of \nreal business investment.\n  In terms of economic growth we see the same pattern. The real GDP \naverage annual growth during the nine previous business cycles, the \nnine previous recoveries since World War II, is 3.4 percent; this \nrecovery, a tepid 2.5 percent. This is not an economic record one can \nbe proud of or be talking about in very positive terms because it is an \neconomic recovery that has been among the weakest of the nine major \nrecoveries since World War II.\n  Here is what happens to spending under our budget resolution. We take \nit from 20.5 percent of GDP this year down to 18.9 percent. This is a \nfiscally responsible budget.\n  With respect to the budget resolution and the difference between it \nand the President's plan, we have only 1 percent more spending than the \nBush budget--1 percent. And where did that additional spending go? We \nput it into veterans' health care, children's health and education. \nThose ought to be the priorities for this country--to take care of the \nveterans to whom we made a promise when we sent them off to war that \nthey would be cared for. This administration did not ask for sufficient \nresources to keep that promise. We did.\n  On children's health care, we said we ought to begin a process of \ntrying to cover all of the children in this country. The administration \ndid not agree with that priority, nor did they agree to expand the \nsupport for education that we think is required if we are going to keep \nour country No. 1.\n  With respect to overall revenues, it is very interesting to look at \nwhat the President called for in his budget. He called for $14.826 \ntrillion in revenue. That is what he called for in his budget scored by \nhis own agency: $14.826 trillion. Our budget called for $14.828 \ntrillion--virtually no difference. When they talk about the largest tax \nincrease in history, they are engaging in a figment of their \nimagination.\n  If you use CBO scoring for both instead of using the President's own \nagency to score his own proposal, which I think is eminently fair--but \nif you use CBO to score both, we have a 2-percent difference in \nrevenues and we believe that can be easily achieved by closing abusive \ntax shelters, going after these offshore tax havens, and by beginning \nto close this looming tax cap gap, the difference between what is owed \nand what is paid, with no tax increase at all.\n  Let me conclude by citing Treasury Secretary Snow. He acknowledged \nthe need for a bipartisan approach to solving long-term challenges. He \nsaid, ``You can't do health care reform or Social Security reform . . . \nwithout a bipartisan consensus. If we made a mistake, it was not \napproaching it in more of a bipartisan way.''\n  That is the former Secretary of Treasury under this administration \nlamenting the fact that they were not sufficiently bipartisan. That is \nprecisely what is needed in this town, is a more bipartisan approach to \ndealing with the fiscal challenges facing this country.\n  I hope very much that this administration gets the message that we \nneed to change course for the fiscal future of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to rise on behalf of supporting \nCongressman Nussle, who has been nominated to be head of OMB. I also \nwant to thank the chairman of the Budget Subcommittee for the courteous \nand professional way he always proceeds in bringing this nomination \nforward. He could have slow-walked it; he could have held it up. He did \nnot. I appreciate that. I know Members on our side appreciate that. \nThat is the approach he has taken as chairman; he has always been fair. \nWe do appreciate that very much.\n  I would note that in his closing statement, he called for \nbipartisanship. It was a bipartisan act on his part to report Mr. \nNussle out. It would even be more of a bipartisan act if he voted for \nMr. Nussle. That would be truly a bipartisan act.\n  Let me note that the debate here is not about Congressman Nussle or \nhis qualifications. As chairman of the Budget Committee in the House, \nhe clearly is qualified to do this job. It is the President's \nprerogative to pick whomever he wants to be OMB Director; it is really \nan in-house job, really an arm of the White House, and so he has \ntremendous leverage in this area, in my humble opinion, latitude in \nthis area.\n  So really today is going to be more about a debate of where the two \nparties stand on economic policies. And there are significant \ndifferences here. All we need to do is to return to the ``scene of the \ncrime,'' otherwise known as the Democratic budget which passed this \nCongress, a budget which dramatically increased the taxes by $900 \nbillion, a budget which dramatically increased the spending on the \ndiscretionary side\n\n[[Page S11021]]\n\nby $22 billion this year and $205 billion over the term of the budget, \na budget which did not address or even attempt to address the most \nsignificant problem we have on the spending side of the ledger, which \nis the issue of how we deal with the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration and the programs which benefit that generation--Medicare, \nSocial Security specifically, Medicaid to a lesser degree--and the fact \nthat those programs are going to drain our children and our children's \nchildren's opportunities to be successful and to have quality \nlifestyles because the cost of those programs is going to simply \noverwhelm the next generations because we will have done nothing as a \nresult of the budget that passed this Congress under the Democratic \nleadership to address those issues.\n  But before we return to that issue, let me just simply highlight a \nfew points which I think have been spun a little bit by the other side \nof the aisle, which are the issues of what these tax cuts which were \nput in place by this President at the beginning of his term have done \nand how the economy has grown.\n  First off, as a result of these tax cuts, in large part, and as a \nresult of the economic policies of this administration, we have now \nseen 23--I think it is actually 24--consecutive quarters of economic \ngrowth, which is a pretty good experience for our Nation. In addition, \nwe have added 8.3 million jobs--8.3 million jobs. In fact, the mean \nincome of Americans has grown faster during the term of this President \nthan it did under the term of President Clinton.\n  In addition, we have seen that revenues are now exceeding the \nhistoric projections by significant amounts. We have seen in the last 4 \nyears revenue increases to the Federal Government which have \noutstripped anything in our history as a percentage of growth. \nHistorically, revenues to the Federal Government have been about 18.2 \npercent of gross national product. Now they are up around 18.6 percent, \nand they are continuing to go up.\n  What has caused this huge influx of revenues to the Federal \nGovernment? What has caused it is that we put in place a fair tax \npolicy which said to entrepreneurial Americans, to working Americans: \nGo out, invest, take risks, make this economy grow, create jobs. As a \nresult of saying that to American entrepreneurs and to working \nAmericans, we have seen this economic expansion. It is an economic \nexpansion that has not only benefited the average American by giving \nthem a better job and more jobs and a higher income rate of growth, but \nit has obviously benefited the Federal Government because the Treasury \nhas seen a huge influx in revenues from this economic growth, which has \nbeen energized in large part by the tax cuts which were put in place in \nthe early part of this administration.\n  Now we see a policy coming forward from the other side of the aisle, \nas defined by their budget, which even they admit increased taxes by \n$400 billion over 5 years and arguably increased them by $900 billion \nover 5 years. And where are those revenues going to come from? Well, if \nyou listen to the chairman of the Budget Committee, they are just going \nto come from collecting money debt, from waste and fraud. Well, those \nare classic obfuscations. The simple fact is that we heard from the \nRevenue Commissioner. He said he could not collect any more than maybe \n$20 billion or $30 billion in addition to the revenues we are already \ncollecting over a 5-year period; nowhere near $400 billion or $900 \nbillion.\n  No, you have to listen to the Democratic Party's leadership, not that \nthe Senator from North Dakota is not one of their leaders; he is, and \nhe is one of their best leaders, by the way. But the people running for \nPresident, what are they proposing? Well, they are proposing primarily \nthat we eliminate the capital gains rate which was put in place, the \ndividend rate which was put in place. Those are the two primary places \nthey are proposing raising revenues. But they are also proposing \nraising the marginal tax rate. They are proposing the Senator Levin \nproposal, which would require that we book all expenses for tax \npurposes. They are proposing a repeal of carry interest, which is a way \nthat entrepreneurs invest and take advantage of that investment and \ngenerate more investment. They are proposing to eliminate deferrals. \nProposal after proposal after proposal is coming out of the Democratic \ncandidates for President, almost at a rate which makes your head spin. \nThe only thing that is coming out faster are proposals to spend money. \nAnd believe me, we know because in New Hampshire we are listening to \nall of this.\n  I had the fortune--good fortune, I suppose, or the fortune anyway--to \nlisten to the Senator from New York, followed by the Senator from Ohio, \nfollowed by the Senator from North Carolina, all coming to New \nHampshire in sequence. I listened to all three of their speeches, and I \ncouldn't keep up with how much money they were going to spend because \nthey were proposing so many new programs. It was like watching a \nwhirligig. Every 10 seconds there would be a new program, new program, \nnew program, followed by taxes, taxes, taxes, taxes.\n\n  Well, I think one thing we should have learned, both from the \nexperience of President Kennedy and President Reagan and now President \nBush, is that when you start to raise taxes on those who are willing to \ntake risks and invest and as a result create jobs in this economy, you \nslow the rate of growth of the economy. Why is that? It is human \nnature. You also slow the rate of growth of revenues to the Federal \nGovernment. Why is that? It is human nature. You raise taxes on people \nand they will change their economic activity to try to avoid taxes. It \nhas been proven year in and year out. You get tax rates to a certain \nlevel and people simply don't invest in taxable activities. Thus, they \nmisuse capital. It is inefficiently used, so fewer jobs are created, \nless economic activity occurs. If you increase taxes, people will \ninvest in a way to try to avoid paying taxes, and thus the revenues to \nthe Federal Government will drop off.\n  OMB, Joint Tax all estimated that when this capital gains cut rate \nwas put in place at 15 percent, that over a 5-year period there would \nbe a $3 billion loss. They used a static model. They used 1950 \neconomics, they used Galbraith thought, Harvard thought, Princeton \nthought on what economics is, which basically says that if you just \nraise taxes, you get more revenues. They missed the Chicago school, I \nthink, they missed the Kennedy school--I mean by that John Kennedy \nhimself, the President--they missed the Reagan school, which has proven \nby fact that when you cut taxes on productive activity to a reasonable \nlevel, you create more productive activity. So instead of having a $3 \nbillion loss of revenue over that 5-year period, which was what we were \ntold we were going to have, we have had a $100 billion increase over \nthe estimates over that period in capital gains revenue. Huge \nexpansion. That is, quite honestly, why the deficit has come down \ndramatically. These are the numbers here.\n  Equally interesting--and we hear this on the other side: Well, the \ntax was for wealthy people; they are the ones who got the tax break. \nWell, yes, that is true. But why is that? Well, it is because the top \n20 percent of Americans pay the taxes, for a large part. Eighty-five \npercent of American income taxes are paid by the top 20 percent--85 \npercent. Eighty-five percent of American income taxes are paid by the \ntop 20 percent of income receivers in our economy. If you are in the \ntop 20 percent, you are paying the taxes. So if there is a tax \nreduction, you are probably going to get that reduction. That is not \nthe issue. The issue is, Are the top 20 percent paying a fair share?\n  Well, under the Clinton administration--and I do not think anybody on \nthe other side of the aisle is going to argue that the Clinton \nadministration was pro the high-income individual in the sense of tax \npolicy--under the Clinton administration, 81 percent of the taxes in \nAmerica were borne by the top 20 percent. But under the Bush \nadministration, 85 percent of the tax burden of America is now borne by \nthe top 20 percent. So the Bush administration has actually made the \ntax laws more progressive. Why is that? Human nature. If you create a \nfair tax policy, people will pay taxes. If you have an unfair tax \npolicy, where taxes are too high, such as what is proposed by the other \nside of the aisle, in the area of dividends, capital gains, marginal \nrates, expensing, carry interest, you go on and on and on, people do \ntax avoidance, they invest in shelters, they go\n\n[[Page S11022]]\n\nout and buy cattle that do not exist or subways that do not exist. That \nis inefficient for the economy, it does not create jobs, and it reduces \nrevenues. What the Bush administration understands, what the John \nKennedy administration understood, what the Ronald Reagan \nadministration understood, is that when you create a tax policy which \nis fair, high-income people pay more taxes, and that is the way it is \ntoday.\n  There is another interesting thing about the Bush tax policy. The \nbottom 40 percent, the people in the bottom 40 percent of incomes in \nthis country, they actually do not pay income taxes as a group. \nIndividuals obviously do, but as a group they do not pay income taxes. \nUnder the Clinton administration, they got 1.6 percent of benefits back \nbecause they got the earned-income tax credit. Under the Bush \nadministration, they are getting almost twice that back under the \nearned-income tax credit. So not only do you have the high-income \npeople paying more in taxes as a percentage of the total, but you have \nthe people in the moderate income and lower income levels actually \ngetting more back from the income taxes. That is called progressivity. \nThat is what you want in a tax system--progressivity that produces \nrevenue, revenue at historic rates. So this argument that we do not \nhave a reasonable tax policy in place that is generating revenues is a \nlittle bit--it flies in the face of fact, especially on the issue of \ncapital gains and dividends.\n  Remember something else about capital gains and dividends: \ndisproportionate benefiters from the capital gains rate and dividend \nrate are seniors. It is seniors who have capital gains income as they \nsell their homes in which they have lived all of their lives and move \non to some other lifestyle; it is seniors who have dividend income \nbecause they have fixed incomes and they have left their earning jobs. \nSo when these folks on the other side of the aisle who are being spoken \nfor by their leadership who are running for President call for a \ndividend increase and the capital gains increase, they are calling for \nan increase of taxes on our seniors, no doubt about that.\n  Now, there have been some other arguments made here, returning to the \nscene of the crime, as I said, the Democratic budget. There has been a \nclaim that they used pay-go as a way to discipline spending around this \nplace. Pay-go. Pay-go. ``Swiss-cheese-go'' should be the term, ``Swiss-\ncheese-go.'' Every time they have a spending program around here that \nthey want to spend money on, pay-go disappears. Where did it go? I do \nnot know where it went. Maybe it went under this desk somewhere. Maybe \nit is under this desk. But it is not around here whenever we are trying \nto spend money. There is no enforcement. Look at these bills which have \nbeen brought out just this year which should have been subject to pay-\ngo, which have not been subject to pay-go--bill after bill after bill, \nthe worst being, of course, the SCHIP bill that was just brought out \nbefore we departed, but there are other ones. There is a whole series \nof them. I won't go through them; they are too numerous to even mention \nany more. So let's hear no more about this pay-go as being a budget \nenforcement mechanism. It is a nice phrase. It was used aggressively by \nall of the people who ran for the Senate in the last election on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle as the way they were going to discipline \nspending around this place. It has not been used to discipline spending \nat all, and it won't be in the future.\n  Now, what we are talking about here is very simple. The budget \nbrought forward by the other side of the aisle increased taxes over \nwhat the President probably would have had to do because of the AMT \nissue by at least $400 billion, probably closer to $450 billion. It \nthen turned around and spent those tax increases to the tune of \nsomewhere around $210 billion plus. In addition, it did not address \nentitlement spending, which is the key issue that confronts the United \nStates as a nation. It did nothing about disciplining our own fiscal \nhouse by putting in place procedural mechanisms which would allow us to \ndiscipline.\n\n  I find the argument that the reason people are going to vote against \nCongressman Nussle to be Director of the OMB because of the fiscal \npolicies of this President to be a bit disingenuous. Is it that they \ndon't like 23 quarters of fiscal expansion and growth? Is it that they \ndon't like 8.5 million new jobs? Is it that they don't like revenues \nbeing at an historic increase over the last 4 years and now being up to \nabout 18.7 percent of gross national product, which exceeds the norm? \nIs it that they don't like the fact that seniors now have a reasonable \ntax rate on their capital gains and a reasonable tax rate on their \ndividends? It must be because that is the economic policy they are \nclaiming has not worked and isn't appropriate and, therefore, they are \ngoing to vote in protest against Congressman Nussle.\n  In my view, I hope Congressman Nussle continues these policies. I \nhope the President will move down the road of fiscal discipline and \nwill continue to give us a tax policy which is fair, balanced, reduces \nrevenue for the Federal Government, gives entrepreneurs a reason to go \nout there and work and take risks and thus create jobs for Americans \nand giant revenue increases for the Government.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the balance of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. At this point, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that following my presentation, \nSenator Sanders be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank my colleagues for their courtesy.\n  Madam President, I sat here enormously entertained by my friend from \nNew Hampshire. It was an almost unbelievable presentation. I will deal \nwith a couple of points in a few minutes.\n  Let me first say we have the nomination in front of us of former \nCongressman Nussle, who was part of the crowd who early on in this \nadministration, as a new administration took shape, came to town with \ntheir allies in Congress, including Congressman Nussle, and said: We \nsee at the end of the Clinton administration very large, proposed, \nprojected budget surpluses. Let's put in place very large tax cuts, \nmostly to wealthy Americans.\n  Some of us said: Maybe that is not the conservative way to do things. \nMaybe we should wait a bit and see whether the actual surpluses do \nmaterialize.\n  No, no, they said. We are going to stick in these big tax cuts, most \nto wealthy Americans, because that is the way things work. We believe \nin the trickle down theory.\n  Guess what. That crowd had their way. I didn't vote for it, but they \nhad their way. Mr. Nussle, the nominee, chairman of the House Budget \nCommittee, the President, and others in the team had their way. The \nresult, of course, we all understand: A $5.6 trillion projected budget \nsurplus was turned in to a projected deficit of $3 trillion. That is \nduring Mr. Nussle's time.\n  There was actually one person in the crowd who didn't go along with \nit. He got fired. His name was Paul O'Neill. Paul O'Neill said he tried \nto warn the administration that the growing budget deficits expected to \ntop hundreds of billions of dollars posed a threat to the economy. The \nVice President, Mr. Cheney, said, quoting from the book that was \nwritten about this:\n\n       You know, Paul, Reagan proves that deficits don't matter.\n\n  That is the crowd we are talking about, deficits don't matter. That \ncomes from the Vice President, but it could have come from the nominee \nbefore us because it is all part of the same crowd, believing in the \nsame thing.\n  It is fascinating to me that the previous speaker talked about how \nwonderful things are going. This economic engine of ours is purring \njust fine. I guess it is, if you live in the right neighborhood and \ndrive the right vehicle. A whole lot of folks got up this morning to \nwork hard all day, struggle to pay their bills. They are the kind of \npeople who know about seconds. They know about second shifts, second \njob, second hand, second mortgage, and they take second place every \nsingle day when we have this debate on the Senate floor by people such \nas my colleague who said things are going well for everybody.\n\n[[Page S11023]]\n\n  Let me describe what we have in our Tax Code. The second wealthiest \nman in the world, Mr. Warren Buffett, a man I greatly admire, said he \nthinks our Tax Code doesn't work at all. He said: If this is class war, \nmy side is winning. The second richest man in the world says he pays a \nlower income tax rate than the receptionist in his office. He thinks \nthat is wrong. So do I. Why? Because my colleague is describing his \nphilosophy. We need to reward investment.\n  How about rewarding work for a change? The philosophy on the other \nside is, let's exempt income from investment and tax work. Why is work \nless worthy than investment? Tell me. You think this works well. You \nbelieve this system this crowd has put together makes sense? When the \nsecond richest man in the world says: By the way, this system allows me \nto pay a lower tax rate than the receptionist in my office, are you \nproud of that? That is what you are bragging about?\n\n  And spending, I keep seeing the disjointed fingers point to the \nDemocratic side on spending. There is no one who has proposed more \nspending in the history of this country than the Bush administration. \nCertainly, no one has proposed higher and larger deficits in the \nhistory of this country than this administration. So it is a little \ntired for us to hear about big spending. No one can match the big \nspending habits of this administration.\n  One more point: We have in front of us in this Chamber a $145 billion \nproposal for additional emergency funds for the Department of Defense \nfor Iraq and Afghanistan. We read in the paper recently there is \nanother $50 billion expected on the way which means there will be in \nfront of us $195 billion in requested funding by this President for the \nwar in Iraq and Afghanistan. Incidentally, he proposes it all be judged \nas an emergency so none of it has to be paid for. So we will continue \nto send soldiers to war and then ask them to come back to pay down the \ndebt because we didn't as a country decide to do it. This President \ndidn't want to do it. This President said: I want all of that money on \nan emergency basis. Talk about a fiscal policy that is out of balance, \none that lacks values, one that I think shortchanges American workers, \none that certainly shortchanges this country's future--this is the \npolicy.\n  The fact is, this nominee is a significant part of the engine for \nthat policy. He served as chairman of the House Budget Committee for 6 \nyears during the period of the origination of this policy. Three of \nthose 6 years they couldn't even get a budget together. Three of those \nyears had the highest budget deficits in history, and we still hear \npeople bragging about the content of that fiscal policy? Are they \nkidding? It is unbelievable. It is, I suppose, because we all get up \nand shower in the morning before putting suits on. Those people who \nshower in the evening after a hard day's work, they don't have it quite \nso good. The fact is, they are the ones who pay the bills, pay taxes, \nstruggle to make ends meet.\n  Talk about creating jobs in these years. The job creation is anemic \nwith this administration. Take a look at the number of jobs created \nover the years of this administration and evaluate what we needed to \ncreate to keep pace. We are not anywhere close to that.\n  Finally, all this debt that has been racked up by this crowd with \nthis fiscal policy, guess who holds a substantial amount of that debt. \nWe borrow money from China and Japan to finance a war in Iraq. That is \nunbelievable to me.\n  From my standpoint, I don't intend to vote for this nominee. It is \nnot so much about this nominee. I generally vote for a President's \nchoices for the Cabinet. But in this case, it is time for us to decide \nto send a message, a message the American people already understand: \nThis fiscal policy doesn't work. This fiscal policy is built on a \nfoundation of quicksand. We already know the result. We see it year \nafter year after year.\n  I intend to vote against this nominee. My hope is that, perhaps \nthrough this debate, we will decide there is a better fiscal policy, \none that requires responsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we now go \nto Senator Wyden for 8 minutes, followed by Senator Collins for 10 \nminutes, Senator Lieberman for 10 minutes, and then to Senator Sanders \nfor his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, a week ago there was a Government report \nthat said more about what is ahead for the Federal budget than anything \nelse. The Census Bureau reported a moral abomination. Here in the \nrichest country on Earth, more than 2 million additional Americans are \nwithout health insurance. With many more citizens one health premium \nrate hike away from joining the ranks of the uninsured, the next \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget must face up to a stark \nfact. America's dysfunctional health care system, with its rising \ncosts, hefty increases in chronic illness and unique hardship for \nemployers, will drive the future of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social \nSecurity, our largest domestic Government programs.\n  At his confirmation hearing, the Washington Post reported that Jim \nNussle repeatedly said how honored he would be to continue to discuss \nthe issues raised that morning. My message today for the nominee is \nstraightforward. If Jim Nussle wants the position of director of OMB to \nbe more than an honorary title, he is going to have to work with the \nCongress on a bipartisan basis on critical issues such as fixing health \ncare, the premier domestic issue of our time. He cannot do that job \nwithout bipartisanship.\n  I suggest there are several opportunities for just that. Senator \nBaucus, Senator Grassley, Senator Rockefeller, and Senator Hatch have \nworked hard to expand coverage for our Nation's youngsters. The \nadministration has indicated they would veto that legislation. I hope \nif Jim Nussle is confirmed as the head of the Office of Management and \nBudget, he will be a voice for bringing all sides together and bringing \ntogether all sides quickly to get that legislation passed and provide \nadditional protection for our youngsters. If that is accomplished, then \nit would be possible late this fall to move on to broader legislation \nto fix health care. I and Senator Bennett, in the first bipartisan \nhealth reform bill brought to the Senate in more than 13 years, have \nproposed legislation, which has also been sponsored by Senators Nelson, \nGregg, and Alexander, that addresses other key issues such as the Tax \nCode in American health care.\n  The Tax Code today disproportionately favors the richest and promotes \ninefficiency at the same time. We have largely sick care in America, \nnot health care. Medicare Part A will pay thousands for seniors' \nhospital bills, and then Medicare Part B will pay hardly anything for \nprevention.\n  The administration would have the opportunity to work with Democrats \nand Republicans on a bipartisan basis to fix health care if someone \nsuch as Jim Nussle, confirmed as the head of Office of Management and \nBudget, wanted to change course with the administration's previous \npriorities.\n  In his hearing in the Budget Committee, I noted Jim Nussle was \ninterested in a number of key domestic issues in working for reforms. \nIn my fair flat tax legislation, for example, we take away the \ndiscrimination against work in the Tax Code. Jim Nussle indicated he \nwould be willing to work on tax reform and maybe can convince an \nadministration that has not given the issue the time of day to get back \nto it.\n  So it is my hope, having voted for the nominee in the committee \nbecause he pledged he would work on bipartisan issues such as health \ncare and tax reform, to give him that opportunity. I have disagreed and \ndisagreed profoundly with the administration's priorities, particularly \nas they relate to health care and taxes. It has been my sense--because \nin the Senate if you want to get anything done that is important, it \nhas to be bipartisan--we need individuals to step up and say they are \ngoing to try to bring both sides together. My colleagues have mentioned \nthat has not been the record, unfortunately, of Congressman Nussle in \nthe past. But he told us at his confirmation hearing on key domestic \nissues--the domestic issues that are going to drive the future of \nAmerica's\n\n[[Page S11024]]\n\neconomy--he would be willing to work in a bipartisan kind of way. We \nhave given him that opportunity. We have given him that opportunity on \nthe CHIP legislation, with four Senators working in a bipartisan way to \nhelp America's youngsters. Senator Bennett and I and Senators Alexander \nand Gregg and Nelson are giving that opportunity for broader health \ncare reform as well.\n  My hope is Jim Nussle will do what he pledged to do in his \nconfirmation hearing, which is to work with both sides of the aisle so \nwe do not waste another 2 years. That is really the alternative--just \nto say we are pretty much done until after the next election. Senator \nBennett and I do not want to do that on fixing American health care. We \nhave Senators who do not want to do that on the CHIP legislation. \nBecause it is my hope Jim Nussle will try to work in a bipartisan way \non these issues, I intend to vote for the nominee this afternoon.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nCongressman Jim Nussle to serve as the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget.\n  The Congressman served his Iowa district in the House through eight \nCongresses, chairing the House Budget Committee for the last three. \nDuring that time and in his testimony before both the Budget Committee \nand the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, the \nCongressman demonstrated an encyclopedic grasp of the Federal budget, \nskill in the legislative process, and an understanding of the \nimportance of good relationships between the executive branch and \nCongress.\n  A spirit of cooperation has seldom been so needed as it is right now. \nMuch unfinished work on the appropriations bills awaits us. Before the \nend of next year, the work of transitioning to a new administration \nwill begin. Regardless of which party occupies the White House, America \nwill have moved steadily closer to a looming fiscal crisis as baby boom \ndemographics collide with unfunded entitlement obligations. Devising a \nfiscal policy that will honor our commitments and meet vital needs \nwithout throttling economic growth will be a huge challenge for the \nFederal Government. I believe Congressman Nussle can help us meet that \nchallenge. With his blend of knowledge, experience, and personal \nengagement--he told our committee in July: ``I love the budget''--\nCongressman Nussle can help us define issues, illuminate choices, and \ndebate decisions. His endorsements by Senator Tom Harkin and by House \nDemocratic Budget Committee Chairman Spratt, as well as the \noverwhelming votes he received from both the Budget Committee and the \nHomeland Security Committee, demonstrate a bipartisan consensus for \nthis nominee.\n  As the Presiding Officer understands better than many people, \nbudgets, of course, are not the only concern of the Office of \nManagement and Budget. OMB also assists the President in developing and \nexecuting policies and programs. In particular, OMB is involved with \nlegislative, regulatory, procurement, e-government, and management \nissues. It is not only a locus of authority within the executive branch \nbut also a critical interface between the President and Congress, \nhelping to set direction for the mechanisms of Government.\n  As Director of OMB, Congressman Nussle would have great influence on \na number of important policy issues aside from helping to formulate and \npresent the President's budget.\n  One of these critical issues is the amount of waste and the lack of \neffective oversight in Federal contracting. The committee which I was \nprivileged to chair and now am the ranking member of, with Senator \nLieberman as our chairman, held extensive hearings last year on the \ndisaster responses on the gulf coast and also on contracting operations \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. We found the problems of waste, fraud, and \nabuse in Federal contracting are enormous. Here are just a few \nexamples:\n  We found that trailers bought to shelter disaster victims following \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita were undeployable in the areas where they \nwere most needed.\n  We found repeated pipeline-laying attempts in Iraq used techniques \nunsuited to the terrain. We found problems in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nsuch as $2.3 million in contracts for the Babylon Police Academy in \nIraq which was spent unnecessarily or without proper accounting and \nschools built in Afghanistan that collapsed under the weight of the \nfirst snow.\n  Unfortunately, the examples of poor process and outrageous outcomes \nin our contracting system are legion, and they are not confined to \ndisaster response or operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. That is why \nseveral of us on the committee--Senators Lieberman, Akaka, Carper, \nColeman, McCaskill and I--have joined in authoring legislation to \nimprove our procurement system to obtain better value for taxpayers' \ndollars. I am hopeful our legislation, which was reported favorably by \nthe committee on August 1, will soon be taken up by the full Senate. It \nwould increase competition, transparency, and accountability in \nGovernment contracting and address the critical shortage of qualified \nGovernment procurement personnel.\n  This issue is obviously a high priority for me, and I am encouraged \nby the Congressman's responses to my questions. They demonstrate his \ncommitment to working to resolve the concerns many of us have about \nwasteful spending in Government contracting.\n  He spoke of ``a broad range of issues that are in need of careful \nattention, including enhancing competition, strengthening the \nworkforce, and improving transparency and accountability.'' I view this \nresponse by Congressman Nussle as an encouraging sign of a shared \nviewpoint on the need to improve performance in an area that accounts \nfor more than $400 billion a year in spending.\n  I was, however, less heartened by Congressman Nussle's responses to \nquestions about the Department of Homeland Security's grants for State \nand local programs, for assistance to firefighters, and for emergency \nmanagement performance. These programs face great cuts under the budget \nproposed by the administration. Fortunately, we have acted to reject \nsome of those proposed cuts and to respond in a more appropriate way.\n  The DHS defense of these proposed cuts noted that substantial \nunexpended funds from prior years are still ``in the pipeline.'' \nCongressman Nussle appears to share the DHS view that this factor \nmitigates proposed budget cuts. As the National Governors Association \nhas pointed out, however, planning and coordination to deal with new \ngrants and the procurement process all take time, so that not every \ngranted dollar can be swiftly committed. The Governors further note \nthat States are, in fact, meeting statutory deadlines for obligating \nand expending funds.\n  Homeland security grants are a critical factor in strengthening the \nNation's security. These funds allow States and localities to fund \nplanning, equipment, training, and exercises to prevent terrorist \nattacks; support intelligence gathering and information sharing through \nfusion centers; establish interoperable communications systems; prepare \nfor mass-casualty incidents; and expand citizen involvement in all-\nhazards emergency preparedness.\n  I would encourage the Congressman, should he be confirmed--and I hope \nhe will be--to reexamine the facts and figures on homeland security \ngrants, particularly as we move into a new budget cycle for fiscal year \n2008. States and communities must receive adequate assistance to \nconduct their critical roles in helping to prevent terrorist attacks \nand respond to emergencies of all types.\n  Turning from budget to management issues, I was also interested in \nCongressman Nussle's views on Federal agency performance as measured by \nthe President's Management Scorecard. For most agencies, the weak spot \nis financial management. Indeed, poor financial management hobbles \noverall planning, management efforts, and the wise use of taxpayers' \ndollars in far too many agencies. At a time when making good use of \nevery tax dollar is critical, it is simply intolerable for any agency \nto be unable to track how, when, for what purpose, and with what result \nit spends the taxpayers' money.\n  In March of 2007, the OMB scorecard showed that 14 of 26 agencies \nreceived unsatisfactory marks in financial performance. But here is \nwhat is perhaps\n\n[[Page S11025]]\n\nmost ironic and most troubling: OMB itself, to my dismay, had the worst \nratings of any agency surveyed, receiving unsatisfactory scores in four \nout of five areas.\n  While noting various agencies' improvements in issuing timely \nfinancial statements, reducing auditor-identified weaknesses, and \nobtaining clean audit opinions, Congressman Nussle told us, ``We should \nnot be satisfied if any Federal agency has unsatisfactory financial \nperformance.'' Indeed, we shall not.\n  I would note that Congressman Nussle told our committee that he \nconsiders OMB's management-scorecard rankings as ``unacceptably low'' \nand he has pledged to work to improve them as Director of OMB. I \nwelcome that commitment, not simply because OMB should stand as an \nexample to other executive branch agencies but also because its \ncritical work with those agencies and with Congress demands high levels \nof efficiency and effectiveness.\n  Madam President, I conclude by saying that the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee did an in-depth review of the \nCongressman's qualifications and experience and background for this \nimportant position. We grilled him on a whole range of issues: on \nmatters ranging from pay-go principles and the alternative minimum tax \nto low-income heating assistance, to an issue of particular concern to \nmy constituents, and that is the funding of Navy shipbuilding. While \nmany policy disagreements will naturally arise in any such discussion, \nI believe there was broad agreement within our committee that \nCongressman Nussle has demonstrated, both in his long service in the \nHouse and in the nomination process, that he is well informed on the \nissues, highly qualified for the position, alert to other points of \nview, and will work closely with Congress as we tackle the enormous \nfiscal challenges facing this Nation.\n  I believe Congressman Nussle would be an effective Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, and I urge my colleagues to support \nhis nomination.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise today to express my intention \nto support the nomination of Congressman Jim Nussle as the next \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget.\n  I do so because Congressman Nussle, in my judgment, falls comfortably \nwithin the standard I have set as I have had the honor to dispatch my \nresponsibility under the advice and consent clause of the Constitution. \nTo state it in nonconstitutional terms, I have always felt the standard \nI should apply is not whether I would present this nominee to the \nSenate--because under the Constitution that is not the Senate's \nresponsibility; it is the President's authority and responsibility--the \nquestion would be, in dispatching my responsibility under the advice \nand consent clause, Do I conclude this individual whom the President \nhas nominated is within an acceptable range for the particular job for \nwhich he has been nominated? On that basis, I have reached a conclusion \nthat I will vote to support Congressman Nussle's nomination.\n\n  I speak in my individual capacity, but I also obviously am honored to \nbe the chair of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, and will note for the Record that there were no negative \nvotes in our committee on this nomination, and there was one \nabstention.\n  This nomination would be a significant one no matter when it came \nbefore the Senate for a vote, because the Office of Management and \nBudget is a very significant and powerful office in our Government. But \nfate brings Mr. Nussle's nomination before us at a very important and \nchallenging fiscal time in Washington and for our country. The fact is \nthat in less than a month, Congress must enact 12 appropriations bills \nto fund the vital functions of the Federal Government for the fiscal \nyear beginning October 1. We have much work ahead of us. It is \ndifficult work, and it has been complicated by the numerous veto \nthreats emerging from the White House about these appropriations bills. \nSome, as the Chair well knows, have even speculated that the ensuing \nconfrontation will lead yet again to a shutdown of parts of the Federal \nGovernment. I hope not, because no one gains from such stalemate and \nsuch shutdowns.\n  To meet our obligations to the American people, in this, as in so \nmuch else, we must reach across the partisan divide--as voters have so \noften made clear they want us to do. In this case, that means we must \nhave a new Director of OMB who is not just competent but who is \nconstructive. He must be a consensus builder, a willing partner with \nCongress, a mediator between the executive and legislative branches, \nworking to solve problems and to accommodate legitimate differences of \nopinion. He must be a fiscal expert, but he must in the weeks ahead \nalso be a statesman.\n  I support this nomination of Congressman Nussle, but I do so with the \nunderstanding that the Congressman will have to exercise the full \nmeasure of his diplomatic skills at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to \nhelp bring the fiscal year 2008 budget and appropriations process to a \nsatisfactory conclusion. There is a lot on the line in our achieving \nthat end in a responsible and appropriate way. The Nation counts on it, \nbut a lot of individual citizens of our Government who rely either on \nthe security the Government provides or the services the Government \nprovides count on us as well.\n  We are a nation at war. Our soldiers in the field need critical \nfunding to ensure their safety and the success of their mission. We are \na nation still under threat of terrorist attack here at home. Resources \nfor our homeland security and for our first responders must be \nsufficient--more sufficient, I would add, in joining with Senator \nCollins on this--than the administration has provided to date, to allow \nour first responders and homeland protectors to do the jobs we expect \nthem to do for us with the proper equipment and the proper training. We \nare a nation with an aging infrastructure. The Minneapolis bridge \ncollapse last month was a clear warning that we cannot ignore the \nhighway and transportation systems that move people and commerce in our \ndynamic and complex society. We have children going to schools across \nthis country who depend on the investment the Federal Government makes \nin their education. We have senior citizens who depend on the Federal \nGovernment to not only protect their security but to provide a decent \nminimum standard of living in so many different ways for them in their \nsenior years. These are just a few of the obligations we have to meet \nfor our Nation and for our future.\n  That is why it is so critical that on both ends of Pennsylvania \nAvenue, we come to this budget and appropriations task in the coming \nweeks with a sense of good faith and shared values as Americans who \ncare about our future and our people. We cannot meet these obligations \nwith confrontation or deadlock.\n  Let me be specific about this. The key difference between Congress's \nfiscal year 2008 budget plan and President Bush's plan is the \ndiscretionary spending level. Congress established a level of $953 \nbillion. The President set his level at $933 billion. That is a $20 \nbillion difference. Now, $20 billion is a very significant amount of \nmoney, but it represents only 2 percent of all discretionary spending \nof the Federal Government as proposed for the coming fiscal year, and \nit represents less than 1 percent of all Federal expenditures. In other \nwords, as a percentage of the budget we are dealing with, the enormous \nbudget we are dealing with, this is a difference--less than 1 percent--\nthat reasonable people sharing a loyalty to our country ought to be \nable to resolve. It is not a difference that merits--2 percent, 1 \npercent--not a difference that merits a shutdown of the U.S. Government \nin whole or in part. It is a difference that can and must be bridged by \npeople who understand the budget process and are willing to forge \nconsensus in the public interest.\n  Congressman Nussle has considerable experience in budgetary matters, \nhaving served as chairman of the House Budget Committee from 2001 \nthrough 2006 and on the House Ways and Means Committee. During his \nconfirmation hearing before the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, I asked Congressman Nussle if he would be willing to \nadvise President Bush to remain open to compromise on spending levels \nto avoid a governmental shutdown. Congressman Nussle\n\n[[Page S11026]]\n\nresponded: ``I will remain open and I need to remain open.''\n  That is part of the reason why I voted to report Congressman Nussle's \nnomination out of committee favorably. I repeat what I said at the \nbeginning: Based on his experience, based on his intelligence he is \ncomfortably within the range, in my judgment, of people who can serve \nas Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and he is the \nperson whom President Bush has set before us. But I will say that to \nme, it is critically important that Congressman Nussle keep the promise \nhe made to our committee--that he will do everything in his power as \nthe next Director of the Office of Management and Budget to avoid \nconfrontation as we proceed to fund the Federal Government and its \noperations for 2008.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for up to an additional 5 \nminutes, which I hope I will not use, from the time that has been \nallocated to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Achieving compromise on the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills is \nonly one of the OMB Director's many critical responsibilities. He also \nhas to help the President prepare and execute the budget for the \nfollowing year across 14 Cabinet departments and more than \n100 executive agencies, boards, and commissions. The Director \nrecommends where every taxpayer dollar is spent, oversees how each \nagency's programs are managed, and reviews vital roles for public \nhealth, worker safety, and environmental protection.\n\n  The OMB Director is also the chief management officer of the Federal \nGovernment--the largest entity of this kind, or any kind, in the world \ntoday--overseeing how agencies conduct procurement, handle their \nfinances, manage information technology, and carry out their \noperations. The numbers here--and I want to pause for a moment to \nstress the ``M'' part of OMB--the management part, which is often \noverlooked because it is the budget--the budgeting--that is the most \npublicly visible. The numbers here are startling and, I would add, \ndisturbing and demand our attention and will, if confirmed, demand \nCongressman Nussle's attention. Government spending on contracts has \nexploded, while the trained workforce that oversees them has shrunk. \nThis has already caused widely publicized and, I would add, infuriating \nexamples of waste, and the problem will only worsen in the years ahead \nif we don't act to better protect taxpayer dollars spent on Federal \nGovernment contracting.\n  Consider this: The U.S. Government is the largest buyer of goods and \nservices in the world. I repeat: The U.S. Government is the largest \nbuyer of goods and services in the world. Between 2000 and 2006, \nspending on Government contracts has grown from about $219 billion a \nyear to $415 billion, an astounding 89-percent increase. Yet the number \nof Federal acquisition specialists--the people who negotiate and \noversee the contracts for this $415 billion--these people in number \nhave dropped dramatically. This is over a significant period of \ndownsizing of the workforce in the 1990s and a small decrease in the \nlast 6 years in response to an enormous increase in contracting. The \nnumbers are particularly striking at the Department of Defense where \nthe workforce has declined by nearly 50 percent since the mid 1990s. \nGovernmentwide, the workforce is about to shrink even further if \nnothing is done, since roughly half the current Federal acquisition \nworkforce is eligible to retire within the next 4 years. So it is \nimperative that Congressman Nussle, if confirmed, pay particular \nattention to this challenge: Federal Government buying, contracting, \nwhich involves more than $400 billion of taxpayers' hard-earned \ndollars.\n  Let me conclude by saying some of what has been said in brief. I have \nhad serious concerns about how budget responsibilities have been dealt \nwith by the administration over the last 6\\1/2\\ years. While I \nunderstand that the next Director will not begin with a blank slate, \nhis performance will be judged by how well he comes to grips with some \nof these inherited problems. The next OMB Director will likely be \nPresident Bush's last OMB Director. He will have the opportunity to \ncraft policy that will be a lasting legacy, and let's hope it is a \nlasting legacy of responsibility and fairness. I urge that if \nconfirmed, Congressman Nussle take a long view of that legacy and work \nto achieve both the fiscal soundness and fairness that has too often \nbeen absent from this administration's record to date.\n  For the past several years, we have wrestled with politics and \npartisan confrontation here in Washington, and generally speaking, not \nonly have all of us lost, but more importantly, the American people and \nthe public interest have lost. As the 2008 election season shifts now \ninto high gear, we cannot let that increasingly partisan environment \nculminate in fiscal and governmental chaos. To meet our obligations, we \nmust work together as voters demand for the greater good of our \ncountry. Jim Nussle will have a great opportunity and an equally great \nresponsibility to see to it that we do that.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let me begin by thanking the majority \nleader, Senator Reid, and Budget Chairman Kent Conrad for their strong \nstatements in opposition to the Nussle nomination. I think that is the \nright position, and I appreciate them speaking out on it.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I placed a hold on the \nnomination of former Congressman Jim Nussle to become OMB Director and \nI voted against his confirmation at the committee level.\n  The reason I did that is not because I have any personal animus \ntoward Mr. Nussle. I have known Jim Nussle for over 16 years. We served \nin the House together, and I like him. So this is not personal. The \nreason I strongly oppose Mr. Nussle becoming the Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget has, in fact, little to do with Mr. Nussle and \neverything to do with the failed economic policies of the Bush \nadministration.\n  The problem is, the President and his advisers have become \nincreasingly isolated and out of touch with the economic realities \nfacing ordinary Americans. The simple truth is that the middle class \ncontinues to shrink, poverty has increased over the last 6 years, the \ngap between the rich and everyone else is growing wider, and millions \nof Americans are working longer hours for lower wages. Meanwhile, in \nthe midst of all of this, President Bush continues to tell the American \npeople day after day how great and how wonderful the economy is doing. \nThis is an insult to American workers and is something that should end, \nand end now.\n  This President needs an OMB Director who can provide a sense of \nreality with regard to the economic conditions facing ordinary \nAmericans and not continue to perpetrate a false mythology. That is \nwhat this debate is all about.\n  Year after year, President Bush, members of his administration, and \nhis advisers, in almost an Orwellian sense, have sounded like a broken \nrecord on the economy. They have told the American people over and over \nagain that the economy--I am now going to use quotes that come directly \nfrom the President and his administration--is ``strong and getting \nstronger.'' The economy is ``thriving.'' The economy is ``robust.'' The \neconomy is ``vibrant.'' The economy is ``solid.'' The economy is \n``booming.'' The economy is ``powerful.'' The economy is ``fantastic.'' \nThe economy is ``amazing.'' The economy is ``just marvelous.''\n  Those are quotes that come from the President, his administration, \nand his advisers. That is what the President and his administration are \ntelling the American people.\n  Now, let's look at reality. How can President Bush and his advisers \nclaim that this economy is robust when nearly 5 million Americans have \nslipped into poverty since the year 2000, including over 1 million \nchildren? We hear a lot about family values in Washington, and I hope \nwhen people talk about family values, they are talking about our kids, \nthe weakest and most vulnerable people in our society.\n  How can a significant increase in poverty since Bush has been \nPresident among our children occur at the same time as he describes \nthis economy as ``robust''? This is absurd. This is insulting.\n\n[[Page S11027]]\n\n  How can the President and his advisers claim the economy is vibrant \nwhen the median income for working-age families has declined by about \n$2,400 since President Bush has been in office? The reality is, from \n2001 through 2005, the bottom 90 percent of households experienced a \n4.2-percent decline in their market-based incomes, representing a loss \nof over $1,200 per household on average. How does that sound like a \nvibrant economy?\n  Madam President, how can the President of the United States and his \nadvisers claim that ``the economy is strong and getting stronger,'' \nwhen the personal savings rate has been below zero for eight \nconsecutive quarters--something that has not occurred since the Great \nDepression? What this means is, with increased energy costs, increased \nhealth care costs, increased education costs, and other increased \nexpenses, the average American is now spending more money than he or \nshe is earning. More money is going out than is coming in. In other \nwords, people are going deeper and deeper into debt. This doesn't sound \nto me like an economy that is ``strong and getting stronger.''\n  How can the President and his advisers claim that the economy is \n``healthy''--that is another word they have used--when 8.6 million \nAmericans have lost their health insurance since the year 2000, and a \nrecord-breaking 47 million Americans are uninsured, with millions more \nunderinsured? That doesn't sound too healthy to me. All over this \ncountry we find workers who are losing their health insurance. We find \npeople who are paying more and more for, in many instances, inferior \ncoverage, and you have a President out there saying this economy is \n``healthy.'' Well, I am sure many of those people who just lost their \nhealth insurance this last year would be quite surprised to find that \nthis economy is ``healthy.''\n  How can this President and his advisers claim that the economy is \n``thriving,'' when, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 35 \nmillion Americans in our country struggled to put food on the table \nlast year, and the number of the hungriest Americans keeps going up? \nHow do you have an economy that is thriving when more and more people \nare hungry and when millions of our fellow citizens have a difficult \ntime putting food on the table? This is not a thriving economy. Hunger \nin America is a national disgrace.\n  Madam President, how can the President of the United States and his \nadvisers claim that our economy is ``booming''--that is another word \nthey have used--when college students today are graduating deeper and \ndeeper in debt, with the average student now owing $20,000 upon \ngraduation. Even more disturbing, some 400,000 qualified high school \nstudents don't go to college in the first place because they cannot \nafford it and because they do not want to come out of school tens and \ntens of thousands of dollars in debt. Does this sound like a booming \neconomy to you? Well, tell that to the young people in this country who \ncan no longer afford to go to college. Tell them about how the economy \nis ``booming.''\n  How can the President of the United States and his advisers claim \nthat our economy is ``fantastic'' when home foreclosures are now the \nhighest on record, turning the American dream of home ownership into an \nAmerican nightmare for millions of families?\n  How can the President and his economic advisers claim that the \neconomy is ``powerful'' when the number of working families paying more \nthan half of their limited incomes on housing has decreased by 72 \npercent since 1997? So you have people working hard, 50, 60 hours a \nweek and, because of the high cost of housing and their limited \nincomes, they are spending more than 50 percent of what they earn on \nhousing.\n  How can the President of the United States and his economic advisers \nclaim that our economy is ``the envy of the world'' when the U.S. has \nthe highest rate of childhood poverty, the highest infant mortality \nrate among major countries, the highest overall poverty rate, the \nlargest gap between the rich and the poor, and we remain the only \ncountry in the industrialized world that does not guarantee health care \nto all people through a national health care program? How is that \neconomy the ``envy of the world''?\n  How can the President and his advisers claim that the economy is \n``amazing'' when we have lost over 3 million good-paying manufacturing \njobs since the year 2000, mainly due to our record-breaking $765 \nbillion trade deficit? Well, tell workers in the State of Vermont and \nall over this country about how amazing the economy is when their \nplants are shut down, when their jobs go to China, and when, if they \nare lucky enough to find a new job, in most cases that job will pay \nsubstantially less than the job they used to have. Tell the white-\ncollar information technology workers whose jobs are going to India how \n``fantastic'' the economy is, when their new jobs pay less than the \njobs they used to have.\n  How can this President and his economic advisers claim the economy is \n``vibrant'' when the number of college graduates earning poverty-level \nwages has more than doubled over the past 15 years?\n  My goal this afternoon is not to engage in a major debate on the \neconomy or what proposals we need to improve the economic life of \nworking people. That is an enormously important debate and one that I \nhope we have sooner than later, but it is not really today's debate. My \ngoal today, and the reason I put a hold on the Nussle nomination, is \nsimply to make the point that the Bush administration is completely out \nof touch with the economic reality facing tens of millions of American \nfamilies, and that we need an OMB Director and an economic adviser who \nwill make this President understand what the ordinary American family \nis going through.\n  Let me give you an example of why we desperately need an OMB Director \nwho can do this. While the President of the United States and his \nadvisers tell us how ``robust'' and how ``vibrant'' and how ``strong'' \nthe American economy is, well, the people of our country, the people \nwho live in that economy, the people who work in that economy have a \ndifferent perception of reality than the gentleman in the Oval Office.\n  In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, published last month, more \nthan two-thirds of the American people said they believe the U.S. \neconomy is either in recession now or will be in recession next year. \nThat is what the American people are saying, the people who are living \nthe economy. They are saying that despite the daily assertions of \nPresident Bush and his advisers. Further, 72 percent of Americans \nsurveyed in a mid-August Gallup poll said the economy was ``getting \nworse.'' That is the most pessimistic outlook on the economy since \nGallup began asking that question in the early 1990s.\n  Madam President, we have a real disconnect. We have a situation in \nwhich the American people are experiencing a certain reality, telling \nus about a certain reality, and a President who is living in a very \ndifferent world.\n  The President keeps telling us how great the economy is doing, but \nthe American people who work every day, who pay their bills every \nmonth, who are trying to provide health care for their families and a \ncollege education for their kids are not buying it. In other words, the \npeople who are living in this economy have a very different perspective \non reality than does this President and his advisers, and that creates \na very dangerous situation which must be corrected by an OMB Director \nwho lives in the real world and who can give this President some real-\nworld advice.\n  What people understand in their guts and what they fear the most is \nthat if economic trends continue along the same path they have been \ngoing for the last many years, we will see for the first time in the \nmodern history of this country that our kids, the next generation, will \nhave a lower standard of living than we do.\n  What the American dream has always been and what my family, which \nnever had much money, experienced and what millions of American \nfamilies have experienced is that if you work hard and you save your \nmoney, your children will have a better economic life, more \nopportunities than you do. That is what every parent's dream is: That \ntheir kids will do better than they did.\n  But I am afraid this American dream is rapidly disappearing. I am \nafraid that with so many American families, the American dream has \nbecome an\n\n[[Page S11028]]\n\nAmerican nightmare. To cite one source--and there are many others--a \nrecent joint study by the Pew Charitable Trust and the Brookings \nInstitution found that men in their early thirties earned on average 12 \npercent less in 2004 than their fathers did in 1974 after adjusting for \ninflation. In other words, for millions of families, despite a huge \nincrease in worker productivity, we are moving in exactly the wrong \ndirection. Workers are producing more but, in many cases, they are \nworse off than their parents.\n  President Bush desperately needs an OMB Director who is not afraid to \ntell the President the truth about these harsh economic realities and \nnot be an echo, not repeat the mythology that this President and his \nadvisers are bringing forth. President Bush needs a Budget Director who \nwill make him face the facts and not his fantasies. Perhaps most \nimportantly, President Bush needs a Budget Director who is willing to \ncompromise with those of us in Congress who are fighting for the needs \nof working families and are not here to represent the wealthiest people \nin this country and the largest corporations.\n  Unfortunately, there is nothing in former Congressman Jim Nussle's \nbackground to suggest he is that person. Quite the contrary. I must \nsay, I am amused to hear some of my colleagues say: Well, we were at a \nhearing with Mr. Nussle and we asked him a question and he said he is \nopen to doing this and doing that. That is wonderful at a confirmation \nhearing. I worked with Mr. Nussle for 16 years in the House. He was \nchairman of the House Budget Committee for 6 years. His record is \nclear. Pay attention to the record rather than what someone might or \nmight not say in a confirmation hearing.\n  Let me suggest where I think the confusion in this whole discussion \nlies, where the disconnect lies. That is that when President Bush tells \nus the economy is doing great, that it is robust, that it is vibrant--\nall of his adjectives--the truth is he is right in one sense. He is \nright in one sense. The economy is not doing well for the vast majority \nof our people who are in the middle class. The economy is certainly not \ndoing well for working families who, in many cases, work longer hours \nfor low wages. The economy is not doing well for our lower income \ncitizens. Poverty has increased significantly since President Bush has \nbeen in the White House. But the economy, we must admit, is doing well \nand, in fact, doing very well for the wealthiest people in this \ncountry, and that is true.\n  So I think the confusion lies in that when the President says the \neconomy is doing great, what he means is that the economy is doing \ngreat for his wealthy friends and for the CEOs of the largest \ncorporations in America. I admit he is right in that regard.\n  If you look at the world from the perspective of CEOs of large \ncorporations who now make over 350 times what their workers make, if \nyou look at the economy from the perspective of hedge fund managers, \nsome of whom make hundreds of millions of dollars a year, if you look \nat the economy from the perspective of people who have more money than \nthey know what to do with, who are literally building yachts that are \nlonger than a football field, I can understand how one could come to \nthe conclusion that the economy is doing very well because from their \npoint of view, from their reality, the economy is doing very well.\n  Today the simple truth is the upper 1 percent of families in America \nhave not had it so good since the 1920s. So I concede, President Bush, \nyou are right. For all your friends who are in the top 1 percent, the \neconomy is doing very well. But some of us--maybe not all of us but \nsome of us--are here not to represent the richest 1 percent; we are \nkind of worried about the bottom 90 percent, the bottom 50 percent, the \nordinary people who go to work every single day and are struggling hard \nto keep their heads above water and to provide the necessities of life \nfor their kids.\n\n  In 2005, the last available figures I have, while average incomes for \nthe bottom 90 percent--that is where most of the folks are--the bottom \n90 percent of Americans declined by $172, the wealthiest 1/100th of 1 \npercent reported an average income of $25.7 million, a 1-year increase \nof $4.4 million. Let me repeat that because I think this deals with the \nconfusion of why the President thinks the economy is doing so good.\n  The income of the bottom 90 percent of Americans declined by $172 \nwhile the income of the wealthiest 1/100th of 1 percent increased by \n$4.4 million.\n  In 2005, the top 1 percent of Americans received the largest share of \nnational income since 1928. Today, rather incredibly--and I was \ninterested in hearing a colleague of mine talking about, oh, my \ngoodness, the wealthy are paying so much in taxes. Well, there is a \nreason, because today, incredibly, the top 300,000 Americans--300,000--\nnow earn nearly as much as the bottom 150 million Americans combined; \n300,000 earning almost as much income as the bottom 150 million \nAmericans combined.\n  This constitutes by far the most unequaled distribution of income in \nany major country on Earth, and that gap continues to grow wider and \nwider. This is an issue this Congress must address. It is not \nacceptable. People keep talking in a general sense about the economy \nwhile ignoring the people in the economy. We have to focus on this \ngrowing income in wealth disparity in this country.\n  While millions of Americans--it is true in my State of Vermont and it \nis true all over this country--are working two and three jobs trying to \ncobble together an income and perhaps some health insurance, the \ncollective net worth of the wealthiest 400 Americans increased by $120 \nbillion last year to $1.25 trillion, according to Forbes magazine.\n  Let me repeat that statement because it is an astounding fact. The \ncollective net worth of the wealthiest 400 Americans--400 is not a lot \nof people--increased by $120 billion last year to $1.25 trillion. \nRemember, at the same time as the personal savings rate is below zero \nand millions of Americans are going deeper and deeper into debt, the \ncollective net worth of the wealthiest 400 Americans increased by $120 \nbillion.\n  That is what this economy is doing. The top 1 percent now owns more \nwealth than the bottom 90 percent, and the reality is the rich are \ngetting richer, the middle class is shrinking, and the gap between the \nvery wealthiest people in our society and everyone else is growing \nwider and wider. We are becoming very different countries--people on \ntop live in a certain world, and the vast majority of people are living \nin another world entirely.\n  What does all of this have to do with the next Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget, which is what we are here this afternoon to \ndiscuss? In my opinion, it has a whole lot to do with who should become \nthe next Director of the OMB.\n  A Federal budget--and our budget is now almost $3 trillion--is more \nthan a long list of numbers. The Federal budget, as any family budget, \nis a statement of our Nation's values and our priorities. It is not any \ndifferent, except the numbers are astronomical, that every family has \nto deal with: How do they spend their money? Where do they spend their \nmoney? What are their priorities? It is the same debate we have in the \nSenate. The Federal budget is a statement about what our country is \nabout, what we stand for, and who we are as a people.\n  We would all, I believe, find it irresponsible and counterproductive \nif a family whom we knew, whom we observed, went out and bought a great \nbig car and they bought a great big boat and went on fancy vacations to \nLas Vegas, all the while neglecting their kids at home. The kids were \nill clothed, ill fed, ill taken care of. We would say that family is \nirresponsible.\n  We need to use those same values when we look at the budget of the \nUnited States of America. Preparing the Federal budget encompasses the \nsame set of values. It is about spending taxpayers' dollars where we \nshould be spending them and not spending them where we should not be \nspending them. It is about taking a hard look at the needs of all our \npeople, especially those who are most in need, and prioritizing that \nbudget in an intelligent, fair, and rational way. That is what an OMB \nDirector is supposed to do. That is what his or her job description is.\n  In February, the President told us about his values and his \npriorities when he submitted his fiscal year 2008\n\n[[Page S11029]]\n\nbudget to Congress. Fortunately, thanks to the excellent work of \nChairman Conrad, the Senate rejected the President's budget and passed \na budget resolution that was much more responsive to the needs of \nordinary Americans, and I thank Chairman Conrad for doing that. I had \nthe opportunity of working with him as a member of the Budget \nCommittee. But as we in the Senate all know, even though the budget \nresolution conference report passed the House and the Senate in May, \nthat is a first step. It is the annual appropriations bills that \nactually provide the funding which keeps our Federal Government \nrunning. Unlike the budget resolution, which cannot be vetoed, the \nPresident has the opportunity to veto each and every appropriations \nbill that comes across his desk, and with very few exceptions, this is \nexactly what the President has threatened to do unless Congress accepts \nhis overall spending requests.\n\n  In other words, the President has said to Congress: It is my way or \nthe highway. We will do it my way or I will veto what you are proposing \nto do. This is the wrong way to negotiate with Congress on the \nappropriations process. The President needs someone to advise him that \na budget should address the needs of all the American people and not \njust the wealthiest people in our country. The President needs an \nadviser to tell him that it is more important to pay attention to \nworking families all over this country, many of whom are falling \nfurther and further behind--to pay attention to those families rather \nthan a handful of billionaires. Frankly, based on his record in \nCongress, I am afraid Mr. Nussle will not do that. He is the wrong man \nfor this position at this particular moment in American history.\n  Now, let me say a few words about the President's budget that he is \nso adamant that Congress adopt. Let's look at the values and the \npriorities this President is proposing. The President has proposed in \nhis budget, despite the growing health care crisis in this country, \nthat he wishes to cut Medicare and Medicaid by $280 billion over the \nnext decade, lowering the quality of health care for approximately 43 \nmillion senior citizens and people with disabilities who depend on \nMedicare, and more than 50 million Americans who rely on Medicaid. That \nis his priority--cut Medicare, cut Medicaid.\n  Even worse--and to me this is a deeply moral issue in a nation that \nalready has the disgrace of having the highest rate of childhood \npoverty in the industrialized world; over 18 percent of our kids are in \npoverty--at a time when 8.7 million children have no health insurance, \nthe President has refused to adequately fund the Children's Health \nInsurance Program in his budget. Now, here is where the President needs \nsome good advice. But I have listened and I haven't heard that advice \ncoming from Mr. Nussle. He has had the opportunity. He was nominated a \nwhile back.\n  Last month, as we all know, the Senate voted by a 68-to-31 margin to \nexpand the SCHIP program to provide an additional 3 million children in \nour country with health insurance. Eighteen Republican Senators thought \nthis was a good idea, and virtually everybody on our side of the aisle \nvoted for it. Although I believe the Senate should have done much \nmore--I believe all of our children should be covered--this is clearly \na step in the right direction. The House passed an even more generous \nbill to expand SCHIP, with the support of some Republicans. But instead \nof working with the Senate and the House, the President issued veto \nthreats on both of these bills.\n  What will Mr. Nussle's advice be on this issue? Will he tell the \nPresident that it is an international disgrace that we are the only \nmajor country on Earth that doesn't provide health care to all of our \npeople and that we have to address that immediately? Will he tell the \nPresident to rescind his veto threat? I doubt it. I doubt it very much. \nBased on his track record of chairmanship of the House Budget Committee \nfor 6 years, I don't think that is going to happen.\n  While the President does not believe we have enough money to increase \nhealth insurance coverage for children, it has been reported that the \nPresident will be asking for another $50 billion for the misguided war \nin Iraq. Fifty billion dollars in additional funding for the Iraq war, \nbut we don't have $5 billion to $10 billion a year to provide health \ninsurance to millions of uninsured kids. It is time the President had a \nbudget director who is willing to say: Excuse me, Mr. President, but \nthat is wrong. That is not what this country is about. It is time to \nget our priorities straight. I am afraid Mr. Nussle will not be the OMB \nDirector who does that.\n  What else does the President's budget have to say about the \npriorities of this country? What about our kids? What about childcare? \nEvery psychologist understands, and many books and papers have been \nwritten on it, that the most formative years of a person's life are \nfrom 0 to 3. That is when their intellectual capabilities develop; that \nis when their emotional capabilities develop. Now, what are we doing \nfor our kids in general and what are we doing with regard to childcare? \nAt a time when working families in Vermont and all across this country \nare searching desperately for quality, affordable childcare, the Bush \nbudget reduces the number of children receiving childcare assistance by \n300,000 kids. Mr. Bush tells us he believes no child should be left \nbehind. By this proposal, however, he is not only leaving 300,000 \nchildren behind, but, because of inadequate funding for childcare, he \nis denying millions of children the opportunities they need so they can \nsucceed in school.\n  Amazingly, childcare fees today are higher than college tuition at a \n4-year public university in 42 States in this country. In other words, \nwe have a major childcare crisis in America. The President needs an OMB \nDirector to tell him and explain to him that you don't cut childcare \nwhen working families all over this country are desperately searching \nout affordable childcare. Will Mr. Nussle be doing that? I doubt that.\n  Madam President, what I wish to do at this time is reserve the \nremainder of my time. There are some other issues I want to raise \nregarding the nomination of Mr. Nussle, but I think the key point I \nwant to make is that what this debate is about is do we need another \nOMB Director who continues to support and push policies which benefit \nthe wealthiest people in this country at the expense of the vast \nmajority of working families or do we need an OMB Director who will \nspeak truth to power and who, in fact, explains to the American people \nthe reality facing the economic lives of working families in this \ncountry.\n  There are some other points I want to make, Madam President, but I am \ngoing to reserve the remainder of my time at this point.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, Senator Lieberman has indicated he \nwishes to give back his time and that I might consume it, so I ask \nunanimous consent at this point that be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I am going to take a few minutes, but I \nwill state for the information of my colleague, Senator Allard of \nColorado, who is going to then take some time, that Senator Sanders has \nsaid it very well. First, I want to say he is a valuable member of the \nSenate Budget Committee. He is thoughtful, he does his homework, and he \nhas come here with a message that I think is very clear.\n  I think of my own family. I think of growing up in Bismarck, ND. My \nparents were killed when I was young, so I was sort of a group project. \nI was raised by my grandparents and my three uncles and aunts and their \nfamilies, so I was raised in four families. When I was growing up, we \nhad a middle-class family. We were in the newspaper business, the \nprinting and publishing business, and my family were middle class. In \nevery case, the woman of the household stayed home until the kids were \naway in school. And we had a lot of kids. We had 13 kids in our family, \nand that includes cousins of mine. Every one of them got a college \neducation. Every one of them got an advanced degree, and that was on \nmiddle-class income.\n  Now, you think about that today. There is no middle-class family who \ncould have the things we had, who grew up the way we grew up, who had \nthe opportunity to get an advanced education. And every single one of \nthese--my two brothers and my cousins--every single one of them got an \nadvanced degree on middle-class incomes,\n\n[[Page S11030]]\n\nand yet the women stayed home. They did not work in the workplace. They \ndid not work for a wage. They worked at home. They worked very hard \nraising these kids. They did a spectacular job of that. But that can't \nhappen today. The woman or the man can't stay home while raising the \nkids before they go to school because they need the income to get by, \nto pay the mortgage, to pay for the car, and to save some money to help \nkids go to school.\n  Our society has been transformed. Talk about family values. Those \nwere family values, because there was a value on being able to raise \nkids and give them a happy and healthy home life and have the resources \nto go to school.\n  Now I heard some claims here by the other side earlier that are truly \nastounding--absolutely astounding. They are talking about how \nsuccessful this fiscal policy has been. Where have they been? Here is \nthe result of the fiscal policy of this administration, and the fiscal \npolicy for which Mr. Nussle was a key architect. It is a policy of \ndebt, deficits, and decline--the three Ds. Here is the record on debt. \nThey took the debt after the President's first year, $5.8 trillion, and \nat the end of this year it is going to be almost $9 trillion. Now this \nis a fact. This is no projection. This is what has happened.\n  Then I heard, well, the Democratic budget has got the biggest tax \nincrease in history. It was remarkable to listen to some of the \ncomments. We heard variously that the tax increase in the Democratic \nbudget was $200 billion, then it got to be $700 billion, and then it \nwas $900 billion. Well, whoa. Talk about variation. We had a $200 \nbillion tax increase, a $700 billion tax increase, and a $900 billion \ntax increase. Which is it?\n  I tell you the reason they can't tell you is because there is no tax \nincrease. There is no tax increase proposed in this budget. None. In \nfact, there is substantial tax relief, tax relief for middle-class \nfamilies, because they are the ones who truly need it.\n  Here are the facts. This is the revenue over 5 years in the budget \nresolution that passed the Senate--$14,828 trillion. It is a big \nnumber, isn't it? How much do you think the President said his budget \nwould raise over that same period? Here is what he said his budget \nwould raise--$14,826 trillion. Do you notice there is almost no \ndifference? The President said his budget would raise $14,826 trillion. \nThat is not my claim about his budget, that is his claim about his \nbudget. Our budget, according to the Congressional Budget Office, will \nraise $14,828 trillion. Where is this huge tax increase? Where is it?\n  If we look at the Congressional Budget Office to evaluate both \nbudgets, here is what we see. The green line is the revenue of our \nbudget. The red line is the President's. There is a small difference--a \n2-percent difference. A 2-percent difference. That is according to the \nCongressional Budget Office. Now, let us assume for a moment their way. \nLet's say there is 2 percent more revenue. Where would we get it \nwithout a tax increase? Well, the first place we would go is the tax \ngap. The IRS estimates that the tax gap for a single year, the \ndifference between what is owed and what is paid, is $345 billion. That \nis for 1 year. If we got just that, we would completely eliminate the \ndifference between the revenue in our proposal and the revenue in the \nPresident's. Of course, this is a 5-year budget. We just need 1 year of \nthe tax gap.\n\n  The Senator from New Hampshire says we cannot get that much. Let's \nassume he is right. Let's say you can't get that much. Is that the only \nplace you can look for revenue without a tax increase? Oh, no.\n  There is a place down in the Cayman Islands called the Ugland House. \nIt is a five-story building. It is the home to 12,748 companies. Isn't \nthat amazing? All those companies, 12,748 companies, claim they are \ndoing business out of this little five-story building. Does anybody \nbelieve that the 12,748 companies are engaged in business out of this \nlittle building?\n  They are not engaged in business. They are engaged in monkey \nbusiness, and the monkey business they are engaged in is avoiding taxes \nhere. What are they doing? Here is what they are doing. They are \nengaged in offshore tax haven scams. Here is what they say. Go on the \nInternet and you know what you will find? You put in the words about \ntax havens, here is what you get--1.2 million hits. A lot of people out \nthere are being inventive about how to avoid taxes. Hear is what they \nsay.\n\n       Your money belongs to you and that means that it belongs \n     offshore.\n\n  Why do they want to put the money offshore? Because they don't want \nto pay any taxes here. Here is my favorite:\n\n       Live tax free and worldwide on a luxury yacht--moving \n     offshore and living tax free just got easier.\n\n  Come on, do you know how much money the Government of the United \nStates says is being lost to this kind of scam? Here is the Senate \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations from February of this year. They said:\n\n       Experts have estimated that the total loss to the Treasury \n     from offshore tax evasion alone approaches $100 billion per \n     year.\n\n  Some of us say we ought to shut it down and stop this outrage. That \nis tax increase? No. That is no tax increase. That is requiring people \nto pay taxes they already owe. If we got just half of this money, half \nof it, we could meet our budget numbers with no tax increase.\n  Some don't want to do a thing around here. They want these scams to \ncontinue. Let them stand up and defend them. And while they are at it, \ndefend this. Abusive tax shelters--what is this a picture of? That is a \nsewer system in Europe. What does that have to do with the budget of \nthe United States? It turns out it has a lot to do with it because we \nhave companies in the United States and wealthy investors who have \nbought sewer systems in Europe. Why? Do they want to run sewer systems \nin Europe? Oh, no, they don't run the sewer system. They buy it and \ndepreciate it on their books for U.S. tax purposes and lease it back to \nthe European cities that built it in the first place.\n  Do you know that is costing us $40 or $50 billion a year, tax shelter \nscams? If we shut those down, we could meet our budget with no tax \nincrease. So please don't come out here and give me this about the \nbiggest tax increase in history. There is no tax increase. Is there \nmore revenue? According to the President there is no difference in \nrevenue between our plan and his plan. If you look at what he would \nclaim his revenue system would produce, it is virtually identical to \nwhat we say ours will produce.\n  But let's accept Congressional Budget Office numbers. They say there \nis 2 percent more revenue in your plan. Let me say, I believe you could \nachieve that by closing down these abusive tax shelters, closing down \nthese offshore tax havens that the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations says is costing us $100 billion a year, or at least \nreducing the tax gap, the difference between what is owed and what is \npaid. The vast majority of us pay what we owe. How are we allowing $340 \nbillion a year to go unpaid by others?\n  When I hear people say this is the biggest tax increase, that is just \nnot true. There is no proposed tax increase in the budget that we \noffered--none. And that is a fact.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of \nCongressman Jim Nussle, the President's nominee to be Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, referred to commonly as OMB.\n  I am pleased the President chose someone with such an extensive \nknowledge of the Federal budget process to succeed the very able \nDirector, Rob Portman. I had the pleasure of serving under Congressman \nNussle when he was chairman of the House Budget Committee. I came into \nthe House the same time he did, so I have had an opportunity to work \nextensively with what I think is an outstanding individual. There I \nwitnessed firsthand his expertise in the budget process.\n  As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Congressman Nussle worked \neffectively with fellow House Members, Senators, and the President to \nshape the Federal budget--much like he will be required to do if \nconfirmed as Director of OMB. Moreover, throughout his service in \nCongress, Congressman Nussle demonstrated a firm commitment to fiscal \nresponsibility, restoring and maintaining fiscal\n\n[[Page S11031]]\n\ndiscipline, starting with this year's appropriations process.\n  It is essential to keeping our economy strong and growing. The fact \nis, today's economy is strong. More than 8 million jobs have been \ncreated since August of 2003, unemployment is at historical lows, and \npaychecks are rising. One of the reasons we are enjoying a strong \neconomy today is because the Republican Congress and the President \ncreated conditions for individuals and small businesses to thrive. \nThese progrowth economic policies included reducing income tax rates, \nreducing capital gains and dividend tax rates, reducing the estate and \ngift taxes, and increasing incentives for small business investment.\n\n  If we neglect extending all these taxes that I just ran off--they all \nhave a termination date on them. If we neglect extending these tax \nreductions, the end result is it is going to be the largest tax \nincrease in the history of this country by neglect. The chairman of the \nBudget Committee is right. They don't have any overt proposal to \nincrease taxes. But by neglect and refusing to renew these taxes that \nare going to be expiring in a few years, the net result is that the tax \nrates are going to increase on our progrowth, economic tax reduction \nprovisions that we put in place, which was reducing the income tax, \nreducing capital gains and dividend taxes, reducing estate and gift \ntaxes, and increasing incentives for small business investment.\n  My view is in this country, if you really want to see economic \ngrowth, you target the small business sector. That is what the \nproeconomic growth policy did, and we saw the results of that, \nresulting in sizable revenue increases to the Federal Government as \nwell as our States throughout this country. The economic growth \nstimulated by these policies not only led to more money in the pockets \nof the American people, it has led to increased Federal revenue and \nreduced deficits. Since 2003, revenues have rebounded sharply, \nfollowing several years of decline. Last year, revenues were up almost \n12 percent, to $2.4 trillion, the highest in our Nation's history. As a \nresult, we cut the budget deficit in half several years ahead of \nschedule and put ourselves on a path toward balancing the budget. That \nis important to me, and I think it is important to the American people \nto have us on a path toward balancing the budget. I think it is \nimportant to the American people that we continue our progrowth \npolicies. After all, that means more jobs.\n  In addition to its well-known budgetary function, the Office of \nManagement and Budget is also charged with an equally important, albeit \nI would say lesser known function, and that is management \nresponsibility. President Bush, with initiatives like the President's \nManagement Agenda and the Program Assessment Rating Tool, referred to \nby many as PART, has given the Office of Management and Budget and the \nCongress the management tools they need as overseers of a large and \ncomplex and sometimes cumbersome bureaucracy. In fact, if the American \npeople want to see how these various agencies are performing, all they \nneed to do is get on the Internet and go to expectmore.gov. You are \ngoing to find an assessment of the agencies and how they are doing, \nwhether they are operating efficiently, spending taxpayer dollars in a \nresponsible way, or whether they are being ineffective, and various \ngrades in between that, or are they absolutely ignoring any attempt to \nbe accountable to the way in which the taxpayer dollars are being \nspent.\n  As a result, on that Web page you are going to see ``no results \ndemonstrated.'' They just kind of thumbed their noses at the taxpayers \nand the President and anybody out here trying to build accountability \nto agency spending. This program helps Members of Congress, helps \nmembers of the administration, and helps the taxpayer out here if they \nwant to take the time to look it up on the Internet, just to see how \nthe various agencies are performing. You might be surprised as to which \nagencies show up as not even making an effort to be accountable to the \ntaxpayers as to how their tax dollars are being spent.\n  OMB's management tools are critical to Congress's ability to hold \nagencies and programs accountable and ensure that taxpayer dollars are \nbeing spent wisely. Congressman Nussle has assured me that he will give \ndue deference to the ``M'' which stands for ``management'' in the OMB. \nI have impressed upon him how important it is that we encourage the \nagencies to continue to try to demonstrate results on their \neffectiveness and not ignore it because it is what we need to \nresponsibly put forward legislation in budgets and appropriations \nbills.\n  I think this vote is a referendum on the economy, but let's look and \nsee what is happening with the economy. It is doing well. New jobs are \nbeing created. Income is coming in at record high rates. America is \ndoing well.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting Congressman Nussle \nwho, I believe, is a highly qualified nominee who is deserving of \nSenate confirmation. I am pleased the Budget Committee favorably \nreported Congressman Nussle with broad bipartisan support. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of this confirmation today.\n  It is important that we move forward with budget accountability. We \nneed to confirm the Director of the OMB quickly, so he can get moving \nforward with his responsibilities. I am here to strongly endorse my \ngood friend and colleague, Congressman Nussle. I hope the other Members \nof this body will join me in voting to support his confirmation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, this nomination of Congressman Nussle as \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget will put him at a \ncritical place at a critical time. The OMB has been a powerful part of \nthis administration, making key decisions on revenue, spending, \ntransparency and regulation. And the new Director will play a major \nrole in shaping both the remainder of this President's term as well as \nthe outlook of the next.\n  One of OMB's most important functions each year is to help generate \nthe President's budget request. With unprecedented levels of debt \nmounting ever higher, the Nation's budget blueprint must begin to \nreflect wise choices.\n  Unfortunately, the pattern of this administration so far has been one \nof fiscal recklessness. The President's tax cuts have reduced revenue \nto the Treasury by $1 trillion and will cost an additional $300 billion \nin 2007 alone. Over the past 5 years we have spent half a trillion \ndollars in Iraq, and we are continuing to spend $10 billion a month for \nthat war.\n  Our current total debt is closing in on $9 trillion, which means that \neach American's share is nearly $30,000. And the budget President Bush \nsubmitted to Congress in February would continue that trend. It would \nincrease the gross Federal debt by nearly $3 trillion to $11.5 trillion \nby 2012. That means each American's share of the debt would rise to a \nwhopping $38,000.\n  The administration needs to turn over a new leaf of fiscal \nresponsibility, and the new Director of OMB must be at the forefront of \nthat effort. Digging out of this ditch of debt will take serious \nbipartisan cooperation and it will require Congress and the \nadministration to work together. This includes deciding how to most \nfairly raise revenue and on which priorities to spend it. And it will \nmean putting aside partisanship of the moment to tackle the long-term \neconomic challenges. We need an OMB Director who is fully committed to \nworking with Congress to tackle this difficult and pressing problem.\n  Another critical function of OMB for which Congressman Nussle will be \nresponsible is the management side. OMB plays an important role in the \nFederal Government's efforts to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse by \npursuing management reforms, evaluating the effectiveness of Federal \nprograms, and providing oversight of agency reports, rules, testimony \nand proposed legislation. OMB can exert great influence on public \npolicy and I believe it is imperative that the person selected to run \nOMB be willing and able to work with both parties in Congress to face \nthe extraordinary challenges ahead.\n  I will support this nomination, and I am hopeful that Congressman \nNussle can meet the many challenges OMB faces at this critical time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I will vote for former Congressman \nNussle to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget. As a \nformer\n\n[[Page S11032]]\n\nChairman of the House Budget Committee, he is clearly qualified, and as \nI have indicated in the past, the President is entitled to great \ndeference when it comes to executive branch nominations, especially \nthose for positions which are so close to the President himself. In \nthis respect, the President's nomination for Director of Office of \nManagement and Budget should receive even greater deference than a \nCabinet position. Of course, this deference decreases as the position \nis more distanced from the policymaking functions of the \nadministration.\n  Given the emphasis I have placed on the need to budget more \nresponsibly, however, I want to make clear my strong disagreement with \nthe administration's budget policies that have featured an unbroken \nrecord of massive deficits and increased debt. And while I hope this \nnominee represents a new period of better relations with Congress on \nbudget matters, I do not vote for Congressman Nussle with the \nexpectation that the President will finally see the light and adopt a \nmore fiscally responsible budget.\n  When his term of office is complete, this President will leave behind \na fiscal mess so massive that it may take decades to clean up. I will \ncontinue my efforts during the remaining 15 months of this \nadministration to make sure that it does not make matters even worse.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I come to the floor today to voice my \nopposition to Mr. Nussle's nomination to be head of the Office of \nManagement and Budget. This nomination is another effort by President \nBush to obstruct Congress from doing its job and to prevent us from \npassing fiscally responsible budget and appropriations bills.\n  We need an OMB Director who can help the President understand that \nthe fiscal problems our country faces are too important and too big for \npolitical gamesmanship. And we need an OMB Director who understands \nthat past policies have failed and that the time for change is now. \nUnfortunately, Mr. Nussle is not the man for the job.\n  As chairman of the House Budget Committee, he repeatedly failed in \nhis biggest responsibility--to pass the annual budget resolution, which \nprotects the integrity of the appropriations process and provides the \nblueprint for how we spend taxpayer dollars. Not passing a budget puts \nthe healthy functioning of the Federal Government at risk. Before the \nnominee took control of the committee, Congress had only failed to pass \nthe budget resolution once since 1974. When Mr. Nussle was chairman of \nthat committee, it happened 3 out of his 6 years leading that \ncommittee.\n  Given the President's refusal to cooperate so far during this year's \nappropriations process, we need an OMB Director who can build \nconsensus. Mr. Nussle's inability to manage the budget resolution \nprocess shows that he clearly lacks this essential skill.\n  Mr. Nussle also presided over a runup in debt unprecedented in our \nNation's history. In 2001, when President Bush came to office and \nCongressman Nussle took over the Budget committee, there was a \nprojected $5.6 trillion surplus. But today, huge tax cuts for the rich \nand reckless spending have left America $9 trillion in debt. To cover \nthis debt, President Bush has had to borrow more than $1.1 trillion \nfrom foreigners, more than the previous 42 Presidents combined.\n  This means that our grandchildren will have to pay part of their \nwages and salaries for our tax cuts. This is not only bad policy, it is \nimmoral.\n  To this day, Nussle continues to support these and other failed Bush \nfiscal policies that, for the sake of the next generation of Americans, \nwe need to reverse.\n  The Bush administration has threatened to veto almost every one of \nour spending bills. These threats are stopping us from doing what the \nAmerican people want us to do--from working together on the important \nissues facing our country and changing the priorities and tone of \ndebate in Washington.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I pride myself on making \nsure taxpayer dollars are wisely spent on programs that make a \ndifference. The spending bills we wrote in the spring are built on \nthese values. They are fiscally responsible and support the programs \nthat protect our country and improve the lives of American citizens.\n  But because we reject President Bush's harmful cuts to housing, law \nenforcement, education and other critical programs, this administration \nand some Republicans accuse Democrats of wasteful spending. That is \noutrageous.\n  Democrats passed a budget that reflected Americans' priorities: no \nnew taxes, restored funding for critical domestic programs, balance the \nbudget by 2012 and contained pay-go for fiscal discipline. We fought to \nincrease funding for education, children's health care, veterans \nbenefits, and crime reduction.\n  President Bush says he wants to veto our appropriations bills because \nwe increase funding for critical domestic programs. Democrats increased \nfunding for the Department of Education when the President wanted to \ncut 44 education programs. Democrats increased funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health when Bush wanted to cut it by more than $300 \nmillion. The President wanted to cut first responder grants and we \nwanted to increase them. We proposed increasing domestic spending by \njust 1.4 percent over last year. That is lower than the growth rate of \nthe economy and the growth rate in taxes collected.\n  These appropriations bills fund every single Federal education, law \nenforcement, transportation, and housing activity in our country and \nthey were passed out of the Appropriations Committee with bipartisan \nsupport. Despite this bipartisan support, the President refuses to \nnegotiate with Congress and is threatening to veto our bills and bring \nthis Nation into a state of gridlock.\n  It is past time for the President to start facing the facts and to \nrealize that the only way forward is by working together. Ours is the \nrichest country in the history of the world and we have more than \nenough to provide decent public services on a balanced budget. My \nDemocratic colleagues and I are eager to come to the table and hammer \nout our differences for the sake of the American people but progress \ntakes political leadership and a willingness to compromise.\n  November's election showed that Americans want Congress to change the \ndirection and change the tone of politics. Democrats got the message \nand in May we passed a bipartisan budget that funded the programs \nAmerica needs while balancing the federal checkbook over 5 years. Our \nbudget provides the blueprint for extending middle-class tax cuts, \nexpanding children's and veterans' health care, and investing in \neducation. We also provided funds to protect our homeland and fully \nsupport our men and women serving in the Armed Forces.\n  We've had 6 years of undisciplined and unprincipled budget leadership \nfrom the White House and congressional Republicans. Representative \nNussle does not seem to understand that the time for a major change is \nnow and he doesn't seem likely to push President Bush to come to the \ntable. For this reason, I oppose his nomination and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nJim Nussle to be our Nation's next Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget. My support comes, however, with serious reservations about \nthe administration's financial commitment to rebuilding the gulf coast \nin the wake of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina.\n  While the President repeatedly speaks of his commitment to rebuilding \nthe gulf coast, at every turn, this administration places financial \nroadblocks to the region's recovery. For months, the administration \nrefused to waive the Stafford Act requirement that hurricane-ravaged \nStates and localities match 10 percent of the funds that they receive. \nSimilarly, the Office of Management and Budget has refused to allow the \nState of Louisiana to use the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program to fund \nits Road Home Program. Finally, the administration has threatened to \nveto the Water Resources Development Act, which takes the first vital \nsteps towards creating a comprehensive program for the restoration of \nthe Louisiana coast.\n  Notwithstanding the administration's claims of financial support, we \nstill have a long way to go in rebuilding the gulf coast. The \nGovernment Accountability Office, for example, recently concluded that \nof the $110 million that the Federal Government has\n\n[[Page S11033]]\n\ncommitted to reconstruction, only a small portion of the Federal \nassistance has been targeted toward long-term needs such as the \nrestoration of the gulf coast's infrastructure. In fact, the Brookings \nInstitution has concluded that only $35 billion of the $110 million has \nbeen dedicated to long-term rebuilding efforts. Only a small portion of \nthis amount is dedicated to reconstructing the gulf coast's levees and \nfloodwalls.\n  The bottom line is that the rebuilding is nowhere near complete and \nneither is the need for Federal aid. The people of the gulf coast \nappreciate the generosity of the American people. We all know where \nwe'd be without the Federal Government lending a hand to help bring \nback the gulf coast. That being said, the President promised in his \nspeech at Jackson Square in New Orleans that the Federal Government \nwould be there until the job is complete. While it is a reality that no \none enjoys facing, the fact that the rebuilding of the gulf is only in \nits infancy--is reality nonetheless. More needs to be done and it is \ncritical that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nrecognize that fact.\n  In conclusion, I will support the nomination of Jim Nussle but with \nthe caveat that the administration must grapple seriously with the \nlong-term financial needs of the gulf coast.\n  I thank the Chair and ask that my entire statement appear in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I oppose the nomination of Jim Nussle to \nbe the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n  During his tenure as chairman of the House Budget Committee, he not \nonly embraced but helped to enact the woefully misguided and disastrous \nbudget policies of this administration, which have resulted in massive \ndeficits, including the highest three on record. Those dangerous \npolicies have resulted in the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars \nfrom the Social Security trust funds, and draconian cuts in domestic \ninvestments that have left the infrastructure of our Nation to \ndeteriorate, and agencies, such as the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, FEMA, unprepared to protect the American people.\n  When I met with Mr. Nussle in July, I also was taken aback by his \nlack of knowledge about funding the military operations in Iraq, \nsuggesting that it is common and routine to fund such operations \nthrough supplemental appropriations bills. He asserted that the United \nStates has always funded its wars through supplementals. This is simply \nnot true, and certainly something that the nominee for the White House \nbudget office ought to have known. Many times the Congress has passed \nsupplemental war funding bills at the beginning of a conflict, but then \nbudgeted for that war spending as part of the regular appropriations \nprocess. That is something that this administration has stubbornly \ndeclined to do, despite overwhelming votes in the Senate calling for \nregular budgeting for the Iraq war. Instead, the administration \ncontinues to ask the Congress to rubberstamp its emergency supplemental \nfunding requests.\n  I have repeatedly warned against this administration's budget and \nspending policies. I have watched the disastrous results that they have \nbrought about. I am not about to endorse a continuation of that kind of \nrecord today. I am heartened by Mr. Nussle's pledge to work in a \ncooperative way with the Congress and the Appropriations Committees. \nHowever, I do not foresee any real change in policy in the offing, and \nso I must oppose this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa seeks recognition. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, might I ask the Senator from Maine if \nshe might give 5 minutes to the Senator from Iowa for a statement in \nsupport of the nominee?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I will be happy to yield that time. I note Senator \nGrassley also is requesting time. Perhaps I can find out from Senator \nGrassley how much time he needs as well so we could accommodate both of \nthe Senators from Iowa.\n  Madam President, how much time is remaining of the time that I have \nbeen allotted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I will be happy to yield 5 minutes to \nSenator Harkin. I will yield the remainder of my time to Senator \nGrassley, but I hope we can only find an additional few minutes so he \ncould complete his statement.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, we will ask another Senator who controls \ntime if we can get additional time for Senator Grassley. We will do \nthat while Senator Harkin and Senator Grassley are speaking.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Maine for \nyielding me this time.\n  In July, in testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, I spoke strongly in favor of President \nBush's nomination of former Congressman Jim Nussle to serve as the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget.\n  In his testimony before the committee and in a subsequent appearance \nbefore the Senate Budget Committee, Congressman Nussle impressed all of \nus with his forthrightness and his obvious expertise on budget issues. \nThis should come as no surprise. The fact is that Congressman Nussle is \nsuperbly qualified for the job of Budget Director. First elected to \nrepresent Iowa's First Congressional District in 1990, he served \nhonorably for eight terms. He joined the House Budget Committee in \nJanuary of 1995 and was elected chairman in January of 2001, a position \nhe served in for the next 6 years.\n  Congressman Nussle is a genuine expert and a recognized expert on the \nbudget and a master of the budgeting process. I have known Jim Nussle \nand worked with him for more than 16 years. I can tell you that he is a \nskilled and savvy operator. He is a straight shooter whose word is his \nbond and who can be counted on to follow through with the commitments \nhe makes. As chairman of the Budget Committee, he reached out to \nmajority and minority members and he gave everyone a fair hearing.\n  In addition, Congressman Nussle will bring to the job an impressive \narray of political skills. As Senators saw firsthand during his \nappearances before the two committees this summer, he is open and \nresponsive. He is an excellent communicator, and he is a formidable \nadvocate for the causes in which he believes.\n  As members of different political parties, Congressman Nussle and I \nhave often disagreed on principles and priorities. But in Jim Nussle, \nthe President has chosen a person of exceptional intelligence, \ncompetence, and experience.\n  As we enter the final month of the fiscal year, we face enormous \nchallenges with regard to the budget. I have had and continue to have \nsharp disagreements with President Bush over his budget priorities, in \nparticular his shortchanging of children's health insurance, education, \nand biomedical research. And, of course, I believe we need to work to \neliminate abusive tax breaks enjoyed by multinational companies and the \nvery wealthy, as was just outlined by the Senator from North Dakota a \nfew moments ago. Now, we all understand that the Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget is not the initiator but the implementer of \nthe President's agenda. However, it is my hope that in Congressman \nNussle, we will have a voice of moderation and corporation.\n  Finally, I would add that those of us who represent rural America, \nrural areas, small towns and communities, could have no better advocate \nfor rural America, for our farmers, our farm families, and those who \nlive in small towns and communities than Congressman Jim Nussle. He has \nalways been there fighting for their interests, and it is kind of good \nto have someone like that in the position of Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget.\n  I intend to vote yes on Congressman Nussle's nomination. I urge all \nof my colleagues to do likewise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask that the Senator withhold.\n  How much time does Senator Gregg have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes.\n\n[[Page S11034]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Thirteen minutes. If the Senator would be willing to \nreserve 10 of his minutes and give the additional 3 minutes to the \nSenator from Iowa so the Senator from Iowa can have a total of 9 \nminutes? At least that gets us close to the Senator's request.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am pleased the Senate is considering the nomination \nof Jim Nussle to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n  I thank Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee for their quick action on \nthe nomination, and I also thank Chairman Conrad and Ranking Member \nGregg of the Budget Committee for helping to move this nomination along \nvery quickly. Also, of course, I thank the majority leader, Senator \nReid, for making time in the Senate's hectic schedule for the \nconsideration of this most important nomination.\n  I have known Jim Nussle for nearly 27 years. I first met him when, as \na student at Luther College, he drove me around the State as I \ncampaigned in my first run for the Senate. He was elected to the U.S. \nHouse in 1991 at the age of 30. Congressman Nussle quickly rose through \nthe ranks as chairman of a committee, and he excelled in that very \nimportant leadership role as chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  Congressman Nussle and I share a strong belief that we here in \nWashington hold a great responsibility to be wise stewards of the \ntaxpayers' money. He took this responsibility very seriously and acted \non it early in his congressional career. Few have worked as hard as \nCongressman Nussle to ferret out wasteful and unnecessary Federal \nspending. If confirmed for the OMB Director, I am certain he will \ncontinue to be one of the taxpayers' advocates there in that new \nposition.\n  When he was chairman of the House Budget Committee, Jim Nussle did \nnot just focus on short-term goals; he looked down the road at long-\nterm challenges. As an example, in the Deficit Reduction Act, with \nJim's leadership at the Budget Committee, Congress took an important \nfirst step in reforming our entitlement spending. This step saved \ntaxpayers nearly $40 billion over a 5-year period of time.\n\n  Jim Nussle also understands that the Federal budget process can and \nneeds to be improved. He chaired a bipartisan task force in the late \n1990s and developed a bipartisan initiative termed the ``Comprehensive \nBudget Process Reform Act of 1998,'' and he did it in a bipartisan way \nwith then-Congressman and fellow Senator Ben Cardin. In working with \nthen-Congressman Cardin, he demonstrated his abilities to work across \nthe aisle and develop bipartisan products.\n  This respect for the other side continued during his time as Budget \nchairman. During the Senate Budget Committee's hearings to consider his \nnomination, House Budget Chairman Spratt attested to the respectful \nmanner in which Congressman Nussle handled the Budget Committee under \nhis chairmanship. Chairman Spratt, then the ranking member, spoke to \nthe fair and collegial treatment the minority received while Jim Nussle \nwas its chairman and to Congressman Nussle's knowledge of the budget \nprocess.\n  I believe it is Congressman Nussle's qualifications and respect from \nall sides that led to a unanimous vote in favor of his nomination by \nthe Homeland Security Committee and by the 22-to-1 vote in the Budget \nCommittee. Yet some have chosen to use Congressman Nussle's nomination \nto take issue with the President's fiscal and economic policies. So I \nwould point out to my colleagues that while they portray the economy as \nnothing but doom and gloom, the facts suggest otherwise.\n  Unemployment remains at historically low levels. Most recently, the \nunemployment rate stood at 4.6 percent. July was the 47th consecutive \nmonth with job gains, and over 8.3 million new jobs have been created \nduring those 47 months. The fact is, the economy is resilient and \ngrowing. We have had 23 consecutive quarters of growth in the gross \ndomestic product.\n  Contrary to the arguments of some of my colleagues, the budget \ndeficit has been coming down year by year. This year's deficit is \nestimated to be 1.5 percent of our gross domestic product, and that is \nlower than the 40-year average of 2.4 percent of GDP. The reduction in \nthe deficit is largely due to the higher than anticipated revenues \ncoming into the Federal Treasury, and this increase in Federal revenue \nhas occurred since the bipartisan tax relief plans passed in 2001 and \n2003.\n  While those on the other side may argue that we are undertaxed, I \nwould like to point out that this year's receipts are projected at 18.8 \npercent of gross domestic product. That is higher than the historic \nnorm over a 30-year average of 18.3 percent. So while Congress and the \nPresident acted in a bipartisan way in response to the economic effects \nof the tech bubble burst and the attacks of September 11, 2001, we are \nstill generating the necessary revenues to operate the Federal budget \nat historic levels.\n  Where would our economy be today if Congress had not enacted a \nbipartisan economic stimulus tax package? Would our economy have \nweathered the crash of the NASDAQ in 2000 when it lost 50 percent of \nits value or the economic shock after the 9/11 attacks in 2001? Would \nwe have come out of it with such resilience as we have without those \ntax bills having passed? Would we have such low unemployment, strong \nGDP growth, or the creation of those over 8 million jobs without that \ntax relief? Now, these are fair questions that the critics of the \nPresident's economic policies ought to consider.\n  Regardless, we are here today to consider the nomination of \nCongressman Nussle to be Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget. However you feel about the President's economic policies, I \nthink we should all agree that the President has the right to choose \nhis Director for the Office of Management and Budget. Rather than delay \nand object to considerations of this nominee, I believe it makes more \nsense to confirm the President's highly qualified choice and get to the \nwork of finishing the peoples' business.\n  We have a serious challenge ahead of us. With only 1 of 12 annual \nappropriations bills having even been considered by the Senate, we find \nourselves less than 4 weeks away from the end of the fiscal year. In \norder for this process to get underway in earnest, it is important that \nthe President has his choice of Budget Director in place. Given \nCongressman Nussle's experience, knowledge, and commitment to public \nservice, it is fitting that he has been nominated to be the Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget.\n  Jim Nussle is highly qualified. He knows the budget. He understands \nCongress, and he is a decent, honorable public servant. So I hope the \nSenate will see fit to confirm Jim Nussle to OMB Director.\n  I think the people who gave me the additional time ought to have it \nback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friend and colleague from Vermont for \nyielding me time. I will speak for a brief moment on this nomination \nand then talk a little bit about Iraq.\n  First, I will oppose the nomination of Jim Nussle to OMB Director. \nWhy? Because our country is in a new world and a new time and a new \nplace. Our health care system, our education system, and our \ninfrastructure are lagging, and those who put continued tax cuts for \nthe very wealthy above rebuilding America are at the wrong time, in the \nwrong place. That is what Jim Nussle has done. I understand it is a \nheartfelt belief of his.\n  We Democrats have adopted a more responsible position of pay-go. We \nDemocrats believe, yes, we must restore our infrastructure, both \nphysical and human, in America to stay great. And with an OMB Director \nwho remains rigidly wedded to the policies of the past, tax cuts to the \nvery wealthy above everything, above rebuilding our schools and \nrestoring health care and getting our bridges and roads built--we are \nheaded in the wrong direction. So I must vote against him and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Now, I rise today to discuss the situation in Iraq and the continuing \nefforts of this administration to paint a rosy picture, to cling to \nstraws when the situation on the ground suggests just the opposite.\n  I first thank my colleague, Jack Reed, who has done great work on \nMILCON, veterans affairs, which we\n\n[[Page S11035]]\n\nhave just considered, and for his work on Iraq.\n  Some have argued that the surge in Iraq is working, but all you have \nto do is look at the facts to know that is not the case. The President \nwent to Anbar Province, which at the moment he is touting as a measure \nof success, but we all know what has happened in Iraq. You push on one \nend of the balloon, and it pops out on another. Anbar may be a little \nbetter; other places are worse. And the fallacy of Anbar is just \namazing. Are we placing our faith in the future in Iraq on a handful of \nwarlords who at the moment dislike al-Qaida more than they dislike us? \nAnd they certainly dislike us. What kind of policy is that? What are \nthe odds that 6 months from now, the fragile and perilous situation in \nAnbar will reverse itself and collapse? We heard about success in \nBaghdad, we heard about success in Fallujah, and we heard about success \nin this province and that province, and it vanishes. Success vanishes \nlike the wind. Why? Because the fundamentals in Iraq stay the same. \nThat is, that there is no central government, that the Shiites and the \nSunnis and the Kurds dislike one another far more than they like any \ncentral government, and that dooms our policy in Iraq to fail. When the \nPresident began the surge he said it was to give the Government \nbreathing room, to strengthen the present Government. We have more \ntroops there, more military action, more deaths this summer, more than \nany other, and the Government is weaker. So why isn't it apparent to \nthe President and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that the \nstated goal of the surge is failing? Because the goal is not a military \ngoal but, by the President's own words, it is to give the Government of \nIraq greater strength, breathing room, as he put it. That Government, \nby just about every standard, is worse off than it was before.\n\n  Again, Anbar Province? Because a few warlords, tribal leaders are now \non our side for the moment, even though they are not loyal to us, they \ndon't like us and they dislike the central government, that is why we \nshould continue the present course in Iraq? It makes no sense.\n  What happened to the great call for democracy in Iraq? Are the tribal \nleaders in Anbar Province our apostles of democracy? Of course not. I \nadmit that is realpolitik. That is fine. But it is not going to solve \nthe problem.\n  If you look at the benchmarks, today the independent GAO report due \nto be delivered to Congress showed little progress being made in \nmeeting the 18 military and security benchmarks set out by the \nCongress. A draft report showed that only three of the benchmarks had \nbeen met. However, over the weekend, the Pentagon revised the draft GAO \nreport and now, miraculously, an additional four benchmarks were \n``partially met.'' Despite the apparent efforts by the Pentagon to edit \nthis independent report, it will take much more than a red pen to \ncorrect the failures of the President's Iraq policy. So the surge by \nthe President's own stated goal is failing. The Government is weaker. \nThe fundamentals on the ground are the same. There is no loyalty to a \ncentral government.\n  The temporary stasis in Anbar Province is not because of the surge \nbut because the surge was unable to protect these tribal leaders from \nal-Qaida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The bottom line is very simple. We are worse off today \nin Iraq than we were 6 months ago. The position of America, democracy, \nstability continues to deteriorate. If there were ever a need for a \nchange in course in Iraq, it is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, we have heard over the last few moments \nfrom some of our Republican friends, again, the assertion of how strong \nthis economy is doing and how we have to continue going along this same \npath with an OMB Director who is supportive of these policies. Let me \nreiterate, I do not believe the economy is stronger when, over the last \n6 years, 5 million more Americans have become poor, slipped into \npoverty, including a million children. I do not believe this economy is \nstrong when median income for working age families has declined by \nabout $2,400 since the year 2000. I do not believe this economy is \nstrong when the personal savings rate has been below zero for eight \nconsecutive quarters. I do not believe this economy is strong when 8.6 \nmillion Americans have lost their health insurance since President Bush \nhas been in office. I do not believe this economy is strong when 35 \nmillion Americans struggled to put food on the table last year and \nhunger in America is growing. I do not believe this economy is strong \nwhen home foreclosures are now the highest on record, turning the \nAmerican dream of home ownership into a nightmare.\n  We need a new direction in economic policy, policies which protect \nthe interests of ordinary Americans and not just the wealthy and the \npowerful. We need an OMB Director to tell this President the reality of \neconomic life for tens of millions of our families rather than continue \na mythology which essentially represents the interests of the people on \ntop who, in fact, are doing very well. Maybe government should \nrepresent all rather than just the wealthy and the powerful.\n  When I talked before about the budget priorities of President Bush, \nwe should continue that discussion and talk about how he treats our \nveterans. The war in Iraq, something which I strongly opposed, has \ngiven us now over 27,000 soldiers who have been wounded, many of them \nseriously. Studies tell us that many of the soldiers returning home \nfrom Iraq are coming home with post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD. \nHow did the President's budget, a budget which we turned around, how \ndid his initial budget treat the veterans? His budget proposed cutting \nthe VA by $3.4 billion over 5 years after adjusting for inflation. That \ndoes not say thank you to our veterans and their families and all they \nhave gone through.\n  We have a President who in his budget has said we don't have enough \nmoney to address the needs of the middle class, working families, \nsenior citizens, children, and veterans. We don't have enough money to \ndo that, to pay attention to the people who are hurting. But amazingly \nenough, President Bush has told us we do have enough money to provide \n$739 billion in tax breaks over the next decade to households with \nincomes exceeding $1 million per year. Under President Bush's proposal, \nthe average tax break for this group of millionaires would total \n$162,000 by the year 2012. So if you are a millionaire or a \nbillionaire, the good news is, we have enough money for you. But if you \nare a veteran coming home from Iraq with PTSD, if you are a mother \ntrying to find quality childcare for your kids, if you are a worker \ntrying to find health insurance, sorry. This country does not have \nenough money for you.\n  Let me be very blunt. In my view, it is wrong to be giving huge tax \nbreaks to the very wealthiest people, the people who need them the \nleast, while cutting back on the needs of the middle class and working \nfamilies. I should say that Mr. Nussle's record as chairman of the \nBudget Committee tells us clearly he supports these tax breaks for the \nvery rich while, at the same time, he has been prepared over the years \nto cut programs for those who need them the most. That is wrong. That \nis why I will be voting against Mr. Nussle's confirmation.\n\n  Included in President Bush's budget is the complete repeal of the \nestate tax which would take effect at the end of 2010. The complete \nrepeal of the estate tax, we should be clear, because sometimes people \nhave not been quite so clear about it, would benefit the wealthiest \nthree-tenths of 1 percent of our population, the top three-tenths of 1 \npercent, and 99.7 percent of the American people would not benefit, \ntheir families would not benefit by one nickel from the repeal of the \nestate tax. Obviously, if you are in the top three-tenths of 1 percent, \nyou are already a millionaire or a billionaire, and you are already in \na family which is doing very well and has been doing well in recent \nyears. In other words, 99.7 percent of Americans would not receive one \nnickel. The wealthiest people, who are\n\n[[Page S11036]]\n\ndoing very well, would get all the benefits.\n  According to the President's budget, this repeal of the estate tax \nwill reduce receipts for the Treasury by more than $91 billion over the \nnext 5 years and more than $442 billion over the next decade. But the \nlong-term damage to our fiscal solvency is even worse. According to the \nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities, repealing the estate tax would \ncost over $1 trillion from 2012 to 2021, all of which benefit goes to \nthe wealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent. In other words, if the \nPresident's plan to permanently repeal the estate tax succeeds, the \nchildren and family members of the most privileged families in America \nwill reap a massive tax break. Paris Hilton, you are in luck, if the \nPresident gets his way. You are going to do very well. But for other \nAmericans, the deficit will go up, and the argument will be raised that \nwe don't have enough money to take care of our kids, our seniors, and \nour veterans.\n  What has Mr. Nussle's position been as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee on repeal of the estate tax? He is there alongside the \nPresident. So we have every reason to believe he will be recommending \nto the President that we continue this extremely unfair and disastrous \npolicy.\n  When we talk about repealing the estate tax, which the President \nwants to do, which Mr. Nussle wants to do, which many of our Republican \nfriends want to do, I think we should see who benefits in a more \nspecific sense. Yes, it is the wealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent who \nwill get all of the benefits, the people who need it the least. Let's \nlook at one particular family who does have the best. Let's put this \nthing into perspective. The reality is the big winner, the people who \nneed this money the most--not the kids, not our seniors, not low-income \npeople, not our veterans, no, they get at the end of the line--the \npeople who receive a significant amount of the benefits from repeal of \nthe estate tax is the Walton family that owns Wal-Mart. In fact, \ntoday--and these things change; they go up and down--the estimated net \nworth of the Sam Walton family is about $83.2 billion. From where I \ncome, that is pretty good, $83.2 billion. You are a family that is \ndoing fine. You will probably be able to pay the rent next month. If \nthe estate tax is repealed for this one family, they will receive a \nbenefit of $32.7 billion, one family, $32.7 billion.\n  We do not have enough money, says the President, to increase health \ninsurance for our children. Oh, he is going to repeal that $32 billion \nto take care of 3 million more kids? We cannot afford that, but we can \nafford to give $32 billion in tax breaks to a family worth $83 billion.\n  Those priorities are wrong. In my view, they are immoral. We need an \nOMB Director who begins to explain to the American people this is not \nwhat America is about, who begins to explain to the American people we \nneed a budget that reflects the needs and deals with the needs of \nmillions of families, where people are working longer hours for lower \nwages, that deals with the problems of our senior citizens, deals with \nthe problems of our crumbling infrastructure, deals with the problems \nof kids who cannot afford to go to college, deals with all of the \nproblems our people face every single day. That is the kind of budget \nwe need. That is the kind of OMB Director we need. What we do not need \nare policies which give obscene benefits to the very wealthiest people \nin this country.\n  Let me simply say at this point that in fact what this debate is \nabout is whether we are going to have an OMB Director who can advise \nthe President about the reality facing our working families or will we \ncontinue the same failed policies?\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a little bit what has \nbeen talked about at length in this debate. I think it has been a very \nhelpful and good debate. It has not been about Congressman Nussle and \nhis qualifications. That seems to be universally agreed upon. It has \nbeen about the issue of policy and how we approach fiscal policy in \nthis country.\n  The other side of the aisle, for whatever reason, seems to think 24 \nquarters of economic growth, with the addition of 8.4 million new jobs \nover the last few years, a tax law which was put into place which has \ncaused us to generate more receipts as a Federal Government than we \never received before over a 3-year period relative to growth and as a \npercent of gross national product, is something we should not have, \nthat this is bad policy for some reason, that giving people jobs, \ncreating economic activity, having a tax policy that is fair, is not \ngood. Therefore, they are attacking Congressman Nussle for him being \nproposed to become OMB Director and for the fact he happens to ascribe \nto those approaches.\n  Now, I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I \nam not sure what they expect. Maybe they are sort of like Claude Rains \nin ``Casablanca,'' where he comes out of the room and says: I'm \nshocked--shocked--to find out that there's gambling going on in Rick's. \nWhat? Are they shocked to find out the President nominated a Director \nof OMB who agrees with him? I mean, really. Obviously, he is going to \nnominate a Director of OMB who agrees with him. For as much as I admire \nthe Senator from Vermont, his philosophies, which he of his own accord \nhas described as socialist--although he affiliates with the Democratic \nParty--are not necessarily the philosophies of the President. So I do \nnot expect he is going to nominate somebody with the philosophy of the \nSenator from Vermont. Even France, quite honestly, has rejected the \nphilosophy of the Senator from Vermont. So I do not think the President \nis going to subscribe to it.\n  What is hard to accept, however, is this argument that for some \nreason the tax cut the President has put in place has been regressive, \nthat it has been unfairly distributed.\n  Let's go back to the record. The simple fact is today the top 20 \npercent of earned income or taxable income under the income tax laws--\nthe top 20 percent of earners in those categories is paying 85.3 \npercent of the burden of Federal taxes. That is more than was paid \nunder the Clinton administration when those same people, the top 20 \npercent, were paying 81 percent of the burden of Federal taxes.\n  People of lower income or moderate income who do not pay income taxes \nbasically--individuals do, but as a group they do not pay a net income \ntax--the bottom 40 percent of income earners in this country is \nactually getting more back from the Federal Government in the form of \nearned income tax credit and other benefits than they received under \nthe Clinton years--almost twice as much back.\n  So you have the highest income people in this country paying more \nthan under the Clinton years, who are bearing a larger share of the \nburden, and you have the lower income people or the moderate income \npeople getting more back from the Federal Government. That, ladies and \ngentlemen, is called progressivity. That is a tax law that is working.\n  Why is it working? Why are the people with higher incomes paying more \ntaxes? That is called human nature. It is called human nature. If you \nsay to someone: ``I am going to take the next 90 cents of the $1 you \nearn, and take it to the Federal Government and the State Government \nand the local government''--I do not know that Vermont reaches 90 \npercent. They are probably pretty close. That is why people come to New \nHampshire to buy liquor and other goods; they are not subject to a \nsales tax. That is just a bit of PR for our State. But if you say that \nto a person, they are not going to go out and make the effort to earn \nthat extra dollar, whether it is 90 percent, 70 percent, or 50 percent.\n  Why? Because they do not want to pay the taxes. They do not want to \nwork for the Government half the year. Actually, everybody is working \nfor the Government half the year, but they\n\n[[Page S11037]]\n\ndon't want to work for it for two-thirds of the year.\n  So if you put in place a tax law that is fair, where you say to a \nperson: ``You go out and invest, you take a risk, you become an \nentrepreneur, and as a result you create jobs, and we are going to tax \nyou fairly,'' then you get more economic activity that is taxable. As a \nresult, you get more money to the Federal Government. That is what has \nhappened over the last 3 years. We are now receiving more revenue than \nwe have historically. In fact, we have had the largest increase in the \nhistory of our Government in the last 3 years as a percentage, and we \nare getting more in than what has been the historical norm. Usually, we \nhave been getting, since World War II, about an 18.2-percent raise in \nrevenues from the gross national product. Now we have gone up to 18.6 \npercent and 18.7 percent, and those are big increases.\n\n  Why are we getting those increases? Because people are willing to \nparticipate in the taxable economy. Because there is a fair tax rate \nthat is in place today. What is the other side of the aisle suggesting? \nLet's raise those taxes. Let's raise those taxes way up so we can spend \nthe money--not to put it to debt reduction, as the Senator from North \nDakota talks about--so we can raise taxes on the American people to \nspend the money.\n  Their budget suggests we increase taxes by somewhere between $400 \nbillion and $900 billion over 5 years. Their budget suggests we \nincrease spending on the discretionary side by around $200 billion over \nthe next 5 years. Their budget suggests we increase spending on the \nentitlement side by a number that is so astronomical I cannot even \ncalculate it, but I think it is around $1 trillion. It is a classic \ntax-and-spend approach. Its purpose is not to make the economy \nstronger. Its purpose is not to reduce the debt. Its purpose is to \nraise taxes, to spend the money on interest, which the other side of \nthe aisle finds attractive.\n  Well, that is reasonable if you do it in a way that is fair. But what \nthey are suggesting is you raise taxes on working Americans, and \nspecifically on seniors. Do you know who most benefits from the capital \ngains rate? Senior citizens. Do you know who most benefits from the \ndividends rate? Senior citizens. Logic tells you that; also statistics \ndo. The fact is, when you are a senor citizen, you do not have earned \nincome. You are probably not subject to the income tax rate for the \nmost part, but you might have dividend income from one of the pension \nfunds you invested in or that the company you worked for invested in. \nAnd you probably have capital gains income because you probably sold \nsome asset such as your house to move into another lifestyle.\n  So not only are they suggesting we raise taxes in a manner which will \nundermine what has been a clear economic benefit to this country, in \nthat we have seen 24 months of economic expansion and we have added 8.4 \nmillion jobs, we have seen revenues jump dramatically. In fact, the \ncapital gains revenues are now $100 billion over what they were \nestimated to be--$100 billion. Why is that? Because people are willing \nto take risks. They are willing to take their capital out that was \nlocked up and put it into more productive activity, the result of which \nis to create jobs.\n  People are investing in starting new restaurants and starting new \nsoftware companies, starting new small businesses all across this \ncountry because there is a reasonable tax rate on doing that. As a \nresult, we are creating jobs. What is the result of that? We generate \nrevenues to the Federal Government. The other side of the aisle does \nnot like that, I guess. The only way they want to generate revenue to \nthe Federal Government is to raise taxes on people. Well, it doesn't \nwork very well, quite honestly. President Kennedy showed the best way \nto do it is the way we have done it. President Reagan showed us the \nbest way to do it is the way we have done it. And now President Bush \nhas shown it one more time.\n  It is hard to accept this philosophy which continues to be paraded \nout by the other side of the aisle, which we, regrettably, in New \nHampshire are hearing a great deal of--actually, we do not regret it. \nWe love it. We love to have the folks come to New Hampshire who are \nrunning for President and listen to their positions. But as you listen \nto people, your head has to spin as to the number of new programs that \nare being proposed by the front runners of the Democratic Party. It is \nprogram after program after program. If you listen to one of their \nspeeches--and I have listened to all the major candidates on their side \nof the aisle give speeches in New Hampshire over the last few weeks--it \nis a litany, more or less like a merry-go-round, of ideas of how to \nspend money, followed by ideas as to how to tax people.\n  The list goes on and on, but right at the top of the list is raise \nthe capital gains rate, raise the dividend rate, raise the taxes on \nearning Americans, raise the taxes on productive Americans, which will \nresult in a reduction of job activity, a reduction of revenues to the \nFederal Government, and it will be an unfortunate decision to reverse \nsome very good economic news we have had over the last few years.\n  Mr. President, at this time I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe we sort of agreed casually on an \norder that the Senator from Vermont will speak, then I will speak, and \nthen the Senator from North Dakota will wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire talks \nabout program after program. Yes, we want to take care of our veterans, \nwe want to provide health insurance to our children, and we do not want \nto give tax breaks to billionaires.\n  Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to my friend from California.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I also yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues.\n  I have never seen the Senator from New Hampshire so emotional and so \nexcited. You would think the record we have seen in terms of this \neconomy has been stellar. It reminds me of the expressions: ``He doth \nprotest too much'' and ``the best defense is a strong offense. Get \nexcited and wave your hands.'' Let's talk about what has happened here. \nThis President and the Republicans in this Senate are trying to claim \nthe mantle of fiscal responsibility. In fact, they turned a $236 \nbillion surplus inherited from the Clinton administration into a $248 \nbillion deficit. They oversaw the three largest budget deficits in U.S. \nhistory, and they are responsible for a $3 trillion increase in the \nnational debt. Now, let me say this: Who owns that debt? Foreign \ncountries--China, Japan. I don't hear the Senator from New Hampshire \nbemoaning the fact that they can hold us hostage.\n\n  We need a change here. We need fiscal responsibility. We need \ninvestments in things that help our children, education, for one, and \nhelp our families, health care, for two, and a way to make sure our \nveterans truly get what they need. Instead, the President gives us as \nhead of the OMB Mr. Nussle, who is closely associated with all of these \npolicies and failed as chairman of the Budget Committee three out of \nsix times to get a budget and work with Democrats. This is an absolute \noutrage.\n  Now, I voted for so many of the President's appointees. I didn't vote \nfor Alberto Gonzales, but I did vote for most.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will not vote for a man who put a bag over his head in \nthe House of Representatives. That, to me, shows complete hostility to \nthis great democracy. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont has \n1 minute.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me conclude by applauding Majority \nLeader Harry Reid, Chairman Kent Conrad, and Senators Schumer, Dorgan, \nand Boxer for publicly expressing their opposition to the Nussle \nnomination.\n  The bottom line is today the economy is doing very well if you are in \nthe top 1 percent, if you are a millionaire or a billionaire. But if \nyou are in the\n\n[[Page S11038]]\n\nmiddle class, if you are a working person, the likelihood is you work \nlonger hours for lower wages.\n  We need a change in economic policy. We need an OMB Director who can \nadvise the President about the reality of the vast majority of the \npeople, and not just the very wealthiest people in our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Does the Senator from New Hampshire ask to speak for an \nadditional 30 seconds?\n  Mr. GREGG. I thought I had some time reserved. I don't. I ask \nunanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Without objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I simply wish to note we are about to vote \non the nomination for the Director of OMB, who is a man of high \nintegrity and high quality, and who has the expertise to do this job \nwell. I think we should presume that the President should have the \nright to appoint the person of his choosing to this office which is so \nuniquely part of the White House to begin with.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me end where I began. This is not \nabout a personality; this is about policy. The fiscal policy of this \nadministration has exploded the debt of our country at the worst \npossible time--right before the baby boom generation retires. Here is \nthe record. It is undisputed. It is uncontradicted. It is a simple \nfact. The debt of this country under this policy--and Mr. Nussle is one \nof the architects of this policy--has skyrocketed from $5.8 trillion at \nthe end of the President's first year to $8.9 trillion at the end of \nthis year. So much of that debt is now held abroad. When this President \ncame into office, there was $1 trillion of U.S. debt held by foreign \ninterests. That has now reached over $2.1 trillion, a more than \ndoubling of U.S. debt held abroad. That puts this country at risk.\n  We saw during the last few weeks the Chinese Minister indicate they \nmight start to diversify out of dollar-denominated securities. \nEconomists said if they chose to do that, they would push the United \nStates into recession. In many ways, our economic future is now less in \nour hands and more in the hands of the people who hold our debt.\n  I ask my colleagues on the basis of policy to reject this nomination.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Jim Nussle, of Iowa, to be Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback), the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Craig), the \nSenator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), and the Senator from Alaska (Ms. \nMurkowski).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez).

Mr. President, earlier this morning, I made a very brief \nstatement indicating that in the rush of business when we went home for \nthe summer work period, the last vote cast that day was Senator \nKennedy's 15,000th vote. There was a lot going on here at that time, \nand no one said anything. But I think it certainly is noteworthy--and \nthat is an understatement--to recognize that this good man has passed \neveryone, except Senator Byrd, in the number of votes cast. Senator \nByrd has cast over 18,000 votes, but there is no close second other \nthan Senator Kennedy.\n  We all recognize the tremendous work this man has done. As I said \nthis morning, what a family. They have done so much for our country. \nTwo of his brothers were assassinated. One of his other brothers was \nkilled in the line of duty during World War II. Senator Kennedy has \ndone so much to leave a legacy in the Kennedy name that is remarkable.\n  We all admire the work he has done. As I said this morning, one of my \npleasures in life is being able to come to the Senate and work with \nthis great man. Working with him is such a pleasure because he can get \non this floor and speak very loudly, and we all listen. But when you \nare working with him on legislation, he has so much humility, never \nwanting to take the limelight, always willing to step back and let \nthose who are his junior move forward, and I include myself in that \nlot.\n  So congratulations to Senator Kennedy.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, more than half a century ago, a right \nend--this is in the days before a tight end was invented--on the \nHarvard football team caught the eye of the head coach of the Green Bay \nPackers. The coach wrote the young man to ask if he might consider a \npro career. But Edward Moore Kennedy had other ideas. He responded that \nhe was flattered by the attention, but that he had already decided to \ngo to law school and then go into another contact sport--politics.\n  I rise this afternoon in tribute to a man who is known to most people \nfor his famous name but who is famous among his colleagues in the \nSenate for his warmth, good humor, and his simply astonishing ability \nand will to get things done.\n  Senator Kennedy, as the majority leader just indicated, cast his \n15,000th vote just before we broke for recess, solidifying his place as \nthe third most prolific voter in the history of this body.\n  It was just the latest milestone in a storied 45-year career marked \nby countless others. And it surprised no one who has ever witnessed him \nspeaking on the floor or off on the issues he cares about. The Senate \nhas been his arena for more than four decades, and in the course of \npushing thousands of pieces of legislation, he has worn out hundreds of \nstaffers, committee members, and stenographers. He ignites\n\n[[Page S11039]]\n\nevery debate and issue he ever decided to touch. Let no one ever accuse \nthis man of simply punching the clock.\n  Thousands of visitors to the Capitol have instantly known that this \nis a place of momentous deeds when they have seen Senator Kennedy \njabbing the air or wheeling around, voice rising, even in an empty \nChamber, to make a point. He is not a man who ever depended on a \nmicrophone to get his point across.\n  His reputation as an aisle-crosser is also well known. Less well \nknown is his graciousness off the floor, as when he accepted an \ninvitation of mine to speak to the students at the McConnell Center at \nthe University of Louisville last year, or when he insisted that \nSenator McCain accept an award in Boston despite the fact it was his \nson's 11th birthday, assuring him he would make that day special for \nhim and for his son, which he did, with a personal Coast Guard tour \naround Boston Harbor and, according to Senator McCain, at least two \nbirthday cakes.\n  Senator Kennedy is one of the most visible men of our time. He has \nevery reason to let people come to him. Yet when we had a reception \nearlier this year for our most recent Republican member, Senator \nBarrasso, it was Senator Kennedy who approached Senator Barrasso and \nsat with him and his family, talking, sharing stories, and welcoming \nthem with all the warmth and affection of a grandfather long after the \nother Senators had cleared the room.\n  Senator Kennedy, as we all know, is a famous story teller. But one of \nthe greatest stories in American politics is his own. We honor him \ntoday for reaching yet another milestone along the way, and we wish him \nmany more.\n  One of my own personal political heroes, Ronald Reagan, was for 8 \nyears a great political nemesis of Senator Kennedy's. Yet Senator \nKennedy said he always admired our 40th President because, as he once \nput it, ``Ronald Reagan stood for a set of ideas, and he had something \nto communicate.''\n  Senator Kennedy's friends on the other side admire the same quality \nin him. We may disagree with his policies, and we do, but we respect \nhim for his remarkable commitment and persistence in pursuit of those \nideas, those principles. And we honor him today for this particularly \nimpressive achievement. Congratulations.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my privilege to join in saying a few \nwords about my senior colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts. The \nspecial words that have been spoken about Ted Kennedy are obviously \nmore than appropriate. But let me say, if I may, it is interesting that \nwhen we take a measure of Ted Kennedy's work here, which is an \nunparalleled record of achievement, and we look at the public record, \nthat public record is actually full of comparisons to the greatest \nSenators who have ever served in the United States Senate or even some \nof the greatest who have served in Washington.\n  The Boston Globe wrote of our senior Senator:\n\n       In actual measurable impact on the lives of tens of \n     millions of working families, the elderly, the needy, Ted \n     belongs in the same sentence with Franklin Roosevelt.\n\n  Time magazine said:\n\n       Ted Kennedy has amassed a titanic record of legislation \n     affecting the lives of virtually every man, woman, and child \n     in the country.\n\n  And in his comprehensive book just a couple of years ago, Adam Clymer \nwrote that Ted Kennedy is a lawmaker of skill, experience, and purpose \nrarely surpassed since 1789. He has been compared to Henry Clay for his \nskill as a legislator and to Lyndon Johnson for his efforts in creating \na more egalitarian, more inclusive America that leaves no one behind.\n  Mr. President, 15,000 votes is a remarkable number. No one knows that \nmore than the Senator sitting in front of me, the Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd, who is the only other member of that exclusive \nclub. He knows, as we all know, that 15,000 is not just a statistic \nrepresenting those votes. It represents and encapsulates countless \nlegislative battles in the trenches, in the committee rooms, in \noffices, tough negotiations, thankless committee hearings, inspired \nideas, setbacks and, to a greater degree than almost any other lawmaker \nalive, laws that improve the lives of everyday Americans.\n  From his maiden speech in the Senate demanding an end to the \nfilibuster of the original Civil Rights Act, there has not been a \nsignificant policy accomplishment in Washington over four decades that \nhas not borne his fingerprints and benefited from his legislative skill \nand leadership. His is the record of progressive politics in our era.\n  In all of the great fights that call us to stand up and be counted, \nfrom the minimum wage year in and year out, to Robert Bork and Sam \nAlito, Ted Kennedy did not just hear the call, he led the charge. You \ncan run down the list. The rights of the disabled who for far too long \nwere left in the shadows or left to fend for themselves, Ted Kennedy \nwrote every single landmark piece of legislation that today prohibits \ndiscrimination against those with a disability.\n  AIDS--when a whole lot of politicians were even afraid to say the \nword, Ted Kennedy passed a bill providing emergency relief to the 13 \ncities hardest hit by the AIDS epidemic.\n  Mr. President, 300,000 young people today have jobs every single \nsummer because of Ted Kennedy. Guaranteed access to health coverage for \n25 million Americans who move from one job to another or who have a \npreexisting medical condition--they wouldn't have gotten that coverage \nwithout Ted Kennedy.\n  Without Ted Kennedy, there wouldn't have been bilingual education in \nthe United States for the 5 million students who today have a brighter \nfuture because they are learning English in our schools.\n  Without Ted Kennedy, we wouldn't have lowered the voting age to 18 \nand ended the hypocrisy that 18-year-olds were old enough to die for \nour country in Vietnam but not old enough to vote for the leadership.\n  Without Ted Kennedy, we wouldn't be the world's leader in cancer \nresearch and prevention.\n  Without Ted Kennedy, we wouldn't have had title IX, which opened the \ndoors of competition and opportunity for a generation of women athletes \nall across our country.\n  The list goes on, and I am not going to go through the whole list. \nBut ever since he entered this body at the age of 30, he has stood up \nagain and again to be counted in support of his beliefs. He stood up to \nbe counted. He stood up to lead again and again. He has already secured \nhis place as one of the great legislators in the history of our \ncountry.\n  And then after casting that 15,000th vote before we went away, he \ncelebrated by doing the same thing that made him a legend in the first \nplace. He rolled up his sleeves and he went back to work. That is why a \nlot of us look forward to seeing these next years with him and watch as \nhe continues to help write the history of the Senate and the history of \nour progressive politics and the history of our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am happy to join in this chorus of \npraise for the senior Senator from Massachusetts on the occasion of the \n15,000th vote he has cast--a historic milestone in this historic body \nand a milestone reached by only two other Senators, only one of whom \ncontinues to serve with great distinction, the man from West Virginia, \nSenator Robert C. Byrd. Senator Edward Moore Kennedy has now added his \nname to this roster of distinction.\n  He is the ninth child of Joseph and Rose Kennedy, born on February \n22, 1932--200 years to the day after George Washington. In a family \nsuch as the Kennedys, I am sure that coincidence did not go unnoticed. \nYears ago, Ted Kennedy made the Senate the focus of his public life. \nSome say that decision has helped him to become one of the best \nSenators ever to serve this body. His dedication to principle and his \nwillingness to delve deeply into tough issues really have been the \nhallmarks of his public service.\n  In his biography of Senator Ted Kennedy, former New York Times \nreporter Adam Clymer recalls a hearing in the 1960s in the Senate Labor \nand Public Welfare Committee on which both Ted and his brother, Bobby \nKennedy, then Senator from New York, served. Clymer describes how the \ntwo Kennedys had to wait 2 hours to question a\n\n[[Page S11040]]\n\nwitness because they were both junior members of the Senate at the \ntime. Bobby Kennedy seemed almost pained by the tedium of sitting there \nhour after hour waiting his turn. Ted was more patient.\n  Exasperated, Bobby Kennedy leaned over and asked his brother: Is this \nthe way I become a good Senator, sitting here and waiting my turn?\n  Ted Kennedy replied to his brother: Yes.\n  Bobby shot back: How many hours do I have to sit here to be a good \nSenator?\n  And Teddy said: As long as necessary.\n  Well, when it comes to 15,000 votes, I am sure that will be a record \nwhich will be hard to match. But when it comes down to it, it is not \nabout the quantity of Ted Kennedy's votes, it is about the quality of \nhis politics. He really cares. He cares about people. He cares about \nthe people who can't afford a lobbyist to stand out in the hallway and \nbeg for a vote. He cares about the people who get up every morning and \nworry that nobody has noticed their lives, lives of sacrifice and lives \nof difficulty. He cares about those people. They won't be holding big \nfundraisers with political action committees, but they are the people \nwho have energized him in his public career.\n  He also cares about the people with whom he works. I can't think of \nanother colleague with whom I have ever served in the House or Senate \nwho really reaches out in so many different ways to each of us on a \npersonal level to show that he cares. If you have a child in the \nhospital, an illness in the family, the loss of a loved one, you can \ncount on a telephone call from Ted Kennedy. If no one else remembers, \nhe will.\n  He also works every single day. I think that is the thing which \nsurprised me my 10 years in the Senate, was just the energy level of \nSenator Ted Kennedy. He never stops. And now, in his majority position \nas chairman of the HELP Committee, he has an agenda he has been waiting \non for way too long, an agenda which included increasing the minimum \nwage in America for the first time in 10 years, an agenda which is \ngoing to lead us into the kind of help for students across America to \ngo to college that we haven't seen since the passage of the GI bill \nafter World War II. Time and again, this Senator has used his \ncommitment and combined it with an energy that has produced dramatic \nresults.\n  I have had the honor of serving on the Judiciary Committee with him, \nand I know that from time to time he has stood up and taken a lonely \nand sometimes difficult political position for what he believed was \nright. It is that kind of courage and dedication to principle which \nleads me to believe he is one of the finest colleagues with whom I have \never had the honor to serve.\n  Finally, he knows that life here in the Senate is a privilege. It is \na privilege for each of us. Although he has been here longer than \nmost--perhaps only one other Senator has been here longer--he \nunderstands that for each of us this is a great privilege, to represent \ngreat States in a great nation. It is a source of great pride for me to \nhave once sat in that gallery as a college student and looked down on \nSenator Ted Kennedy on the floor, wondering if I would ever meet him, \nand to be able to stand here today on the occasion of his 15,000th vote \nand to count him as a friend and an inspiration.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this is a great pleasure--a great pleasure--\nthat I congratulate my very highly esteemed colleague and dearest \nfriend, Senator Edward Kennedy, upon the casting of his 15,000th vote. \nSenator Kennedy has now become a member, an illustrious member, of one \nof the most exclusive clubs in the whole wide world. Throughout the \nentire history of the Senate, only 2 other Senators have cast 15,000 \nvotes--I and the late Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. As a \ncharter member of this exclusive club, I welcome Senator Kennedy \naboard.\n  This latest achievement is only one of many for this fine son of \nMassachusetts. He has spent more than half his life in the Senate, and \nhe is the third longest serving Senator in U.S. history. As I have said \nbefore on this floor, history will be kind to Senator Kennedy. I have \nno doubt that history will not only regard Senator Ted Kennedy as one \nof the most effective national legislators of the 20th and now the 21st \ncentury but also as one of the great Senators ever to have graced this \nillustrious Chamber.\n  Although born to a life of privilege, Senator Kennedy has dedicated \nhis life to serving others. Senator Kennedy represents the heart and \nthe conscience of American liberalism. Senator Kennedy is responsible \nfor much, indeed much of the progressive legislation of the last four \ndecades. He is always a powerful and eloquent voice for the poor and \nthe oppressed, expressing his views in soaring speeches and passionate \nstruggles for the rights of labor, for health care reform, and for \nstrengthening the social safety net for America's less fortunate.\n  In the Senate, he has demonstrated that it is through public \nservice--to paraphrase his late brother, President John F. Kennedy--\nthat Americans can stop asking what their country can do for them and \nactually do something for their country.\n  Senator Ted Kennedy gave me unstinting support during the years when \nit was my privilege to serve as the Senate Democratic majority leader \nand minority leader at different times. When times got tough, I knew \nthat I could always count on Ted Kennedy's advice and his support. It \nmay have been a needed vote; it may not have been. It may have been \nassistance in building approval for legislative proposals. But whatever \nwas needed, Ted Kennedy was always there, and I was always grateful.\n  Thank you, Ted.\n  I shall always value Ted Kennedy's friendship not only to me but to \nthe great people of the great State--E Pluribus Unum--of West Virginia. \nAnd I am quite pleased and I am proud--proud, Ted--to have had the \npleasure and the honor and the great privilege of serving with this \nextraordinarily great Senator in the Senate.\n  Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations, Senator Ted \nKennedy, on casting your 15,000th vote. But even more importantly, \ncongratulations on being such a needed advocate for the powerless in \nour great and powerful country. Americans are a compassionate people, \nand the senior Senator from Massachusetts has no intention of ever, \never, letting the Senate forget that. Amen.\n  Thank you, sir.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is such an honor for me to be here and \nhear the Senator who has served the longest and cast the greatest \nnumber of votes heap high praise on the Senator who is No. 3 in that \ncategory. It is such an honor for every one of us, the other 98 who are \nhere, to serve with both of them.\n  I will be brief because so much has been said, but Ted Kennedy has \nbeen a beacon, he has been a mentor, he has been almost a father figure \nto so many of us in the Senate. He is so committed to the things he \nbelieves in, and you hear it in his speeches and you see it even more \nso in the great craft with which he yields the legislative pen. But \nunlike some who may love mankind in the abstract, Ted Kennedy also has \na quintessential kindness and decency to the individuals of this body \nand to individuals he just meets. We all see it in him as he walks the \nhalls. Ted Kennedy is a special human being. He would be a special \nhuman being in any craft or vocation because of who he is, what he \nknows, where he comes from. But I think every one of us--from Senator \nByrd, No. 1 in seniority in the Senate, to Senator Barrasso, No. 100--\ncount our lucky stars that we are able to serve with and know a great \nman such as Ted Kennedy.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would not want all the accolades to \nSenator Kennedy to come from that side of the aisle. Forty years ago, \nin 1967, I came to this body as a very young legislative aide to \nSenator Howard Baker, and Ted Kennedy was a very young Senator but \nalready in his second term. All the talk for the first few months--and \nI imagine Senator Byrd can remember this--was about how long would it \ntake for Senator Baker, a new Republican Senator, to\n\n[[Page S11041]]\n\nbreak on some important issue with father-in-law, the Republican \nleader, Senator Everett Dirksen and after a few months we knew because \nSenator Baker walked across the aisle and joined with Senator Ted \nKennedy and they fought against Senator Dirksen, Baker's father-in-law, \nand Sam Ervin, the most respected constitutional lawyer in the Senate, \non the issue of one man one vote.\n  I remember working with Jim Fluge, Senator Kennedy's friend who came \nback to work in the Senate 3 or 4 years ago. The upstarts won that \ndebate; Baker and Kennedy beat Dirksen and Ervin on the one man one \nvote issue. That was my first exposure to working with Senator Kennedy.\n  Several years passed and President Bush the first asked me to be the \nEducation Secretary, and I came to Washington and what did I discover? \nI have to be confirmed by a committee chaired by Senator Ted Kennedy. \nThat was 1991. That was 16 years ago. I was eventually confirmed and \nthen we worked together for nearly 2 years on educational issues.\n  Then, 4 years ago I came back and I am in the Senate and today I am \nserving on the committee that once confirmed me, and who is the \nchairman 40 years later? Senator Ted Kennedy. So I have had a very \nspecial privilege of working with Senator Kennedy and admiring him, \nboth as a legislative aide and a Cabinet member and now as a colleague \nin the Senate.\n  I can say as a practicing Republican what every Senator in this body \nalready knows: Nothing will bring a Republican audience to its feet \nfaster than a speech against high taxes, against Federal control, and \nagainst Ted Kennedy. But those outside the Senate might wonder, then, \nhow could the Republican leader and others here hold him in such \naffection? I can give you one example. We have a tradition in the \nSenate still called the maiden speech. We think about what we might say \nwhen we first come here and make it a special occasion. My first speech \nwas about what it means to be an American, how could we put the \nteaching of American history and civics back in its rightful place in \nour classrooms so our children could grow up learning what it means to \nbe an American. This is the subject the Senator from West Virginia has \nworked on, spoken about, and legislated on many times.\n  But after I made that remark and introduced a piece of legislation, \nwho was the first Senator to come over and volunteer to go around among \nhis Democratic colleagues and round up enough cosponsors so the \nlegislation could pass and eventually funds be appropriated? It was \nSenator Kennedy. Who is the Senator who at least once a year takes his \nentire family to some part of American history and helps them all \nunderstand that? I remember his coming back and telling me how excited \nhe was when the family went to Richmond and were in the church, I \nbelieve it was, where Patrick Henry was down on his knees and gave his \nspeech about American liberty.\n  That is a part of Ted Kennedy that those of us in the Senate, on both \nsides of the aisle, know. It is a part we respect and a part we \nappreciate. He cares about what it means to be an American because he \nand his family are such an important part of American history.\n  It is a great privilege to serve in this body with Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to express appreciation to all my \ncolleagues for their generous comments this evening, in particular to \nthe two leaders, Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, for their \nkindnesses tonight and other times where they have been generous of \nspirit and thought.\n  I want the people of Massachusetts to know this is not an ending; \n15,000 votes is not an ending. No one could demonstrate that better \nthan my friend and colleague from West Virginia who still speaks with \nsuch eloquence and such passion and does such an extraordinary job in \npreserving this institution the way our Founding Fathers wanted it to \nbe. He has no peer--certainly in my lifetime and I think probably in \nthe history of this body.\n  The greatest public honor of my life has been representing the people \nof Massachusetts. I love the State. I love the people. I have been \ngreatly honored by their confidence and their support over the many \nyears--joyous years, sad years. They have been extraordinary in terms \nof their support of a voice in the Senate and a vote to try to \nrecognize that America is not just a land, it is a promise. It is a \nnever-ending promise about strengthening our families and about \nstrengthening our country and about being a fair country and creating \ngreater opportunity and leading the world when we basically reflect our \ngreatest values.\n  I have been greatly honored in working in the Senate with \nextraordinary men and women over the period of years. I include so many \nwho are here now, so many of those who have worked with me over the \nperiod of years, men and women of great integrity and strong commitment \nand caring about this Nation. They have demonstrated extraordinary \ncourage, extraordinary leadership, and have helped to make the country \na much better and fairer land; many on our side, many on the other \nside--many on the other side.\n  When we think back on the great battles and challenges we have had \nover the period of years, we made progress when we came together. That \nhas been true.\n  I am very grateful to my friend, and he is my friend, John Kerry, my \ncolleague. I thank him for his friendship and support over many years. \nHe has pointed out he has helped me in my first campaign. I tried to \nhelp him on his last campaign. We are friends and colleagues and have a \ngood deal of respect for each other. I have a great deal of affection \nand respect for John.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd. As we know, he \nis not only the President of the Senate, but he has devoted his life to \nthis institution. On so many different occasions and on so many \ndifferent times--I know many in this body can remember it--when this \ninstitution was teetering on whether we were going to maintain our \nposition as the Founding Fathers wanted it and tried to devise it or \nwhether we were going to move off track, he has reminded us, \nparticularly in the great debate we had on the Iraq war, about that \nrole of this institution and its role in American life and its role in \nthe world. We are all mindful of that.\n  He has been a friend. We have a time where we go back and remind each \nother of the times we differed, but what we also, I think, have valued \nis the fact that our friendship I believe is stronger because of the \ntimes that we did differ. We have great affection for each other, \nrespect for each other. I thank him for his extremely kind and generous \nremarks.\n  Mr. BYRD. And I thank you, Ted.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, finally, I could not take this moment \nwithout thinking back about, personally, the service in this Chamber. \nWhen I first arrived in this Chamber, I was fortunate to have two \nbrothers, one a President and another an Attorney General. I had the \nopportunity to work with them on those responsibilities in that regard. \nThen, to have a brother who served in the Senate was a golden time for \nme during that period of time.\n  I have been enormously proud of the work my nephew, Congressman \nKennedy, serving in the House of Representatives, and now Patrick, my \nson, who serves in the House of Representatives and is a leading voice \nin terms of the mental health issues for our country--I am so proud of \nall his good work.\n  We grew up in a family that believed in public service, that elective \noffice can make a difference but also understood that other people make \nextraordinary differences in advancing the cause of fairness and \ndecency in the Nation. I think of the work of my sisters in that \nundertaking, all of whom have been involved--whether Special Olympics \nor Very Special Arts or other programs in which they have all been \ninvolved.\n  We still believe in the importance of public service and the honor, \nthe high honor that one has in elective office. There are many of those \nwho dismiss that concept as an old-fashioned viewpoint, but I think any \nof us who have read the history of this Nation and who understood its \nhistory know there is no higher personal honor than to have that \nopportunity.\n  Finally, I welcomed the opportunity to come back to serve as a \nSenator\n\n[[Page S11042]]\n\nfrom Massachusetts, to try to be a voice of what I call the march for \nprogress in this country. Thomas Jefferson used to say every 25 years a \nnation redefines itself. He talked about the continuing expansion of \nthe real cause of liberty in this Nation--not in ways that so \nfrequently are overused and overstate that word but in its core, \nprincipal meaning.\n  As I mentioned, this Nation is a country that is a continuing \nprocess. That is why each day that I wake up, I think of a new \nopportunity to try to have some constructive impact. People will agree, \nand some will differ, on the directions. Sure, programs change--and \nthat is understandable--but basic, fundamental values about what this \nNation is all about and what so many of us who have the great honor of \nservice in this body understand is that America is a continuing \ndiscovery and a continuing promise and a continuing opportunity for \neach and every one of us to make some contribution.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his comments. I remember that \ndebate very well. It was a rather basic and fundamental issue about one \nperson one vote. The question at that time was, is that going to be \ncontinued or whether there was going to be such flexibility that we \nwere going to continue the gerrymandering of different districts. \nSenator Baker, with the very strong assistance of Senator Alexander, \nreminded this body and helped maintain and insist about what the \nSupreme Court had said about that issue. I thank him for his comments \nand also for his continued work in the areas of education and so many \nother areas.\n  I have been fortunate to have a number of my colleagues here from \nMassachusetts, a number of members of the delegation.\n  There were some former colleagues here as well. Senator Riegle was \nhere, and Senator Culver. I was reminded actually over the August \nrecess that I had cast the 15,000th vote. I was talking with Senator \nCulver, and we were reminiscing. He was here when I cast my first vote, \nwhich goes back over a very long, considerable period of time. I am \ngrateful for his presence as well as my other colleagues, Bill \nDelahunt, Jim McGovern. We saw many of those who were here earlier from \nour Massachusetts delegation. I thank them very much.\n  People ask me how long I will continue to serve in the Senate. I give \nthe same response, that is, I am going to stay here until I get the \nhang of it.\n  I look forward to that. I would never get the hang of it if I did not \nhave the wonderful love, affection, and warmth my wife Vicky, the joy \nof my life, gives to me every single day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11042-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11042-S11044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, during August, as many Members of this \nbody did, I traveled to Iraq, met with Tennesseans there, met with \nGeneral Petraeus, General Odierno. Then I traveled to Tennessee and \ndiscussed my visit and listened.\n  I want to talk for a few minutes about where I believe we should go \nfrom here in Iraq. The strongest message I received, both in Iraq and \nin Tennessee, was this--not that we get out, not that we even win a \nvictory of the kind we won in Japan or Germany, but it is time for the \nUnited States Government to speak with one voice on Iraq.\n  A retired four star general from Tennessee, who has a lot of \nexperience with the special forces, put it this way to me: He said our \nbiggest problem in Iraq is we are divided and the enemy knows it.\n  It is inexcusable that we in the Senate should spend so much time \nlecturing political leaders in Baghdad for their failure to come up \nwith a consensus when we ourselves have not been able to come up with a \nconsensus about Iraq.\n  It is time for the Government to speak with a single voice about \nwhere we go from here in Iraq. Our troops deserve it and our enemy \nneeds to hear it. I believe that one voice would be a new strategy to \nchange our mission in Iraq from combat to supporting, equipping, and \ntraining the Iraqi troops, and then stabilizing Iraq province by \nprovince, neighborhood by neighborhood, tribe by tribe.\n  If we adopt this new strategy as a nation, and if we speak clearly to \nour troops and to the enemy with one voice, I believe this would likely \nbring home half our troops within a year or two.\n  Such a new strategy would put us on a path to finish responsibly what \nwe have undertaken in Iraq. I believe there is a consensus within this \nbody for such a new strategy. I believe that consensus is sitting there \nstaring us in the face.\n  The strategy I am describing would implement the unanimous \nrecommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group chaired by former \nSecretary of State Jim Baker, a Republican, and former Congressman Lee \nHamilton, a Democrat. It would take into account the lessons and \nsuccesses of the last few months under the leadership of General \nPetraeus in Iraq.\n  Basically the new strategy I am describing would implement the \nrecommendations of Baker-Hamilton province by province. The Baker-\nHamilton strategy, the one I am describing, would be grounded upon \nthree basic principles. First, the United States will begin immediately \nto move our forces in Iraq out of direct combat and into roles of \nsupport, training, and providing equipment as security conditions on \nthe ground permit.\n  This will proceed province by province as Iraqis demonstrate their \ncapacity to manage their own security as they have, for example, in \nAnbar Province where President Bush visited yesterday.\n  Generals Petraeus and Odierno told a group of us Senators about 10 \ndays ago that they believe that 6 or 7 provinces are on the way to \nbeing ready for this sort of mission change and this sort of \nstabilization. We have seen it in Anbar. We saw it in northern Baghdad \nwhere we flew by helicopter to an edge of Baghdad where about 70 \nAmerican troops were living in a neighborhood. We had dinner with two \nSunni sheiks, two Shiite sheiks, and we talked about the progress \nthere.\n  What had happened is that the Iraqis had simply become exhausted with \nterrorists of various kinds killing their relatives and terrorizing \ntheir neighborhoods. One of the sheiks with whom we had dinner had seen \nhis teenage son murdered in his front yard.\n  When sufficient American forces, coalition forces, had come to the \nneighborhood to work with the fed-up Iraqis, they had proceeded \nbasically to run the terrorists out of town. It was much easier for \nthem to tell, as they said, who are bad guys than for us to tell who \nthey are. They described them as various groups of thugs, criminals, \ninsurgents, militias, all there for no good. But when the Iraqis began \nto man the checkpoints and when Iraqis worked on the neighborhood \nwatch, and when 600 of their sons were sent to Baghdad to the police \nacademy, as had been done with the prospect that they would then come \nback and help, then the American officers there said: It may not be \nlong before we are able to shift our mission from combat to \nsupport, equipping, and training of the Iraqi troops for this area.\n\n  Now, that is not to say that means instantly in every part of Iraq \nthings will be safe. They certainly were not while we were there. Two \nprovince governors were assassinated within a 2-week period of time \njust before we came. Fourteen Americans lost their lives in a \nhelicopter crash 2 days before we were there. On the day we were there, \nwe found out later, two suicide bombers had gone to the nearest other \noutpost such as the one we visited and killed 4 people and wounded 11 \nothers.\n  There is plenty of danger left in Iraq. But there is no mistaking the \nfact that when we begin to see--and under Petraeus's leadership we \nbegin to have--those outposts around Baghdad, and work with the Iraqis \nin certain parts of the country, significant military progress is being \nmade.\n  So the first principle of a new strategy would be to change the \nmission of\n\n[[Page S11043]]\n\nour troops province by province. The second principle would be to \nmaintain a long-term presence in Iraq but one that would steadily \ndiminish over time.\n  The troops who would remain would be there to keep Iraq from turning \ninto a terrorist haven--troops who would be embedded with training \nIraqi Army units and police, those troops necessary for force \nprotection and for search and rescue and for intelligence.\n  The final principle would be we would step up regional and diplomatic \nefforts to press others in the region to help Iraq succeed. Those \nefforts are now well underway with a more expansive United Nations \nassistance mission for Iraq.\n  There is plenty of evidence that a new strategy such as the one I \nhave described can attract a consensus here in the Senate and in the \nCongress, and I believe in the country. To begin with, while he has not \nadopted the Baker-Hamilton recommendation, the President has praised \nthe report and has adopted parts of the report. The Democratic \nleadership has adopted many parts of the report and, in fact, the main \ndifference, it seems, separating that side and this side in coming to a \nconsensus is whether there should be a specific deadline, which the \nBaker-Hamilton commission rejects.\n  Some have said, well, that means the Baker-Hamilton recommendations \nare toothless, do not have effect. Well, I see the Senator from West \nVirginia here. He will remember exactly what I am about to say. My \ngrandfather was a railway engineer for the Santa Fe Railway. His job \nwas to drive large locomotives onto what was then called a roundtable. \nThe roundtable's job was to turn that huge locomotive around and head \ndown a different track in a different direction. Once the roundtable \nhad turned the locomotive around and put it on a different track, there \nwas no getting on the other track. You might not know exactly how fast \nit would go down the new track, and you might have different engineers, \nbut it was headed down a different track. I believe the Baker-Hamilton \nrecommendations, as updated by General Petraeus's experiences, would \nbegin to put our country on a new track with a new strategy in Iraq \nthat would cause us responsibly to finish our job there and could begin \nto develop a consensus on both sides of the aisle.\n  In the Congress there is now bipartisan legislation that would make \nthe Iraq Study Group recommendations our national policy. In the \nSenate, the legislation sponsored by the Senator from Colorado, Senator \nSalazar, a Democrat, and myself, has 15 sponsors, 8 Democrats and 7 \nRepublicans. In the House of Representatives, the Udall-Wolf \nlegislation, the same legislation as Salazar-Alexander, has 60 \nsponsors, 26 Democrats, and 34 Republicans.\n  If the President of the United States and the Democratic leadership \nin the Senate supported this bipartisan legislation, I am convinced it \nwould get 75 votes and we would speak with one voice on Iraq to our \ntroops and to our enemy. If the President and the Democratic leadership \nsimply did not oppose this legislation, I believe it would attract a \nmajority of votes in the Senate, maybe 60 votes. The Congress could \nenact this legislation by the end of the month. The President could \nsign it immediately. He could then begin to implement its \nrecommendations moving us in a new strategy down a different track in \nIraq and report to us, as the legislation requires, every 90 days.\n  This is not a perfect option. The Baker-Hamilton group is 10 \ndistinguished Americans--including Ed Meese, President Reagan's \nAttorney General; Vernon Jordan, from the National Urban League; Larry \nEagleburger, Sandra Day O'Connor, President Clinton's Secretary of \nDefense, President Clinton's former chief of staff, Secretary Baker, \nChairman Hamilton; Chuck Robb, a former Member of this body; Alan \nSimpson, a former Member of this body--a very diverse group, five \nDemocrats, five Republicans. They met for 9 months. They were unanimous \non their 79 recommendations. That did not mean they agreed with every \nsingle recommendation. But, taken as a whole, they said we can go from \nhere to there in Iraq. This is how we do it. This is how we go.\n\n  What are the other options? I can understand the Democratic leader \nwanting to have a vote on withdrawal immediately with a deadline. Many \nMembers, maybe every Member on the other side, would vote for that. I \nrespect that. But I would respectfully say we are not going to have a \nconsensus on that approach. Too many of us believe it would strand \npeople who had been loyal in Iraq. Too many of us believe it would not \nsufficiently honor the lives and the treasure we have invested in Iraq. \nToo many of us believe there is too great a risk of turning over Iraq \nto terrorists. And if none of those arguments make a difference, it is \nsimply logistically impossible to move 160,000 American soldiers and \nmarines and airmen out of Iraq overnight. So for all those reasons, \nwhile we might have a vote on withdrawal immediately with a deadline, \nthere can't be the kind of consensus that we need in the Senate.\n  On the other hand, I can understand those, many on this side, who say \nwe should stay the course for a victory in Iraq. But this is not Japan \nor Germany. After World War II, we had millions of troops in Japan and \nGermany for a long time. We had an entire division in Germany which did \nnothing but wait to see where their might be trouble and then go to \nsnuff it out. We were working with two countries which were homogeneous \nand which had been nations for a long time. We didn't have there the \nsame circumstances we have in Iraq. There is not the possibility of the \nsame kind of victory in Iraq that we had in Japan and Germany. We are \nspending $2 billion plus a week. We are losing two to three American \nlives each day. Our armed services are stretched thin. Most of the \nsoldiers I talked with--and they are not complaining--were there for \ntheir second or third tour of duty, and some were expecting to come \nback again.\n  Finally, I don't believe we can sustain a stay-the-course policy in \nIraq because there is not the support for that among the American \npeople.\n  I suppose there is another option that one could try. The President \nand some on the ground in Iraq might be tempted to simply say: Let's \ncontinue the surge for a while longer because already in some places, \nas I have described--in Anbar Province, in four or five others, in \nnorthern Baghdad where we were--already in some places there is \ndemonstration that we are having some military success. But a surge \nwould be open-ended, a surge by itself. A surge is a tactic; it is not \na strategy. We need a strategy about where we go from here.\n  When I go back to Tennessee, I don't have Tennesseans rushing up to \nme to tell me what to do about Iraq. They expect me to have some idea \nabout what to do about Iraq, to say where we go from here, and then \nthey will critique that and tell me whether they agree.\n  I believe there is not sufficient public support for the President \nsimply to go before the American people and say: Let's continue the \nsurge. We know if we put 25,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 of our \ntremendous American troops in a particular place in Iraq, there will be \nsome good results. We have already seen it. But a surge by itself does \nnot answer the question. In fact, it never has answered the question: \nWhere do we go from here in Iraq? How do we finish the job responsibly? \nThat is the question.\n  The surge can be a part of the new strategy. The Baker-Hamilton \nrecommendations in December specifically said that as they called for a \nnew strategy that included change of mission. But a surge was a tactic, \na part of the strategy, not the strategy itself.\n  If none of those options are promising for a consensus within this \nbody and in the House of Representatives and the country, then where \ndoes that leave us? It leaves us somewhere in the middle, which is \noften, in a democracy, the right place to be. My father used to say: \nFinish what you start. We need to finish the job in Iraq.\n  George Reedy, Lyndon Johnson's Press Secretary, wrote a book, \n``Twilight of the Presidents,'' in which he described the job of the \nPresident--see an urgent need, develop the right strategy, but, third, \npersuade at least half the people he is right. We can and no doubt will \nhave votes in this body on withdrawal with a deadline. We will probably \nhave votes on stay the course and victory. We will probably have a vote \non indefinite continuation of the surge. But there is not a possibility \nof consensus on any of these approaches.\n  There is a good prospect for consensus on a strategy based upon the\n\n[[Page S11044]]\n\nBaker-Hamilton principles, updated by the lessons and successes of \nGeneral Petraeus. If the 10 members of the Iraq Study Group, the Baker-\nHamilton group, over 9 months could agree unanimously on where we go \nfrom here in Iraq, surely 50 or 60 or 70 of us can agree on where we go \nfrom here in Iraq.\n  I look forward to the President's report. I look forward to General \nPetraeus's recommendations. He has demonstrated that he is an \nexceptional leader. We Tennesseans have a special pride in him because \nof his leadership of the 101st Airborne Division. But once \nGeneral Petraeus has made those recommendations, I hope the President \ntakes a page from a former President of this country whom President \nBush admires, Harry Truman.\n\n  In 1947, Harry Truman found himself in about the same shape President \nBush finds himself today. Americans were tired of war, even though in \nthat case we had won it. The President's poll numbers were very low. \nThe President had lost both Houses of Congress in the preceding \nelection. The President had an urgent overseas mission that he hoped \nour country would adopt. According to David McCullough, the biographer \nof President Truman, Truman said if he sent a plan with his name on it \nup there to the Senate and the House, it would quiver a couple of times \nand die. So he called in General George C. Marshall who was his \nSecretary of State, and he called in Dean Acheson. He said: Let's call \nit the Marshall plan and go up to Arthur Vandenberg, the leader of the \nopposition in the Senate, and try to persuade him it is the right thing \nto do.\n  We got the Marshall plan, and Truman today is remembered as a near \ngreat President. I am certain that President Bush believes as firmly in \nhis heart that finishing the job in Iraq is as essential today as \nPresident Truman believed the Marshall plan was essential in 1947. But \nPresident Bush, I hope, will also remember the lesson of Harry Truman \nand borrow the recommendations and the prestige of the Baker-Hamilton \ngroup and borrow the lessons and successes of a distinguished general--\nin this case General Petraeus--and give us a plan that is a genuinely \nnew strategy, one that can attract significant support on that side of \nthe aisle as well as this, one that, like my grandfather's big round \ntable with the locomotive, can take our country and put it on a \ndifferent track in Iraq that will assure us of that and that will cause \nus to change our mission for our troops from combat to supporting, \nequipping, and training, province by province, as soon as we honorably \ncan.\n  If it does, as I said earlier, I believe we will see about half our \ntroops come home within a year or two. The principles also include a \nlong-term but steadily diminishing presence in Iraq to fight \ncounterterrorism and a stepped-up effort for diplomatic and political \nefforts especially in the region. But if the President were to do this, \nand if the Democratic leadership would make room for consensus in this \nbody, we could end this spectacle of the U.S. Congress lecturing \nBaghdad for being in a political stalemate when we are in one \nourselves. We can speak with a single voice. We are elected to be able \nto do so. Our troops deserve it. The enemy needs to hear it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Five Presidents have relied on his steady \n     judgment, wise counsel, and candid advice. With Senator \n     Warner's retirement, the Senate will lose one of its most \n     independent and widely-respected voices and the Commonwealth \n     of Virginia will lose one of its fiercest advocates.\n       John Warner has served our country in many roles throughout \n     his distinguished career, always putting the American \n     people's needs first. He enlisted in the Navy shortly before \n     his 18th birthday and chose to interrupt his law studies to \n     commence a second tour of active military duty as an officer \n     in the Marine Corps, volunteering for duty in Korea. He went \n     on to practice law, serve as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, and \n     serve as Secretary of the Navy before his election to the \n     Senate. Our Military had no greater friend than Senator \n     Warner during his service as Chairman of the Senate Committee \n     on Armed Forces.\n       I look forward to working with Senator Warner in the coming \n     months as we assess the situation in Iraq and pursue policies \n     to keep our country safe.\n       John Warner is a true statesman. Laura and I wish Senator \n     Warner, his wife Jeanne, and the rest of his family all the \n     best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11044-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11044-S11045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Honoring Corporal Willard M. Powell\n\n  Mr. Bayh. Mr. President, today, with a heavy heart, I honor the life \nof the brave Army corporal from Evansville, IN. Willard M. Powell, 21 \nyears old, died on August 16, 2007, in Balad, Iraq, from injuries \nsustained during combat operations in Taramiyah, Iraq. With an \noptimistic future before him, Will risked everything to fight for the \nvalues Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the \nworld.\n  Will's ambition was to become a marine, and he joined the Army at the \nage of 19 after graduating from Reitz High School. He passionately felt \nthe call to duty as he left for basic training, looking forward to his \nlong-anticipated career in the military. Will was deployed to Iraq \nApril 2007, where he worked diligently in his infantry unit, awaiting \nhis promotion to corporal. It was during his assignment to the 4th \nBattalion, 9th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry \nDivision Strykers from Fort Lewis, WA, that he was killed while serving \nhis country.\n  Today, I join Will's family and friends in mourning his death. Will \nwas a loving son to his mother and stepfather, Sunny-Kay and Mark \nPowell, and to his father and stepmother, Willard and Linda Kerchief. \nHe will be greatly missed by his grandparents, Barbara Poodry, Gloria, \nand Tim Thibodeau, Larry and Patti Powell, and Raymond Kerchief and his \ngreat-grandmother Marcetis ``Cedi'' Milton.\n  In Evansville, Will was an active member of the First Christian \nChurch, where he attended Bible study classes with friends and fellow \nchurch-goers. Will bonded with the other members of the church's youth \ngroup and built important friendships. He was passionate about sports \nand a skilled athlete himself, qualifying for the Junior Olympics in \nbowling. Those who knew him best say he taught them the meaning of true \nfriendship and possessed an extraordinary pride in his service to our \ncountry.\n  Today and always, Will will be remembered by family members, friends, \nand fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice \nhe made while dutifully serving his country. While we struggle to bear \nour sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example he \nset, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his \ncourage and strength of character that people will remember when they \nthink of Will, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing \ndays of conflict and grief.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Will's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we\n\n[[Page S11045]]\n\ncannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who \nstruggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \ndetract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, \nbut it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement is just as \ntrue today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain that the \nimpact of Will's actions will live on far longer that any record of \nthese words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Willard M. Powell in the \nofficial record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat Will's family can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah \nwho said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will \nwipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11045-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TRAGEDY IN GREECE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

I urge the administration to \ncontinue to demonstrate our commitment to our Greek allies in the wake \nof these horrific events.

Mr. President, as President Bush arrives in Sydney \nto take part in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC, leaders \nmeeting, it is appropriate to take stock of America's role in the Asia-\nPacific region.\n  America's future prosperity and security is directly tied to Asia. \nThe region contains the world's fastest growing major economies, \nlargest militaries, largest energy consumers and importers, and biggest \ncontributors to global climate change. Some of the most critical items \non our international agenda--such as ending North Korea's nuclear \nweapons program, developing ties to moderate Muslim states, building a \nsound global economy, achieving energy security, combating climate \nchange, and responding to pandemic disease--are impossible to achieve \nwithout robust U.S. partnerships and sustained engagement in Asia.\n  But despite the region's obvious importance, we have lost ground over \nthe past seven years. The war in Iraq that should never have been \nauthorized or waged has been an enormous distraction from the fight \nagainst al-Qaida, which has reconstituted itself in Afghanistan and \nPakistan. In addition to the enormous costs in lives and resources, the \nwar has also set back our standing and leadership in the world, and \nmade it far more difficult for America to lead on critical issues. In \nAsia, a region that both wants and expects United States' leadership, \nthis inattention has led to a decline in U.S. prestige and influence \nand has placed our national security interests in jeopardy.\n  While America has been increasingly absent in Asia, China has \npromoted itself as an alternative to U.S. leadership. And with \nfundamental shifts in Asia's security and economy underway--a rising \nChina, emerging India, a Japan seeking to become a more ``normal'' and \nassertive nation, and North Korea and South Korea presenting dangers \nand opportunities the United States cannot afford to stay on the \nsidelines.\n  U.S. engagement is vital to maintaining the balance, and therefore \npeace, among potentially competing powers. In particular, the rise of \nChina requires a clear-sighted view of our interests. A policy that \nseeks cooperation with China on security, economic, energy and \nenvironmental issues, maintains our military strength in the western \nPacific, and strengthens our ability to compete must be a foundation of \nany successful policy.\n  While APEC may be primarily an economic forum, it also offers the \nopportunity to engage all the region's leaders in a single setting--and \nto further our agenda across the range of key challenges. Too often, \nthe U.S. has missed this opportunity.\n  North Korea's nuclear ambitions already have had a profound impact on \nthe region, and we must work to achieve a complete and verifiable \nelimination of all the DPRK's nuclear weapons capabilities and \nprograms. I welcome the recent statement that North Korea will declare \nand disable its nuclear programs by the end of the year. For far too \nlong, the administration's disdain for diplomacy allowed the threat \nfrom North Korea to grow. While clearly the best time to negotiate with \nNorth Korea would have been before it tested a nuclear weapon, we must \nnow verify North Korean compliance with their commitments. This will \ndemand principled, aggressive, direct and sustained American diplomacy \nand leadership in the region.\n  To build support against terrorists and prevail in the long-term \nbattle against violent extremism, the U.S. must work closely with Asia, \nand Southeast Asia in particular, to develop effective strategies that \nboth prevent acts of terrorism and root out al-Qaida elements. In \naddition to cooperative military, intelligence, and law enforcement \nefforts, this will require recognition that our relationships in the \nregion are more complex and multidimensional than a narrow approach to \ncounterterrorism. We should use the opportunity of the APEC forum to \nexplore new initiatives to increase political, diplomatic, economic, \neducational, and cultural engagement.\n  In terms of our shared prosperity, nowhere is America's sustained \nleadership more important in ensuring that the global economy remains \nvibrant. Together the economies of the APEC region account for over \nhalf the world's output and trade. It is essential that Asian countries \nwork with us to ensure balanced growth and openness of the global \ntrading system. This means shifting away from their traditional \ndependence on export-led growth and weak currencies toward stronger \nconsumption at home and greater absorption of imports. The United \nStates should negotiate only ``gold standard'' agreements with our \nAsian trading partners that stimulate growth and jobs and contain \nbinding labor and environmental standards and intellectual property \nprotections.\n  With the nations of East Asia working together through ASEAN, the \nASEAN Regional Forum, APEC, the East Asia Summit and other regional \narrangements, Asia is moving ahead--with or without us--to create a new \nregional architecture. Our interests demand that we re-engage to ensure \ntrans-Pacific linkages are relevant and strong. That means developing \nnew arrangements to meet new and rising challenges and transnational \nthreats that stem from globalization--especially in the areas of \npandemic disease, climate change, and energy security. The latest \npandemic, an unidentified, highly contagious virus affecting pigs, is \nsweeping Asia. We must ensure that China and other affected countries \ncooperate in research and containing this and future outbreaks of \ndisease. We should use the opportunity of APEC to further the dialogue \nabout the growing problem of pandemics.\n  On climate change and energy, the U.S. and Asia face many of the same\n\n[[Page S11046]]\n\nchallenges, and we ought to capitalize on those areas where our \ninterests intersect. We have a mutual interest, for instance, in \nassuring adequate oil supplies, preventing disruptions in oil and gas \nexporting states and in the sea lanes, promoting greater efficiency, \ndeveloping and expanding clean sources of energy, coordinating build-up \nand release of strategic stockpiles to prevent price spikes during \nsupply emergencies, and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. The \ntime is ripe for U.S. leadership on a serious and comprehensive energy \nand climate initiative in Asia that would ramp-up the development and \ndeployment of efficiency-related technologies, establish an adequate \nresearch and development fund for carbon sequestration and related \ntechnologies, increase opportunities for U.S. businesses to capture a \nshare of the region's burgeoning clean energy market, and create a \nforum to address supply security-related concerns.\n  We will not be able to fight global climate change effectively unless \nthe United States is able to lead the world toward a post-Kyoto \nProtocol framework that includes binding limits on the large projected \ngrowth in greenhouse gas emissions from China, India, and other Asian \ncountries. The Bush administration's prolonged refusal to confront the \nchallenges of climate change at home has robbed the United States of \nits ability to lead effectively in such efforts abroad. We should use \nthe opportunity of APEC to discuss a new, comprehensive energy \ninitiative in Asia to address the twin challenges of energy security \nand climate change.\n  The U.S. also should work with its Asian partners to strengthen \ndemocracy. Nowhere is the need for building consensus more pressing \nthan in Burma. Peaceful pro-democracy activists continue to put their \nlives on the line for freedom, and democratic nations should stand in \nsolidarity with them. U.S. leadership is vital to any regional effort \nto press the military junta to achieve national reconciliation.\n  The U.S. must resume an active leadership role in Asia. We cannot sit \non the sidelines. We have too much at stake in Asia, in terms of our \nprosperity, security, energy, and health. If we are to protect and \nadvance these interests, America must be a reliable and engaged \npartner. It is good that President Bush is traveling to Sydney for \nAPEC, and I know we all wish him success at this important summit. But \nthe time has long since passed to pursue a new path that reflects the \nimportance of Asia to our national interests and enables the United \nStates to play a greater and appropriate leadership role in the region. \nWe cannot afford any more missed opportunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11046-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             TRIBUTE TO COBB ENERGY PERFORMING ARTS CENTRE\n\n Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, I speak today to congratulate \nthe Bridgeport Public School System, which for the second year in a row \nhas been selected as a finalist for the Broad Prize for Urban \nEducation. The $1 million Broad Prize, the largest education prize \ngiven to school districts, is awarded each year to honor urban school \ndistricts that demonstrate the greatest overall performance and \nimprovement in student achievement while reducing achievement gaps for \npoor and minority students.\n  That Bridgeport has been nominated for this award 2 years in a row \nspeaks volumes about the progress Bridgeport has made educating its \nstudents. The city's schools serve the highest percentage of low-income \nstudents in Connecticut, with 95 percent of its students eligible for \neither free or reduced-price school lunches. Yet in 2006, Bridgeport \nstudents outperformed their peers in demographically similar districts \nin the State in reading and math at all grade levels. In fact, \nBridgeport is the only one of those school districts to improve in \nreading and math at all grade levels from 2003 to 2006. This \nimprovement was seen across all subgroups of students, including low-\nincome, African-American and Hispanic students.\n  The city has also done a remarkable job in closing the achievement \ngap between White and minority students. Bridgeport has reduced \nachievement gaps between Hispanic students and their White peers in \nhigh school reading and math, as well as in elementary school reading, \nand the district has reduced achievement gaps for African-American \nstudents in high school math. In addition, Bridgeport has closed the \nHispanic achievement gap faster than the State average in elementary \nand high school reading and high school math. This is no small feat, \nconsidering that almost 90 percent of the district's students are \nracial minorities.\n  The Broad Foundation has praised the district's willingness to take a \nhard look at the data it collects on student performance, and using it \nto identify where it is succeeding and where it needs to improve. In \nfact, Bridgeport uses this data to put together quarterly assessments \nthat are tightly aligned to State standards. Data from these \nassessments is available in real time, allowing for immediate \ndiagnostics and subsequent adjustments. Given the proliferation of \ndata, administrators and teachers have become more comfortable using it \nand district administrators have reported that school principals have \nbeen using the data to determine their schools' needs and plans. \nTeachers have also reported that they too analyze the data when meeting \ntogether in teams to determine their strengths and weaknesses.\n  This results-based approach, where the main focus is on student \nperformance, has so far been a rousing success. I would like to \ncongratulate Superintendent John J. Ramos, Sr., and all the teachers, \nprincipals, administrators, and other school personnel of the \nBridgeport public schools not just for the nomination, but for all the \nhard work they have done to provide a better education to their \nstudents.

Mr. President, today I honor Maurice ``Moe'' Dube \nwhom I had the privilege to on August 14 welcome home to Maine and \nofficially swear in as Maine's district director of the U.S. Small \nBusiness Administration, SBA. I was incredibly honored to be able to \ncelebrate Moe's appointment with him and his family in Lewiston-Auburn, \nwhere both of our roots run so deep.\n  Moe's return to Maine is wonderful news for the numerous small \nbusinesses and manufacturers in our state who depend on the SBA and the \nvaluable programs it administers. In my capacity as the ranking member \nof the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have \nhad the\n\n[[Page S11047]]\n\nprivilege of working with Moe during his previous service with the SBA \nand know that his experience, expertise, and dedication will be a true \nasset for Maine's robust small business community.\n  Because our State so depends on small businesses and entrepreneurship \nfor our economic livelihood, I have long believed that the district \ndirector position is one of Maine's most critical appointments. Indeed, \naccording to the SBA, in 2005, Maine had an estimated 151,000 small \nbusinesses of which over 111,000 were led by self-employed \nentrepreneurs. Of the 40,000 Maine firms with employees, an \noverwhelming 97.5 percent were small businesses employing fewer than \n500 employees. Clearly, Maine small businesses are the job creators and \ndrivers of our economy, so it is critical to have a district director \nwho will help our state make the most of the SBA's vital programs.\n  In his new capacity as district director, Moe will, among other \nthings, be responsible for the administration of the SBA business loan \nportfolio; the oversight of the Maine Small Business Development Center \nNetwork; the coordination of Maine's SCORE chapters; and oversight of \nthe Women's Business Center at Coastal Enterprises, Inc.\n  Although Moe will clearly have a lot on his plate as he takes the \nreins as district director, I am confident that his long experience at \nthe SBA, which he joined in 1987, makes him eminently qualified. Moe \nbegan his SBA career as a liquidation loan officer in the SBA's Maine \ndistrict office before moving to the business development division, \nwhere he was promoted to assistant district director for business \ndevelopment and later to deputy district director. His most recent \nassignment prior to relocating to Maine was as district director of the \nSBA's Massachusett district office.\n  When Moe was with the Maine SBA, I and my staff had the pleasure of \nworking hand-in-glove with him on a variety of issues on behalf of our \nState's small businesses. I can tell you firsthand that his \ncomprehensive background, keen acumen, and tireless dedication will be \noutstanding assets for Maine's small business community. And perhaps \nmost importantly, in an ideal ``one-two punch'' for our small \nbusinesses, Moe not only knows how to deliver SBA programs as \neffectively as possible--but Moe also knows Maine. I look forward to \ncontinuing to collaborate with Moe as he advances the SBA's agenda.\n  I know Moe will make a fine district director, and I am so pleased \nthat a man of his talents has accepted this position, which is so vital \nto Maine's economy. I look forward to working with him closely to \nensure that Maine small businesses will continue to thrive and create \nopportunities for all Mainers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11047-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11047-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, treaties, and withdrawals which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11047-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of January 4, 2007, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on August 4, 2007, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \nthe Speaker had signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2272.

A bill. to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to \nprovide for national energy efficiency standards for general service \nincandescent lamps, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will transform the lighting market in the U.S.\n  Beginning in 2012 and continuing through 2014, the current 40, 60, \n75, and 100 watt incandescent bulbs will be phased out and replaced by \nlower wattage bulbs that produce the equivalent amount of light. For \nexample, bulbs that currently consume 100 watts of electricity would be \njust as bright but would consume only 72 watts of electricity.\n  By 2014, the traditional incandescent light bulbs found in \napproximately 4 billion U.S. light sockets will be virtually obsolete. \nTheir 125 year old technology will be replaced by new technologies such \nas LEDS, light emitting diodes, halogen incandescent bulbs, improved \ncompact fluorescent lamps and higher efficiency incandescent bulbs.\n  When fully implemented, the new efficiency standards for incandescent \nlighting will save 65 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year. \nThis is the equivalent of shutting down 24 new 500 mw coal plants a \nyear and would save consumers almost $6 billion a year in electricity \ncosts. The light bulb standards will save nearly as much energy as of \nthe Federal appliance standards from 1987 to 2000. Energy savings from \nthis one standard are two to three times larger than savings from any \nother single appliance standard. Unlike the energy savings from longer-\nlived appliances which are replaced on a 10 to 15 year cycle, the full \nsavings from efficient light bulbs will roll in much sooner, about 1 to \n3 years after enactment.\n  My legislation requires the Secretary of Energy to conduct two \nadditional rulemakings to consider imposing more stringent efficiency \nstandards for lighting. The secretary is required to consider a \nstandard of 45 lumens per watt in the first rulemaking and to adopt \nthat standard or an alternative standard that results in equivalent or \ngreater energy savings. If the Secretary fails adopt a standard with \nthe equivalent savings or fails to complete the first rulemaking on \ntime, a 45 lumens per watt standard will become effective in 2020.\n  The legislation also includes detailed provisions aimed at preventing \nunscrupulous manufacturers from finding ways to avoid the efficiency \nregulations.\n  The bill seeks to help consumers make their lighting purchasing \ndecisions based on lifecycle cost, lamp lifetime and lighting quality \nby improving the labeling requirements for light bulbs. In addition, \nthe Secretary of Energy, in cooperation with EPA, Commerce, and the FTC \nis required to provide an annual assessment of the market for general \nservice lamps and compact fluorescents. The Secretary is also required \nto work with the lighting industry, utilities and other parties to \ncarry out a national consumer awareness program to help consumers make \nenergy efficient lighting choices.\n  Many of the provisions in my bill were hammered out in negotiations \nbetween major lighting manufacturers and efficiency advocates. In fact, \nPhilips Lighting was the initiator of the negotiations on phasing out \ninefficient incandescent lamps, and Osram Sylvania and General Electric \nwere actively engaged in the process. Many efficiency advocates \nparticipated in the negotiations including the Alliance to Save Energy, \nACEEE, and NRDC. The negotiators made a great deal of progress but were \nunfortunately unable to reach consensus on all of the issues involved \nbefore the energy bill was considered by the Senate.\n  My bill sets forth a reasonable process that will save a significant \namount of energy and also allow manufacturers to plan for and implement \nmajor changes in an orderly way. The House energy bill includes a \nsimilar lighting provision authored by Representatives Harman and \nUpton.\n  I intend to hold a hearing on this legislation next week. I hope that \nwhat we learn at the hearing will facilitate reaching a consensus on \nefficient lighting standards during the House-Senate conference H.R. 6, \nthe energy bill. We must take action to assure that the potential \nenergy savings from these standards become a reality.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2017\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Freedom of Information Act was signed into law on \n     July 4, 1966, because the American people believe that--\n       (A) our constitutional democracy, our system of self-\n     government, and our commitment to popular sovereignty depends \n     upon the consent of the governed;\n       (B) such consent is not meaningful unless it is informed \n     consent; and\n       (C) as Justice Black noted in his concurring opinion in \n     Barr v. Matteo (360 U.S. 564 (1959)), ``The effective \n     functioning of a free government like ours depends largely on \n     the force of an informed public opinion. This calls for the \n     widest possible understanding of the quality of government \n     service rendered by all elective or appointed public \n     officials or employees.'';\n       (2) the American people firmly believe that our system of \n     government must itself be governed by a presumption of \n     openness;\n       (3) the Freedom of Information Act establishes a ``strong \n     presumption in favor of disclosure'' as noted by the United \n     States Supreme Court in United States Department of State v. \n     Ray (502 U.S. 164 (1991)), a presumption that applies to all \n     agencies governed by that Act;\n       (4) ``disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of \n     the Act,'' as noted by the United States Supreme Court in \n     Department of Air Force v. Rose (425 U.S. 352 (1976));\n       (5) in practice, the Freedom of Information Act has not \n     always lived up to the ideals of that Act; and\n       (6) Congress should regularly review section 552 of title \n     5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of \n     Information Act), in order to determine whether further \n     changes and improvements are necessary to ensure that the \n     Government remains open and accessible to the American people \n     and is always based not upon the ``need to know'' but upon \n     the fundamental ``right to know''.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF FEE STATUS FOR NEWS MEDIA.\n\n       Section 552(a)(4)(A)(ii) of title 5, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``The term `a representative of the news media' means any \n     person or entity that gathers information of potential \n     interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial \n     skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and \n     distributes that work to an audience. The term `news' means \n     information that is about current events or that would be of \n     current interest to the public. Examples of news-media \n     entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the \n     public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if \n     such entities qualify as disseminators of `news') who make \n     their products available for purchase by or subscription by \n     or free distribution to the general public. These examples \n     are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery \n     evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic \n     dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications \n     services), such alternative media shall be considered to be \n     news-media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded \n     as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can \n     demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through \n     that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually \n     employed by the entity. A publication contract would present \n     a solid basis for such an expectation; the Government may \n     also consider the past publication record of the requester in \n     making such a determination.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 305\n\n       Whereas the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued \n     a final Medicare National Coverage Determination on the Use \n     of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents in Cancer and Related \n     Neoplastic Conditions (CAG-000383N) on July 30, 2007;\n       Whereas 52 United States Senators and 235 Members of the \n     House of Representatives, representing bipartisan majorities \n     in both chambers, have written to the Centers for Medicare & \n     Medicaid Services expressing significant concerns with the \n     proposed National Coverage Determination on the Use of \n     Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents in Cancer and Related \n     Neoplastic Conditions, issued on May 14, 2007, regarding the \n     use of erythropoiesis stimulating agent therapy for Medicare \n     cancer patients;\n       Whereas, although some improvements have been incorporated \n     into such final National Coverage Determination, the policy \n     continues to raise significant concerns among physicians and \n     patients about the potential impact on the treatment of \n     cancer patients in the United States;\n       Whereas the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the \n     national organization representing physicians who treat \n     patients with cancer, is specifically concerned about a \n     provision in such final National Coverage Determination that \n     restricts coverage whenever a patient's hemoglobin goes above \n     10 g/dL;\n       Whereas the American Society of Clinical Oncology has \n     written to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to \n     note that such a ``restriction is inconsistent with both the \n     FDA-approved labeling and national guidelines'', to express \n     deep concerns about such final National Coverage \n     Determination, and to urge that the Centers for Medicare & \n     Medicaid Services reconsider such restriction;\n       Whereas such restriction could increase blood transfusions \n     and severely compromise the high quality of cancer care \n     delivered by physicians in United States; and\n       Whereas the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has \n     noted that the agency did not address the impact on the blood \n     supply in such final National Coverage Determination and has \n     specifically stated, ``[t]he concern about the adequacy of \n     the nation's blood supply is not a relevant factor for \n     consideration in this national coverage determination'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services should \n     begin an immediate reconsideration of the final National \n     Coverage Determination on the Use of Erythropoiesis \n     Stimulating Agents in Cancer and Related Neoplastic \n     Conditions (CAG-000383N);\n       (2) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services should \n     consult with members of the clinical oncology community to \n     determine\n\n[[Page S11081]]\n\n     appropriate revisions to such final National Coverage \n     Determination; and\n       (3) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services should \n     implement appropriate revisions to such final National \n     Coverage Determination as soon as feasible and provide a \n     briefing to Congress in advance of announcing such changes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/04/senate-section/article/S11081-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NOS. 110-5 AND 110-6\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask \nunanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the \nfollowing treaties transmitted to the Senate on September 4, 2007, by \nthe President of the United States: 1996 Protocol to Convention on \nPrevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes, Treaty Document \nNo. 110-5; and Amendment to Convention on Physical Protection of \nNuclear Material, Treaty Document No. 110-6.\n  I further ask consent that the treaties be considered as having been \nread the first time, that they be referred, with accompanying papers, \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed, and \nthat the President's messages be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, with a view to receiving advice and consent, the \n1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution \nby Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (the ``London Convention''), done \nin London on November 7, 1996. The Protocol was signed by the United \nStates on March 31, 1998, and it entered into force on March 24, 2006.\n  The Protocol represents the culmination of a thorough and intensive \neffort to update and improve the London Convention. The London \nConvention governs the ocean dumping and incineration at sea of wastes \nand other matter and was a significant early step in international \nprotection of the marine environment from pollution caused by these \nactivities.\n  Although the Protocol and the London Convention share many features, \nthe Protocol is designed to protect the marine environment more \neffectively. The Protocol moves from a structure of listing substances \nthat may not be dumped to a ``reverse list'' approach, which prohibits \nocean dumping of all wastes or other matter, except for a few specified \nwastes. This approach is combined with detailed criteria for \nenvironmental assessment of those materials that may be considered for \ndumping and potential dumping sites.\n  The Protocol would be implemented through amendments to the Marine \nProtection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA), which currently \ncovers London Convention obligations. There will not be any substantive \nchanges to existing practices in the United States, and no economic \nimpact is expected from implementation of the Protocol. I recommend \nthat the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Protocol \nand give its advice and consent to ratification, with the declaration \nand understanding contained in Articles 3 and 10 respectively in the \naccompanying report of the Department of State.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, September 4, 2007.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the \nAmendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear \nMaterial (the ``Amendment''). A conference of States Parties to the \nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, adopted on \nOctober 28, 1979, adopted the Amendment on July 8, 2005, at the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. I transmit also, for the \ninformation of the Senate, the Department of State report on the \nAmendment. Legislation necessary to implement the Amendment will be \nsubmitted to the Congress separately.\n  The Amendment contains specific provisions to effect a coordinated \ninternational response to combating and preventing nuclear terrorism \nand ensuring global security. It will require each State Party to the \nAmendment to establish, implement, and maintain an appropriate physical \nprotection regime applicable to nuclear material and nuclear facilities \nused for peaceful purposes. The aims of the regime are to protect such \nmaterial against theft or other unlawful taking, to locate and rapidly \nrecover missing or stolen material, to protect such material and \nfacilities against sabotage, and to mitigate or minimize the \nradiological consequences of sabotage. The Amendment also provides a \nframework for cooperation among States Parties directed at preventing \nnuclear terrorism and ensuring punishment of offenders; contains \nprovisions for protecting sensitive physical protection information; \nand adds new criminal offenses that each State Party must make \npunishable by law. States Parties must also either submit for \nprosecution or extradite any person within their jurisdictions alleged \nto have committed one of the offenses defined in the Convention, as \namended.\n  This Amendment is important in the campaign against international \nnuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation. I recommend, therefore, \nthat the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this \nAmendment, subject to the understandings described in the accompanying \nreport of the Department of State.\n                                                      George W.
