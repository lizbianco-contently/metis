Mr. President, following the remarks of the leaders, if \nthere are any, we will be in a period of morning business, with \nSenators allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  I ask that on the Democratic side--we are going to try to do this on \na rotating basis--on the Democratic side Senator Harkin and Senator \nSchumer be the first speakers.\n  Negotiations on the agreement to vote in relation to the stimulus \nlegislation is ongoing. If we have a vote on that legislation, it will \nbe at 11 or 11:30 a.m. today. That will be the only vote today. We hope \nto reach agreement so we can have that vote, as I indicated.\n  We also should tell everyone we are working very hard to do something \non the bailout of our financial institutions. We know we have an \nobligation to do that. A lot of Senators have a lot of questions about \nwhere we are in this situation.\n  We were at the White House last night. Our meeting was reconvened on \nthe second floor of the Capitol last night, and Secretary Paulson was \nhere, Senator Dodd, Senator Gregg, Chairman Frank, and Chairman Baucus. \nThey worked into the nighttime and finished at 10:30, 11 o'clock last \nnight. They are going to reconvene this morning.\n  Right now, out of 100 percent of the Congress--we have the Democrats \nin the Senate, Republicans in the Senate, Democrats in the House, \nRepublicans in the House--we only have three of those Members trying to \nwork something out. The House has basically walked away from \neverything. We were doing pretty well until the meeting at the White \nHouse yesterday.\n  We are going to continue to work hard. We understand the urgency of \naddressing this situation. We will have more to say about this issue \nlater. We are doing our very best.\n\n[[Page S9560]]\n\n  I hope the two Presidential candidates will go to the debate tonight \nand leave us alone to get our work done here. It would be a great aid \nto what we are trying to do.\n  We are going to come in about 9:30 Saturday morning. We are going to \nvote an hour after that time on the CR. There is other business we can \ndo tomorrow. We will try.\n  It is quite evident we will be in session next week. We have a lot of \nbusiness to do that has not been done. I will mention a couple. We have \nthe DOD authorization, which is very important, rail safety, Amtrak. Of \ncourse, I have already talked about the financial crisis legislation. \nWe have the Indian nuclear agreement. I have had a number of \nconversations with Secretary Rice and President Bush on this issue. We \nhave another bunch of bills a Republican Senator has held up, and we \nprobably will have to file cloture on those before we leave.\n  There are a number of moving parts. We are going to try to put them \ntogether. We are going to do our very best to keep Senators advised as \nto what is going to happen chronologically. As everyone who serves in \nthe Senate knows, we cannot be specific at any given time. We will do \nour best so people have an idea of what the weekend holds and what next \nweek holds.\n  Next week, as I indicated before, is a little bit more complicated \nbecause we have a Jewish holiday starting at sundown on Monday, ending \nsundown on Tuesday. So we will not be working that period of time, that \nis for sure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9560-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, of course, we live in very perilous \ntimes. Our economy, particularly our debt markets and our credit \nmarkets, is in very serious shape. To paraphrase Chairman Bernanke, the \narteries of the patient--our financial system--are clogged and the \npatient will have a heart attack. We don't know if it will be tomorrow \nor 6 months from now or a year from now but, unfortunately, if we don't \nunclog those arteries, a heart attack will occur. So we must act.\n  I know there are some--particularly some very ideological people on \nthe hard right--who say do nothing and let everyone learn their lesson; \nthere are a lot of people, particularly at the high end of the economic \nspectrum, who should learn their lesson. But there are millions of \ninnocent people who will be hurt if we do nothing: the auto worker who \nwill be laid off because we sell fewer cars; the small businesswoman \nwho has struggled to build her business over 15 or 20 years and can't \nget a loan; the waitress at a restaurant of a chain that has to shut \ndown because it can't get credit. Average people get hurt when our \nfinancial arteries are clogged, even though they are blameless. That is \nthe difficulty of our world. It is not fair, it is not right, but it is \nhow it is.\n  We must come together and work in a bipartisan way to unclog those \narteries, and we must do it soon. We should not leave here until we \nhave a plan, whether it takes a day, several days, 1 week, or even \nmore. We cannot abandon our responsibilities, and we should work. I \nbelieve we will stay here and work until a plan is agreed upon and we \nsee some light at the end of this rapidly darkening tunnel. That is the \nfirst point I wanted to make.\n  Second, we need to pass a good plan. The President's initial offering \nwas received with, let's say, lack of popularity, to put it kindly, by \nboth Democrats and Republicans in this Chamber and people out in \nAmerica. It is because it was a $700 billion blank check. There was no \nhelp for taxpayers' protection so they got paid back first. There was \nno help for homeowners.\n  Chairman Bernanke tells us that housing is the root cause of the \nproblem and if we don't find a floor to the housing markets, we may \nneed bailout after bailout, unfortunately. This bill had no protection \nfor homeowners.\n  I know Secretary Paulson said the Government owns a large share of \nthe bonds, that they will have more ability to renegotiate mortgages \nand avoid foreclosures but, frankly, that is hope over reality because \nthe bonds are now broken up in 40 tranches. If the Government owns 10, \n15, 20, 25, or even 30 of them, if 1 tranche holder objects to \nrefinancing, it won't happen.\n  We need help for homeowners beyond what is in the legislation. We \nneed oversight, tough oversight. This is a democracy. We are known for \nour checks and balances. It has served America well for over 200 years. \nAnd all of a sudden, in an unprecedented taking of power, to give so \nmuch power to the Treasury Secretary with no one looking over his \nshoulder would be, frankly, not the American way. So we need tough and \nstrong oversight.\n  Point 1, we will work until we get this done, even if it means \nstaying past recess. We must. We have an obligation.\n  Point 2, we will pass a better plan than the President's plan. We \nwill work with the President, but we need protection for homeowners, \ntaxpayers, and oversight.\n  The third point I wish to make is this: This cannot pass without \nstrong bipartisan support. There will be some in both parties who will \nnot vote for any plan. So neither party has a majority, neither the \nDemocrats--we are a majority by a small margin--nor the Republicans, \nwho are close to a majority. But we will need strong bipartisan support \nas many on each side of the aisle will not vote for a plan, and that is \ntheir prerogative.\n  We need the President to get the Republican house in order. Even if \nwe were to want to pass a bill with just Democratic votes, we could \nnot. It is obvious. Look at the math. We need to have this bipartisan \nsupport.\n  We began it yesterday under Chairman Dodd and Chairman Frank's \nleadership when we met in this building and crafted a very good \ncompromise that was a basis to take to Secretary Paulson. It did far \nmore for taxpayers, for homeowners, for oversight than the existing \nbill.\n  Unfortunately, however, we needed a four-legged stool, and one leg \njust vanished--the House Republicans--in a way that none of us still \nunderstand. In addition, Senator McCain's desire, even though he had \nnot been involved in this legislation at all, to fly in put another fly \nin the ointment and created more trouble. I have not heard Senator \nMcCain offer one constructive remark. We don't know what he supports. \nDoes he support the House plan? Does he support the President's plan? \nDoes he have his own plan? By all reports, he hardly spoke at the \nmeeting, which was his opportunity to try and do something. He spoke at \nthe end and didn't say what his views were as to whether he supported \neach plan.\n\n  So we need two things on the Republican side: We need President Bush \nto take leadership. We need President Bush, first and foremost, to get \nthe Republican House Members to support his plan or modify it in some \nway to bring them on board yet keep the Democratic House Members, the \nRepublican Members of the Senate, and the Democratic Members of the \nSenate on board. Second, we need the President to respectfully tell \nSenator McCain to get out of town. He is not helping. He is harming.\n  When you inject Presidential politics into some of the most difficult \nnegotiations, under normal circumstances, it is fraught with \ndifficulty. Before McCain made his announcement, we were making great \nprogress. Now, after his announcement, we are behind the eight ball and \nwe have to put things back together again.\n  So this is a plea to President Bush, for the sake of America: Please \nget your party in line. Get the House Republicans to be more \nconstructive. Get Senator McCain to leave town and not feed the flames \nand maybe we can get something done. In fact, not maybe, we have no \nchoice but to get something done.\n  So, again, to reiterate my three points: No. 1, we will work until we \nhave a product. The perilous state of\n\n[[Page S9561]]\n\nour financial markets and our national economy, the danger to average \nAmericans, now unforeseen but real and lurking behind the shadows, says \nwe can do nothing else. No. 2, we will continue to work for a better \nplan than the one the President proposed, with protection for \ntaxpayers, homeowners, and real oversight. No. 3, the President must \nget his Republican House in order by getting the House Republicans in \nline and asking Senator McCain, respectfully, to leave town. Because \nwithout Republican cooperation, we cannot pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I know there is an order for Senator \nHarkin to speak next and I saw him in the cloakroom and told him I \nwould speak for a moment until he is prepared to come to the floor. So \nI ask unanimous consent to speak next in order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for his \ncomments. Of course, being from the State of New York, he feels \nintensely and personally what is happening with many of these economic \ndecisions on Wall Street. This involves not only the savings of \nmillions of Americans but the jobs and careers of many people who are \nworking hard in the financial sector.\n  I am sorry we have reached this point, and I am also sorry that of \nall the things being proposed so far there are two glaring omissions. I \nunderstand time is a constraint on our activities, but we have to come \nto grips with the fundamental issue that is at stake. What we have done \non Wall Street over the years is create a shadow credit industry with \nno oversight and little regulation. As a result, this has been an \nanything-goes-capitalism on Wall Street, which, sadly, has led to the \ndemise of major investment banks and brokerage houses. It isn't just \ntheir misfortune, it is the misfortune of their employees and \ninvestors, savers and retirees who counted on them for their future.\n  Well, the idea that we would step aside and let the magic of \ncapitalism work its will has shown us we should have thought more about \nthis. It wasn't that many years ago on the Senate Floor that I was \ndebating Senator Phil Gramm of Texas. He was high priest of this theory \nof fundamentalism--free-market fundamentalism. He would argue we needed \nto get Government out of the way; that all Government can do is get in \nthe way by creating red tape and slowing things down and diminish \nprofit taking and wealth creation. Well, he carried the day for a long \nperiod of time. He had this Svengali influence on many Senators, \nincluding the Republican nominee for President, John McCain.\n  Look what we have reaped from this. We have now an economic crisis--\nto quote the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve--that has been generated by this market philosophy. So at the \nend of the day, we need to put in place sensible regulation so the \ntaxpayers are protected and the people who count on these investment \nhouses can have some assurance their money will be returned. That is \nthe bottom line, and we will not have time to do that before the end of \nthis year. It will take time to do it carefully. It must be part of it.\n  The second point I will make is this--and I see Senator Harkin has \ncome to the floor: There is a great deal of empathy and concern for \nthose on Wall Street whose businesses are facing failure. I have some \nconcern too. But I have more concern for the homeowners across America \nwho are losing literally thousands of homes to foreclosure because of \nthe tricks and traps which these same entities put in their mortgage \ninstruments.\n  I think of people I have met in Chicago--retirees living on Social \nSecurity lured into these rotten mortgage arrangements, about to lose \ntheir homes because of someone who brought them into a room and had \nthem sign a stack of papers with a reset that took the home away when \nthe monthly costs went beyond their Social Security check. That is an \noutrage. How many tears have been shed on the floor of the Senate or in \nWashington for these people? None.\n  What we hear from this administration is it is their misfortune; they \nmade bad decisions. We have to honor the sanctity of the contract. \nSanctity is a word that, in my religion, connotes holiness--a sacred \nquality. What in the world is holy or sacred about these subprime \nmortgages, which were brokered for the purpose of making a fast buck \nand getting out of town, leaving victims behind who are about to see \ntheir homes foreclosed. I would like to see at least a modicum of \nsympathy for some of the people facing foreclosure. But when we bring \nthis up in the negotiations over this bailout plan, we are told \nabsolutely, no. We can do nothing for the homeowners at the end of the \nday.\n  Well, I will tell you, it isn't just a matter of sympathy or a matter \nof taking a moral position, it is good economics. If we don't stem the \ntide of foreclosures among homeowners at the base of our economy, then \nthese mortgage instruments will continue to decline in value and there \nwill be further instability in the credit markets. It is not just a \nmatter of doing the right thing, it is the proper thing economically to \nget us back on track. But I can't sell that. You know why. Because the \nbanks and the mortgage lenders, the same people who authored this mess, \noppose it.\n  The sanctity of the contract. Well, I wish to tell you something: If \nwe were dealing with the sanctity of the contract, we wouldn't be \ntalking about bailout, we wouldn't be talking about $700 billion from \nhard-working taxpayers in Iowa or Illinois coming to the rescue of a \nlot of people who have been reaping multimillion dollar annual bonuses \nfrom the mess they have created on Wall Street. The sanctity of a \ncontract. Give me a break.\n  Let's have some respect for the people across America--the families \nwho are the strength of this Nation; those middle-income and hard-\nworking Americans who get up and go to work every day and struggle with \nthis economy and who may have been lured into a bad mortgage and now \nface the greatest economic catastrophe of their lives. How much help \nwill they get from this bailout? Exactly nothing. Nothing. There is \nnothing on the table to help them. That, to me, is unconscionable and \nunacceptable.\n  I think we should have a balanced approach. Yes, take this economic \ncrisis seriously at the top, but don't forget that at the bottom of the \npyramid are the hard-working families of America that have been \nexploited by these people on Wall Street and deserve a break as part of \nour conversation.\n  The final point I will make is I am glad John McCain is back on the \nPresidential trail. His visit to Washington didn't help a bit. It hurt. \nIt riled up and roiled up all the political forces in this town because \nhe summoned the Presidential campaign to Capitol Hill. That didn't help \none bit. He needs to get back running for President. He needs to show \nup in Mississippi tonight for this critical Presidential debate. We \nneed to roll up our sleeves, on a bipartisan basis, and find a good \nsolution to this crisis we face.\n  I yield the floor\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank Senator Durbin for \nwhat he said because I have come to the floor to talk about that bottom \nof the pyramid; to talk about a vote we will be having in another hour \nand a half or so on a stimulus package that goes directly to the kind \nof people Senator Durbin is talking about, the people at the bottom. \nThey are unemployed. They need help--they need food stamps, they need \nunemployment benefits extended, and they need infrastructure jobs to \nrebuild our economy. Yet we are not talking about that.\n  So I wish to thank Senator Durbin so much for pointing that out \nbecause I wish to talk about that for awhile.\n  Before I do that, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks \nSenator Grassley be recognized to speak for up to 30 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9561-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9561-S9564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ECONOMIC RECOVERY PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, following on what Senator Durbin was\n\n[[Page S9562]]\n\ntalking about, all the news, of course, all the time, is about this \nbailout for the financial institutions. They are talking about $700 \nbillion, but actually it is about $1 trillion. When you take in AIG and \nyou take in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, you are into a trillion \ndollars. But what about the honest, hard-working, play-by-the-rules \ncitizens at the bottom of this pyramid who are left in the ruins? They \nare left in the ruins after years of mismanagement and outright \nmalpractice by the titans of the financial industry.\n  So I wish to talk about the economic recovery package, the Reid-Byrd \neconomic recovery package that I think we will be voting on very \nshortly--otherwise called the stimulus package. It meets the urgent \nneeds of working families all across America, with a special emphasis \non those hardest hit by the economic downturn. There is no question \nthat we need this stimulus package.\n  The first stimulus package we had, that was White House driven, and \nit was to send checks out to almost everybody. So we sent the checks \nout. Well, I have to admit I voted for it, but I kind of wish now I \nhadn't. But I voted for it, and a lot of those checks went out, and who \nknows what happened to that money. Some of it may have been saved; OK. \nSome of it may have been spent to reduce credit card debt; OK. Some of \nit may have been used to buy a new flat-screen TV made in China, or \nother kinds of things. So you don't know if it was a stimulus or not. \nWhat we need now is to do a real stimulus--something that actually will \neffectively stimulate the economy and which has been proven \neconomically that, for every dollar you put in, you will get more than \na dollar back in economic activity.\n  The unemployment rate has been rising for 8 straight months. Home \nprices, as we know, continue to plummet. Millions of Americans face the \nprospect of foreclosure and losing their homes. Prices have risen \nsharply for staples such as food, gasoline, electricity, and home \nheating oil. So we urgently need this second stimulus measure. Winter \nis coming on, and people are hurting. Instead of just sending out \nchecks, this bill targets it to those who have been suffered the most. \nIt injects money into infrastructure projects to create jobs directly \nand to generate new economic activities.\n  The bottom line is we need a package that actually provides the \nmaximum stimulus for each dollar spent. We know what works. We have the \ndata. We have history.\n  We get the biggest bang for the buck, stimulus-wise, No. 1, by \nexpanding food stamp benefits. That is the best. The second best way is \nby extending unemployment benefits. Third, immediately pumping money \ninto infrastructure projects will employ people and create jobs.\n  Let me discuss a few of the things that come under the jurisdiction \nof my Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and \nRelated Agencies. The package extends unemployment insurance for 7 \nweeks in all and 13 weeks in high unemployment areas. It temporarily \nincreases food stamp benefits by 10 percent and includes an additional \n$450 million for the Women, Infants and Children's Program that goes to \nthe lowest income people in America to get our kids started right in \nlife. It provides $60 million for senior meals programs. It also \nprovides $500 million for the weatherization program.\n  Now, this is in addition to some of the money we have in the \ncontinuing resolution for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram. Now, get this, in the continuing resolution we have $5.1 \nbillion for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program to low income \nand elderly, and $250 million for weatherization. Well, when you give \n$5.1 billion to low-income elderly for energy assistance, guess where \nthat money goes. It goes up the chimney. Of course, people do need it. \nBut we should be putting more emphasis on weatherization so they do not \nhave to spend so much money on heating their homes year after year. We \nknow that works, too. It provides jobs and it will help our seniors and \nour low-income folks cut down on their energy bills this winter and \nnext year. That is why in stimulus we put in $500 million for \nweatherization programs.\n\n  For every dollar spent on food stamps, according to Moody's \nEconomy.com, we create $1.73 in new economic activity. That is the most \nof any of these.\n  When food stamp recipients spend every penny of benefits they \nreceive--they spend every penny on food which is produced, packaged, \ntransported, and sold here in America, so that money has a multiplier \neffect here in our own economy and it also frees up more money for them \nto spend on housing, transportation, daycare--other things that \nstimulate the broader economy. That is why food stamps have such a \ngreat multiplier effect.\n  The second, as I said, comes from extending unemployment benefits. At \none level this is about fairness and compassion. Unemployed individuals \ndesperately need the additional income. But on a second level, it also \nhas a tremendous multiplier effect for the economy. Again, according to \nMoody's, for every dollar we spend on increasing unemployment benefits, \nwe add $1.64 in new economic activity.\n  Talking about the increase in energy prices for those with a low \nincome, energy prices have increased by more than 22 percent this year, \ncoming on the heels of a 17-percent increase in 2007. There is no \nquestion that Americans, especially those of modest incomes, low \nincomes, and the elderly, need assistance in paying their energy bills. \nThey also need assistance in weatherizing their homes. A lot of low-\nincome people live in housing that is poorly insulated and that needs \nto be weatherized. It will save them money. It will increase the value \nof their home, if they own it. This stimulus will provide that \nassistance. But it helps the whole economy and the environment as well.\n  We also create hundreds of thousands of new jobs by investing in \ninfrastructure projects, including $10.8 billion for building and \nrepairing highways, bridges, mass transport, airports, Amtrak, schools. \nIt includes $2 billion for school renovation and repairs, $500 million \nfor Corps of Engineer projects such as flood control and environmental \nrestoration.\n  Let me tell you about the experience we have had in Iowa. In the last \n10 years, we have been able to get about $127 million into Iowa for \nrebuilding and modernizing our schools--about $127 million. This has \nprovided jobs, it has provided for new schools, schools that are better \nequipped for our students, but the figures come back and show us that \n$127 million has translated into over $1 billion of construction. What \na great multiplier effect that has. We know schools need to be \nrenovated all over America. That is in this stimulus package we are \ngoing to vote on here very shortly; money to rebuild and modernize our \nschools all over this country.\n  We have $2 billion for that. Think about the multiplier effect. If \nthat is about the same, that $2 billion could translate to somewhere, I \nwould say, conservatively speaking, between $10 billion and $20 billion \nin construction in this country to rebuild and modernize our schools.\n  Next, the package looks out for rural America, where I happen to \nlive. It includes $792 million in grants and loans for the construction \nof community facilities, everything from hospitals to city buildings in \nsmall towns of less than 20,000. It will provide over $500 million in \nloans and grants for rural water and wastewater improvements. We have a \nhuge backlog of needed projects that are ready to go, but no money to \npay for it. It is critical to the health and well-being of people who \nlive in rural America.\n  This bill also provides up to $3.4 billion in loans and loan \nguarantees for single-family homes in rural areas.\n  There is a huge backlog of infrastructure projects. Many of them are \nalready on the books ready to go. Again, a lot of what I am talking \nabout will probably be funded and built sometime in the future. We are \nnot going to continue to let our schools deteriorate into nothing. So \nwhy not do it now, when unemployment is going up; when people on the \nbottom are hurting because of increased energy prices, fuel prices, \nfood prices; when a lot of their housing values are going down? Isn't \nthis the time to get the jobs that are needed in America?\n  There is another item in this bill and that goes to the safety and \nsecurity of Americans. This stimulus also provides\n\n[[Page S9563]]\n\n$490 million for the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants to make up for the \ndevastating cuts that were made last year as a result of President \nBush's vetoes and veto threats. I have been leading the effort to \nrestore this funding. It is absolutely critical for law enforcement, \nand especially for Iowa law enforcement. In 2007, in Iowa alone, the \nByrne Grant-supported task forces seized illegal drugs valued at more \nthan $31 million and netted more than 2,000 criminal convictions. They \nresponded to over 260 clandestine labs. Mr. President, 85 percent of \nIowa's drug cases originated from these task forces.\n  It is not only on the enforcement side but it is on the \nrehabilitation side that these grants were used. Over 560 drug \noffenders received treatment in Iowa to get them off it and get them \nstarted back on the right path again. Again, Iowa law enforcement \nagencies are struggling to maintain crucial law programs in the wake of \nlast year's cuts. This funding in the stimulus would allow them to pick \nup and redouble their efforts against crime and drugs.\n  The two last things I want to mention are the area of biomedical \nresearch, public health, and job training. In the stimulus package, \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health is included--$1.2 \nbillion. Why did we put that in there? Because the funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health has declined in real terms by over 10 \npercent in the last 5 years. What has happened is we are losing \ncutting-edge biomedical research, we are losing a generation of \ntalented scientists who can pursue treatments and cures. This $1.2 \nbillion in the stimulus for NIH will be sufficient to fund \napproximately 3,300 new research grants in the areas such as cancer, \ndiabetes, Alzheimer's, and heart disease.\n  Senator Arlen Specter and I worked very hard, along with others here, \nto double the funding of NIH between 1998 and 2003. We did it. We got \nit up and we got it up so it would be on the level where it was 20 \nyears ago. Since 2001, as I have said, we have fallen down 10 percent \nin real terms. It is shameful what we are doing to the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  This package also provides $905 million for public health to enhance \nour Nation's preparedness against bioterrorism and to improve our \npreparedness in the event of an influenza pandemic. This package \nincludes $300 million for employment and training activities for \ndislocated workers. It will help more than 79,000 people receive \nservices including job search, career counseling, and training. As \nSenator Durbin said, these are people on the bottom of the pyramid. You \ncan give all that money you want to Wall Street, it isn't going to help \nthese people. What helps these people is job search, career counseling, \nand job retraining to give them the skills they need to work.\n  The bill includes $300 million for youth employment and training \nprograms. Right now the unemployment rate for teenagers has reached \nhistoric highs this year--historic, the jobless rate. It is now one of \nthe worst employment environments for teenagers since World War II. \nMore than 80,000 teenagers would receive services under the stimulus \npackage.\n  We have all been reading about how the economy is at a dangerous \ninflection point. The financial and credit crisis, falling house \nprices, foreclosures, rising unemployment, rising prices for food and \nenergy--all of these things kind of hitting at the same time, \nthreatening to plunge our economy into a deep recession. Certainly we \ndo have to act to shore up our financial system. But we have to do some \nother things in the broader economy.\n\n  We need to extend a helping hand to those Americans hardest hit by \nthis broken economy, a generous helping hand. Boy, are we going to \nextend a generous helping hand to Wall Street. From everything I am \nreading, it looks as though the Congress is about to do that. But the \npurpose of the Reid-Byrd economic recovery package is to also extend a \nhelping hand to those at the bottom. It addresses the urgent needs of \nworking Americans. It is well crafted to deliver maximum economic \nstimulus to the economy.\n  We are going to be voting on this, I guess. By an agreement, it takes \n60 votes. It will probably get over 50 votes, but I am told, because of \nthe opposition of the Republican side, we will not get 60 votes. What a \nshame. I hope I am wrong. I hope what I have heard and what I have read \nis wrong. I hope, when we have this vote on the stimulus, Senators will \ncome here and say: Look, if we are going to be called on to bail out \nWall Street and the financial services and we are not even going to put \na limit on how much income they can make, we can't help these people \nwho are at the bottom of that pyramid?\n  If that happens, that we do bail out Wall Street and the financial \nservices industry and we don't take care of people at the bottom, the \ngap between the rich and the poor will get wider and wider in our \ncountry, the cynicism of people toward their Government will grow, and \nit will be well-founded cynicism--that somehow we are here only to help \nthose at the top, that only if we put more into the top it will trickle \ndown--the same old trickledown economics I have been fighting against \nall my public life. It is the same theory, that you give it at the top \nand it trickles down.\n  Later on we are going to be discussing more about the bailout. But I \ncouldn't help but read the paper this morning about the so-called \nbailout. I thought this was interesting. It said the critics of this \nso-called bailout package can be roughly divided into two camps. One \ngroup thinks money should go directly infused to banks, which would \nthen allow it to trickle down to borrowers. A second group thinks the \nGovernment should buy individual mortgages, help ordinary Americans \nmore directly, and let the benefits trickle up to the banks.\n  I favor methods that directly help average Americans. We know from \npast experience going clear back to the New Deal that when you put \nmoney in at the bottom, you get the biggest bang for the buck and it \ndoes trickle up, it helps our own economy. That is why food stamps have \nthe biggest multiplier effect, because you are getting the people at \nthe bottom. But you put in things up at the top and it trickles down, \nby the time everybody takes their cut, it never quite gets down to help \npeople at the bottom.\n  The plan that is out floating around--\n\n       ``The plan is a trickle-down approach from banks to Main \n     Street,'' said Alan S. Blinder, a professor at Princeton \n     University. ``But if you reduce the flood of foreclosures and \n     defaults''--which he would have the government do by buying \n     loans directly, then renegotiating the terms--``it will make \n     mortgage-backed securities worth more.''\n       That might help ordinary Americans, but it would be \n     difficult to administrate.\n\n  Difficult to administer? I don't think so. It might be a little more \ndifficult than giving a bushel basket of money to Wall Street--yes, \nthat is easy. But because something is a little more difficult, should \nthat be an argument why we should not do it?\n  The article goes on:\n\n       ``There is a kind of suggestion in the Paulson proposal \n     that if only we provide enough money to financial markets, \n     this problem will disappear,'' said Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel \n     prize winning economist.\n       But that does nothing to address the fundamental problem of \n     bleeding foreclosures and the holes in the balance sheets of \n     banks.\n\n  Now, again, everything is being rushed here. Everything is being \nrushed on the bailout. ``We have got to do it now. Now. Now. We have \ngot to do it yesterday.''\n  Ten days ago this was not as big a problem. Quite frankly, Mr. \nPaulson--with Mr. Bernanke, but Mr. Paulson came out and said the sky \nis falling, thus sort of putting out there a self-fulfilling prophecy. \nIn fact, I would go so far as to say the credit crunch we see happening \nin America today, the drying up of credit, is happening in part because \nof Mr. Paulson's statements, scaring everybody that the sky is falling. \nYet it was Mr. Paulson who has been there for 2 years and 3 months and \nhas been saying that ``things are fine.''\n  As late as May of this year, Secretary Paulson said--I do not have \nthe exact quote in front of me, but basically: The credit crunch, the \nworst is behind us. Well, I have to ask, was he wrong for 2 years and \nright now or right for 2 years and wrong now? Nevertheless, his posture \nof last week of raising the stakes, scaring everyone, has put everyone \nin a kind of panic mode. As I said, 10 days ago, 2 weeks ago, no one \nwas in a panic mode; credit was flowing. Things were a little tight,\n\n[[Page S9564]]\n\nbut it was flowing. But once he pushed the stakes out, all of those \npoker chips out there, and said the Government has to come in right \nnow, put in $700 billion with no strings attached, all of a sudden \npeople said: Well, I am going to slow down. I am going to kind of hold \nmy money back. I am not going to be buying some of that paper out there \nuntil I see what the Government is going to do.\n  Mr. Paulson, by using his position, has created kind of a panic \nsituation in this country. Now, does that mean we have to respond to \nthat by panicking? I don't think so. You know, when people such as Mr. \nPaulson and others--and I bear him no ill will at all, but when people \nlike that say that things are fine and the worst is behind us, and then \nall of a sudden they tell us the sky is falling, doomsday, Armageddon \nis here, I think that is the time to sort of sit back, take a deep \nbreath, and let us work this thing through. I would proffer that the \nmost important thing we can do is not rush to judgment on this bailout \nbut do it right, do it in a way that will provide for long-term \neconomic benefits in this country, not just some short-term bailout.\n  Again, I would quote Alan Blinder, former member of the Federal \nReserve, distinguished economist:\n\n       I totally disagree that this needs to be done this week. \n     It's more important to get it right.\n\n  I agree with Professor Blinder; it is more important to get it right.\n  Now I see the plan they are talking about--I was told yesterday the \nplan was going to be that they were going to put out like $250 billion \nright away, with another $100 billion he could access if he wanted to; \nand then before he could get the other $300 or $350 billion, they would \ncome to Congress and we would have to then authorize and appropriate \nit.\n  Oh, no. Now what I read is much different from that. We are going to \ngive him $250 billion, another $100 billion they can access without any \nquestions, and then the other $300 or $350 billion they can use without \never coming to Congress to ask for it, but we get 30 days to say they \ncannot use it.\n  Well, you know what that is like. That is never going to happen. That \nis never going to happen. And if Mr. Paulson says they are not going to \nspend the $700 billion right away, they might use $50 billion next \nmonth and then $50 billion the next month--it seems to me what we need \nto do is to let the American people know that the Congress, is not \ngoing to let the economic system go under. So what we do is we might \nput out $200 billion, $250 billion, make sure.\n  We should definitely cap executive pay. If the Congress is going to \nkind of leave it up to the Secretary and leave it up to some board to \ndecide what is fair compensation. And who is going to be on the board? \nWhy, people from the industry. What a sweetheart deal that is going to \nbe.\n  I have to say that if people are coming to the Government and asking \nthe taxpayers of this country to bail them out, that is like being on \nthe Government payroll. And if they are going to be on the Government \npayroll, they ought not be paid any more than what Government employees \nare paid. I would even go as far as to say that they can get paid as \nmuch as the President, but they should not get paid any more than the \nPresident of the United States, period. But that is not what we are \nfacing.\n  Now, if they want to have a package that says: Okay, here is $250 \nbillion, and they maybe can get another $100 billion, it ought to \nsunset in January or February, and the Congress ought to come back and \nsee where we are, see how much more money we need, see if the \ncompensation things have been working right, see if we are getting \nequity in these companies, and then let's have a more deliberate debate \nand consideration of what we might want to do in January or February \nwhen we come back. Well, we raised this with Mr. Paulson the other \nevening, and he was adamant: No, we have to have the $700 billion. We \nhave to have it all now because that will give the confidence to the \nmarket that we have enough money to buy all of this worthless paper. \nWell, what about the Congress giving some assurances to the American \npeople that we are going to be here, we are going to give them some \nmoney, but we want to make sure they do it right, folks. We are going \nto guard the taxpayers' dollars. And yes, we will be back in January; \nyes, we will be back here in February; if we need to do more, we can do \nmore then but in a more deliberative manner than what we are being \nrushed to do now before an election.\n  Lastly, there are a couple of other things I must say about this \nbailout. You know, if a company comes in--let's say they are facing \nbankruptcy and they come into an investment bank to get help. Do you \nthink the bank will just give them money? Oh, you need money? What it \nis you want? We will give it to you. The bank is going to want to see \ntheir books, not just their balance sheet, they want to know how they \ngot in that situation, what kinds of models they used to buy their \nsecurities to get to that point where they are right now, and what \ntheir valuation may be.\n  Well, I suggested to Mr. Paulson that we should do that to every one \nof those investments firms that comes in. If they come in and they are \nputting their bids in to sell their securities, if I understand, in a \nreverse-auction kind of a system, and they want the taxpayers to buy \nthis questionable security or whatever it might be, well, it would seem \nto me that one of the conditions ought to be that they open their \nbooks, that we get to see exactly what it was they used in deciding how \nthey decided how much to pay for that investment. What got them to this \npoint?\n  I have a sneaking suspicion that a lot of them do not want us to know \nthat because, quite frankly--and I will say this very frankly and \nforthrightly--I think there was a lot of accounting fraud going on. I \nam selling to you, you sell to me, I sell to you, and every time, we \ncan make a profit on it. Well, that doesn't really work, folks. But it \nseems to me that a lot of that was going on. But we need to know. Yet I \nsee nothing in this bailout plan that will mandate that we have \nindependent auditors go in and really understand what the government \nwill be getting for its money. What were their internal models, their \nproprietary models that they used in conducting their business? We need \nto know that. Quite frankly, I do not see that in this bailout.\n  Lastly, we have to make sure there is no arbitrage going on where you \nhave people from foreign countries or hedge funds dumping near \nworthless papers into banks later on--later on, in January and February \nand March--and we keep filling the swamp buying near worthless paper. I \ndo not see anything in this bailout plan that will stop that either.\n  So, again, I did not mean to get off too much on the bailout plan. I \nwill have more to say about that later. I wanted to make my point that \nwe are going to be voting on a stimulus package that will go out to \nhelp people on the bottom of the economic pyramid, to help them get \nthrough the winter, to give them jobs, to build schools, to get \ninfrastructure projects going. This is $56 billion. That is compared to \na $1 trillion we are going to be asked to spend on the bailout if you \ninclude what we have already done. About 5 percent of what they are \nasking us to do for Wall Street, we are saying let's do for Main Street \nAmerica. That is the least we can do.\n  There is one thing I also wanted to add. I have heard rumors that \nthey might want to put the bailout plan on the continuing resolution. I \ncan tell you nothing would be worse, nothing could be worse than to try \nto put the bailout on the continuing resolution to keep our Government \ngoing. The continuing resolution provides money that is needed for \ndisaster assistance, for the military, for our veterans. I hope that is \njust a rumor. I hope that does not happen, as an appropriator and as a \nsenior member of the Appropriations Committee. As I said, I still have \nnot made up my mind on the bailout. We will see how it develops. But \nthe one thing is, if there are efforts to put it on the CR, it will \ncause great problems.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9564-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9564-S9567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX POLICY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank my friend from Iowa. On that last point, my \ncolleague from Iowa speaks of something that I would like to emphasize. \nAnd I presume one of the reasons he would\n\n[[Page S9565]]\n\nnot like to see it on the continuing resolution is that it would \njeopardize all of the relief in there for the flood victims we have in \nIowa?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Exactly.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would supplement also--I did not come here to speak \non the same thing Senator Harkin did, but let me supplement something \nSenator Harkin said about suspicions that something could be wrong here \nand we need some sort of investigation.\n  Maybe my colleague from Iowa heard that about 2 or 3 days ago, there \nwas an announcement by the FBI that they were investigating four of \nthese institutions. If the FBI thinks something is wrong, you might not \nbe far off that something is bad and needs to be investigated.\n  I wish to put my remarks this morning in the perspective of what I \nhave been saying since June and July, and then we had the August summer \nbreak, and now in September on two previous occasions. So on maybe four \nor five previous occasions throughout the summer, I have come to the \nfloor to speak about the differences of the tax policies of the two \ncandidates for President. I come for that same purpose today.\n  But I wish to also say that my purpose in coming is twofold--one, so \nthat people will pay more attention to the tax policies of the two \nPresidential candidates and consider those tax policies in light of \nsome of the history I have brought to their attention, the history from \na couple of standpoints: what had been said in previous elections and \nthen what actually happened after those Presidents were sworn in, and \nmaybe it was not exactly as they said it was in the Presidential \nelection. So take that into consideration during this election.\n  The other one is to point out the history of different tax policy, \nwhen we have a President of one party, a Congress of another or when we \nhave a Congress and a President of the same political party. So we take \nthat into consideration when we want to analyze the checks and balances \nof Government working well for good tax policy. Why concentrate on tax \npolicy? Because tax policy is a very important part of overall economic \npolicy. Will we have a tax policy--hence, an economic policy--that \ngrows the economy and creates jobs?\n  What this generation of policymakers ought to be all about is having \nan economic policy--and tax policy being part of it--that will advance \nopportunities for the next generation so we continue down the American \ntrend of each generation succeeding, living better than the generation \nof mom and dad.\n  Starting in the third week of July, I have come to the floor to \ncompare the tax plans of Senator McCain and Senator Obama. They are the \ntwo Presidential candidates. During this series of visits with my \ncolleagues, I have talked about the relationship between party control \nand the likelihood of tax hikes or tax cuts. I use this famous \nthermometer chart. Well, I don't know whether it is famous, but I think \nit is a pretty good indicator of some things I have stated. There is a \nbig difference between tax policy that comes out of a Congress, where \nthe Congress and the President are of the same political party. A \ndifferent tax policy emerges when the House and Senate may be of one \nparty and the President of another. But we can see up there that when \nwe have a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress at the top, we \nhave less tax cuts and, in some instances, tax increases. When we have \na Republican President and a Democratic Congress, we still have tax \nincreases but somewhat less than when there is a Democratic President \nand Democratic Congress. Then, going down to the third from the top, we \nsee a Democratic President, a Republican Congress. There we have tax \ndecreases but not as much as if we go down to the next line, where we \nhave a Republican President, a Republican Senate, and a Democratic \nCongress--more tax decreases but not as much as the next line. There is \na Republican President, a Democratic Senate and a Republican Congress, \nwhere we get more tax cuts.\n  But we really get job-creating tax cuts and economy growth tax cuts \nwhen we have a Republican President and Congress.\n  I would like Members to think in terms of the thermometer, as we look \nat the debate going on in the campaign for the Presidency.\n  Later on in July, I talked about the 1992 campaign promise of a \nmiddle-class tax cut, then the 1993 tax legislation that instead of \nhaving middle-class tax cuts, we had, in the words of Senator Moynihan, \nthen chairman of the Finance Committee, a ``world record'' tax \nincrease. I use this chart, which depicts 16 years of Rip van Winkle, \nto remind people of Rip van Winkle waking up between the 1992 campaign \nfor a middle-class tax cut that was promised before the November 3, \n1993, election and then the tax legislation of 1993, which, in the \nwords of Senator Moynihan, chairman of the committee at that time, \nended up going from a middle-class tax cut promise of the 1992 campaign \nto the largest tax increase in the history of the country. Here we have \nthe history of rhetoric in campaigns and how they might turn out after \na President is sworn in.\n  In our first week back after the summer break, I discussed the \neffects of the proposed 17 percent to 33 percent increases in the top \ntwo tax rates. That is not my policy. That is not my making something \nup. That is basically what one of the candidates, Senator Obama, had \nsaid he is going to do if elected President. Then I also spoke during \nthat speech of those 17-percent to 33-percent increases in the top two \nrates being very negative to the growth of small business activity and \nthen, in the end, the detriment that does to job creation because small \nbusiness creates most new jobs.\n  Then last week I discussed the impact of Senator McCain's and Senator \nObama's tax plans on our senior citizens.\n  Today I would like to focus on the fiscal impact of both tax plans. \nIt is particularly timely, considering the Treasury's recent activity \nand proposal to resolve the problems in our Nation's financial sector. \nNeedless to say, from a fiscal policy standpoint, we are sailing into \nuncharted waters. I am sure everyone realizes there is always a large \ngap between what a Presidential candidate promises and what that \ncandidate is able to deliver, if elected. We still need to carefully \nexamine the plan that both my colleagues are putting forth during this \nelection season. While neither plan is likely to be enacted exactly as \nlaid out in the campaign, we can evaluate how realistic those plans are \nand also gain some insight into the candidate's vision of the Tax Code.\n  For a long time now, I have been saying we should stop calling the \ntax relief enacted in the 2001 and 2003 bills the Bush tax cuts and \ncall it the bipartisan tax relief that it has been. Both bills, \nespecially the 2001 bill, were passed with Democratic support in \nCongress where the Republican majority was narrow. My colleagues of the \nother party enjoy referring to it as the ``Bush'' tax cuts because they \nwould like to put all blame on the President. That is quite easy to do \nwhen a President's popularity isn't so great. But, in fact, that is \nintellectually dishonest because the Bush tax cuts, if they had been \nenacted the way he campaigned and proposed them, would have been \nanother $350 to $400 billion more than what Senator Baucus and I, in a \nbipartisan way, worked out because we thought it was more responsible \nand we could still do the economic good at a lower level of tax breaks. \nIt should be called the bipartisan tax bill that it is and not \ndenigrated with the Bush name on it because it was a lot different than \nwhat President Bush proposed to Congress.\n  In the case of the 2003 tax relief bill, Republicans passed it due to \nVice President Cheney's tie-breaking vote. Maybe we don't want to speak \nto that so much as a bipartisan bill. But the first version of it going \nthrough the Senate, as I recall, was bipartisan. The implication that \nPresident Bush or Republicans were able to impose this legislation by \nthemselves is ridiculous.\n  The 2001 and 2003 bipartisan tax relief bills became law only with \nthe support of Members of both political parties. In confirmation of \nwhat I have been saying, that both bills were bipartisan, in those 2001 \nand 2003 tax relief bills we find that both major campaigns have \nadopted what is essentially the meat and potatoes of both bills.\n  To illustrate how both campaigns have adopted significant parts of \nthe 2001 and 2003 tax relief package, I\n\n[[Page S9566]]\n\npresent this chart. It is taken not from a partisan group but by the \nTax Policy Center. This chart shows, as we can see, the fiscal impact \nof how both plans would change current law. The Tax Policy Center shows \nthat Senator McCain's plan to prevent widespread tax increases would \nlose revenue of $4.2 trillion over 10 years. That is the red bottom \nline. Senator Obama's plan, which would include some widespread tax \nincreases, would also contribute to the deficit. The Tax Policy Center \nsays that number for the Obama plan would be $2.9 trillion. Remember, \nthe Congressional Budget Office looks ahead 10 years, so I am talking \nabout 10-year figures.\n  I have another chart. This chart assumes current law levels of tax \nrelief in effect and then compares Senator McCain's and Senator Obama's \nplans. The Tax Policy Center also produced the data I am using in this \nchart. This chart shows Senator McCain's plan would raise $600 billion \nless than current tax policy. Senator Obama's tax plan would raise $600 \nbillion more than current tax policy.\n  I respect the analysis done by veteran analysts at the Tax Policy \nCenter. They have worked hard to develop a lot of data for \npolicymakers, such as those of us in this Senate, for our use. If, \nhowever, we were processing legislation, it would have to be scored by \nthe nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, not by the Tax Policy \nCenter. So the Tax Policy Center data is helpful, but we must note that \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation will be the decisive scorekeeper of any \nlegislation that either candidate would propose in their budgets after \nthey are sworn in.\n  The Tax Policy Center has acknowledged that both candidates' plans \nlack detail. Necessarily then, the analyses and conclusions reached by \nthe Tax Policy Center are qualified and need to be. There is a key \ncaveat in these totals. Both plans assume revenue-raising offsets that \nlack specificity to be scored. Senator Obama has specified about $100 \nbillion in defined revenue-raising proposals. That is close to the most \naggressive accounting of revenue raisers in the congressional \ninventory. I am going to refer to a snapshot of the revenue raisers the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee has developed. It is in what I have \nreferred to as the revenue-raising well chart. This is a chart that is \nmodified from time to time, but I have been using it in the Senate for \nwell over a year.\n  As this chart shows, roughly $90 billion in revenue-raising offsets \nhave been defined, scored, and approved by the House Ways and Means \nCommittee. That figure is considerably higher than revenue raisers \napproved by the Senate Finance Committee. Some of these offsets will be \nused in legislation we hope to pass shortly. This well chart gives us a \nrough snapshot of what is available. In other words, it is to bring \nsome realism to what is politically accomplishable within the House and \nthe Senate or between the two. This chart gives us that rough snapshot.\n  Let's then give the candidates the benefit of the doubt and round \nthat $90 billion up to $100 billion.\n  Let's also look at the track record of tax-writing committees over \nthe last few years. If you look at that history, you will find the \ncommittee generates about $1 billion per month. That is about--you can \nadd it up--$12 billion per year. So let's gross-up the defined revenue \nraisers, then, to $220 billion.\n  Now, if you take that conservative number of $220 billion, how do the \nplans of the two candidates for President stack up? Senator Obama's tax \nplan contains $920 billion in unspecified, unverified tax increases. If \nwe net that number against the $220 billion--that looks a little more \nrealistic--we find that Senator Obama's plan is short on specified \nrevenue raisers by $700 billion. To be evenhanded, Senator McCain is \ncarrying $365 billion in unspecified revenue raisers. If we net that \nnumber against the known revenue raiser number of $220 billion, we find \nthat Senator McCain's plan is short of revenue raisers by $145 billion. \nSo let's take a step back just for a moment. It means the deficit \nimpact of Senator McCain's plan is understated by about $145 billion. \nIt means the deficit impact of Senator Obama's plan is understated by \n$700 billion. As against the current tax policy baseline, it means the \nplans are not as far apart as they might appear.\n  So let's go back to the current policy baseline. This is the Tax \nPolicy Center's chart I have referred to two times already. It means we \nneed to raise Senator McCain's deficit impact number from $5.3 trillion \nto $5.45 trillion. Likewise, we need to raise Senator Obama's deficit \nimpact number from $3.9 trillion to $4.6 trillion. Keep in mind that \nthe current policy baseline shows a revenue loss of $4.7 trillion. That \nis what the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. \nMcCrery, calls the ``reality baseline.''\n  In recent weeks, Senator Obama has indicated he might revisit the \nmarginal rate increases and increases in tax rates on dividends and \ncapital gains after the election. I hope he will because his tax plan \nwill stop growth in our economy. It is very bad when you have a \nrecession. He said, if elected, he might reconsider them in light of an \neconomy that might be in recession. So the deficit impact of Senator \nObama's plan might be further understated.\n  If the candidates were just proposing tax changes, the deficit impact \nof their numbers would end with these figures I presented on these \nvarious charts. That would assume neither candidate would be doing \nanything on the spending side.\n  There is no Congressional Budget Office estimate of the two \ncandidates' spending plans. A nonpartisan think tank, the National \nTaxpayers Union Foundation, has performed analyses and estimates of the \ntwo candidates' plans. I would use this chart that I do not think I \nhave shown to Senators before. You can also find a comparative analysis \nat the National Taxpayers Union's Web site.\n  Let's take a look at Senator McCain's plan first. The National \nTaxpayers Union, a nonpartisan public policy research organization, \nNTU, says that Senator McCain's plan would include new spending of \n$68.5 billion per year. You can find the document, again, on the NTU's \nWeb site.\n  Senator McCain has made it clear he wants to cut spending. That is \nconsistent with his career in the Senate. He has been a spending \ncutter. Sometimes he has found it to be a very lonely fight. Senator \nMcCain, despite fighting wasteful spending, has too often lost. \nSometimes I have disagreed with his definition of wasteful spending, \nand, obviously, other times I have agreed with him. But one thing is \nclear: Senator McCain pushes spending cuts, and any honest, nonpartisan \nobserver could not quarrel with that point. Senator McCain's overall \neconomic plan continues his principle of cutting spending and keeping \ntaxes low.\n  Senator Obama's plan on spending is completely different. The \nNational Taxpayers Union counted up 158 new Federal spending programs. \nA conservative estimate of those programs came to $344.6 billion per \nyear. We are talking, then, for emphasis, that Obama would spend $344.6 \nbillion per year. You can look that up also on the NTU Web site.\n  If my friends on the other side have what they feel is a better \nestimate of Senator McCain's, on the one hand, and Senator Obama's, on \nthe other hand, new spending plans, I would be glad to take a look at \nit. But when you look at the NTU analyses, you can see that Senator \nObama's spending plans would amount to $276 billion more per year. \nConservatively speaking, it means that, if elected, a President Obama's \ntax and spending plans, if enacted, would exceed a President McCain's \nplans, in deficit impact, before the end of the first term.\n  Something has to give. Senator McCain has been willing to put \nspending cuts on the table. It has been a hallmark of his congressional \ncareer. He would have to find a way to get the Congress to follow \nbecause that is not Congress's inclination, to cut spending. It would \nprobably be his greatest challenge, but we know he is in the fight to \nrestrain spending.\n  As a country, we cannot endure a deficit impact as large as would be \nprojected under Senator Obama's tax plan, on the one hand, and add to \nit his spending plan, on the other hand. Where will Senator Obama \nadjust his plan, if elected? Will he abandon the tax cuts he has \npromised? Will he enlarge the group of Americans he has targeted for \ntax increases? Will he abandon his ambitious spending plans? Will he \ncut spending?\n\n[[Page S9567]]\n\n  I think you need to think of the history of past campaigns, of what \ncan happen to spending or tax policy enunciated in a campaign but not \ncarried out after that President is elected, as evidenced by President \nClinton in 1993, passing the biggest tax increase in the history of the \ncountry--and those are Senator Moynihan's words--contrary to the \nmiddle-class tax cuts he promised during the campaign. I hope Senator \nObama is not up to that same game. But voters ought to be alerted to \nit, ought to be alerted, too, to make sure, as to things Senator McCain \nis saying, that if he is President, you have that to measure against. \nWe need to keep candidates intellectually honest, not to promise too \nmuch on the campaign trail; when they get sworn in, they do not have so \nmany promises to keep. But we should expect Presidents to keep \npromises.\n  More importantly, a President McCain or a President Obama is likely \nto be dealing with expanded Democratic majorities on Capitol Hill. That \ngets me back to my tax increase thermometer and what it has told us \nover the past 20 years: that with a unified Democratic Government, \ntaxes are likely to go up, as evidenced by the top of the thermometer \nshown on this chart. At the highest level of tax increases, you get \nthat when you have a Congress and a President that are both under \nDemocratic control, as evidenced by the 20-year history. Spending is \nnot likely to go down because whether Republicans are in control of \nCongress or the Democrats, the inclination of Congress is not to cut \nspending. That is not right, but that is a fact of life, and a \nPresident who wants to veto bills is a damper on that.\n  In closing, I would like to review the issues I have raised today \nvery quickly. Many folks are asking about the fiscal impact of the tax \nplans proposed by Senator McCain and Senator Obama. The Tax Policy \nCenter has produced data looking at the proposals against current law. \nBoth candidates implicitly acknowledge current law is not a realistic \nmeasure. With that noted, the Tax Policy Center has examined the \nproposals against the more realistic baseline--current tax policy. If \nunspecified revenue raisers are deducted from both plans, the deficit \nimpact of both plans grows. Likewise, we find the gap in deficit impact \nbetween the two plans narrows.\n  We cannot ignore the deficit impact of the spending side of each \ncandidate's plan. Senator Obama's plan outspends Senator McCain's plan \nby over 500 percent. When Senators McCain's and Obama's plans are \ncombined, Senator Obama's plan adds more to the deficit. In this \ntroubled time, the Federal Government has stepped into the breach of \nthe financial sector meltdown--all the more reason we need to closely \nscrutinize the tax and spending policies of our colleagues, Senators \nMcCain and Obama.\n  Mr. President, out of respect for my colleagues--I had more to say, \nbut it was in a little different version--I am going to give up the \nfloor. But is anybody on the record to speak after the Senator from \nMichigan is done?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The Senator from Iowa has 1 minute remaining, also, I would notify \nhim.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Senator Harkin?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. No. You have 1 minute remaining. \nThere is no unanimous consent request after Senator Stabenow.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. How much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the \nfloor for 5 minutes after the Senator from Michigan speaks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9567-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9567-S9568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, today I wish to speak in support of what I consider to \nbe the people's benefit, the people's bailout we have in front of us--a \njobs stimulus--that we are going to be voting on shortly to invest in \njobs in Michigan and all across the country and why we need to be doing \nthat, why we need the President to finally support us in doing that, \nand why we need to have bipartisan support to do that. But first I wish \nto share with you some of what the people in Michigan are feeling right \nnow about what is going on.\n  We in Michigan have known for a long time that things were not going \nwell, that the fundamentals of the economy were not strong. We have \nknown for a long time. I have been sounding the bell. Other colleagues \nof mine here in the majority have been sounding the bell. We have been \nputting forward solutions in the last 18 months, holding investigative \nhearings, proposing strategies to address the housing market and what \nneeds to be done for jobs in the future. All we have heard from the \nother side of the aisle, from this President, has been: The \nfundamentals of the economy are strong. And now, all of a sudden, they \ncome to us and say we are at the edge of a cliff. Well, unfortunately, \nI believe we are.\n  Contrary to all of the information or misinformation that was given \nto us in leading up to the war in Iraq, where, after listening very \ncarefully and intently, I did not believe what was being said about the \ncrisis or sense of urgency and voted no, in this case, where we are \nhearing from people around the country and I am hearing from people \naround Michigan in terms of what is happening--the inability to get \ncredit to be able to start a business, what is happening in terms of \npotentially more job loss--I think this is, in fact, a crisis.\n  But what is outrageous to me is that this is not an accident. This is \na crisis that has been brought forward because of a failed philosophy \nand a failed set of policies that have got us to this point. People in \nMichigan are mad about it. And I am mad about it. I am mad about the \nposition in which we now find ourselves because, in fact, if people \ncannot get a car loan, my auto dealers are not going to be able to stay \nin business, my auto workers are not going to be able to have the \nopportunity to build those great automobiles. So I know this is \nserious. If, in fact, folks cannot get a college loan, that impacts the \nfamilies whom I represent. If they cannot get a line of credit, if \nsomebody takes an early out at one of our auto companies and decides \nthey are going to set up their own small business and they cannot get \ncredit, they cannot get a line of credit to set up that business, they \nare in trouble. My communities are in trouble. But what is an outrage \nis what has gotten us to this point and the fact that when families in \nMichigan have been not only on the edge of the cliff but falling off \nthe cliff--thousands of them a month, losing jobs, losing homes, can't \nget the health care they need for their family, squeezed on all sides--\nwe haven't been able to get the support from this administration or the \nbipartisan support we have needed to be able to help the families who \nfall off a cliff every day. So the people in Michigan are mad, and I \ndon't blame them, because I am mad too.\n\n  We have had a failed set of philosophies that has gotten us to this \npoint. While we know now--or I believe that--unfortunately, we do have \nto do something because the people in my State are ultimately going to \nsee their jobs gone if we don't. I also believe it is incredibly \nimportant that we investigate, and that we demonstrate that we know \nwhat happened, the policies that failed, and that we are not going to \nlet it happen again. I believe, frankly, there is only one way to do \nthat, and that is by changing the philosophy, changing the White House \nin this country.\n  But let's look at where we are: massive deregulation. I know from the \ngreat State of Ohio, the Presiding Officer faces the very same concerns \nI do. Massive deregulation: Let's not watch what is going on. No \naccountability. Tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, while middle-\nclass people lose their jobs, and then step back and let greed roll. \nLet greed reign, with no accountability.\n  Now, that is what has gotten us to this point. People can try to mask \nit over in a thousand different ways, but the facts are the facts. This \nphilosophy--the Republican philosophy of deregulation, coupled with \nmore concern about tax cuts for the wealthy than what is happening to \nour country in\n\n[[Page S9568]]\n\nterms of debt or investment, has gotten us where we are. The reality is \nthat the American people one more time are in a situation where they \nare going to pay for it if we act and they are going to pay for it if \nwe don't act. So we have to sort through what is the most responsible \nway to proceed when we know that American families are counting on us \nto get it right.\n  I received an e-mail from my brother last night--a small businessman \nin Michigan, working hard every day. He raised two great daughters; one \nis in college and one is out. He understands what it is like to try to \npay the bills. He sent me an e-mail from a friend of his who has been \ngoing around--and this will give you an idea about what people in \nMichigan feel about all this. Just with AIG alone, what was done in \nterms of the bailout for AIG--$85 billion, my brother's friend sent an \ne-mail that said: You know, they figured out that if you looked at \nevery American 18 years of age or older and you divided that money up, \nand then you took minus taxes, because everybody in America is playing \nby the rules and is stepping up and paying their taxes, and what you \nwould end up with for every American 18 years of age or older, just \nfrom that one company: $297,500--Mr. President, $297,500, just from \nthat one company, or a husband and wife: $595,000.\n  Now, what could a family do with $595,000? Could they buy a house? \nCould they start a business? Could they make sure their kids can go to \nschool and come out without a bunch of debt? Maybe it is as simple as \nmaking sure you can pay the gas payment, the heating payment, and put \nfood on the table and know you don't have to go to sleep at night and \nsay: Please, God, don't let the kids get sick.\n  We know financial markets are complicated and it is not that easy. I \nwish it were that easy, because I would be happy to do that. I wish it \nwere that easy, but we know it is not.\n  We know what has been built here, because of deregulation and lack of \noversight and irresponsibility, has been a house of cards, and it is \ncomplicated. People don't even know who holds their mortgage now and, \nchances are, it is divided up and lots of different folks have it \nsomewhere, and you can't even figure out how to negotiate to be able to \nkeep your home. But we know it is complicated, and we also know the \nreality is in the American marketplace that if credit is not available, \nthen businesses can't keep the payrolls going, which is where the \nrubber meets the road, and what I care about, and I know the Presiding \nOfficer cares about.\n  So this is serious. This is serious. We do need to fix it in a \nresponsible way. But you know what. We also need to express the outrage \npeople feel about getting us to this point. We have seen 605,000 people \nand counting since January alone lose their jobs, a lot of them in my \nState of Michigan where we have 8.9 percent unemployment and counting; \n605,000 people since January. I have been on the floor I can't even \ncount how many times talking about the fact that we need to focus on \ngood-paying jobs. For those who lost their jobs, we need to extend \nunemployment compensation so they can pay the mortgage and stay in \ntheir house while they are trying to find another job. Our economic \nstimulus plan that is before us now, put forward by our leader, Senator \nHarry Reid, and Senator Byrd and the Democrats, extends that \nunemployment compensation and is absolutely critical. But it is even \nworse than that, because we have had 8 years--8 years--of not paying \nattention to middle-class families. In manufacturing alone, in the \ngreat State of Michigan, in the great State of Ohio, people who not \nonly make automobiles but appliances and furniture and all the things \nthat keep the economy running, have been overlooked. We have lost 3.5 \nmillion jobs; in fact, that number is going up. Even as we have this \nchart, I think I saw a new number that said 3.8 million. This number \nkeeps going up and up and up, of lost manufacturing jobs since this \nfailed Republican strategy started in 2001.\n  So we all understand we are at the edge of a cliff, but we have a lot \nof people who have fallen off already and are saying: What about me? \nWhat about my family? What are you going to do about my family? Don't I \ncount anymore? Is it only the wealthy people who count? Is it only the \npeople on Wall Street who count? What about me, and what about my \nfamily?\n  That leads me to the economic stimulus plan that has been put before \nus, because this is our downpayment as the Democratic majority, and I \nam so hopeful it is going to be bipartisan. I am so hopeful. This is a \ndownpayment on the fiscal relief for the help the American people need. \nNow, it is about 8 percent of the bailout of the fiscal crisis \nsituation that we are being asked to deal with; about 8 percent of the \n$700 billion is what we are asking for with this amount.\n  Mr. President, if I might receive unanimous consent for an additional \n2 minutes. I realize you have the gavel.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you very much.\n  What we have in front of us is the ability to come together and--I \nsee people of goodwill. I see our leader on finance, our ranking \nmember, and we work together all the time. I am hopeful we are going to \ncome together on this one.\n  We have in front of us the ability to create jobs with this package. \nOverall, the cost of it is only 8 percent of what we are being asked to \ndo to deal with the overall financial crisis. It is not clear whether \nit is going to work, what we are being asked to do in the broader \nsense, but I tell you what: This will work, because this will put \npeople back to work. This will extend unemployment compensation. It \nwill invest--and I wish to thank our leadership for taking my \nrecommendation--in advanced battery technology research, which is part \nof how we get to the advanced vehicles, to invest $300 million so we \ncan claim that technology, so it is not being made overseas. Jobs and \nrebuilding America are in this plan. It is only 8 percent of what we \nare being asked to do to be able to deal with the crisis in the \nfinancial markets. I know that is real. I know it is. I know we have to \ndeal with a responsible plan. But, frankly, this is about making sure \nwe deal with the crisis in the lives of families every day, and it is \nthe least we can do.\n  We need a responsible plan for the broader crisis: No golden \nparachutes for CEOs; we need to help homeowners; We need to have \naccountability. Frankly, we need to investigate and find out exactly \nwhat happened and who is responsible and hold them accountable. Because \nthe American people are watching to see if we are going to also pay \nattention to what is happening; the crisis in their lives. This \nstimulus package we have in front of us right now is a first step to \ndoing that, to say: We hear you. We get it. It matters what happens in \npeople's lives. I hope we are going to support it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Iowa deferred in order to finish his speech in a very short period \nof time. I ask unanimous consent that when he finishes, I then be \nrecognized for not more than 10 minutes, and then the senior Senator \nfrom Washington be recognized after me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9568-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9568-S9569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  AMT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there is a provision in the bill we \npassed Tuesday on taxes with only two dissenting votes that hasn't been \ndiscussed much, and I wish to refer to that provision. It is a \nmodification of the alternative minimum tax credit allowance against \nincentive stock options. So the important words there are ``incentive \nstock options.'' Because of how stock options are treated by the AMT, \nthe economic downturn in 2000 created a situation where many \nindividuals owed tax on income they never realized. This is because \nthey owed tax on the value of their stock options when they were \nexercised and not on what the value of the stock actually was when the \nshares were sold. Many people owed tax that was several times their \nactual income. Congress acted to remedy this situation through past \nlegislation, but that did not completely\n\n[[Page S9569]]\n\nsolve the problem. Many families are still facing an IRS bent on \ncollecting liabilities owed now, despite the fact that those \nliabilities would be offset by credits in the near future. This means \nthat the IRS was--and could, in the future--be working to seize assets \nsuch as family homes to satisfy present tax liabilities that would be \neliminated within the next few years under current law.\n  One Iowa family caught in this AMT trap is the Speltz family of Ely, \nIA, near Cedar Rapids. Ron and June Speltz found themselves in the \ncrosshairs of the IRS after Ron used stock options to purchase several \nshares of stock of his employer. I ask unanimous consent that an \neditorial printed in the Des Moines Register on July 24, 2006, that \ndescribes the Speltz family ordeal be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was I ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the DesMoinesRegister.com, July 24, 2006]\n\n                  Congress Should Fix Unfair Tax Quirk\n\n                   (By the Register Editorial Board)\n\n       The U.S. government has ruined the financial lives of Ron \n     and June Speltz of Ely.\n       Here's how it happened: In 1992, Ron took a job with \n     McLeodUSA, then a small telecommunications start-up. \n     Compensation included stock options, which he saved for a \n     family nest egg. In 2000, he and June consulted a financial \n     adviser on the best way to cash out the stock. The adviser \n     told them to exercise the stock options and hold the stock \n     for a year to take advantage of low tax rates on capital \n     gains.\n       Then the stock price fell. What was once worth about \n     $700,000 became worth about $2,000. Yet, they owed more than \n     $250,000 in state and federal taxes due to a quirk in the \n     Alternative Minimum Tax law that targets Incentive Stock \n     Options (ISO-AMT).\n       When we wrote about the Speltzes and other Iowans in \n     similar straits earlier this year, we received a few letters \n     to the editor stating it was their greed and desire to avoid \n     paying taxes that landed them in such a predicament.\n       Yes, they tried to take full advantage of tax law. Who \n     doesn't? But at the end of the day, Americans should not have \n     to pay taxes on money they never collected. It amounts to the \n     U.S. government taking money from people it shouldn't be \n     entitled to. It's hard to believe Congress intended such \n     consequences for people whose employers, like McLeod, go \n     bankrupt.\n       It's devastating families and driving them into bankruptcy, \n     too. The Speltzes have had to borrow money from banks and \n     family members to try to pay the tax. They have lost \n     everything they had saved for retirement and their children.\n       But perhaps the greatest tragedy is that they have taken \n     every possible step to get the government to respond to their \n     case. And they're still waiting for help.\n       They've traveled to congressional hearings in Washington, \n     repeatedly contacted members of the Iowa delegation, and gone \n     round and round with the Internal Revenue Service. They even \n     took their case to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, which on \n     July 14 affirmed a judgment from the United States Tax Court \n     that the Speltzes owe the tax.\n       ``This is one more time that our court system has placed \n     the issue in the hands of Congress,'' Ron wrote in an e-mail \n     to the Register. ``We are in desperate need'' of Congress'' \n     help.\n       Here's a glimmer of hope: When we checked with Sen. Charles \n     Grassley's office last week, his aide, Jill Kozeny, said the \n     senator was ``working to get included some ISO-AMT relief for \n     middle-income taxpayers'' in what's called the ``extenders'' \n     tax bill being negotiated in a conference committee.\n       ``Obviously this is the biggest thing that's happened in \n     five years,'' said the Speltzes' pro-bono attorney, Tim \n     Carlson. He hopes it provides relief to the thousands of \n     Americans, including scores of Iowans who worked for McLeod, \n     who have been adversely affected by this quirk in tax law.\n       We hope so, too. The senator is the Speltzes' last hope.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, despite the previous stock option \nalternative in minimum tax relief enacted earlier, the IRS is still \nafter the Speltz family. In fact, this past June, Ron and June received \na notice from the IRS announcing their intent to levy certain assets. \nAfter stating that the IRS intends to levy any State tax refunds, the \nnotice continued: ``In addition, we will begin to search for other \nassets we may levy.''\n  I think anyone would be terrified to receive something such as this \nin the mail, especially when the outstanding liability derives from \nincome never actually realized, and Congress has already decided that \nit shouldn't happen.\n  In July, I sent a letter with 26 of my colleagues in the Senate and \nthe House to IRS Commissioner Shulman asking that he use the discretion \nprovided to him by effective tax administration to suspend collection \nefforts to collect incentive stock option alternative minimum tax \nliabilities in order to give us a chance to fix this problem once and \nfor all. Commissioner Shulman gave us that chance by agreeing that the \nIRS would not undertake any collection enforcement action through the \nend of the fiscal year. The end of the fiscal year is next Tuesday.\n  If the House does not stop playing politics with the taxpayers and \ninstead pass the Senate extenders package that we passed with only two \ndissenting votes, Commissioner Shulman promises in his letter that \n``the IRS will then continue to administer programs in accordance with \ncurrent law.'' That means the Speltzes and probably a lot of other \npeople spread around Iowa, California, and other places where high-tech \nwas a big thing in the 1990s, their assets will be needlessly seized \nfrom them if we do not fix this problem.\n  This is not a political issue either. The original legislation to fix \nthis problem was introduced in the Senate by Senator Kerry, and in the \nHouse by Congressman Chris Van Hollen. Both bills were cosponsored by \nMembers of both parties. Even the National Taxpayer Advocate, in her \nFiscal Year 2009 Objectives Report, agreed that this problem demanded \nimmediate action.\n  Commissioner Shulman has given us the window we need to prevent \nadditional taxpayers from being crushed in the grip of incentive stock \noption AMT liability. Any delay in enacting the Senate-passed \nlegislation is to aid and abet the seizure of the Speltz family's \nassets and those of many other families.\n  According to the latest Small Business Administration report, issued \nin December 2007, all net new private sector jobs in 2006 were created \nby small businesses. According to the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, almost half of those job-creating businesses are \nowned by taxpayers who are targeted with a marginal rate increase of 17 \npercent to 33 percent. Since these small businesses are likely to \ncreate or retain new jobs, maybe we could get a bipartisan agreement \nnot to raise their taxes on small business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the discussion is on the serious problem \nthis country is facing. While I take a position against the \nadministration's program, I know they are behind closed doors with the \nleadership on both sides, both Houses, trying to come up with something \nthat is workable.\n  I suggest what we are going to vote on, scheduled for 11:30 a.m., \nwhich I think will be a little later than that, does not have a \nsolution. One of the points I want to make sure everyone knows is that \nin this legislation is the extension of the moratorium on oil shale.\n  The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2007 established a 1-year \nmoratorium on the necessary funding to complete the final regulations \nfor commercial leasing of oil shale on public lands. Without \ncongressional action, the moratorium will expire. The stimulus bill \nthat we will be voting on shortly after 11:30 will continue this \nmoratorium for another year.\n  This is serious. The Senate has debated energy legislation for weeks, \nand the extension of this moratorium does nothing to address increasing \ndomestic energy supply.\n  The potential energy development from the Rocky Mountain oil shale is \ntruly massive. The Green River Formation located within Colorado, \nWyoming, and Utah contains the equivalent of 6 trillion barrels of oil. \nOf this 6 trillion, the RAND Corporation estimates there are 1.1 \ntrillion recoverable barrels. That equals more than 2,000 years' worth \nof imports from Saudi Arabia, or 145 years of domestic supply at \ncurrent rates of oil consumption. These numbers would nearly double \nassuming the Department of Energy's estimate of nearly 2 trillion \npotentially recoverable barrels. What we are talking about is huge.\n  The RAND Corporation projects that within the first 12 years of \ncommercial production, these barrels would be recoverable at prices as \nlow as $35 to $48 per barrel.\n\n[[Page S9570]]\n\n  There are problems out there. We have been arguing on the floor of \nthe Senate, and the Democrats refuse to increase the supply or vote for \nany increase in oil or gas in America.\n  We have the Outer Continental Shelf discussion that is going on. This \nbill doesn't affect that. However, since 1982, Democrats and the \nenvironmental left have blocked access to 85 percent of America's Outer \nContinental Shelf resources. With this year's record-high gas prices, \nAmericans have demanded that the Democrats in Congress allow us to \nproduce from our own resources. With just 6 weeks until election day, \nDemocrats have finally relented.\n  We held a news conference yesterday. We all celebrated the fact that \nwe are going to allow these two moratoria to expire. This bill will \nstop the expiration of the moratorium on oil shale.\n  The Interior Department estimates that the Outer Continental Shelf \ncontains 19 billion barrels of undiscovered recoverable oil. That \nequals 35 years of imports from Saudi Arabia.\n  We can see that while the Outer Continental Shelf is great, we want \nto remove that moratorium. It is even much more important we do it with \noil shale because of the sheer size. As I say, the vote doesn't affect \nthe Outer Continental Shelf, but it does affect oil shale.\n  Americans spent more than $327 billion to import oil in 2007. These \noil imports accounted for 46 percent of the Nation's $711 billion trade \ndeficit last year. By opening the Outer Continental Shelf and the oil \nshale, America can cut that trade deficit in half.\n  Assuming a $130 price per barrel of oil, America will trade more than \n$135 billion to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela for oil imports this year.\n  Outer Continental Shelf and oil shale production can stop this \ntransfer of oil and keep hundreds of billions of dollars at home within \nour economy creating jobs at home, not overseas.\n  America is not running out of oil and gas or running out of places to \nlook for oil and gas. America is running out of places where the \nDemocrats in Congress are allowing us to look for oil and gas.\n  We had a great celebration on Wednesday that the moratoria would be \nlifted in both areas. This bill would extend the moratorium on shale, \nthe largest opportunity we have and potential we have for reserves and \nfor lowering the price of gas at the pump that we will be dealing with \nthis year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as all of us are aware, J.P. Morgan has \nagreed to buy Washington Mutual, which is based in my home State of \nWashington. I have been in touch with J.P. Morgan and with WaMu about \ntheir plans, and I have been assured that the transition will go \nsmoothly and that Washington Mutual's banking customers will not see \nany interruption in service. And that is good news.\n  It is, of course, still too early to know the impact of the failure \nof WaMu, the Nation's largest thrift, will have on local jobs, but it \nis further evidence to me that the economic crisis has spilled over \ninto our communities.\n  I am very saddened that it is having an impact on families and our \neconomy, and yet it is another sign that we must find a bipartisan \nsolution now.\n  We are working together quickly to reach an agreement. We have \nrejected the President's $700 billion blank check because it did not \nensure oversight or protection for our taxpayers. But Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Senate are working with the House Democrats, the \nTreasury, and the Fed to come up with a solution that keeps this crisis \nfrom hitting more communities. We are hopeful that the House \nRepublicans will come to the table and work with us on a solution that \nprotects American taxpayers.\n  As we do this, I firmly believe we must also offer the American \npeople a hand and help get our economy going in communities across this \ncountry.\n  We now have an opportunity today to help millions of struggling \nfamilies who are grasping for a lifeline as this economy sustains blow \nafter blow. Long before this economic crisis rippled across our \nfinancial system, middle-class families were already reeling under the \nimpact of failed policies that were implemented by President Bush and \nbacked by John McCain, and it is critical that we act now to help those \nfamilies, those small businesses, State and local governments get back \non their feet. The bill I am hoping we will vote on shortly will do \njust that.\n  This bill brings security to seniors who are facing a stack of \nmedical bills they cannot afford to pay and offers help to families who \nhave seen the value of their homes drop below the amount they owe. It \nensures that the most vulnerable Americans can continue to put food on \ntheir table and keep a roof over their heads. It creates jobs at a time \nwhen billions of workers have been laid off and billions more are \nworried that their job is going to be next.\n  The Bush-McCain economic philosophy of ``hands off'' has done its \ndamage. It is time that we now put the interests of the American people \nfirst again.\n  This bill I hope we will vote on shortly will do just that. I wish to \ntake a few minutes this morning to underscore the importance of what \nthat bill will do.\n  First of all, dropping home values and dwindling business revenues \nhave put our State governments under extraordinary financial stress at \na time when they can least afford it. As a result of the White House's \nfailed policies, Republican and Democratic Governors across the country \nare now facing drastic cuts in services from health care to education \nto law enforcement, and they are looking and asking for relief from \nWashington.\n  Already, State-supported health clinics and hospitals are closing, \nschools are pushing more and more students on fewer teachers, and fully \ntrained police officers are being asked to hand in their badges because \ntheir departments can no longer afford to keep them on the beat.\n  This bill will allocate about $20 billion to help our States continue \nto provide the services on which our citizens depend.\n  Next, this package puts workers on the job immediately by providing \n$8 billion for highway projects in every one of our States. As chairman \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, I have been watching with dismay as the construction \nsector of our economy has endured hundreds of thousands of layoffs over \nthe last several months.\n  Construction jobs play a critical role in our economy. They provide a \nliving wage that enables those families to keep food on their tables. \nBut the construction industry is now facing its highest unemployment \nrate in 13 years.\n  A couple of months ago, an estimated 783,000 jobless laborers, \ncarpenters, plumbers, pipefitters, and other tradesmen were looking for \nwork wherever they could find it. With that in mind and watching that \nhappen, I helped to work to craft a transportation and housing \ninfrastructure package that is in this bill that addresses our most \ncritical needs.\n  It requires that we spend the money fast so that we will see an \nimmediate impact on our economy in every one of our communities. Every \nState across this Nation has a highway, transit, or airport maintenance \nproject that is ready to go to construction, but they lack the money to \nbuy the rebar or purchase the timber or order the concrete or even pay \nthe workers.\n  This bill we will be considering will allow those projects to get up \nand running right now when we desperately need those jobs. This funding \nwill create more than 278,000 family-wage jobs in a sector that has \ntaken it on the chin over the last year, and it does it fairly and it \ndoes it responsibly.\n  This bill requires those highway dollars be spent according to the \nformula that was established in our SAFETEA-LU highway law. There are \nno earmarks, no special projects. States have to use these dollars \nwithin 90 days.\n  Now, all of us have heard about the increasing demand for public \ntransportation as gas prices have gone through\n\n[[Page S9571]]\n\nthe roof. For example, Amtrak, our Nation's railroad, continues to set \nrecords now for its ridership. Well, the bill we are considering makes \nurgently needed investments in Amtrak and mass transit. It provides \n$2.35 billion in funding to improve and expand our bus and rail \nsystems, including $350 million to repair railcars and make other \nnecessary improvements to the Amtrak network. Most importantly, that \nwill put another 70,000 Americans back to work.\n  The bill also includes $400 million for capital projects at our \nNation's airports and $44 million to modernize our Nation's shipyards \nto make them competitive and efficient. It provides money to ensure \nthat Americans who rely on public housing will continue to have a roof \nover their heads. It will help address a growing problem in our \ncommunities--renters who have lost their homes because their landlords \nwere foreclosed on. This bill includes $200 million to help those \ntenants find immediate shelter and long-term housing. It includes $250 \nmillion so our public housing authorities can rebuild those vacant \nunits and fill those units with needy tenants.\n  Finally, this bill will increase benefits for those jobless Americans \nwho, at a time when unemployment is at the highest since 2003, need to \nknow they can keep food on their tables. Our economy has bled jobs \nevery single month this year. Hundreds of thousands of workers are \nwondering how they are going to pay their mortgages or pay for their \nfood or their heat.\n  The jobless rate now stands at 6.1 percent across the country, and it \nis worse in those States where manufacturing and auto industries have \nbeen faltering for years. This bill reaches out to those families by \nextending unemployment benefits by just 7 weeks across the country and \n13 weeks in States where the jobless rate is the highest. And it \ninvests in our workforce by helping those laid-off workers search for a \nnew job or earn skills so they can go back into the job market and be \ncompetitive.\n  It also helps our teenagers get job experience and helps them find \nlong-term employment. I want our colleagues to know teenagers are among \nthe hardest hit by the economic crisis today. Almost 20 percent of our \nteenagers are unable to find a job, and the number is even higher among \nminorities. So it is critical that we enable these young people to get \nwork experience now. Because if they lose out, they are less likely to \nmove into a career later. Teens without jobs are more likely, as we all \nknow, to turn to crime or gangs in these difficult times, and that is \ngoing to cost our communities millions in law enforcement and lost \nproductivity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this bill helps support part-time jobs \nafter school, paid internships, and community service jobs for older \nyouth. Those programs will pay off in the long run.\n  I have talked about a few of the programs in this package which I \nbelieve are a critical shot in the arm to help our economy, and it is \nnot going to come a moment too soon. The economic crisis we are facing \nis a direct result of failed policies by this President, this \nadministration, in the long run.\n  We are hearing now we need to bail out Wall Street. Well, this \npackage before us will help the average citizen across our country get \nthe security they need as they face this troubling crisis. I urge my \ncolleagues to work with us to get to a vote and send a message across \nthe country that we in the Senate and the Congress stand behind them, \nthe working families in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the noted economist John Kenneth Galbraith \nonce wrote:\n\n       There are two kinds of economists in the world: Those who \n     don't know the future, and those who don't know that they \n     don't know the future.\n\n  In that sense, we are all economists now. We are all uncertain about \nour economic future. What we do know is that the stakes for our \neconomic future are high, and we do know the economy is doing poorly \nright now.\n  During the last 8 months, more than 600,000 people lost their jobs. \nHousing prices have been falling. Last month, the median home sales \nprice fell 9\\1/2\\ percent. That is the largest decline since \nrecordkeeping began in 1999. The experts say we have not yet hit \nbottom.\n  Last month, there were more than 300,000 foreclosures. That is a 12-\npercent increase from the previous month and a 27-percent increase from \nthe year before.\n  Consumer confidence is low. Last December, the Conference Board's \nIndex for consumer confidence was above 90. Now it is below 57. Last \nmonth, retail sales fell by three-tenths of a percent.\n  In this downturn, Congress acted relatively early. In February, on a \nbipartisan basis, we passed an economic recovery bill and included in \nthat bill was a tax rebate that put money in people's pockets. Lots of \npeople spent that money, and the second quarter gross domestic product \nwas larger than it otherwise would have been. But almost all those \nchecks have now been sent and spent, and the economy is still in bad \nshape.\n  We need another economic recovery package, and that is what this bill \nwould provide. This bill includes help for workers who have lost their \njobs. It includes a further expansion in the number of weeks for \nunemployment benefits and much more.\n  In June, Congress passed an extension of the number of weeks of \nunemployment benefits. That extension provided that those who had \nexhausted their regular 26 weeks of benefits would become eligible for \nan additional 13 weeks of benefits. We tried to add in a provision for \nanother 13 weeks for those in high-unemployment States, but some of our \ncolleagues and the President opposed that provision so it was dropped \nin conference.\n  In August, unemployment hit 6.1 percent. That is the highest level in \n5 years. Well, here we are in September and the economy is still \nstruggling. In fact, it is in worse shape. It is not easy to find a job \nthat pays well. In October, for example, it is anticipated that 775,000 \nworkers will exhaust the 13 weeks of additional benefits we provided in \nJune. Another 363,000 workers will exhaust these benefits in November \nor December. That is a total of more than a million workers.\n  This bill provides for an extra 7 weeks of benefits in all States, \nand then it would make right what we could not do earlier this year, \nwhich is provide an additional 13 weeks of benefits for individuals who \nlive in States where unemployment is higher than 6 percent. At the \nmoment, that is 18 States.\n  The bill will also help areas that have been hit by Federal \ndisasters. Under this bill, there would not be a waiting-week penalty \nwhen State-extended unemployment benefits kick in during times of \ndisaster. This bill will provide much needed help for overburdened \nState unemployment systems. We are a society that cares about all its \npeople. In hard economic times, giving additional weeks of unemployment \nbenefits to people who cannot find a job is clearly the right action to \ntake.\n  But there is another reason providing extra weeks of unemployment \nbenefits will help stimulate the economy. People who are unemployed \nlose the income from their jobs. They generally don't have the income \nthey need. So if they receive more money, they are likely to spend it; \nhence, unemployment benefits. When these unemployed workers spend their \nmoney, the folks who create the goods and services they buy will need \nmore workers. Those workers will spend the earnings they get. The cycle \ngoes on. Economists call this the multiplier effect.\n  The chief economist and cofounder of Moody's is Mark Zandi. He \nestimates that for every dollar of new unemployment benefits, the \neconomy will grow by $1.64. Compared to other options to stimulate the \neconomy, this option has a high bang for the buck.\n  At times such as these, we need to extend the number of weeks of \nunemployment benefits. To help strengthen our economy, we also need to \nprovide fiscal relief to State governments.\n  The economy of a State has a major effect on the state government's \nbudget. When a State's economy weakens, the State government's revenues \ngenerally fall off. In addition, as unemployment increases and incomes \ndecline, more people become eligible for\n\n[[Page S9572]]\n\nassistance programs like Medicaid. And that increases the demand for \nState spending.\n  Almost all of the States have balanced budget requirements. During a \ntime of economic weakness, when revenues drop and the need for \nexpenditures increases, States may have to raise taxes or cut other \nspending in order to keep their budgets balanced. Unfortunately, that's \nprecisely the wrong fiscal policy.\n  If a State raises taxes, it reduces the purchasing power of its \nresidents and firms. And that can lead to further economic decline.\n  Reductions in State spending also lower the purchasing power of those \npersons or firms that would receive the State funds.\n  Unfortunately, the current economic weakness is pressing many States \nto either raise taxes or cut spending. According to the Center on \nBudget and Policy Priorities, 30 States had to take actions to reduce \ntheir budget deficits for fiscal year 2009, which began on July 1 of \nthis year. And of these 30 States, 13 are facing additional budgetary \nshortfalls that appeared after they enacted their budgets. These 30 \nStates are facing about $52 billion of shortfalls. If States raise \ntaxes or cut spending by that much, it would place a significant drag \non the national economy.\n  During the last economic downturn, Congress increased the Federal \nmatching rate for the Medicaid program by about 3 percentage points for \nfive quarters. This freed up $10 billion for the States so that they \ndid not have to cut Medicaid benefits. And that helped States to avoid \ncutting other expenditures or raising taxes. Most economists thought \nthat this fiscal assistance measure for the States worked well.\n  In February, the Finance Committee reported out an economic recovery \nbill that included State fiscal assistance in the form of an increase \nin the Medicaid matching rate. Unfortunately, that provision was not \nagreed to on the Senate floor.\n  But the fiscal situation of the States is now worse than it was at \nthe beginning of the year. And so, we should try to help the States. So \nthis bill includes State fiscal relief in the form of an increase in \nthe Medicaid matching rate.\n  This bill contains an across-the-board temporary increase of 4 \npercentage points in the Federal Medicaid matching rate. That would \nprovide every State with much needed help. At a time of unprecedented \nfiscal crisis, I think that every State deserves this level of help.\n  These are historic economic times. We are all uncertain about the \neconomic future. The stakes are high.\n  Let us not be found wanting. Let us act to bolster the economy's \nrecovery. And let us vote to advance this bill.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Reid/Byrd \neconomic stimulus package. Over the past week, congressional leaders \nhave been working with administration officials to craft a bailout \npackage for Wall Street. But if we are going to bail out Wall Street, \nwe also need to help Main Street. The President's failed fiscal \npolicies have resulted in higher unemployment, hardship in coping with \nrising food costs, higher energy costs, and increased dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  If the President thinks that a $700 billion bailout for Wall Street \nis good for America, he should certainly support a $56 billion \ninvestment program to create jobs on Main Street.\n  The unemployment rate now stands at 6.1 percent, the highest rate \nsince September 2003. The unemployment rate is up 1.4 percentage points \nsince last August. The U.S. economy has lost jobs every month this \nyear, a total of 605,000 jobs. The stimulus package extends \nunemployment benefits by 7 weeks in all States and another 13 weeks in \nhigh unemployment States.\n  Food prices have increased by 7.5 percent this year after increasing \n4.9 percent in 2007. In order to help low-income individuals cope with \nrising food prices, the stimulus package temporarily increases Food \nStamp benefits by 10 percent and includes $450 million for the Women, \nInfants, and Children--WIC--program, which would allow 625,000 women \nand children to receive benefits. $50 million is included for food \nbanks, $30 million for the commodity supplemental food program, and $60 \nmillion for senior meals programs, providing 18 million more meals to \nseniors.\n  There are consequences for failing to invest in America. Bridges fall \ninto rivers. Roads and subways are congested to the breaking point. \nFEMA cannot respond to a major disaster. Fuel prices go through the \nroof.\n  This stimulus package includes $10.8 billion for building and \nrepairing highways, bridges, mass transit, airports, and AMTRAK, \ncreating 384,000 jobs; $50 million for the Economic Development \nAdministration to help communities impacted by massive job losses due \nto corporate restructuring; $500 million for the COPS program to hire \n6,500 police officers; $600 million for clean water systems that would \ncreate 24,000 jobs; and $2 billion for school construction that would \ncreate 32,300 jobs.\n  Twenty-nine States are facing a $52 billion shortfall in revenues in \ntheir fiscal year 2009 budgets, resulting in cuts in health care, \neducation, and other programs. The stimulus package includes $19.6 \nbillion to reduce the States' share of Medicaid costs by increasing the \nFederal share by 4 percent.\n  Energy prices have increased by 22.4 percent in 2008. This stimulus \nbill includes major investments in promoting energy independence and a \nclean environment, including funds for advanced battery research, for \nlocal governments to improve energy efficiency, for environmental clean \nup, and weatherizing homes.\n  Over 22 percent of the world's energy supply is under the Arctic ice \ncap. The Russian President has stated that Russia should unilaterally \nclaim part of the Arctic, stepping up the race for the disputed energy-\nrich region. We are not going to go along with that. No. Hell \nno. Russia has a fleet of 20 heavy icebreakers and is nearing \ncompletion of the first of their newest fleet of nuclear-powered \nicebreakers in an effort to control energy exploration and maritime \ntrade in the region. Thanks to the Bush administration, the United \nStates has only one functioning heavy polar icebreaker, and it has only \n6 years left of useful life. Shame. Mr. President, $925 million is \nincluded for the Coast Guard to provide what the Navy and the Air Force \ncall, ``an essential instrument of U.S. policy'' in the region.\n\n  Funding is included to promote safety and energy efficiency in public \nhousing, implement provisions of the recent housing law, give housing \nassistance to tenants displaced by foreclosure, and fund FBI \ninvestigations of fraud in the mortgage market.\n  To promote education and job training, $2 billion is included for \nschool repairs, $36 million for homeless education, and $400 million \nfor the secure rural schools program. Job training funds would provide \n160,000 dislocated workers and youth with training and job search \nassistance.\n  Mr. President, $1.2 billion is included for the National Institutes \nof Health. America's small businesses, the lifeblood of our economy, \nface an ever-tightening credit market in the wake of struggling \nfinancial markets. The stimulus provides $205 million to support $16 \nbillion in reduced-fee loans to small businesses, delivering needed \nrelief to small businesses on Main Street.\n  I urge Senators to vote for this bill to send a message to the White \nHouse that Main Street matters.\n  I ask unanimous consent that information relating to rule XLIV of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate be made a part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         DISCLOSURE OF CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING ITEMS\n\n       The Constitution vests in the Congress the power of the \n     purse.

Mr. President, this will be the last time this year we will \nbe able to vote on an economic recovery package. The plan we vote on \ntoday will provide targeted investments that will help working people \nnow, not weeks or months from now. The dollars we invest in this \nlegislation will come right back to our economy by creating jobs, \nrebuild our crumbling infrastructure and help small businesses grow.\n  With 605,000 jobs lost this year alone, this legislation extends \nunemployment benefits by 7 weeks across our country and by 13 weeks \nStates with particularly high unemployment rates.\n  With States across America facing budget shortfalls as revenue dries \nup, this legislation provides funds to prevent State services like \nhealth care and education from deteriorating.\n  We invest in energy efficiency and clean energy programs to help \nAmericans switch to cleaner energy sources that will cost less as oil \nprices continue to reach record highs.\n  We invest in our crumbling infrastructure, which will not only help \nsmall and large businesses but will create nearly 400,000 good jobs.\n  We help Americans who are at risk of losing their homes by supporting \nthe Federal Housing Administration, providing tools to stop mortgage \nfraud, and funding legal assistance for foreclosure prevention.\n  This legislation also invests in job training, health care and small \nbusinesses to give our working Americans and our economy a desperately \nneeded boost.\n  As I have said before, Members of Congress from both parties will \ncontinue working as long as it takes to resolve the bailout \nlegislation.\n  But we do not have to wait until that bill is passed and implemented \nto help struggling American families and businesses. I urge all my \ncolleagues to support these wise investments in the places and people \nthat need help the most.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9573-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TO EXTEND FOR 5 YEARS THE PROGRAM RELATING TO WAIVER OF THE FOREIGN \n  COUNTRY RESIDENCE REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL \n                               GRADUATES\n\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the \nmotion to proceed to S. 3604 is considered made by the majority leader.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the stimulus \npackage. This stimulus package attempts to overturn an oil shale \nagreement that was reached in the continuing resolution.\n  This is more of the same shoddy process we have seen from the \nmajority party throughout the entire Congress. If the purpose of this \namendment is to stimulate the economy, why would we attempt to place \none of the largest potential deposits of oil in the world out of reach?\n  This provision would maintain the status quo of sending $700 billion \nannually to the likes of Hugo Chavez, if we enacted this provision. Not \nonly are we sending American dollars abroad, but we are sending \nAmerican jobs after them. It is ironic that something that is supposed \nto stimulate our economy would, in fact, hurt us.\n  This Congress has already passed a stimulus proposal as well as a \nsupplemental disaster appropriations bill, and we are going to vote on \na $700 billion Wall Street bailout. We must realize that the United \nStates does not have a blank check to spend unlimited amounts of \ntaxpayer money.\n  It is premature to consider the stimulus package before we fully know \nwhat our other obligations are going to be. This do-nothing and drill-\nnothing Congress is out of touch with the people who put them in \noffice.\n  Earlier this week we saw the largest single-day jump in oil prices in \nhistory. How did Democrats in Congress react? They attempted to extend \nthe ill-conceived moratorium on oil shale regulations. This moratorium \nplaces over 800 billion barrels of potentially recoverable oil out of \nreach. That is an energy source larger than the proven reserves of \nSaudi Arabia. Let me repeat that again. We are talking about an energy \nsource larger than the proven reserves of Saudi Arabia.\n  The Democratic-controlled Congress is completely ignoring the needs \nof our Nation. It is not only unfortunate but also insulting to the \nAmerican people who are struggling to pay these high fuel prices at the \ngas pump.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Congress needs to take action to stimulate \nthe slumping economy in ways that create jobs and help average middle-\nclass Americans. So I am pleased that today the Senate is voting on a \nsecond economic stimulus package of $56.2 billion aimed at creating \njobs and helping people suffering from higher prices at the pump and at \nthe grocery store, reduced State services, high unemployment, home \nforeclosures and otherwise feeling the economic pain in their daily \nlives. We clearly need more economic stimulus, especially in States \nlike Michigan. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nbill.\n  Importantly, this package includes a much needed unemployment \nextension. In August, Michigan's unemployment rate rose from 8.5 \npercent to 8.9 percent. The Nation's unemployment rate also increased \nby .4 percent, to 6.1 percent, the highest since 2003. These are very \nhard economic times. Unemployment rates are rising and since January \n2001 we have lost 3.686 million manufacturing jobs nationally and \n253,800 manufacturing jobs in Michigan. Since 2000, we have lost more \nthan 450,000 jobs in Michigan across all industries.\n  The unemployment insurance extension which was signed into law on \nJune 30 as part of the supplemental war appropriations bill included a \n13-week extension of UI benefits for all States. Since then, workers \nwho started receiving the 13-week extension in mid-July under the \ncurrent program will have their benefits cut off starting October 5. \nThis means that an estimated 42,600 workers in Michigan will be cut\n\n[[Page S9575]]\n\noff in October, and 775,000 workers across the Nation. By the end of \nthis year, the number of individuals who would have exhausted their \nunemployment benefits will rise to 58,000 in Michigan and 1.1 million \nnationally.\n  The unemployment insurance extension included in this economic \nstimulus package is essential. This extension will ensure that hard \nworking Americans have an additional 7 weeks as they continue to find \njobs. In high unemployment States like Michigan, these States will \nreceive an additional 13 weeks. We must ensure that those individuals \nwho have lost their jobs and are looking for work, during a time when \nindustries are losing jobs and the price of food and energy are rising, \nare not also struggling to put food on their table, pay their utility \nbills, and cover their mortgages.\n  With States facing billions of dollars in shortfalls in revenue \ncollection, they are forced to cut health care, education and other \nimportant programs that average people depend on. This bill will help \nStates facing shortfalls by providing $19.6 billion to reduce the \nState's share of Medicaid costs by increasing the Federal share by 4 \npercent.\n  The bill also includes $10.8 billion for building and repairing \nhighways, bridges, mass transit and airports. I have been calling for \nadditional infrastructure spending because infrastructure investment \ncreates jobs and promptly puts people to work. This type of investment \nstrengthens our economy and it gives us better roads and safer bridges.\n  President Bush had opposed providing infrastructure funding as an \neconomic stimulus claiming there is a lag time to get infrastructure \nprojects going and Federal funding could not be spent fast enough to \nspur the economy in the short term. But there are plenty of ready to go \nprojects in Michigan and other states that can put people to work right \naway.\n  Infrastructure spending for projects that are ready to begin \nconstruction could immediately create high-paying jobs in the short \nterm. Once built, the new infrastructure would enhance economic output \nover the long term. Investment in transportation, water and sewer \nprojects, navigational systems, and other public infrastructure \nprojects that are ready to go will create jobs and provide the means \nfor future economic growth. Specifically, Michigan has at least $263 \nmillion of transportation projects that could be started this year.\n  The Great Lakes navigational system also faces a backlog in \nconstruction and operations and maintenance projects. The Army Corps of \nEngineers estimates $62 million could be used this year to address the \nbacklog in dredging projects to help ensure that shipping--one of the \nlowest cost ways to transport supplies to industry and products to \ncustomers--is not impeded. The Economic Recovery Act includes $100 \nmillion for Army Corps of Engineers dredging projects to address this \nbacklog and to ensure that channels are dredged for energy shipments \nand other raw materials. Great Lakes coal trade for the year totals \nabout 24 million tons, fueling electric utilities and manufacturing \nplants. In total, Great Lakes vessels transport about 115 million tons \nof cargo each year, fueling our Nation's industries and manufacturing \nplants. This funding is critical for ensuring these shipments can \ncontinue to flow. The bill also would provide $600 million for the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's clean water State revolving fund, \nwhich provides funding to States for low-cost loans for sewer projects. \nThis money could be used immediately in Michigan, which has 20 sewer \nprojects that are ready-to-go, and could use $55 million this year.\n  I am pleased that the stimulus package contains a significant \nincrease in funding for the Department of Energy's weatherization \nassistance programs, providing an increase of $500 million over what is \nalready proposed to be included in the continuing resolution for fiscal \nyear 2009, providing a total of close to $1 billion for this program. \nThe Bush administration has consistently reduced funding for \nweatherization assistance in previous years and even proposed to \neliminate it completely this year. But instead of decimating the \nprogram as proposed by the administration, the stimulus package will \nmore than triple the current level of funding assistance provided by \nthe Federal Government and help to weatherize an additional 300,000 \nhomes and support more than 8,000 existing jobs.\n  This stimulus package also includes over $700 million to continue to \nhelp our Nation's homeowners and renters, many of whom are experiencing \nthe real impacts of this housing crisis first hand. The increased \nfunding to implement the recently-passed Housing and Economic Recovery \nAct, funding for legal assistance to families whose homes are in \nforeclosure, and housing assistance to renters who are being displaced \nby foreclosure included in this bill would provide much needed relief \nto those caught in the middle of this crisis. In addition, this bill \nwould provide additional funding to assist the FBI in their \ninvestigation of the rising claims of mortgage fraud throughout this \ncountry.\n  The cost of operating and maintaining public housing has been rising \nand public housing agencies need additional funding to address critical \nand urgent safety, security and energy-related needs. This bill \nincludes funding to address these needs that will prioritize \nrehabilitating vacant rental units in order to meet increasing demand \nfor affordable rental housing.\n  The stimulus package includes an additional $300 million for advanced \nbattery research and development and battery manufacturing. This \nfunding is critical if the U.S. is to develop the components needed for \nadvanced technology vehicles and if we are to remain competitive in the \nglobal marketplace. There is a strong push here and in other countries \nto develop a lithium ion battery suitable for vehicle applications at \naffordable cost. Significantly more Federal investment is required--as \nmuch as triple the amount being spent now--if we are to meet this \nchallenge in the U.S. Over time, Japan and other Asian governments have \ninvested significantly more money in battery technology and have \nsupported their manufacturers in bringing these technologies to the \nmarket. Most of these technologies were originally invented here, but \nthe manufacturing has been done overseas because these other countries \nmore vigorously support their manufacturing base. We need a similar \nstrong commitment in the U.S.--both in exploratory research and \ndevelopment and in development of advanced battery manufacturing \ncapabilities--to ensure that the next generation of technology is built \nhere in America. The additional $300 million included in the stimulus \nwill take a giant step in the right direction.\n  This legislation also includes valuable funding for law enforcement \nand border security. It includes $490 million for Byrne grants to \nsupport State and local police and $500 million for the COPS hiring \ngrant program, which will put 6,500 new officers on the street across \nthe country. Further, the bill includes $776 million for border \nconstruction at CBP-owned inspection facilities at land border ports of \nentry.\n  Mr. President, with the economic crisis on Wall Street looming before \nus Congress must act to help people on Main Street now more than ever. \nThe bill before us does this and I will vote for it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with the backdrop of gas prices soaring \nto new heights this past summer and the specter of sending a half a \ntrillion dollars to overseas to purchase oil from foreign regimes, I am \ntold that the majority leader seeks to reinstate a moratorium on final \nregulations for the commercialization of oil shale. Ironically he is \ndoing it on a bill that is being called a stimulus. Well, it certainly \nwon't stimulate domestic production of energy. If brought to fruition \nit will give the majority in the Senate the dubious distinction of \nbeing even more antiproduction than the majority in the House.\n  I have heard my friends on the other side say that they are not \nstanding in the way of oil shale, but at the same time, they are doing \nexactly that. In the next sentence, they argue that there is nothing \nabout oil shale that will bring relief to the American consumers. I \nfind it difficult to understand these statements, and so do a majority \nof Americans. Over the summer, the majority did everything it could to \nobstruct our efforts in increase domestic production. The majority \ncancelled an appropriations committee markup to avoid the issue of \ndrilling on the OCS\n\n[[Page S9576]]\n\nand developing Western oil shale. They prevented a real debate and a \nreal vote on energy. Finally, we saw a breakthrough from the House. \nAfter dodging the energy reality for months, they passed a continuing \nresolution without the moratorium on oil shale regulations and without \nthe moratorium on the OCS. This was a great development and not one we \nshould turn back by reimposing an oil shale ban.\n  Several recent polls inform us that a strong and growing majority of \nthe American people want to us to produce more of our own American \nenergy resources. The development of Western oil shale will not be upon \nus today, but an indefensible moratorium on regulations will ensure \nthat the development of oil shale will not be upon us tomorrow, either. \nAnd, therefore, relief for the American people will be delayed as well. \nLet me tell you what I know about oil shale, and the moratorium that \nthe other side supports.\n  Oil shale is a rock from which oil can be extracted through \ntechnologies such as in-situ heating and surface retorting. I have been \nout to Colorado and I have seen the vast commitments that private \nindustries are making to help make oil shale production a reality in \nthis country. But make no mistake about it--with this moratorium, the \nother side seeks to stand in the way of that progress.\n  The USGS estimates that there is a potential total of 2.1 trillion \nbarrels of resource in the Green River Basin of Colorado, Utah, and \nWyoming. The Strategic Unconventional Fuels Task Force and Rand \nCorporation have estimated that 800 billion barrels of oil equivalent \nis technically recoverable. This is enough to replace the amount of oil \nwe currently import at today's pace for more than 160 years. With oil \nprices above the $100 mark for a sustained period of time and with \ntechnologies advancing rapidly, the potential development of large \nquantities of oil shale is a reality. American companies stand ready to \ncontinue the necessary work, but a moratorium placed on oil shale casts \na large shadow of uncertainty. We must remove that shadow immediately.\n  In 2005, we passed the Energy Policy Act. Working across party lines \nin both the Senate and the House, Senator Bingaman and I brought \ntogether broad bipartisan support behind a conference report that each \nand every Senator from the Western oil shale States supported. In that \nbill we set up an oil shale pilot program with research and development \nleases. We also set forth a time frame for the development of final \nregulations for commercial leasing. This does not mean that commercial \nleasing would begin now, but what it does mean is that companies that \nneed to make long-term planning decisions on where to make significant \ncapital investments have a clear sense of rules of the road for future \nWestern oil shale leasing.\n\n  If these regulations were completed, companies could be provided with \ncertainty and stability. Recently, Chevron joined other companies who \nhave publicly called for the lifting of the moratorium on oil shale \nregulations. The final regulations would provide a road-map on \ndiligence requirements, royalty rates, conversion fees, and operating \nand environmental requirements such as reclamation requirements. Both \nprivate industry and localities would know the terms and conditions \nnecessary for this American energy project. That is why we included \nthis provision in the bipartisan 2005 Energy bill. Two years after that \nbill passed, along came an appropriations moratorium quietly written \ninto a large omnibus spending bill. In other words, Congress has \nprevented the Department of the Interior from doing the work necessary \nto make oil shale a reality. Shell Oil Company recently testified \nbefore the Senate Energy Committee that, ``the extension of this \nmoratorium on potential future development of America's vast oil shale \nresource may be intended to become permanent in nature. The extension \nof this moratorium may well have a chilling effect on our efforts to \ndevelop this resource in the future.'' I could not agree more with this \nassessment.\n  Additionally, the Department of the Interior recently testified that \nfinalizing oil shale regulations is a critical component to realize the \nvast potential of our Western oil shale resource. Assistant Secretary \nAllred stated that, ``absent the certainty that final regulations would \nbring, the commercial oil shale industry may not be willing to invest \nthe necessary dollars for research, and this vast domestic resource \nwill remain untapped at a time when our Nation is searching for ways to \nfurther its energy security.'' And recently Utah's Governor--a voice \nfrom on the ground--requested that Congress remove this moratorium, \nwriting, ``I recommend lifting those restrictions. Utah is home not \nonly to substantial oil shale reserves . . . but also to businesses \nwilling to develop oil shale using new technology that will make \nextraction cleaner and more efficient. We have State and Federal \nregulators who are capable of ensuring that this resource is developed \nin an environmentally responsible manner.'' So, despite this coalition \nof industry, local support, and a Federal agency eager to do the \nnecessary work, and now even the Speaker and the majority in the \nHouse--the majority in the Senate is asking us to stand in the way of \nthis progress.\n  For all of the above reasons, I introduced a bill in May that lifts \nthis unnecessary and harmful oil shale moratorium. We pushed and proded \nand pushed some more until the House majority listened to the American \npeople. Now, I am sending the same message to the Senate. Ending this \nmoratorium would send a message to the world that America is serious \nabout Western oil shale development. I urge my colleagues on the other \nside to reaffirm their bipartisan commitments made during the Energy \nbill of 2005 and help us join the House in removing the oil shale \nmoratorium. If we do that, we will take a step in the right direction \nof reducing our great dependence on foreign oil and we will strengthen \nour Nation's energy security.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the bill \noffered by Majority Leader Reid and Chairman Byrd. I commend them for \ntheir leadership during this economic crisis. This bill helps families \nwho are struggling with rising food and energy costs and it creates \njobs by investing in America's infrastructure. Simply put, this bill \nsays to the American people--your government is on your side and help \nis on the way.\n  We need this bill to show Americans whose side we are on. Americans \nare mad as hell. They have watched Wall Street executives pay \nthemselves lavish salaries, engage in irresponsible lending practices, \npractice casino economics and gamble on risky investment mechanisms. \nNow those very same Americans who've worked hard and played by the \nrules, who were prudent investors, prudent savers, and prudent citizens \nare asked to pay the bill for those who didn't.\n  Now, it is for these people that government must do something. It is \nfor these people that this bill is so important. We have to show them \nthat we are fighting for the middle class. Since we're about to shell \nout $700 billion to help Wall Street, we need to put government on the \nside of those who need it.\n  I agree with the President that Congress must act promptly in order \nto restore confidence to our markets. But there are still tough \nquestions to be asked. Congress will act with resolve but we will not \nbe a rubberstamp. The administration originally sent us a plan for a \nblank check. I say no blank checks and no checks without balances. I \nwill continue to work to put in the oversight and accountability into \nthis plan. This plan needs to work. I will fight for the middle class \nand for the people who play by the rules.\n  I am supporting the Reid-Byrd stimulus bill for three reasons. First, \nit provides a safety net for families. Second, the bill creates jobs in \nAmerica with infrastructure investments. Third, it fights price gouging \nand fraud.\n  The stimulus is a safety net for America's families. It is for \nfamilies who are struggling to pay for food, energy, and housing. It \nalso extends unemployment insurance up to 13 weeks in States with high \nunemployment. It increases Medicaid payments to States, so States with \nshortfalls can continue health care. It also helps the elderly pay \ntheir energy bills.\n  The stimulus makes important investments in America's physical \ninfrastructure, which will create jobs. Specifically, it provides: $8 \nbillion to build\n\n[[Page S9577]]\n\nand repair bridges and highways; $2 billion for mass transit systems, \nincluding important work to improve and expand bus, subway, and light-\nrail services; and $350 million for AMTRAK to help repair tracks and \ntunnels. These transportation infrastructure investments will create \n384,000 jobs. The bill also provides $600 million for water and sewer \ngrants to fix aging sewer systems; helps take burden off ratepayers and \nprotects public health and the environment. These investments will \ncreate 24,000 jobs.\n  The stimulus fights price gouging and fraud on American taxpayers. \nThe foreclosure crisis is ruining lives and ruining neighborhoods. The \nFBI Director told the CJS Subcommittee that mortgage fraud \ninvestigations are growing rapidly. The Reid-Byrd stimulus provides $5 \nmillion to increase the FBI's investigations of mortgage fraud, which \nwill allow the FBI to add at least 20 agents and support staff to keep \nup with the rising caseload. And the stimulus includes $13.1 million \nfor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for increased oversight of \ncommodity, energy, and food pricing.\n  As chairwoman of the Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee, I am \npleased this bill includes important funding to make America's \ncommunities safer and stronger. This bill makes America's neighborhoods \nsafer; safer communities are stronger communities. The bill provides \n$490 million for Byrne grants, which is the main Federal grant program \nthat helps State and local law enforcement pay for police training, \nantidrug task forces and equipment like radios and computers. \nSpecifically, this funding will help keep over 6,000 cops on the beat \nin our local communities and install almost 45,000 mobile laptops in \npolice vehicles. The 2008 Omnibus provided just $170 million for Byrne \ngrants because the President threatened to veto the CJS bill. The $490 \nmillion in the Reid-Byrd bill will result in a final 2008 Byrne grant \namount of $660 million. This is the level in the Senate passed 2008 CJS \nbill. The Reid-Byrd bill also includes $500 million for the COPS hiring \nprogram, the competitive grant program that pays for new cops on the \nbeat. This funding will put 6,500 new cops on the street in \nneighborhoods around the Nation. This is the first time since 2005 that \nthe COPS hiring program would receive substantial dedicated funds to \nhelp communities hire new police. I'm so pleased the Reid-Byrd stimulus \nbill includes $50 million to enforce the Adam Walsh Child Protection \nAct. This funding will enable the U.S. Marshals to hire 150 new deputy \nmarshals devoted to apprehending fugitive sex offenders who prey on our \nchildren.\n  In the area of science and innovation, I'm pleased the bill includes \n$250 million for NASA to help shorten the 5-year gap in time between \nthe Space Shuttle's retirement in 2010 and the availability of our new \nvehicle in 2015. During this 5-year gap, the only way U.S. astronauts \nwill be able to go into space is aboard Russian vehicles. The United \nStates of America must remain a leader in science, innovation and space \nexploration. The Reid-Byrd bill helps close our gap in space access.\n  The Reid-Byrd bill tells those who are struggling that help is on the \nway and that your government is on your side. The bill makes important \ninvestments in our infrastructure and creates jobs. It makes our \ncommunities and our Nation safer and stronger. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Reid-Byrd stimulus bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership permitting me \nto comment on the schedule for consideration of the Appropriations \nbills before the vote on the stimulus bill. It is unfortunate that the \ncontinuing resolution comes in the form it does to the Senate. What \nthis bill actually contains is the fiscal year 2009 Homeland Security \nAppropriations bill as well as the Defense appropriations bill, and the \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. It also \ncontains a continuing resolution to fund the rest of the Government \nthrough March 6, and a substantial disaster supplemental in response to \nfloods, wildfires, and hurricanes.\n  There was no opportunity for the Senate to carefully review all of \nthis bill in the time that is being allotted for its consideration this \nmorning, there was no opportunity for most Members--whether they were \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee or otherwise--to advocate for \nspecific requests, no forum for offering amendments, no meetings in \nwhich to argue policy or air grievances, there was no meeting of a \nconference committee.\n  A few elements of the bill have been previously considered, but only \na few, by the Senate. Only the Military Construction and Veterans \nAffairs chapter was debated on the floor of the other body. The regular \norder has been thrown out the window and we have failed to give the \nSenate and the people we represent an opportunity to know exactly what \nwe are about to do. Not one of the individual appropriations bills has \nbeen brought to the Senate floor. But in spite of that, we have to \nappropriate the money, we have to vote in support of an appropriations \nbill. I rest my case. I hope we can do better in the future than we \nhave done in this cycle.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \nmotion to proceed to S. 3604.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The motion to proceed to S. 3297 is pending.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understood we were in a position to move \nforward on the IP bill, plus a number of judges who are on the \ncalendar. As Members know, in a rather extraordinary fashion, I \nexpedited the consideration of 10 judges, notwithstanding\n\n[[Page S9578]]\n\nthe Thurmond rule and the late date and had gotten support from my side \nfor not holding them over the normal time. I had understood we had an \nagreement to move forward on the IP bill, plus four or five of these \njudges this morning. That seems to be somewhat in doubt. According to \nthe House, the IP bill has to go over now. All these matters, I \nsuppose, we could bring them up next year, but I would rather get them \ndone this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Before there is a request propounded, I think it would be \nuseful to have a conversation. I think it ought to be possible for us \nto work out all of these; that is to say, judges and the IP bill. We \nneed a little more conversation in order to do so. I am personally \nready to do it right now if the chairman is willing.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am going to momentarily suggest the \nabsence of a quorum. We are into about a 5-minute window to work it \nout. I respect the rights of all Senators. The suggestion that the IP \nwait until next year, it is strongly supported by the Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, about every \nRepublican group there is. We had worked that out and included things \nthat Republican Senators wanted. As a practical matter, though, if it \nhas to wait any longer, we can assume it is dead. I assume I will still \nbe chairman of the Judiciary Committee next year. I am perfectly happy \nto bring up all these judges and IP enforcement next year, if that is \nwhat my friends on the other side wish.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I do not wish to interfere with the \nnegotiations going on and the potential of an agreement being reached \non the judges and the other things that are being discussed, but I do \nhave about 15 minutes on the current situation in the markets, and I \nwould like to speak on that. So I would be more than happy to wait for \nthem to finish their negotiations or go ahead and speak as though in \nmorning business, depending on the ruling of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator from \nKentucky proceeding for up to 15 minutes as in morning business?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                         Federal Reserve Policy\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak about the current economic situation \nand the bailout bill that will soon be coming to the floor of the \nSenate. Let me start by saying I am as concerned about what is going on \nin the financial markets and the economy as everyone else. I know there \nare extreme tensions in the credit markets, and those problems could \nsoon have an impact on businesses and individuals who had nothing to do \nwith the mortgage mess. However, I do not agree that the bill we have \nbeen discussing, and would probably come to the floor of the Senate, \nwill fix those problems.\n  I also strongly disagree with the Senators who have come to the floor \nand declared that this crisis is a failure of the free markets. No. The \nroot of the crisis is the failure of Government. It comes from a \nfailure of regulation and, most importantly, monetary policy. In the \nlong term, we certainly need to update our financial regulations to \nreflect the realities of our modern economic system. But it is just \nplain wrong to blame failures of our regulations and regulators on the \nmarkets.\n  A little history is in order. Our financial regulations are based on \nstructures put in place during the Great Depression. Our laws simply do \nnot reflect the current landscape of the financial markets. Once upon a \ntime, banks may have been the only instruments that were a danger to \nthe entire financial system, but it is now clear that other \ninstitutions are now so big and connected that we cannot ignore them in \nthe future. Also, many of today's common financial instruments did not \neven exist 20 years ago, much less when our laws were written.\n  But our regulatory structure is not the only problem. The real fuel \non the fire of this crisis has been the monetary policy of the Federal \nReserve. I have been a vocal critic of the Fed for many years and have \nbeen warning that their policies would hurt Americans in the short and \nlong run. For most of these years, I did not have much company. But I \nam glad many economists and commentators have recently joined me in my \ncriticism of the Fed.\n  During the second half of his time as Fed Chief, former Chairman Alan \nGreenspan tried to micromanage the economy with monetary policy. Any \neconomy is going to have its ups and downs, and it was foolish to try \nto stop that. But Chairman Greenspan did it anyway. By trying to smooth \nout those bumps, he overshot to the high and low sides, creating \nbubbles and then recessions.\n  I have spoken many times on the floor about the Fed policies that led \nto the housing bubble, but a few parts are worth repeating. Everyone \nremembers the dot-com bubble, which itself was partly a result of the \neasy money pumped into the system by the Fed in the late 1990s. Well, \nChairman Greenspan set out to pop that bubble and kept raising interest \nrates in the face of a slowdown, driving the economy into recession.\n  In order to undo the problems created by his tight money, he then \novershot the other way, taking interest rates as low as 1 percent for a \nyear and below 2 percent for nearly 3 years. In turn, that easy money \nignited the housing market by bringing mortgage interest rates to \nalltime lows. Low-cost borrowing encouraged excessive risk taking in \nthe financial markets and led investors to pump borrowed funds into all \nkinds of investments, including the various mortgage lending vehicles.\n  In 2004, Mr. Greenspan encouraged borrowers to get adjustable rate \nmortgages because of all the money they would save. Four months later, \nhe started a series of 17 interest rate increases that helped make \nthose mortgages unaffordable for the hundreds of thousands of borrowers \nwho listened to his advice. I warned him about that advice the \nfollowing day after his speech, but that warning fell on deaf ears.\n  Then, in 2005, rising interest rates and housing price appreciation \novercame the ability of borrowers to afford the house they wanted. To \nkeep the party going, borrowers, lenders, investors, rating agencies, \nand everyone else involved lowered their standards and kept mortgages \nflowing to less creditworthy borrowers who were buying evermore \nexpensive homes.\n  Chairman Greenspan also let investors and homeowners down by failing \nto police the banks and other lenders as they wrote even more risky \nmortgages. Regulated banks were allowed to keep most of their risky \nassets off their balance sheets. Even worse, he refused to use the \npower Congress gave the Federal Reserve in the Home Ownership and \nEquity Protection Act of 1994 to oversee all lenders, even those not \naffiliated with banks. His refusal to rein in the worst lending \npractices allowed banks and others, including Freddie Mac and Fannie \nMae, to write the loans that are now at the center of our mortgage \ncrisis. Chairman Ben Bernanke issued rules under that law in July of \n2008--14 years later--but that was far too late to solve the problem.\n  Before turning to the coming legislation, I wish to mention a few \nmore failures of Government that directly contributed to this mess. \nFederal regulations require the use of ratings from rating agencies \nthat have proven to be wrong on the biggest financial failures of the \nlast decade. The Community Reinvestment Act forced banks to make loans \nthey would not otherwise make based on the credit history of the \nborrower. The Securities and Exchange Commission, under former Chairman \nDonaldson, failed to establish meaningful oversight and leverage \nrestrictions for investment banks.\n  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac used the implied backing of the Government \nto grow so large that their takeover by the Government effectively \ndoubled the national debt. They were pushed by their executives and the \nClinton administration to loosen their lending standards and write the \nloans that drove the companies to the point of being bailed out by the \ntaxpayers.\n\n[[Page S9579]]\n\n  Finally, the same individuals who have come to this building to ask \nfor the latest bailout set the stage for the very panic they are using \nto justify the bailout. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Fed \nChairman set expectations for Government intervention when they bailed \nout Bear Stearns in March. The markets operated all summer with the \nbelief that the Government would step in and rescue failing firms. Then \nthey let Lehman Brothers fail, and the markets had to adjust to the \nidea that Wall Street would have to take the losses for Wall Street's \nbad decisions, not the taxpayers. That new uncertainty could be the \nmost significant contributing factor to why the markets panicked last \nweek. What is more, the panic today is a result of the high \nexpectations set last week when the Secretary and Chairman announced \ntheir plan. When resistance in Congress and the public outrage over the \nplan became clear, the markets walked back to the edge of panic.\n\n\n                            Bailout Proposal\n\n  Now I wish to talk about the bailout bill that we expect to have on \nthe floor of the Senate soon. The Paulson proposal is an attempt to do \nwhat we so often do in Washington, DC--throw money at the problem. We \ncannot make bad mortgages go away. We cannot make the losses that our \nfinancial institutions are facing go away. Someone must take those \nlosses. We can either let the people who made the bad decisions bear \nthe consequences of their actions or we can spread the pain to others. \nThat is exactly what Secretary Paulson proposes to do: take Wall \nStreet's pain and spread it to Main Street, the taxpayers.\n  We all know it is not fair to taxpayers to pick up Wall Street's tab. \nBut what we do not know is if this plan could even work. All we have is \nthe word of the Treasury Secretary and the Fed Chairman. But they have \nbeen wrong throughout this whole housing mess. They have previously \ntold us that subprime problems would not spread and the economy was \nstrong. Now they say we are on the edge of a severe recession or maybe \nthe second-largest depression in the history of this great Republic.\n  Well, I am not buying it, and neither are many of our Nation's \nleading economists. If some sort of Government intervention is needed \nto fix the mess created by the Government failure I talked about \nearlier, we need to get it right. Congress owes it to the American \npeople to slow down and think this through. We need to know that \nwhatever we do is going to fix the problem, protect the taxpayers, not \nreward those who made bad decisions, and make sure this does not happen \nagain. But we cannot do that in 1 week as we are all trying to rush \nhome. Congress needs to take this seriously and stay until we find the \nright solution, not just throw $700 billion at Wall Street as we walk \nout the door.\n  Now, Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the two letters I mentioned from economists opposing the bill, \nalong with an article from the New York Times from 1999 about the \nClinton administration pushing Fannie and Freddie into risky loans, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       To the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the \n     President pro tempore of the Senate:\n       As economists, we want to express to Congress our great \n     concern for the plan proposed by Treasury Secretary Paulson \n     to deal with the financial crisis. We are well aware ofthe \n     difficulty of the current financial situation and we agree \n     with the need for bold action to ensure that the financial \n     system continues to function. We see three fatal pitfalls in \n     the currently proposed plan:\n       (1) Its fairness. The plan is a subsidy to investors at \n     taxpayers' expense. Investors who took risks to earn profits \n     must also bear the losses. Not every business failure carries \n     systemic risk. The government can ensure a well-functioning \n     financial industry, able to make new loans to creditworthy \n     borrowers, without bailing out particular investors and \n     institutions whose choices proved unwise.\n       (2) Its ambiguity. Neither the mission of the new agency \n     nor its oversight are clear. If taxpayers are to buy illiquid \n     and opaque assets from troubled sellers, the terms, \n     occasions, and methods of such purchases must be crystal \n     clear ahead of time and carefully monitored afterwards.\n       (3) Its long-term effects. If the plan is enacted, its \n     effects will be with us for a generation. For all their \n     recent troubles, America's dynamic and innovative private \n     capital markets have brought the nation unparalleled \n     prosperity. Fundamentally weakening those markets in order to \n     calm short-run disruptions is desperately short-sighted.\n       For these reasons we ask Congress not to rush, to hold \n     appropriate hearings, arid to carefully consider the right \n     course of action, and to wisely determine the future of the \n     financial industry and the U.S. economy for years to come.\n       Signed:\n         Acemoglu, Daron (Massachussets Institute of Technology); \n           Adler, Michael (Columbia University); Admati, Anat R. \n           (Stanford University); Alexis, Marcus (Northwestern \n           University); Alvarez, Fernando (University of Chicago); \n           Andersen, Torben (Northwestern University); Baliga, \n           Sandeep (Northwestern University); Banerjee, Abhijit V. \n           (Massachussets Institute of Technology); Barankay, Iwan \n           (University of Pennsylvania); Barry, Brian (University \n           of Chicago); Bartkus, James R.

Granting the Treasury broad authority to purchase \n     troubled assets from private entities poses a significant \n     threat to taxpayers while failing to address fundamental \n     problems that have created a bloated, over-leveraged \n     financial services sector.\n       Such a large government intervention would create changes \n     whose effects will linger long into the future. The Treasury \n     plan would fundamentally alter the workings of the market, \n     transferring the burden of risk to the taxpayer. At the same \n     time; the $700 billion proposal does not offer fundamental \n     reforms required to avoid a repeat of the current problem. \n     Many of the troubles in today's market are the result of past \n     government policies (especially in the housing sector) \n     exacerbated by loose monetary policy. Congress has been \n     reluctant to reform the government sponsored enterprises that \n     lie at the heart of today's troubled markets, and there is \n     little to suggest the necessary reforms will be implemented \n     in the wake of a bailout. Taxpayers should be wary of such an \n     approach.\n       In addition to the moral hazard inherent in the proposal, \n     the plan makes it difficult to move resources to more highly \n     valued uses. Successful firms that may have been in a \n     position to acquire troubled firms would no longer have a \n     market advantage allowing them to do so; instead, entities \n     that were struggling would now be shored up and competing on \n     equal footing with their more efficient competitors.\n       Although it is clear that the financial sector has entered \n     turbulent times, it is by no means evident that providing the \n     U.S. Treasury with $700 billion to purchase troubled assets \n     will resolve the crisis. It is clear, however, that the \n     federal government will be facing substantially higher \n     deficits and taxpayers will be exposed to a significant new \n     burden just as the looming crisis in entitlement spending \n     appears on the horizon.\n       For these reasons, we find the proposed $700 billion \n     bailout an improper response to the current financial crisis.\n           Sincerely,\n         Dick Armey, FreedomWorks Foundation; Wayne Brough, \n           FreedomWorks Foundation; Alan C.

Holmes)\n\n       In a move that could help increase home ownership rates \n     among minorities and low-income consumers, the Fannie Mae \n     Corporation is easing the credit requirements on loans that \n     it will purchase from banks and other lenders.\n       The action, which will begin as a pilot program involving \n     24 banks in 15 markets--including the New York metropolitan \n     region--will encourage those banks to extend home mortgages \n     to individuals whose credit is generally not good enough to \n     qualify for conventional loans. Fannie Mae officials say they \n     hope to make it a nationwide program by next spring.\n       Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home \n     mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the \n     Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and \n     moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders \n     to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\n       In addition, banks, thrift institutions and mortgage \n     companies have been pressing Fannie Mae to help them make \n     more loans to so-called subprime borrowers. These borrowers \n     whose incomes, credit ratings and savings are not good enough \n     to qualify for conventional loans, can only get loans from \n     finance companies that charge much higher interest rates--\n     anywhere from three to four percentage points higher than \n     conventional loans.\n       ``Fannie Mae has expanded home ownership for millions of \n     families in the 1990's by reducing down payment \n     requirements,'' said Franklin D. Raines, Fannie Mae's \n     chairman and chief executive officer. ``Yet there remain too \n     many borrowers whose credit is just a notch below what our \n     underwriting has required who have been relegated to paying \n     significantly higher mortgage rates in the so-called subprime \n     market.''\n       Demographic information on these borrowers is sketchy. But \n     at least one study indicates that 18 percent of the loans in \n     the\n\n[[Page S9581]]\n\n     subprime market went to black borrowers, compared to 5 per \n     cent of loans in the conventional loan market.\n       In moving, even tentatively, into this new area of lending, \n     Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk, which may \n     not pose any difficulties during flush economic times. But \n     the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in \n     an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar \n     to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980's.\n       ``From the perspective of many people, including me, this \n     is another thrift industry growing up around us,'' said Peter \n     Wallison a resident fellow at the American Enterprise \n     Institute. ``If they fail, the government will have to step \n     up and bail them out the way it stepped up and bailed out the \n     thrift industry.''\n       Under Fannie Mae's pilot program, consumers who qualify can \n     secure a mortgage with an interest rate one percentage point \n     above that of a conventional, 30-year fixed rate mortgage of \n     less than $240,000--a rate that currently averages about 7.76 \n     per cent. If the borrower makes his or her monthly payments \n     on time for two years, the one percentage point premium is \n     dropped.\n       Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home \n     mortgages, does not lend money directly to consumers. \n     Instead, it purchases loans that banks make on what is called \n     the secondary market. By expanding the type of loans that it \n     will buy, Fannie Mae is hoping to spur banks to make more \n     loans to people with less-than-stellar credit ratings.\n       Fannie Mae officials stress that the new mortgages will be \n     extended to all potential borrowers who can qualify for a \n     mortgage. But they add that the move is intended in part to \n     increase the number of minority and low income home owners \n     who tend to have worse credit ratings than non-Hispanic \n     whites.\n       Home ownership has, in fact, exploded among minorities \n     during the economic boom of the 1990's. The number of \n     mortgages extended to Hispanic applicants jumped by 87.2 per \n     cent from 1993 to 1998, according to Harvard University's \n     Joint Center for Housing Studies. During that same period the \n     number of African Americans who got mortgages to buy a home \n     increased by 71.9 per cent and the number of Asian Americans \n     by 46.3 per cent.\n       In contrast, the number of non-Hispanic whites who received \n     loans for homes increased by 31.2 per cent.\n       Despite these gains, home ownership rates for minorities \n     continue to lag behind non-Hispanic whites, in part because \n     blacks and Hispanics in particular tend to have on average \n     worse credit ratings.\n       In July, the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n     proposed that by the year 2001,50 percent of Fannie Mae's and \n     Freddie Mac's portfolio be made up of loans to low and \n     moderate-income borrowers. Last year, 44 percent of the loans \n     Fannie Mae purchased were from these groups.\n       The change in policy also comes at the same time that HUD \n     is investigating allegations of racial discrimination in the \n     automated underwriting systems used by Fannie Mae and Freddie \n     Mac to determine the credit-worthiness of credit applicants.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe I am next in line to make \nremarks as in morning business, and I wish to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n\n\n                            Financial Crisis\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, to date I have received from \nCalifornians more than 50,000 calls and letters, the great bulk of them \nin opposition to any form of meeting this crisis with financial help \nfrom the Federal Government. I wanted to come to the floor to very \nsimply state how I see this and some of the principles that I hope will \nbe forthcoming in this draft. Before I do so, I wish to pay particular \ncommendation to Senator Dodd, Senator Schumer, Senator Bennett, and \nothers who have been working so hard on this issue. I have tried to \nkeep in touch--I am not a negotiator; I am not on the committee--but \nCalifornia is the biggest State, the largest economic engine, and \npeople are really concerned.\n  We face the most significant economic crisis in 75 years right now. \nSwift and comprehensive action is crucial to the overall health of our \neconomy. None of us wants to be in this position, and there are no good \noptions here. Nobody likes the idea of spending massive sums of \nGovernment money to rescue major corporations from their bad financial \ndecisions. But no one also should be fooled into thinking this problem \nonly belongs to the banks and that it is a good idea to let them fail. \nThe pain felt by Wall Street one day is felt there, and then 2, 3, 4 \nweeks down the pike, it is felt on Main Street.\n  The turbulence in our financial sector has already resulted in \nthousands of layoffs in the banking and finance sectors, and that \nnumber will skyrocket if there is a full collapse. The shock waves of \nfailure will extend far beyond the banking and finance sectors. A \nshrinking pool of credit would affect the home loans, credit card \nlimits, auto loans, and insurance policies of average Americans. I am \nreceiving calls from people who tell me they want to buy a house, but \nthey can't get the credit or the mortgage to do so. Why? Because that \nmarket of credit is drying up more rapidly one day after the other. It \nwould have a major impact on State and local governments which would \nlose tens of millions of dollars, if not hundreds of millions of \ndollars.\n  Hurricane Ike shut down refineries on the gulf coast 2 weeks ago, and \nnow, today, people are waiting hours in lines for gasoline in the \nSouth. Similarly, the collapse of the financial sector would have \nsevere consequences for Americans all across the economic spectrum: for \nthe person who owns the grocery store, the laundry, the bank, the \ninsurance company. Then, if the worst happens, layoffs. And even more \nthan that, somebody shows up for work and finds their business has \nclosed because the owner of that business can't get credit to buy the \ngoods he hopes to sell that week or that month. Wages and employment \nrates have already fallen even as the cost of basic necessities has \nskyrocketed. Our Nation is facing the highest unemployment rate in 5 \nyears, at 6.1 percent. Over 605,000 jobs have been lost nationwide this \nyear. My own State of California, a state of 38 million people, has the \nthird highest unemployment rate in the Nation at 7.7 percent. That is \n1.4 million people out of work today. One and a half million people--\nthat is bigger than some States. We have 1.5 million people out of \nwork, and one-half million have had their unemployment insurance expire \nand have nothing today.\n  Congress is faced with a situation where we have to act and we have \nto do two things. We have to provide some reform in the system of \nregulation and oversight that is supposed to protect our economy. We \nalso have to find a permanent and effective solution to keep liquidity \nand credit functioning so that markets can recover and make profit. The \nsituation, I believe, is grave, and timely, prudent action is needed.\n  Just last night, the sixth largest bank in America--Washington \nMutual--was seized by government regulators and most of its assets will \nbe sold to JPMorgan Chase. This follows on the heels of bankruptcies \nand takeovers of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, Fannie Mae, and \nFreddie Mac. If nothing is done, the crisis will continue to spread and \none by one the dominos will fall.\n  Now, this isn't just about Wall Street. Because we are this credit \nsociety, the financial troubles facing major economic institutions will \nricochet throughout this Nation and affect everyone. So I believe the \nneed for action is clear. But that doesn't mean Congress should simply \nbe a rubberstamp for an unprecedented and unbridled program.\n  My constituents by the thousands have made their views clear. I \nbelieve they are responding to the original 3-page proposal by the \nSecretary of the Treasury. It is clear by now that that 3-page proposal \nis a nonstarter. It is dead on arrival and that is good. Secretary \nPaulson's proposal asked Congress to write a $700 billion check to an \neconomic czar who would have been empowered to spend it without any \nadministrative oversight, legal requirements, or legislative review. \nDecisions made by the Treasury Secretary would be nonreviewable by any \ncourt or agency, and the fate of our entire economy would be committed \nto the sole discretion of one man alone--the man we know today, and the \nman whom we don't know after January.\n  Additionally, the lack of governance or oversight in this plan was \nmatched by the lack of a requirement for regular reports to Congress. \nThis proposal stipulated that the economic czar, newly created, would \nreport to Congress after the first three months with reports once every \n6 months after that. This was untenable. Six months is an\n\n[[Page S9582]]\n\neternity when you are spending billions a week. The Treasury Secretary \nasked Congress to approve this massive program without delay or \ninterference. It is hard to think of any other time in our history when \nCongress has been asked for so much money and so much power to be \nconcentrated in the hands of one person. It is a nonstarter.\n  Yesterday, shortly before we met for the Democratic Policy Committee \nlunch, we were told there had been a bipartisan agreement on principles \nof a possible solution, and many of us rejoiced. We know that our \nMembers, both Republican and Democrat, have been working hard to try to \nproduce something that was positive. Then, all of a sudden, it changed. \nOne Presidential candidate parachuted into town which proved to be \nenormously destructive to the process. Now, negotiations are back on \nthe table, and as I say, we have just received a draft bill of certain \nprinciples.\n  I would like to outline quickly those principles that I think are \nimportant. First is a phase-in. No one wants to put $700 billion \nimmediately at the discretion of one person or even a group of a very \nfew people, no matter how bright, how skilled, how informed they might \nbe on banking or finance principles. The funding should come in phases \nand Congress should have the opportunity to make its voice heard if the \nprogram isn't working or needs to be adjusted.\n  The second point: Oversight, accountability, and governance. The \nTreasury Secretary should not and must not have unbridled authority to \ndetermine winners and losers, essentially choosing which struggling \nfinancial institution will survive and which will not. The original \nplan placed all authority in the hands of this one man, and this is why \nI say it was DOA--dead on arrival--at the Congress. We must assure that \ncontrols are in place to watch taxpayer dollars and make sure they are \nwell-spent fixing the problem, and that oversight by a governance \ncommittee and the Banking Committees are strong, and that they give the \nbest opportunity for the American people to recover their investment \nand, yes, even eventually make a profit from that investment. That can \nbe done and it has been done in the past.\n  I believe that frequent reporting to Congress is critical. \nTransparency, sunlight on this, is critical. So Congress should receive \nregular, timely briefings, perhaps weekly for the first quarter, on a \nprogram of this magnitude. A proposal should mandate frequent reporting \nand the public should be ensured of transparency to the maximum extent \npossible.\n\n  I also believe that within the first quarter--and this, to me, is \nkey--a comprehensive legislative proposal for reform must be put \nforward. We must reform those speculative practices that impact price \nfunction of markets. We must deal with the unregulated practices that \nhave furthered this crisis. Look. I represent a State that was cost $40 \nbillion in the Enron episode during 1999 and 2000 by speculation, by \nmanipulation, and by fraud. There still is inadequate regulation of \nenergy commodities sold on the futures market. And that is just one \npoint in all of this. We must prevent these things from happening. The \nonly way to do it is to improve the transparency of all markets. No \nhidden deals. Swaps, in my view, should be ended. The London loophole \nshould be ended.\n  We have to outline rules for increasing regulation of the mortgage-\nbacked securities market, along with comprehensive oversight of the \nmortgage industry and lending practices for both prime and subprime \nlending.\n  Senator Martinez of Florida and I had a part in the earlier housing \nbill, which included our legislation entitled the SAFE Mortgage \nLicensing Act. We found that the market was rife with fraud. We found \nthere was one company that hired hairdressers and others who sold \nmortgages in their spare time. We found there were unscrupulous \nmortgage brokers out there unlicensed, preying upon people, walking off \nwith tens of thousands of dollars of cash. This has to end. It has to \nbe controlled. It has to be regulated.\n  So I believe the crisis of 2008 stems from the failure of Federal \nregulators to rein in this Wild West mentality of those Wall Street \nexecutives who led those firms and who thought that nothing was out of \nbounds. Every quick scheme was worth the time, and worth a try. \nCongress cannot ignore this as the root cause of the crisis. It was \ninherent in the subprime marketplace, and it has now spread to the \nprime mortgage marketplace.\n  It is also critical that accurate assessments of the value of these \nilliquid mortgage-related assets be performed to limit the taxpayers' \nexposure to risk and structure purchases to ensure the greatest \npossible return on investment.\n  Taxpayer money must be shielded at all costs from risk to the \ngreatest extent possible.\n  Reciprocity is not a bad concept if you can carry it out. The \nGovernment must not simply act as a repository for risky investments \nthat have gone bad. An economic rescue effort that serves taxpayers \nwell must allow them to benefit from the potential profits of rescued \nentities. So a model--and it may well be in these new principles--must \nbe developed to ensure the taxpayers are not only the first paid back \nbut have an opportunity to share in future profits through warrants \nand/or stocks.\n  As to executive compensation limits, simply put, Californians are \nfrosted by the absence of controls on executive compensation. Virtually \nall of the 50,000 phone calls and letters mentioned this one way or \nanother. There must be limits. I am told that the reason the Treasury \nSecretary does not want limits on executive compensation is because he \nbelieves that an executive then will not bring his company in to \npartake in any program that is set up. Here is my response to that: We \ncan put that executive on his boat, take that boat out in the ocean, \nand set it on fire. If that is how he feels, that is what should \nhappen, or his company doesn't come in. But to say that the Federal \nGovernment is going to be responsible for tens of millions of dollars \nof executive salaries, golden parachutes, whether they are a matter of \ncontract right or not, is not acceptable to the average person whose \ntaxpayer dollars are used in this bailout. That is just fact.\n  The one proposal that was made by one of the Presidential candidates \nthat I agree with is that there should be a limit of $400,000 on \nexecutive compensation. If they don't like it, too bad, don't \nparticipate in the program. As I have talked with people on Wall Street \nand otherwise, they don't believe it is true that an executive, if his \npay is tailored down, will not bring a company in that needs help. I \nhope that is true. I believe there should be precise limits set on \nexecutive pay.\n  Finally, as to tangible benefits for Main Street in the form of \nmortgage relief, there have been more than 500,000 foreclosures in my \nhome State of California so far this year. In the second quarter of \nthis year, foreclosures were up 300 percent over the second quarter of \n2007. More than 800,000 are predicted before this year is over.\n  I have a city in California where 1 out of every 25 homes is in \nforeclosure. This is new housing in subdivisions. As you look at it, \nyou will see garage doors kicked in. You will see houses vandalized. \nYou will see the grass and grounds dry. You will see the street \nsprinkled with ``For Sale'' signs, and nobody buys because the market \nhas become so depressed.\n  This crisis has roots in the subprime housing boom that went bust, \nand it would be unconscionable for us to simply bail out Wall Street \nwhile leaving these homeowners to fend for themselves.\n  Everything I have been told, and I have talked to people in this \nbusiness, here is what they tell me: It is more cost-effective to \nrenegotiate a subprime loan and keep a family in a house than it is to \nforeclose and run the risks of what happens to that home on a depressed \nmarket as credit is drying up, as vandals loot it, as landscaping dries \nup, as more homes in the area become foreclosed upon; the way to go is \nto renegotiate these mortgages with the exiting homeowner wherever \npossible. I feel very strongly that should be the case.\n  I don't know what I or any of us will do if we authorize this kind of \nexpenditure and we find down the pike in my State that the rest of the \nyear, 800,000 to 1 million Americans are being thrown out of their \nhomes despite this form of rescue effort. Think of what it means, Mr. \nPresident, in your State. You vote for this, any other Senator\n\n[[Page S9583]]\n\nvotes for it, and these foreclosures continue to take place and \nindividual families continue to be thrown out of their homes. It is not \na tenable situation.\n  I hope, if anybody is listening at all, that in the negotiating team, \nthey will make a real effort to mandate in some way that subprime \nforeclosures be renegotiated, that families, wherever possible, who \nhave an ability to pay, have that ability to pay met with a \nrenegotiated loan. I have done this now in cases with families who were \ntaken advantage of. We called the CEO of the bank, and the bank has \nseen that the loan was renegotiated, in one case in Los Angeles down to \n2 percent. That is better than foreclosing and running the uncertainty \nof the sale of the asset in a very depressed housing market.\n  These are my thoughts. Again, it is easy to come to the floor and \ngive your thoughts. It is much more difficult to sit at that \nnegotiating table.\n  I once again thank those Senators on both sides of the aisle who \nreally understand the nature of this crisis--that it isn't only Wall \nStreet, that it does involve Main Street, and if there is a serious \ncrash, it will hurt tens of millions of Americans, many of them in \nirreparable ways. So we must do what we must do, and we must do it \nprudently and carefully.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GAO STUDY ON PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF \n                   MANUFACTURERS.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the Untied States \n     shall conduct a study to help determine how the Federal \n     Government could better protect the intellectual property of \n     manufacturers by quantification of the impacts of imported \n     and domestic counterfeit goods on--\n       (1) the manufacturing industry in the United States; and\n       (2) the overall economy of the United States.\n       (b) Contents.--In conducting the study required under \n     subsection (a), the Comptroller General shall examine--\n       (1) the extent that counterfeit manufactured goods are \n     actively being trafficked in and imported into the United \n     States;\n       (2) the impacts on domestic manufacturers in the United \n     States of current law regarding defending intellectual \n     property, including patent, trademark, and copyright \n     protections;\n       (3) the nature and scope of current statutory law and case \n     law regarding protecting trade dress from being illegally \n     copied;\n       (4) the extent which such laws are being used to \n     investigate and prosecute acts of trafficking in counterfeit \n     manufactured goods;\n       (5) any effective practices or procedures that are \n     protecting all types of intellectual property; and\n       (6) any changes to current statutes or rules that would \n     need to be implemented to more effectively protect the \n     intellectual property rights of manufacturers.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit \n     to Congress a report on the results of the study required \n     under subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 602. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States intellectual property industries have \n     created millions of high-skill, high-paying United States \n     jobs and pay billions of dollars in annual United States tax \n     revenues;\n       (2) the United States intellectual property industries \n     continue to represent a major source of creativity and \n     innovation, business start-ups, skilled job creation, \n     exports, economic growth, and competitiveness;\n       (3) counterfeiting and infringement results in billions of \n     dollars in lost revenue for United States companies each year \n     and even greater losses to the United States economy in terms \n     of reduced job growth, exports, and competitiveness;\n       (4) the growing number of willful violations of existing \n     Federal criminal laws involving counterfeiting and \n     infringement by actors in the United States and, \n     increasingly, by foreign-based individuals and entities is a \n     serious threat to the long-term vitality of the United States \n     economy and the future competitiveness of United States \n     industry;\n       (5) effective criminal enforcement of the intellectual \n     property laws against such violations in all categories of \n     works should be among the highest priorities of the Attorney \n     General; and\n       (6) with respect to criminal counterfeiting and \n     infringement of computer software, the Attorney General \n     should give priority to cases--\n\n[[Page S9589]]\n\n       (A) involving the willful theft of intellectual property \n     for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial \n     gain;\n       (B) where the theft of intellectual property is central to \n     the sustainability and viability of the commercial activity \n     of the enterprise (or subsidiary) involved in the violation;\n       (C) where the counterfeited or infringing goods or services \n     enables the enterprise to unfairly compete against the \n     legitimate rights holder;\n       (D) where there is actual knowledge of the theft of \n     intellectual property by the directors or officers of the \n     enterprise; and\n       (E) where the enterprise involved in the theft of \n     intellectual property is owned or controlled by a foreign \n     enterprise or other foreign entity.\n\n\n                           PROGRAM OVERSIGHT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Intellectual property is the lifeblood of our economy, and \nprotecting that property from theft and misappropriation is important \nto preserving our place at the economic forefront of the world. \nCombatting intellectual property offenses can help us save jobs for \nAmericans, increase tax revenues from legitimate businesses, and \nbolster our productivity, with all the gains that come from that. Some \nof the provisions in this bill authorize significant resources to the \nDepartment of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to better \ntake on the tasks of battling intellectual property crimes. I have \nconfidence in law enforcement, and I also take seriously the obligation \nwe have in the Congress to ensure that the public's money is well and \nresponsibly spent.\n  Mr. COBURN. I, too, believe that intellectual property is important \nto our country, businesses and individual rights holders. Illegal \nimportation of counterfeit goods, such as pharmaceuticals, also \nthreatens the health and safety of U.S. citizens. It is necessary for \nthe Federal Government to protect and enforce intellectual property \nrights domestically and internationally. I believe we are on the way to \nachieving this goal with S. 3325, but we have to ensure that the \nagencies this bill tasks with enforcement of intellectual property \nrights are held responsible. All of us, including those in the \nintellectual property community, would have to agree that enforcement \nof intellectual property rights, even with passage of S. 3325, will \nonly become a priority of the Federal Government if agencies, such as \nthe Justice Department and FBI, are truly held accountable for \nachieving the goal of increased enforcement.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am committed to vigorous oversight of the Justice \nDepartment in all its functions, and as the champion of S. 3325, I am \nespecially interested in ensuring that these programs are effectively \nand efficiently managed. My interest does not end with the enactment of \nthis bill; in fact, this is just the beginning. I am committing myself \nand the Judiciary Committee to oversight of these programs; soon after \nthe filing date of the reports required of the Justice Department and \nthe FBI, we will hold hearings to ensure that the information we need \nto evaluate these programs and the use of the funds that have been \nappropriated.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am glad that the Senator from Vermont is making this \ncommitment and am relying on his assurance of oversight of these \nprograms so that our government is held responsible and informed \ndecisions are made on how to responsibly allocate our scarce Federal \ndollars. Although the criteria we established in this legislation are \nnecessary, they will neither have an effect on how the Justice \nDepartment and FBI prioritize and use the funds authorized under this \nbill, nor ensure grantees appropriately use Federal grant dollars, \nunless we make certain these agencies rigorously follow the standards \nwe set forth in this legislation. If the Justice Department and FBI \ncontinue to receive Federal funding year after year without Congress \nquestioning the contents of their required reports or grantees' use of \nfunds, all of the efforts of those supporting this bill will be for \nnaught, and we will not have succeeded in making IP enforcement a \npriority for this country.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor their work on this bill. I recognize we have all made compromises \nalong the way to ensure we pass the most effective enforcement \nlegislation possible, while still maintaining our desire to hold \nFederal agencies, which spend taxpayer dollars, accountable for their \nactions so that this country's intellectual property rights holders are \nprotected from counterfeiting and piracy.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the impending \npassage of S. 3325, the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights Act \nof 2008/Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual \nProperty Act of 2008.\n  When I first reviewed the bill, I was concerned that section 301's \ncreation of the intellectual property enforcement coordinator, or IPEC, \na presidentially appointed White House officer, might allow political \ninterference with the Justice Department's copyright investigation and \nenforcement decisions. I am now persuaded, however, that the bill's \ncreation of this new office does not, and was not intended to, \ninfluence the exercise of prosecutorial and law enforcement \ndecisionmaking by the Department of Justice and other law enforcement \nagencies. Criminal law enforcement is a critical component of Federal \nenforcement of intellectual property rights, and the bill includes \nlanguage that prevents the IPEC from exercising any control over \ncriminal investigations and prosecutions. These restrictions are \nconsistent with the bill's language, as well as with current Department \nof Justice and White House policies that guard against improper \ncontacts between the White House and the Department of Justice on \nprosecutions and investigations.\n  For example, the bill contains several important limitations on the \nauthority of the IPEC. Section 301(b)(2) of the bill provides that the \nIPEC ``may not control or direct any law enforcement agency, including \nthe Department of Justice, in the exercise of its investigative or \nprosecutorial authority.'' Section 305(b) further provides that \n``nothing in this title shall alter the authority of any department or \nagency of the United States (including any independent agency) that \nrelates to--(1) the investigation and prosecution of violations of laws \nthat protect intellectual property rights; (2) the administrative \nenforcement, at the borders of the United States, of laws that protect \nintellectual property rights.'' Section 306(c) also provides that \n``Nothing in this title--(1) shall derogate from the powers, duties, \nand functions of any of the agencies, departments, or other entities \nlisted or included under section 301(b)(3)(A); and (2) shall be \nconstrued to transfer authority regarding the control, use, or \nallocation of law enforcement resources, or the initiation of \nprosecution of individuals cases or types of case, from the responsible \nlaw enforcement department or agency.''\n  The foregoing provisions of the bill make clear that the IPEC does \nnot, and was not intended to, have the authority to influence or \nattempt to influence the law enforcement and prosecutorial \ndecisionmaking of the Department of Justice and its law enforcement \npartners. Rather, the IPEC's role is limited to general coordination, \nas defined in the statute, that does not interfere with, or derogate \nfrom, the existing prosecutorial and law enforcement authority and \nresponsibilities of the Department of Justice and other law enforcement \nagencies.\n  With this understanding in mind, I interpose no objection to the \nSenate's adoption of this bill and will lend my support to its passage.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President I support the overall goals of S. 3325, the \nPRO-IP Act, and believe that our country's intellectual property rights \nshould be protected at home and abroad. However, I believe that \nCongress should make both realistic and fiscally responsible \ncommitments in the legislation it passes.\n  Intellectual property is important to our country, businesses, and \nindividual rights holders. Illegal importation of counterfeit goods, \nsuch as pharmaceuticals, also threatens the health and safety of U.S. \ncitizens. It is necessary for the Federal Government to protect and \nenforce intellectual property rights domestically and internationally.\n  I believe we are on the way to achieving this goal with this \nlegislation, but we have to ensure that the agencies this bill tasks \nwith enforcement of intellectual property rights are held responsible. \nAll of us, including the members of the intellectual property \ncommunity, would have to agree that enforcement of intellectual \nproperty rights, even with passage of this legislation, will only \nbecome a priority of the Federal Government if agencies,\n\n[[Page S9590]]\n\nsuch as the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nare truly held responsible for achieving the goal of increased \nenforcement.\n  I believe that the only way to ensure these agencies actually answer \nfor their actions, and make intellectual property enforcement a \npriority, is through effective oversight by this Body. We have included \nin this bill two reporting requirements for the Justice Department and \nFBI that will make certain we know: (1) exactly what the agencies were \ndoing before this bill was enacted to enforce intellectual property \nlaws so that we may establish a performance baseline, and (2) what the \nagencies will be doing in the future as a result of this bill. We have \nalso included other standards for State and local law enforcement \nagencies that will be receiving grants from the Justice Department, so \nthat the grantees also have standards to meet in order to receive \nFederal funds.\n  These reports and standards, however, will neither have an effect on \nhow these agencies prioritize and use the funds authorized under this \nbill, nor ensure grantees appropriately use Federal funds unless we \nmake certain the criteria we set forth in this bill are met. If the \nJustice Department and FBI continue to receive funding year after year \nunder this legislation without Congress questioning the contents of the \nreports they are required to submit, all of the efforts of those \nsupporting this bill will be for naught, and we will not have succeeded \nin making intellectual property enforcement a priority for this \ncountry.\n  To be clear, I would prefer actual language in this bill stating \nthat, if the Justice Department and FBI fail to submit their reports on \ntime, any authorizations under title IV of this bill would be suspended \nuntil those reports are submitted. However, even though this language \nwas not accepted, the Senator from Vermont has assured me that the \nJudiciary Committee will hold oversight hearings early each year so we \nmay thoroughly question the contents of the reports required to be \nsubmitted by the Justice Department and FBI under title IV. It is my \nhope that the outcome of any oversight hearings in the Judiciary \nCommittee related to the content of this bill will be effectively \ncommunicated to the Appropriations Committee so that the members of \nthat committee will have detailed information to establish whether \nthese agencies have complied with the requirements of S. 3325, and \nenable them to make informed decision on how to responsibly allocate \nour scarce Federal dollars.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor their work on this bill. I recognize that we have all made \ncompromises along the way to ensure we pass the most effective \nenforcement legislation possible, while still maintaining our desire to \nhold Federal agencies, which spend taxpayer dollars, accountable for \ntheir actions so that this country's intellectual property rights \nholders are protected from counterfeiting and piracy.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenators Specter, Leahy, Bayh, and others in strong support of S. 3325, \nthe Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property \nAct of 2008, PRO IP Act, which was just approved unanimously by the \nSenate today. First, I would ike to express my appreciation to Senator \nSpecter and Senator Leahy for the excellent job they have done in \nensuring that the Senate passed this important piece of legislation \nbefore we complete our business for the year. I would like to thank \nSenator Bayh. I have partnered with Senator Bayh on this issue for the \npast 3 years. We first introduced intellectual property enforcement \nlegislation in the first session o the 109th Congress. I believe it is \nsafe to say that we are both pleased that the concepts contained in our \nlegislation have become a part of the PRO-IP Act. I think it is \nimportant to point out that the PRO-IP Act has strong bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate. When we pass legislation in a bipartisan manner, \nit reveals the best of the Senate.\n  For over 4 years, I have been talking about the need for our \nGovernment to improve its efforts to protect our Nation's intellectual \nproperty from what I have referred to as the Pirates of the 21st \nCentury. At a time when American businesses face some of the fiercest \ncompetition ever, our Government cannot ignore the growing threat of \nintellectual property theft to companies, workers, and consumers. \nIntellectual property theft is no longer an issue limited to knockoff \nhand bags and pirated DVDs and CDs.\n  Today, almost every product made is subject to being counterfeited. \nThe problem of intellectual property theft impacts businesses--big and \nsmall. Genuine products manufactured in the United States are competing \nwith phony products, which are sold both here and abroad. At a time \nwhen so many American businesses and workers are in dire straits, our \nNation can no longer turn a blind eye to this problem. The economic \nimpact of intellectual property theft is overwhelming. According to the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, intellectual property theft is costing \nAmerican businesses an estimated $250 billion each year and has cost an \nestimated 750,000 jobs. The chamber estimates that if counterfeit auto \nparts sales were eliminated, the U.S. auto industry could hire up to \n200,000 additional workers. In my home State of Ohio, 200,000 \nadditional auto industry jobs would make a tremendous impact in \nreversing the loss of manufacturing jobs.\n  The costs of intellectual property theft are not limited to lost jobs \nand revenues. There are significant health and safety ramifications. \nFor example, during a hearing I held in July 2006, the general counsel \nfrom Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems LLC, Bendix, which is \nheadquartered in Elyria, OH, testified that counterfeit air brakes used \nin tractor-trailers are so authentic looking that some of these \ncounterfeit products are returned to Bendix via its warranty claims \nprocess. Bendix is so concerned about the safety implications of this \nproblem that it is spending $1 million annually on IP protection and \nenforcement activities--that is $1 million that this one company is not \nable to spend each year on other things such as research and \ndevelopment or worker training. Moreover, given the proliferation of \ncounterfeit goods into areas such as pharmaceuticals and auto parts, it \nis only a matter of time before our Nation sees the dire health and \nsafety consequences arising from this problem.\n  The passage of the PRO-IP Act is an important step to building upon \nthe efforts that have begun under the National Intellectual Property \nLaw Enforcement Coordination Council and STOP! initiative. The PRO-IP \nAct will provide increased resources for Department of Justice programs \nto combat intellectual property theft and provide coordination and \nstrategic planning of Federal efforts against counterfeiting and \npiracy. I am particularly pleased that the PRO-IP Act will create a \nWhite House-led coordinator. I believe that the most effective \nintellectual property enforcement coordination requires White House \nleadership. As a result, I believe the efforts underway in each \nDepartment and agency will have improved effectiveness by placing the \nnew IP enforcement coordinator within the Executive Office of the \nPresident. The coordinator will have both the visibility and the access \nto provide a most effective executive branch voice on IP enforcement.\n  Finally, while I am pleased that the Senate completed its work on \npassing intellectual property enforcement legislation, I know that my \njob is not finished. I will continue to work with my colleagues to \nensure that Congress provides effective oversight over the various \nagencies and departments charged with enforcing and protecting \nintellectual property rights and that these entities have the resources \nnecessary to get the job done.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendments be withdrawn; that a Leahy substitute amendment, which is at \nthe desk, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate; and any statements related to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5655) was agreed to:\n  The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.''\n\n[[Page S9591]]\n\n  The bill (S. 3325), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are a nation in the midst of an \nunprecedented financial crisis. It is not just our financial \nenterprises that are shaken but our confidence in our own economic \nstrength. The Members of this Congress and the people of this Nation \nare being asked to take extraordinary steps to contain the explosions \non Wall Street.\n  We must not, as we try to repair the structure of our financial \ninstitutions, neglect the very sources of our economic power. \nIntellectual property--copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade \nsecrets--is an ever-growing sector of our economy. We are the envy of \nthe world for the quality and the quantity of our innovative and \ncreative goods and services. If we want to continue to lead the world \nin producing intellectual property, we need to protect Americans' \nrights in that property.\n  This bill is among the most important I have championed. I drew on \nthe experiences of thousands of intellectual property owners, hundreds \nof law enforcement officials, and all the legislators on both sides of \nthe aisle in Congress, and we have a bill that provides a focused and \nhoned set of improvements to the intellectual property law, targeted \nincreases in resources for significant enforcement efforts, streamlined \ninteragency efforts to coordinate governmental intellectual property \npolicies but also vigorous oversight of the Justice Department's \nprograms.\n  I thank all those who cosponsored it. Our bill is going to improve \nthe enforcement of our Nation's intellectual property laws, they will \nbolster our intellectual property-based economy, and it will protect \nAmerican jobs.\n  Mr. President, we are a Nation in the midst of an unprecedented \nfinancial crisis. It is not just our financial enterprises that are \nshaken, but our confidence in our own economic strength. The Members of \nthis Congress, and the people of this Nation, are being asked to take \nextraordinary steps to contain the explosions on Wall Street. We must \nnot, as we try to repair the structure of our financial institutions, \nneglect the very sources of our economic power. Intellectual property--\ncopyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets--is an ever-growing \nsector of our economy. We are the envy of the world for the quality, \nand the quantity, of our innovative and creative goods and services. If \nwe want to continue to lead the world in producing intellectual \nproperty, we need to protect our citizens' rights in that property.\n  Long ago, I was the Chittenden County State's Attorney in Vermont. \nThere is crime everywhere, even in Vermont, and I prosecuted every kind \nof case. I will never forget how much successful prosecutions depend on \nwhether the investigators and lawyers charged with protecting the \npublic from crime have the right tools to do so. No matter how \ndedicated the prosecutor, and no matter how outrageous the crime, if \nthe laws are not clearly and sensibly drafted, or if the resources are \nsimply inadequate, no justice will be done.\n  The intellectual property enforcement bill we consider today is \ndesigned solely and specifically to ensure that law enforcement has the \ntools it needs to protect our Nation's impressive array of intellectual \nproperty. The revisions to the civil and criminal statutes, the \nprovision of directed resources to Government at all levels, the \ncoordination across the Federal Government of efforts in creating \npolicies and enforcement efforts, and the requirements for reporting to \nthe Congress--all of these provisions are focused on strengthening the \nprotection of our intellectual property.\n  Vermont is special to me, and the goods from Vermont that embody \nintellectual property are prized by consumers around the world. But \nevery State in the Union is home to industries based on intellectual \nproperty. The creative and innovative Vermonters that I am proud to \ncall friends and constituents have counterparts in every other State. \nThese individuals and industries are essential to restoring and \nbuilding our fiscal health. In a time of such frightening economic \nmalaise, we should redouble our efforts to make sure that the \nproductive and valuable sectors of our economy are freed from the \ndebilitating effects of theft and misappropriation.\n  Intellectual property is just as vulnerable as it is valuable. The \nInternet has brought great and positive change to all our lives, but it \nis also an unparalleled tool for piracy. The increasing inter-\nconnectedness of the globe, and the efficiencies of sharing information \nquickly and accurately between continents, has made foreign piracy and \ncounterfeiting operations profitable in numerous countries. Americans \nsuffer when their intellectual property is stolen, they suffer when \nthose counterfeit goods displace sales of the legitimate products, and \nthey suffer when counterfeit products actually harm them, as is \nsometimes the case with fake pharmaceuticals and faulty electrical \nproducts.\n  This bill is among the most important I have championed. Drawing on \nthe experiences of thousands of intellectual property owners, hundreds \nof law enforcement officials, and all of the legislators in Congress, \nit provides a focused and honed set of improvements to the intellectual \nproperty law, targeted increases in resources for significant \nenforcement efforts, streamlined inter-agency efforts to coordinate \ngovernmental intellectual property policies, and vigorous oversight of \nthe Justice Department's programs. I thank all the cosponsors of this \nlegislation for their efforts and support. Our bill will improve the \nenforcement of our Nation's intellectual property laws, bolster our \nintellectual property-based economy, and protect American jobs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9591-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9591-S9595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Melgren, of Kansas, to be United States District \n     Judge for the District of Kansas.\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF ANTHONY J. TRENGA\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an outstanding \nVirginian, Anthony J. Trenga, who has been nominated by the President \nto serve as an article III judge on the United States District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Virginia.\n  I am pleased to note that Mr. Trenga also enjoys the strong support \nof my colleague, Senator Webb. Senator Webb and I have worked closely \ntogether to provide the White House with recommendations of outstanding \nnominees to serve the Eastern District of Virginia. After interviewing \nmore than a dozen candidates out of a very strong field of applicants, \nSenator Webb and I\n\n[[Page S9592]]\n\nwere honored to recommend Anthony Trenga for the Federal bench in the \nEastern District of Virginia. He is an exceptionally skilled attorney \nand, in my view, he will make an outstanding Federal judge.\n  Anthony Trenga has been practicing law before Federal courts in \nVirginia for more than 30 years. He has served as lead counsel in more \nthan 50 cases before the Federal court in the Eastern District of \nVirginia on a wide range of subject areas. Since 1998, Mr. Trenga has \nworked at the law firm of Miller and Chevalier, where he specializes in \nlitigation and trial practice. He is a fellow of the American College \nof Trial Lawyers and has served as a member of the faculty of the \nNational Trial Advocacy College at the University of Virginia, \nsponsored by the Virginia CLE Committee of the Virginia Bar Foundation.\n  Mr. Trenga received his law degree from the University of Virginia \nSchool of Law and completed his undergraduate studies at Princeton \nUniversity. Upon graduation, he was a law clerk to the Honorable Ted \nDalton, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia from \n1974 to 1975.\n  From 1982 to 1998, Mr. Trenga was a partner at Sachs, Greenbaum & \nTayler in Washington, DC, and a managing partner at Hazel & Thomas \nbased in Fairfax, VA.\n  Equally impressive to his legal career, though, is that despite the \nrigors of a busy legal practice, Mr. Trenga has always found time to be \nactively involved in community affairs. In addition to participating in \nhis firm's pro bono program, Mr. Trenga serves as chairman and member \nof the Alexandria Human Rights Commission, the board of directors of \nthe Northern Virginia Urban League, the board of trustees of the \nAlexandria Symphony Orchestra, and the board of directors for the \nBethesda Center of Excellence.\n  It is clear to me that Anthony Trenga is eminently qualified to sit \nas a jurist on this illustrious court. I note that the American Bar \nAssociation and the Virginia State Bar concur in this assessment, as \nboth have given him their highest rating.\n  I thank the committee for favorably reporting this exemplary nominee \nto the full Senate, and I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm him.\n\n\n                   Nomination of Mary Stenson Scriven\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I share with my colleague, Senator \nNelson, great gratitude for the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, as \nwell as Ranking Member Specter, for moving forward with judicial \nnominations. One of those is of great importance to the State of \nFlorida and deals with the Middle District of Florida, where there have \nbeen a couple of vacancies. This is a district that continues to grow \nin population but does not have a commensurate growth in judges on the \nbench.\n  I am delighted that we have moved the confirmation of Mary Scriven to \nthe U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. Magistrate \nJudge Mary Scriven is an outstanding attorney and a terrific public \nservant. She has been serving with great distinction as a magistrate \njudge and will serve with great distinction as a U.S. district judge.\n  In 1987, after earning her undergraduate degree from Duke University, \nshe then went on to Florida State University College of Law, where I \nhappened to have gone to law school myself. I am delighted that Judge \nScriven and I share that bit of heritage. She then entered the private \npractice of law in Tampa with the law firm of Carlton Fields. There is \nno finer firm in Florida than Carlton Fields. Judge Scriven eventually \nbecame a partner there before going on to a life of public service, \nbecoming a magistrate in 1997.\n  In December of 1997, Judge Scriven was selected to serve an 8-year \nterm as a Federal magistrate judge. She was reappointed to another 8-\nyear term in 2005. In her 11 years as a magistrate judge, Judge Scriven \nhas proven herself to be a committed public servant. She has a \ntremendous amount of courtroom experience, both in civil and criminal \nmatters, and she has put in the time and effort necessary to understand \nand fairly decide issues with little glamour but often of a critical \nnature, not only to the litigants but to the people of the State.\n  I know that I echo the sentiments of those who know Judge Scriven \nwhen I say she reflects the necessary attributes of a jurist--\nintelligence, honesty, and evenhandedness.\n  I congratulate her on this great accomplishment. To her and the \nmembers of her family I met when she came up for her hearing--her \nmother, father, husband, and children--I congratulate the entire family \non this tremendous accomplishment. We know the President made a good \nchoice in nominating Judge Scriven to the bench. I am pleased her \nconfirmation has now been accomplished.\n  I also thank Senator Nelson for the cooperative way our office has \nworked on nominations. Every day, I am more and more proud of the \nJudicial Nominating Commission that our good friend Mickey Grindstaff \nchaired and of all of the fine people, lawyers and nonlawyers, from \nthroughout the State who give of their time to review candidates and to \nmake recommendations in a bipartisan way, trying not only to put \nsomebody on the bench but to make sure we get the very best in the \nlegal profession to then rise to this honored position of a Federal \ndistrict court judge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank all the volunteers who \nsit on the Judicial Nominating Commission, which is an informal custom \nwe set up in Florida so that we have people process applications, \ninterview the candidates, and make recommendations to us for the \nvacancy. Then Senator Martinez and I will sit down with each of the \nsuggestions coming from the Judicial Nominating Commission and explore \nin detail.\n  Judge Scriven has been through this process three times. The last \ntime, it was a jump ball for Senator Martinez and myself between two \noutstanding women candidates. The two of us had the feeling that when \nthe next vacancy came up, we certainly wanted Judge Scriven to have \nthat Federal judgeship. Sure enough, we happily come to the floor today \nto say congratulations to Judge Scriven. Now she is going to be Federal \nJudge Scriven. I thank her for offering herself for public service and \nfor the public service she has rendered so unselfishly for so long.\n  To those who have participated in the process, when we get to the \nmerits, this isn't politics because of the way Senator Martinez and I \nselect these judges. This is not politics. This is the merits because \nthey are looked upon for their accomplishments, background, and \njudicial temperament. Then we, in collaboration with the White House \nand advising the White House before we consent, work the process. It \nhas worked very well.\n  We have two vacancies. I wish we could fill both vacancies, but \nSenator Martinez and I understood that in the last hurly-burly of \ntrying to wrap up this session, the likelihood was that we were going \nto get only one. There is another vacancy out there we want to see \nfilled very promptly at the beginning of the new Congress in January. \nThus, the two of us will be pushing and pushing to get a nominee \nconfirmed.\n  Congratulations to Judge Scriven.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. If I may add a followup, now that the chairman of the \ncommittee is here, I wish to repeat my thanks to Chairman Leahy for the \ncooperative way in which we have been able to accomplish these \njudgeships, not only the ones for Florida but the ones throughout the \ncountry that are so very important. We still have a U.S. attorney that \nwe are hoping in the next 24 hours we might be able to get into a \npackage: Mr. Albritton for the Middle District, a longstanding vacancy \nin the U.S. Attorney's Office that needs to be filled.\n  The point is to say thank you to the chairman. We appreciate his \nwork. Senator Nelson and I both appreciate Judge Scriven's \nconfirmation. She will serve with great distinction.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield for a moment, both Senators from \nFlorida have talked about this, and I will not say anything different \nthan what they have heard me say. They work very well, in a bipartisan \nfashion, to seek out the best possible people. I have a great deal of \nrespect for both of the Senators. Because they have done that, it has \nmade my job as chairman a lot easier. I look at the distinguished \nPresiding Officer from Virginia as another example because he was \nworked so well with the distinguished senior\n\n[[Page S9593]]\n\nSenator from that state. Again, it is a situation where there is a \nDemocratic Senator and a Republican Senator. They have worked very \nclosely together to try to bring the best.\n  I have no problem with different parties in an, obviously, political \nposition choosing partisan positions. In the Federal judiciary, which \nis supposed to be outside of partisan politics, I wish more Senators \nand Presidents--the next President, whoever it is--would look at the \nmodel of the Senators now on the floor. I include the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia, the Presiding Officer, in this. Seek the best \npossible man or woman for these judgeships. Let those of us in \nlegislative office take care of the partisan politics. We can do that. \nBut let the American people, when they walk into a courtroom, say: \nWhether I am plaintiff or defendant or whether I am rich or poor, no \nmatter who I am, this judge will give me a fair trial. Win or lose, I \nwill walk out knowing I had a fair trial and it was based on the facts, \nnot on politics.\n  I thank my two friends from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I echo how much Senator \nMartinez and I appreciate the exceptional cooperation the chairman \nextends to us. We have one more vacancy. I am not talking about the \nU.S. attorney, I am talking about one more judicial vacancy that, in \nthe new Congress, we want to address immediately and see whether we can \nfill.\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF ERIC F. MELGREN\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my gratitude for \nthe Senate's confirmation of Eric F. Melgren as Federal District Judge \nfor the District of Kansas.\n  It is important that we deliver solid judges to our court system. \nWith that said, I believe Eric Melgren is qualified for this important \nresponsibility. Since 2002, he has been serving as U.S. attorney for \nthe District of Kansas. Between 2002 and 2003, the District of Kansas \nhad a fourteen percent increase in the number of criminal cases filed \nin U.S. District and State courts.\n  Eric's nomination will be of great benefit to the District of Kansas. \nDue to an increase in caseload, a temporary judgeship was created in \nthe District of Kansas in 1990. Since the temporary judgeship was \ncreated, we have seen an increase in the caseload for the District of \nKansas.\n  Currently, Kansas has five active Federal district judges. With \nEric's confirmation, we will now have six active judges. However, one \nof these judgeships is temporary and set to expire on November 21 of \nthis year. If the temporary judgeship would have expired before the \nSenate confirmed Eric and another judge took senior status this year, \nthe District of Kansas would only have four active judges. Therefore, \nwith the increase in caseload, it was vital that we confirmed Eric \nbefore the expiration of this temporary judgeship.\n  Again, thank you for confirming the nomination of Eric Melgren. He is \na man of integrity and sound judgement. Eric's passion for the law will \nbe of great benefit to the State of Kansas and the rest of the Nation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to express my pleasure at the \nconfirmation today of Clark Waddoups to the U.S. district court in Utah \nand my thanks to all those, in particular the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, who facilitated this result.\n  Clark Waddoups will be a truly outstanding judge.\n  He graduated from the University of Utah law school where he was \npresident of the Utah Law Review and has been practicing law in Utah \nfor nearly 35 years, a majority of it in Federal court.\n  More than that, he has participated in the life of the law in our \nState, serving on the board of visitors of the law school at Brigham \nYoung University and for 17 years on the Advisory Committee to the Utah \nSupreme Court on the Rules of Evidence.\n  Not surprisingly, the Utah chapter of the Federal Bar Association has \nrecognized Clark as Utah's outstanding lawyer and the American Bar \nAssociation unanimously gave him its highest well qualified rating to \nserve as a Federal judge.\n  Not only is Clark Waddoups an outstanding lawyer, but he is a good \nman.\n  He is active in his church and for many years served on and led the \nboard of the Family Support Center of Utah.\n  Federal courts across America are very busy today, and no more so \nthan in Utah.\n  Utah has just five U.S. district court seats and our population has \nincreased by more than 50 percent since the last one was created in \n1990.\n  Because this vacancy occurred when Judge Paul Cassell resigned to go \nback to teaching, there was no senior judge available to help out.\n  So the service of such an outstanding judge will be welcome indeed.\n  My colleague and friend from Utah, Senator Bennett, and I worked \ntogether to recommend the very best candidate to replace Judge Cassell.\n  Clark Waddoups stood out from the many qualified and experienced \nlawyers we considered.\n  He is known and respected through the legal community and will be a \nfair and wise jurist who will live up to the highest standards of the \nAmerican legal system.\n  As everyone knows, the confirmation process, especially for judicial \nnominees, has its share, perhaps more than its share, of tension and \ncontroversy.\n  As a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I know there are \nmany competing demands and expectations.\n  But Chairman Leahy nonetheless scheduled not one but two hearings \nthis month to consider a total of 10 additional nominees to the U.S. \ndistrict court.\n  And he made sure that they got on the Judiciary Committee agenda, \nreported to the floor yesterday, and confirmed today.\n  So I am deeply grateful to President Bush for nominating Clark \nWaddoups and to Chairman Leahy for facilitating his progress through \nthe confirmation process.\n  Utah and America will be better off with Judge Clark Waddoups on the \nbench.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as this Congress winds down, we need to \nfocus on confronting the worst financial crisis we have experienced \nsince the Great Depression, one that has exposed the American taxpayers \nto trillions in losses. But just as I continued to hold hearings on \nnominations on September 13, 2001, in the wake of the attacks of 9/11, \nI have continued deep into this Presidential election year to hold \nhearings and take action on both executive and judicial nominees. \nIndeed, yesterday the Judiciary Committee reported out 13 nominations, \nincluding 10 nominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal \nbench, and the nomination of Greg Garre to be Solicitor General of the \nUnited States, one of the highest and most prestigious positions at the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  I went the extra mile to hold two expedited hearings this month on \njudicial nominations--despite the Thurmond Rule that Republicans \ncreated and followed with Democratic Presidents, despite the practices \nthey followed in 1996 and 2000, and despite the record of Republicans \nin filibustering and raising objections to important bills with broad \nbipartisan support.\n  I held a hearing just 3 days ago as an accommodation to Senator \nSpecter, the ranking republican member of our committee and a former \nchairman. I have accommodated Senator Hatch, another former chairman. I \nalso accommodated the Senator from Kansas and included the nominee from \nKansas at a hearing Tuesday afternoon, even though his nomination has \nraised concerns. We also have proceeded with hearings on another \nnominee from Virginia, a nominee from California, and the two nominees \nfrom Colorado. I continue my practice of working with Senators on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  Today I have continued to do so, and the Senate has confirmed all 10 \nof these Bush judicial nominations: Clark Waddoups of Utah, Michael \nAnello of California, Mary Stenson Scriven of Florida, Christine \nArguello and Phillip A. Brimmer of Colorado, C. Darnell Jones II, \nMitchell S. Goldberg, and Joel H. Slomsky of Pennsylvania, Anthony J. \nTrenga of Virginia, and Eric Melgren of Kansas.\n  I have said throughout my chairmanship that I would treat President \nBush's nominees better than Republicans treated President Clinton's, \nand I have done so. In the 17 months I served as chairman of this \ncommittee during President Bush's first term with a Democratic \nmajority, the Senate confirmed 100 of the President's judicial \nnominations. In the 38 months I\n\n[[Page S9594]]\n\nhave served as Judiciary Committee chairman, the Senate has now \nconfirmed 10 more nominees than it did during the more than 4 years \nRepublicans led the committee, 168 nominees compared to 158.\n  Even before the August recess, we had confirmed more judicial \nnominations in this Congress than were confirmed during the previous 2 \nyears when a Republican Senate majority and Republican chairman of this \ncommittee did not have to worry about the Thurmond Rule and an \nabbreviated session due to a Presidential election. With the \nconfirmations today we have confirmed 68 this Congress, 14 more than in \nthe last Congress with a Republican majority.\n  My approach has been consistent throughout my chairmanships during \nthe Bush presidency. I submit that the results have been positive. Last \nyear, the Judiciary Committee favorably reported 40 judicial \nnominations to the Senate, and all 40 were confirmed. That was more \nthan had been confirmed in any of the 3 preceding years when a \nRepublican chairman and Republican Senate majority managed the process. \nEven though this is a Presidential election year, we confirmed more of \nPresident Bush's nominees this year--28--than the Republican-led Senate \nconfirmed in 2005 and virtually the same number as in 2006, both non-\nPresidential election years.\n  Indeed, the contrast between our productivity on judicial nominations \nby confirming 10 judicial nominees late in this Congress and the flurry \nof activity undone by Republican obstructionism at the end of the last \nCongress is significant. Although we wasted many months during the \n109th Congress debating a handful of President Bush's most extreme \nfailed nominees, the Democratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee \nworked especially hard as time ran down in that Congress to be \naccommodating on judicial nominations. We agreed to the request of \nSenator Specter, then the committee chairman, to hold four hearings in \nSeptember 2006 on nominations and numerous extra business meetings. But \nour work to be accommodating and move nominations forward was to no \navail when holds by Senator Brownback and other Republicans stopped the \nSenate from confirming 14 judicial nominees. Included in these were \nthree nominees to fill judicial emergency vacancies in the Western \nDistrict of Michigan, a situation not resolved until this Congress, \nwhen the Michigan Senators and the White House worked together with us \nto fill those vacancies.\n  Despite our efforts to step away from the tit for tat of the \nnomination battles of the past and the work we have done to \ndramatically lower judicial vacancies by approving the nominees of a \nPresident from the other party, our efforts have yet to be \nacknowledged. After today, we will have cut the judicial vacancies from \nI encountered in the summer of 2001 after years of pocket filibusters \nof moderate and qualified nominees of President Clinton by Republican \nSenate leadership, to about a third, from 110 to as low as 34 today. In \nthe 6 years of Senate Republican majority control during the Clinton \nadministration, the pocket filibusters and obstruction of moderate, \nqualified nominees more than doubled circuit court vacancies. By \ncontrast, we have cut circuit court vacancies by two-thirds, from 32 to \na low of 9 this summer.\n  We have broken through longstanding logjams in the Fourth, Fifth, and \nSixth Circuits and lowered vacancies in virtually every circuit from \nwhen President Bush took office. With the recent confirmations of \nHelene White and Ray Kethledge to seats on the Sixth Circuit, that \ncircuit, which had four vacancies after the Republican pocket \nfilibusters, now has none. The Fifth Circuits had a circuit-wide \nemergency due to the multiple simultaneous vacancies during the Clinton \nyears, when Republicans controlled the Senate. The Fifth Circuit now \nhas no vacancies. We have succeeded in lowering vacancies in the Fourth \nCircuit, the Fifth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit, the \nNinth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit, the DC Circuit, \nand the Federal Circuit.\n  Judicial vacancies that rose steadily and dramatically under \nRepublican Senate control with a Democratic President have fallen \ndramatically with a Republican President when a Democratic Senate \nmajority was in charge. I recall that as the Presidential elections in \n2000 drew closer, Republican pocket filibusters resulted in the \njudicial vacancy rate rising to 10 percent. Democrats have reversed \nthat course. We have now lowered that number to 34, less than a third \nof where they stood after Republican pocket filibusters and \nobstruction. The vacancy rate is below 4 percent vacancy now. As \nunemployment for ordinary Americans has now risen about 6 percent \nnationwide and much higher in some States and communities, we have cut \nthe judicial vacancy rate dramatically.\n  I suspect many of these facts have been lost among the Republican \nelection-year gambits and grumblings about judicial nominations that \nalways seem loudest when we are moving forward on nominations. Partisan \nRepublican critics ignore the progress we have made on judicial \nvacancies. They also ignore the crisis that they had created by not \nconsidering circuit nominees in 1996, 1997, and 1998. They ignore the \nfact that they refused to confirm a single circuit nominee during the \nentire 1996 session. They ignore the fact that they returned 17 circuit \ncourt nominees without action to the White House in 2000. They ignore \nthe public criticism of their actions by Chief Justice Rehnquist during \nthose years. They ignore the fact that they were responsible for more \nthan doubling circuit court vacancies through pocket filibusters of \nmoderate and qualified Clinton nominees or that we have reduced those \ncircuit court vacancies by more than two thirds.\n  In the 1996 session, the Republican majority confirmed only 17 of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees, and none were circuit court \nnominations. In stark contrast, under Democratic leader in this \nelection year, the Senate has confirmed 28 judicial nominees, 4 of them \nto prestigious circuit courts.\n  I have yet to hear explanations for why they did not proceed with the \nnominations of Barry Goode, Helene White, Alston Johnson, James Duffy, \nElena Kagan, James Wynn, Kathleen McCree Lewis, Enrique Moreno, Allen \nSnyder, Kent Markus, Robert Cindrich, Bonnie Campbell, Stephen \nOrlofsky, Roger Gregory, Christine Arguello, Andre Davis, Elizabeth \nGibson, and so many others.\n  One of those many nominees blocked by the Republican abuses of those \nyears was finally confirmed today. I was happy to accommodate Senator \nSalazar's request that we add two Colorado nominees to the first of our \nSeptember hearings, after he and Senator Allard reached an agreement. \nThat agreement led Senator Allard finally to return the blue slip for \nMs. Arguello. Of course, Ms. Arguello was nominated by President \nClinton to the Tenth Circuit, but a Republican pocket filibuster in \n2000 stalled her nomination. Ms. Arguello, like Judge Helene White, who \nwas confirmed to the Sixth Circuit earlier this year, has now been \nnominated by Presidents of both parties. I thank the committee for \ncompleting the work on her nomination we should have completed a decade \nago, and I am pleased that she was confirmed today.\n  I am also pleased that today we confirmed the nomination of Darnell \nJones, who has been a highly regarded judge on the Philadelphia Court \nof Common Pleas for more than 20 years, serving as the President Judge \nof that court for the last two. Judge Jones will now become just the \n88th African-American Federal judge or justice, out of 875 seats, and \nthe 72nd African-American district court judge.\n  There is still much work to be done. In his two terms, President Bush \nhas nominated only 25 African-American judges to the Federal bench, \ncompared to 77 African-American judges nominated by President Clinton \nin his two terms, more than three times as many. President Bush's \nfailure to nominate an African-American judge from Mississippi even \nthough that State has the highest percentage of African-American \nresidents of any State is disappointing and inexplicable. I have urged, \nand will continue to urge, this President and the next one to nominate \nmen and women to the Federal bench who reflect the diversity of \nAmerica. Racial diversity remains a pillar of strength for our country \nand one of our greatest natural resources. Diversity on the bench helps \nensure\n\n[[Page S9595]]\n\nthat the words ``equal justice under law,'' inscribed in Vermont marble \nover the entrance to the Supreme Court, is a reality and that justice \nis rendered fairly and impartially.\n  Another aspect of the problem created by Republicans that we have \nworked hard to improve is a dramatic reduction in the number of \njudicial emergency vacancies. Nearly half of the judicial nominees the \nSenate has confirmed while I have chaired the Judiciary Committee have \nfilled vacancies classified by the Administrative Office of the Courts \nas judicial emergency vacancies. Eighteen of the 27 circuit court \nnominees confirmed while I have chaired the committee filled judicial \nemergency vacancies, including 9 of the 10 circuit court nominees \nconfirmed this Congress. When President Bush took office, there were 28 \njudicial emergency vacancies. Now that number is 13, fewer than half.\n  Of course, we have made this progress even while devoting extensive \ntime and attention to rebuilding the Justice Department in the wake of \nthe scandals of the Gonzales era and the Bush-Cheney administration.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, the Judiciary Committee began its \noversight efforts. Over the next 9 months, our efforts revealed a \nDepartment of Justice gone awry. The leadership crisis came more and \nmore into view as I led a bipartisan group of concerned Senators to \nconsider the U.S. attorney firing scandal, a confrontation over the \nlegality of the administration's warrantless wiretapping program, the \nuntoward political influence of the White House at the Department of \nJustice, and the secret legal memos excusing all manner of excess and \nsubverting the rule of law.\n  What our efforts exposed was a crisis of leadership that took a heavy \ntoll on the tradition of independence that has long guided the Justice \nDepartment and provided it with safe harbor from political \ninterference. It shook the confidence of the American people. Through \nbipartisan efforts among those from both sides of the aisle who care \nabout Federal law enforcement and the Department of Justice, we joined \ntogether to press for accountability. That resulted in a change in \nleadership at the Department, with the resignations of the Attorney \nGeneral and virtually all of its highest ranking officials, along with \nseveral high ranking White House officials.\n  Earlier this month the Judiciary Committee held its ninth hearing to \nrestock and restore the leadership of the Department of Justice in the \nlast year alone, including confirmation hearings for the new Attorney \nGeneral, the new Deputy Attorney General, the new Associate Attorney \nGeneral, and so many others. We have already confirmed 35 executive \nnominations so far this Congress and are poised to add to this total, \nhaving reported out of committee this month another six high-level \nexecutive nominations, including the nomination of Greg Garre to be \nSolicitor General of the United States, one of the highest and most \nprestigious positions at the Department of Justice, and of J. Patrick \nRowan to be the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the National \nSecurity Division.\n  The reduction in judicial vacancies is one of the few areas in which \nconditions have actually improved over the last couple of years. I wish \nwe could say the same about unemployment or the price of gas or food, \nor the condition of our financial markets and housing markets. The \neconomy has experienced job losses every month this year, and they now \ntotal more than 650,000. Compare the progress we have made on filling \njudicial vacancies with what has happened to cost of gasoline, food \nprices, health care costs, inflation, the credit crisis, home \nmortgages, and the national debt. All those indicators have been moving \nin the wrong direction, as is consumer confidence and the percentage of \nAmericans who see the country as on the wrong track.\n  The American people are also best served by a Federal judiciary they \ncan trust to apply the law fairly regardless of who walks into the \ncourtroom. The judiciary is the one arm of our Government that should \nnever be political or politicized, regardless of who sits in the White \nHouse. I have continued to work in the waning days of this Congress \nwith Senators from both sides of the aisle to confirm an extraordinary \nnumber of nominees late in the election year. I will continue to work \nwith the next President to ensure that the Federal judiciary remains \nindependent and able to provide justice to all Americans, without fear \nor favor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9595-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nLEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9595-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9595-S9599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\nMENTALLY ILL OFFENDER TREATMENT AND CRIME REDUCTION REAUTHORIZATION AND \n                        IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I was proud to be a cosponsor, but I am \nespecially proud of the lead sponsor, Senator Edward Kennedy of \nMassachusetts. This is a matter he has cared passionately about, and he \nhas worked tirelessly. He relied not only on his own family experience \nbut also the experiences of so many other thousands of families who \nhave seen Senator Kennedy as a champion. I applaud him.\n  We have been in constant contact with Senator Kennedy during the time \nwe have been talking about this issue. Incidentally, we are, of course, \ntalking about The Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction \nReauthorization and Improvement Act. I have talked with him about his \npersonal experience and with those who are mentally ill, and his \nconcern about this whole subject has been shown time and time again. So \nI applaud Senator Kennedy and all the other cosponsors for what they \nhave done.\n  Today, the Senate will finally turn to legislation to reauthorize the \nMentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act. Though this \nbill was reported by the Judiciary Committee in April, it has stalled \non the Senate floor for 5 months due to Republican objection. I am glad \nthat we are moving forward on this bill today.\n  I was a sponsor of the original authorization of this Act in 2004, \nand I am proud that these programs have helped State and local \ngovernments to reduce crime by providing more effective treatment for \nthe mentally ill. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the reauthorization \nof this important legislation in this Congress, and I thank Senators \nKennedy, Domenici, and Specter for their leadership on this issue.\n  All too often, people with mental illness find themselves in a \nrevolving door between the criminal justice system and the streets of \nour communities, committing a series of minor offenses. These offenders \nend up in prisons or jails, where little or no appropriate medical care \nis available for them. This bill gives State and local governments the \ntools to break this cycle, for the good of law enforcement, corrections \nofficers, the public's safety, and the mentally ill offenders \nthemselves. More than 16 percent of adults incarcerated in U.S. jails \nand prisons have a mental illness, and about 20 percent of youth in the \njuvenile justice system have serious mental health problems. Almost \nhalf the inmates in prison with a mental illness were incarcerated for \ncommitting a nonviolent crime. This is a serious problem that I hear \nabout often when I talk with law enforcement officials and others in \nVermont.\n  Under this bill, State and local governments can apply for funding to \ncreate or expand mental health courts or other court-based programs, \nwhich can divert qualified offenders from prison to receive treatment; \ncreate or expand programs to provide specialized training for criminal \njustice and mental health system personnel; create or expand local \ntreatment programs that serve individuals with mental illness or co-\noccurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders; and promote and \nprovide mental health treatment for those incarcerated in or released \nfrom jails and prisons.\n  The grants created under this program have been in high demand, but \nonly about 11 percent of the applications submitted have been able to \nreceive funding due to the scarce Federal funds available. The bill's \nsponsors and I worked hard to determine an appropriate authorization \nlevel of funding, which has unfortunately been slashed\n\n[[Page S9598]]\n\nin this bill in order to accommodate the objection of the junior \nSenator from Oklahoma. I look forward to working with Senators Kennedy, \nDomenici, and Specter as the appropriations process moves forward so \nthat these vital programs can be adequately funded.\n  This legislation brings together law enforcement, corrections, and \nmental health professionals to help respond to the needs of our \ncommunities. They are familiar with the unique problems states face \nwith mentally ill offenders, and they understand the importance of \nfederal support. I am glad the Republican objection to moving this bill \nforward has been lifted, and I hope the House passes this important \nbill swiftly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Leahy, and Senator Specter, to laud the passage of S. \n2304, the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction \nReauthorization and Improvement Act of 2008. This bill reauthorizes and \nimproves several programs intended to provide federal support for \ncollaborations between criminal justice and mental health systems.\n  I must first show my great admiration and appreciation for Senator \nTed Kennedy, with whom I have worked diligently on legislation related \nto mental illness. His support, knowledge, and friendship have been \ninvaluable in our joint fight for better access and opportunities for \nthe millions of Americans who suffer from some form of mental illness. \nTo him I owe a debt of gratitude and am thankful for the opportunity to \nhave worked so closely with him for so many years.\n  It is estimated that approximately 16 percent of adult U.S. jail and \nprison inmates suffer from mental illness and the numbers are even \nhigher in the juvenile justice system. Many of these individuals are \nnot violent or habitual criminals. Most have been charged or convicted \nof non-violent crimes that are a direct consequence of not having \nreceived needed treatment and supportive services for their mental \nillness.\n  The presence of defendants with mental illnesses in the criminal \njustice system imposes substantial costs on that system and can cause \nsignificant harm to defendants. In response to this problem, a number \nof communities around the country are implementing mental health \ncourts, a specialty court model that utilizes a separate docket, \ncoupled with regular judicial supervision, to respond to individuals \nwith mental illnesses who come in contact with the justice system.\n  Many communities are not prepared to meet the comprehensive treatment \nand needs of individuals with mental illness when they enter the \ncriminal justice system. The bill passing today is intended to help \nprovide resources to help states and counties design and implement \ncollaborative efforts between criminal justice and mental health \nstructures. The bill reauthorizes the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment \nand Crime Reduction Grant Program and reauthorizes the Mental Health \nCourts Program. It creates a new grant program to help law enforcement \nidentify and respond to incidents involving persons with mental illness \nand it funds a study and report on the prevalence of mentally ill \noffenders in the criminal justice system. All of these reforms will \nhelp to address this problem from both a public safety and a public \nhealth point of view. This will help save taxpayers money, improve \npublic safety, and link individuals with the treatment they need to \nbecome productive members of their community.\n  Certainly, not every crime committed by an individual diagnosed with \na mental illness is attributable to their illness or to the failure of \npublic mental health. Mental health courts are not a panacea for \naddressing the needs of the growing number of people with mental \nillnesses who come in contact with the criminal justice system. But \nthey should be one part of the solution. Evidence has shown that in \ncommunities where mental health and criminal justice interests work \ncollaboratively on solutions it can make a significant impact in \nfostering recovery, improving treatment outcomes and decreasing \nrecidivism.\n  I thank my good friends for working with me on this very important \nissue. I appreciate their commitment to advancing these important \nprograms and I am thankful to be here to see the passage of this \nlegislation that we worked so hard on.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, in strongly supporting \nSenate passage of S. 2304, the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and \nCrime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 2008. This \nbicameral, bipartisan legislation demonstrates strong Federal support \nfor helping local communities address the current crisis in which far \ntoo many persons with mental illness are subjected to incarceration, \nnot treatment. With full funding, this proposal has the potential to \nachieve significant reforms in the criminal justice system's treatment \nof people diagnosed with mental illness.\n  I commend Senator Domenici for his leadership on this bill and on \nmany other initiatives to improve our Nation's mental health system. I \nalso commend the leadership of Representatives Bobby Scott and Forbes \nin the House of Representatives on this issue. This important \nlegislation will promote cooperative initiatives that will \nsignificantly reduce recidivism and improve treatment outcomes for \nmentally ill offenders.\n  Based on the most recent studies by the Bureau of Justice, more than \nhalf of all prison and jail inmates in 2005 had a mental health \nproblem, including 56 percent of inmates in State prisons, 45 percent \nof Federal prisoners, and 64 percent of jail inmates. According to a \nreport by the Council of State Governments' Criminal Justice-Mental \nHealth Consensus Project, the rate of mental illness in State prisons \nand jails is at least three times the rate in the general population, \nand at least three-quarters of those incarcerated have a substance \nabuse disorder.\n  Far too often, individuals are subjected to the criminal justice \nsystem, when what is really needed is treatment and support for mental \nillness or substance abuse disorders. Families often resort in \ndesperation to the police in order to obtain treatment and assistance \nfor a loved one suffering from an extreme episode of a mental illness. \nDuring times of such distress, families feel they have no other \nalternative because persons with symptoms such as paranoia, exaggerated \nactions, or impaired judgment are unable to recognize the need for \ntreatment.\n  It is unconscionable, and may well be unconstitutional, for these \nvulnerable individuals to be further marginalized after they are \nincarcerated. Too often they are denied even minimal treatment because \nof inadequate resources. Most mentally ill offenders who come into \ncontact with the criminal justice system are charged with low-level, \nnonviolent crimes. Once behind bars, they may well face an environment \nthat further exacerbates symptoms of mental illness that might \notherwise be manageable with proper treatment, and they may soon be \nback in prison as a result of insufficient and inadequate services when \nthey are released.\n  This bill reauthorizes critical programs to move away from troubled \nsystems that often result in the escalating incarceration of \nindividuals with mental illness. Through this legislation, State and \nlocal correctional facilities will be able to create appropriate, cost-\neffective solutions. In particular, I am very supportive of the crisis \nintervention teams that many communities have developed to expand \ncooperation between the mental health system and law enforcement. These \nteams have been very effective in enabling officers to spend less time \narresting mentally ill individuals and more time directing them toward \ntreatment. I also support the continued expansion of mental health \ncourts, so that defendants can be placed into judicially supervised \ncommunity-based treatment programs, which often result in better \noutcomes and reduced recidivism.\n  To date, we have seen only a fraction of the possible potential of \nthis legislation, because only a small number of communities have been \nable to benefit from this legislation. Because of limited Federal \nfunding, only 11 percent of applicants have been able to receive one of \nthese grants, even though demand for them is high. No magic solution \nwill solve the problems faced by communities across America. But this\n\n[[Page S9599]]\n\nbill will effectively address local needs by fostering greater \ncooperation between law enforcement and mental health providers.\n  In addition, members of State and local law enforcement need access \nto training and other alternatives to improve safety and \nresponsiveness. It reauthorizes the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment \nProgram and maintains its authorized funding at $50 million a year. The \nlegislation also authorizes grants to States and local governments to \ntrain law enforcement personnel on procedures to identify and respond \nmore appropriately to persons with mental illness, and develop \nspecialized receiving centers to assess individuals in custody.\n  The broad support for this legislation includes the Council of State \nGovernments, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the National \nSheriffs Association, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the \nNational Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare, the National \nAlliance for the Mentally Ill, the Campaign for Mental Health Reform \nand Mental Health America. These organizations understand it will \nprovide much needed assistance to help solve this complex problem. \nCourts, law enforcement, corrections and mental health communities have \nall come together in support of this legislation, and Congress is right \nto respond.\n  Individuals and their loved ones struggle with countless challenges \nand barriers during a mental health crisis. With this bill, Congress \nwill be providing significant new support for needed cooperative \nefforts between law enforcement and mental health experts. I am pleased \nthat the Senate supports this legislation, and I am optimistic it will \nbe enacted before the end of this current session of Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9599-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the outset, I wish to thank my \ndistinguished colleague, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, for the committee's action in considering the judicial \nnominees and for moving ahead with their confirmations today. Senator \nLeahy is used to being generous and statesmanlike, but to confirm all \nthese judges at this time, on September 26, considering the background \nof the controversies in the Senate, is an act of statesmanship. If they \nwrote a book ``Profiles in Statesmanship,'' as well as the book \n``Profiles in Courage,'' Senator Leahy would be at the top of the list.\n  There has been a lot of controversy during the last 2 years of the \nadministration regarding judges. Both Republicans and Democrats have \nbeen at fault in the last 2 years of President Reagan's administration, \nthe last 2 years of President George H. W. Bush, the last 2 years of \nPresident Clinton, and beyond President Clinton. As I have said on the \nfloor on a number of occasions, I have crossed party lines to support \nPresident Clinton's judges because I thought they were inappropriately \nbottled up. There is controversy now and we have moved ahead. Senator \nLeahy has been the leader, the chairman of the committee, to get the \njob done.\n  There are three Pennsylvanians in the group of judges that we are \nconfirming today: C. Darnell Jones, II, president judge of the \nPhiladelphia Court of Common Pleas; Mitchell Goldberg, judge on the \nBucks County Court of Common Pleas; and Joel Slomsky, a distinguished \npractitioner. Three very distinguished nominees.\n  I see the Senator from Colorado is on the floor, and there are two \nColorado judges, as well as other judges, that were confirmed. I thank \nthe chairman for his action taken today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, one, I \nappreciate his kind words. He and I have been friends from our days \nwhen we first met as prosecutors in our jurisdictions. So I appreciate \nthat.\n  I also appreciate the fact that he has said privately what he has \nsaid publicly in thanking me. The Senators from Colorado, the Senators \nfrom Florida, and the Senators from Virginia have also joined with the \nSenators from Pennsylvania in thanking me for moving these nominations. \nI am sure when the Record is read that Senators from the other States \nwill be aware of what we have done. But I do appreciate that. His words \nmean a great deal to me.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, a few more concluding comments. I was \nglad to yield to my distinguished colleague, the chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  I also wish to comment briefly about the intellectual property \nenforcement bill, which is the Leahy-Specter bill. I am glad to see \nthat has cleared and that the holds have been taken off, and I thank \nSenator Coburn for taking the hold off, after very extensive \ndiscussions, which I know the chairman has had and I have had. This is \na very important bill for the intellectual property community to \nprovide enforcement and to provide teeth so intellectual property is \nrespected, giving additional powers to the Department of Justice to see \nto it that the infringement of intellectual property is acted upon \nswiftly.\n  I see a number of my colleagues waiting to speak, so I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n          Nominations of Christine Arguello and Philip Brimmer\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise, first and foremost, to thank the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Patrick Leahy, for his \nstatesmanship and his hard work and leadership on the Judiciary \nCommittee, as on so many issues. The ten judges that have just been \nconfirmed show the kind of statesmanship he brings to this body, and I \nam very proud to be able to work with him and proud to be able to work \nwith the distinguished ranking member as well.\n  I wish to make a brief comment regarding two of the judges who were \nconfirmed a moment ago, and they would be Christine Arguello and Philip \nBrimmer from Colorado.\n  Christine Arguello is a person who was nominated by President \nClinton, now over 10 years ago, to the district court, as well as the \nTenth Circuit Court of Appeals. She is truly an American dream. She was \nborn and raised in very humble circumstances. There was a poignant time \nwhere, because her father worked on the railroad, she actually lived in \na boxcar. Yet, over time, she became a very successful student and \nended up at Harvard Law School. She went on to have a very \ndistinguished career both in the private sector and the public sector \nand served as my chief deputy attorney general during the time I served \nas the attorney general for the State of Colorado.\n  She is a tenured law professor. She knows the law well, and she will \nmake the State of Colorado and the United States of America very proud \nwith her service on the bench of the U.S. District Court for the State \nof Colorado. So I congratulate her, and I thank Senator Leahy and \nSenator Specter for their leadership in moving that through the house.\n  I wish to congratulate Phil Brimmer, who will join Christine Arguello \nin the U.S. District Court. He comes from a family of distinguished \njurists, and he has a distinguished academic career and now over 7 \nyears of leadership experience within the U.S. Attorney's Office in \nColorado, where he has been in charge of the special prosecutions unit. \nHe is a lawyer's lawyer. Both Christine Arguello and Phil Brimmer will \nmove the hands of justice forward in a way we can all be very proud of \nfor the State of Colorado.\n  I see there are two of my colleagues on the floor, Senator Bingaman \nand Senator Mikulski. I think they are waiting to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take just a few minutes to \nspeak about our colleagues who have announced their plans to retire at \nthe conclusion of this 110th Congress. We obviously will miss them. \nThere are five individuals about whom I wanted to say a brief word: \nSenators Allard, Hagel, Craig, Warner, and Domenici. They have all \nbrought their intelligence, principles, and perspectives on the issues \nconfronting our Nation. The Nation is better for their efforts.\n  Senators Allard and Hagel both came to the Senate in 1996.\n\n[[Page S9600]]\n\n                              Wayne Allard\n\n  Senator Allard had a long career in public service before coming to \nthe Senate. He managed to serve the State of Colorado while never \ngiving up his credentials as an expert veterinarian in that State, \nreaffirming the long-held belief that he and all of us have had that a \nlegislative body should be composed of individuals with training other \nthan that which they acquire here in the Halls of Congress. His \nstraightforward approach has been a hallmark of his work here.\n  Living a principle that he espouses, he is fulfilling his often-\nstated intention to limit himself to two terms. He and his wife Joan \nwill certainly be missed here in the Senate.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  Chuck Hagel of Nebraska forged a very successful career in business \nand broadcasting, civic organizations and government, but first he \nserved our country as a sergeant in Vietnam. It was an honor to work \nwith him on the Vietnam Memorial visitors center legislation. He has \nchampioned that cause, knowing firsthand how much it means to have \nlived through the experience of that war. He has a wide knowledge of \nthe world, and he has informed his thoughtful and well-considered \npositions on foreign policy and arms control and national security \nissues with that knowledge.\n  He can always be counted on for a straightforward approach and an \nhonest statement of his views.\n\n\n                              Larry Craig\n\n  My longtime colleague on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nSenator Craig, has been a valuable voice for Idaho for decades. He \nserved in his State's legislature for 6 years before coming to the \nHouse of Representatives 28 years ago, where he served for 10 years.\n  In 1990, he was elected to the Senate. We worked very closely on \nissues important to energy and natural resources throughout the West. \nHe has been a leader in many national policy areas, including aging and \nopening trade to Cuba.\n  I have appreciated his contributions, particularly in our Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, where his opinions have always been \nclearly expressed and his best efforts are made to represent his State \nand the Nation.\n\n\n                              John Warner\n\n  With the exception of Harry Byrd, John Warner has represented \nVirginia in the Senate longer than any other Senator in its history. He \nhas done so with great enthusiasm, skill, hard work, and style. To many \npeople, John Warner embodies what a Senator should be. He knows the \nworld, he knows this country, and he knows, of course, his beloved \nState. He is an outstanding citizen of each of those.\n  He is a patriot in the old-fashioned and in the deep-hearted sense of \nthat word. He has demonstrated his love of country through years of \nservice both in uniform and out of uniform. The miles he has traveled \nto all corners of the world to see our forces in action and the hours--\ninnumerable hours--he spent hearing committee testimony, he has \nabsorbed. That has equipped him to really be an expert in this body on \nmilitary issues. His leadership will be missed on those issues and \nother issues as well here.\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  The most senior Senator retiring this year, of course, is my \ncolleague and friend Senator Pete Domenici. He is not only the most \nsenior Senator retiring this year from the Senate, he is also the most \nsenior Senator New Mexico has ever had. When Pete leaves the Senate \nthis year, it will be after 36 years of unstinting work doing his best \nfor his country and for our State of New Mexico.\n  He will be the first to say that his success and longevity here could \nnot have been possible without two important elements: his family and \nhis staff. The love and support of his wife Nancy have been invaluable. \nAlso, from the first, he has had a fine staff. It was true when he came \nto Washington and it is certainly true today, here and in New Mexico. \nThey are skilled individuals who make it their business to be helpful \nto the people of our State.\n  Senator Domenici's contributions are well known to all of us. His \nwork on the Budget Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee and the Appropriations Committee over the years has made a \nlasting impact on national policy. As a member of the Budget Committee, \nfrom the day he was sworn in, he was either the chairman or ranking \nmember of that committee for 12 years of his 36 years on the committee.\n  One of the things in which he takes great pride is helping to get us \nto a balanced Federal budget twice. We can all appreciate how difficult \nthat kind of undertaking is.\n  Senator Domenici and I, of course, served on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee together. The Senate Historian has told us that as \nfar as his office can tell, it is the only instance in the history of \nthe Senate where Senators from the same State served as chairman and \nranking member of the same committee at the same time. Obviously, I \nwill miss that arrangement.\n  New Mexicans, including me, have great affection and respect for Pete \nDomenici. ``People for Pete'' is the motto Pete has used in each of his \ncampaigns for many years. It is not just a famous campaign phrase in \nour State--although it is seen on bumper stickers all over our State \nwhenever a campaign is underway involving Pete--but it is a bit of a \ntwist on what his career has been all about; that is: Pete for the \npeople of New Mexico. That has been his commitment. He has carried \nthrough in great form.\n  We will miss his service to the State of New Mexico here in the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee for working with Senator Salazar \nand myself in getting two individuals finally confirmed by the Senate; \nthat is, Phillip Brimmer and Christine Arguello to the District Court \nof Colorado. I know it was not an easy task that the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee had before him. I know he had to buck some of the \npersistent rules of his committee, he had to buck a very tight timeline \nat the end and had to deal with some misunderstandings that further \ndelayed their confirmation.\n  I respect him highly for his good work as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I respect him for the fact that he was able to keep his \ncommitment to both myself and Senator Salazar on these two individuals. \nSenator Salazar and I worked hard to work out an agreement where we \ncould fill at least two of the vacancies of the three existing \nvacancies on the District Court of Colorado.\n  I also compliment my good friend and colleague Senator Salazar for \nbeing willing to work with me to meet the needs of this district court. \nWhen you have three vacancies on a district court, they are reaching \nthe status of what we call emergency status. That means there is \nconsiderable more workload there because of the vacancies, and as a \nresult of that it begins to impede their ability to deal with the cases \nthat might come before that district court.\n  I also state for the record that this is a court that deals with a \nvery heavy workload and probably should have an additional seat on the \nbench there in this district court because of the heavy workload we \nhave in the Colorado District Court.\n\n\n                             Philip Brimmer\n\n  I would like to take a moment to talk about the two fine individuals \non whom Senator Salazar and I ended up agreeing--first of all, in \nregard to Mr. Brimmer.\n  Mr. Brimmer is an outstanding lawyer. He is a graduate of Harvard and \nYale Law School, institutions that provided him with tremendous \nanalytical tools and an arsenal of knowledge which have served him well \nin his career.\n  Upon graduation from law school, Mr. Brimmer spent 2 years clerking \nfor the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. Thereafter, \nhe joined a Denver law firm, where he spent 7 years in private practice \nbefore making a decision to devote his career to public service. This \ndecision led Mr. Brimmer to the Denver District Attorney's Office, \nserving first as a deputy district\n\n[[Page S9601]]\n\nattorney and later promoted to chief deputy district attorney,\n  Former District Attorney and current Governor of Colorado Bill Ritter \nwrote, ``throughout Mr. Brimmer's service at the Denver District \nAttorney's Office, he upheld the highest standards of integrity, \nfairness, honesty, hard work--and a dedication to public service.'' \nGovernor Ritter felt he could trust Phil Brimmer with the most \nchallenging cases that came through the office; Phil Brimmer did not \ndisappoint.\n  Current Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey recently wrote of \nhis former colleague in a similar fashion. ``[Phil Brimmer] never \nfailed to impress me both with his work ethic and his knowledge of the \nlaw . . . He was one of our most valued attorneys.'' The sentiments of \nGovernor Ritter and District Attorney Morrissey are reflected in \nnumerous other letters sent to my office from people who worked with \nMr. Brimmer throughout the years.\n  Similar to his experience as deputy district attorney, Mr. Brimmer \nhas been exceptionally successful as Federal prosecutor. Almost 7 years \nago, he joined the U.S. Attorney's Office as an assistant U.S. attorney \nand has worked on an assortment of criminal cases as chief of the major \ncrimes section and now as chief of special prosecutions section.\n  As chief of special prosecutions in the U.S. Attorney's Office, Mr. \nBrimmer handled very challenging and procedurally complex case, dealing \nwith an assortment of crimes, including child exploitation, cyber \ncrimes, capital crimes, and prison crimes. Attorney general of Colorado \nJohn Suthers hired Phil Brimmer in the fall of 2001, recognizing his \n``excellent work ethic'' and his ``tremendous intellectual \ncapability''. It seems Mr. Brimmer continues to impress everyone he \nworks beside as he continues to serve Colorado's legal community with \ngreat distinction.\n  Anyone familiar with Philip Brimmer's professional credentials can \nattest to his intelligence and his talent. Anyone familiar with Philip \nBrimmer, as an individual, would certainly observe that he is \nrespectful, loyal, and good-humored. His integrity, honesty and \nprofessional dedication to public service also contribute to making \nPhilip Brimmer a ``rare find.''\n  From my conversations with Mr. Brimmer, it is clear that he \nrecognizes the proper role of the judiciary. His personal qualities and \ncharacter, coupled with his professional experience, an ABA rating of \n``well qualified'', and outstanding bipartisan recommendations from \nwithin Colorado's legal community make Philip Brimmer ideally suited to \nservice on the federal district court.\n\n\n                           christine arguello\n\n  I would also like to welcome Ms. Christine Arguello to the U.S. \nSenate.\n  This is not my first endorsement of Ms. Arguello. In 1999, I made a \nrecommendation to then President Clinton to nominate Ms. Arguello for a \nseat on the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. This past \nJanuary, I again offered her name to President Bush and urged he \nconsider nominating Christine Arguello to fill a vacant judgeship on \nColorado's Federal district court.\n  I speak before the Senate today in support of the nomination of this \nfine lawyer for service on the Federal bench. In her more than 25 years \nof legal experience, she has worn many different hats. She has \nexperience as a trial lawyer, in-house counsel, law professor, and \npublic servant.\n  She is a skilled attorney with impressive credentials and a diverse \nprofessional background.\n  Ms. Arguello earned her undergraduate degree from the University of \nColorado and her law degree from Harvard. She began her distinguished \nprofessional career working as an associate for a law firm. She moved \nto a public service career after 19 years of private practice when she \njoined the Colorado Attorney General's Office, where she served as the \nchief deputy attorney general under the former attorney general, and \nnow my currently Senate colleague, Ken Salazar.\n  In 2003, she returned to private practice as a civilian litigation \nattorney, and in 2006 she assumed her current job as managing senior \nassociate counsel for the University of Colorado at Boulder.\n  She has been described by many as a trailblazer. Ms. Arguello and the \nwide-ranging experiences and accomplishments she brings with her would \nmake her a great asset to the Federal bench. In addition to being the \nfirst Hispanic from Colorado to be admitted to Harvard Law School and \nthe first Hispanic to be promoted to partner at one of the ``big four'' \nlaw firms in Colorado, Ms. Arguello has added law professor to a long \nlist of accomplishments.\n  She became a tenured professor at the University of Kansas Law School \nand joined the faculty at the University of Colorado School of Law and \nthe University of Denver College of Law as an adjunct professor and \nvisiting professor, respectively.\n  It is with a great deal of pleasure that I am able to see to \nconclusion the confirmation of Phil Brimmer and Christine Arguello to \nthe District Court of Colorado.\n  Again, I cannot say how thankful I am I have a good friend and \ncolleague such as Senator Ken Salazar who is willing to work with me on \nissues that are facing the Colorado District Court and many other \nissues that are facing the State of Colorado.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I seek recognition under morning \nbusiness and wish to speak about the economic crisis facing the Nation. \nI will be brief because I think we need less deeds and more action.\n  Mr. President, we do have an economic crisis. We do have a credit \ncrisis. We need to be able to protect our economy, we need to act to \nprotect the taxpayer, and we need to act to protect the distressed \nhomeowner.\n  I am frustrated and deeply troubled. I am deeply troubled by where we \nfind ourselves when I observe that House Republicans are defying their \nown President. Our economy is in trouble.\n  Yesterday, leadership on both sides of the aisle and both sides of \nthe dome went to the White House at the President's request to try to \ndeal with this issue. To my surprise, House Republicans poked their own \nPresident in the eye and derailed a plan that we were developing. Now \nwe need action. And I say to President Bush, we need Presidential \nleadership. We need a situation room. We need a situation room not at \nCNN, we need an economic situation room at the White House.\n  I ask the President, while all of this hubbub is going on on Capitol \nHill, to be the commander in chief of the economy. We need a commander \nin chief of the economy. I ask him to do what he has done as Commander \nin Chief, to listen to his generals. He has Paulson, he has Bernanke, \nand he also needs to get his Republican troops in line.\n  Yesterday we had a method and we had momentum for working on this \nproblem. I salute my Senate colleagues, Senator Dodd, the chairman of \nthe Banking Committee, and his Democrats. But I also salute the \nRepublicans in the Senate, on a bipartisan basis. They were working \nmethodically, they were working steadily, and they were acting \nresponsibly. We had a plan.\n  What happened is the Republican House became afraid of voters. I know \nwe need to listen to voters. I am getting the same kind of e-mails they \nare. In the last 72 hours, I have received close to 8,000 e-mails and \nonly 30 were for this plan.\n  I have received over 1,300 phone calls and almost all were against \nthe bailout and why they are against the bailout. They wonder who is on \ntheir side, who is looking out for them; who is going to bail them out \nof their stagnant wages; who is going to bail them out of their rising, \nescalating health care; who is going to bail them out when they are \ntrying to pay their utility and put gas in their car and buy groceries. \nSeniors are wondering who is going to bail them out as they try to make \nsure they do not outlive their income. We listened to them loudly and \nclearly. Yet what we need to be able to do is not only respond to them, \nwe need to be able to respond to this credit crisis.\n  Make no mistake, if we do not act we could lose jobs that could \naffect small business and ordinary homeowners. It could cause massive \nor significant temporary layoffs.\n  Now, I am for reform. I absolutely do want reform. I believe we were \nworking\n\n[[Page S9602]]\n\nto get it. We have to get back on track, and the President needs to get \nus back on track.\n  I believe what the Senate was doing protected the economy by putting \ncapital where it needed to go. It also protected the taxpayer by making \nsure that we had a stake in the outcome. We absolutely also forbade \ngolden parachutes and put a cap on compensation. Again, we made sure \nthat those who created the crisis do not further gouge us by profiting \noff the crisis. We had methods and we had momentum for both solving the \ncrisis and at the same time bringing reform. But in the midst of it, \nthe House Republicans decided they were going to do their own plan and \ncome up with some kind of insurance plan. Well, where were they 2 days \nbefore that?\n  Then, the Republican Presidential nominee parachuted in, ran back and \nforth on both sides of the Capitol and huffed and puffed. Huffing and \npuffing will not do it. We have had too much huff, we have had too much \npuff, and there is now a need for Presidential leadership.\n  I am glad the Republican nominee decided to go to Mississippi and \ndebate. That is where we will debate the economic future of the United \nStates of America. Tonight's topic should be on the economy. We should \nlisten to the Republican nominee and the Democratic nominee. We need to \nhear their ideas on the future of the economy of the United States, how \nthey will be the next commander in chief of the economy; how that will \ncreate jobs that stay in the United States of America and pay a living \nwage, not a survivable wage; how they will deal with the skyrocketing \ncost of health care.\n  How are we going to deal with energy? It affects utilities and gas \nand, therefore, groceries. We need that debate because it is on the \neconomic future, and I am glad he is going.\n  And here, while they are in Mississippi debating, we should begin to \nact. I ask that the President create this economic situation room. I am \nproud of my Senate colleagues. I salute the Republicans on the other \nside for working. We all worked together. We have all had to set aside, \nin these last couple of days, the outcome we wanted.\n  I am at heart and soul a reformer. I wanted more reform. I want more \nteeth in the Securities and Exchange Commission where they do not just \nbark, that they bite. I was one of the people 10 years ago who voted \nagainst deregulation of the financial institutions. But we could not \nget that much reform in this package. We can do that on another day.\n  I stood on the floor of the Senate and said I wanted retribution for \nthose who created fraud and engaged in predatory practices against \nunsuspecting homeowners. I want them investigated. I want people to go \nto jail. That is why, as chair of the committee that funds the FBI, we \nput money into the Federal checkbook so we can now have the FBI agents \nout there doing forensics, looking at the books of those people who \ntried to cook the books.\n  So, sure, I am for reform, and I am for retribution. But right now we \nhave to focus on rescue. So let's get it together. Let's put politics \naside. I believe the Senate is acting that way. The House Republicans \nneed to act that way. But the one person who has called us to come \ntogether, the President of the United States, has now got to go hands \non, to listen to his generals, get his troops in line, and let's win \nthis battle for America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to say to Senator Mikulski how much \nI appreciate her words of passion, of leadership. I think she laid it \nout for the American people. We are on their side. We want to make sure \nwe address their concerns.\n  The fact is, it looked as though we had a framework, I say to my \nfriend, that was workable. The fact is, we had brought together people \nfrom both sides. Sadly, that was all disrupted when Presidential \npolitics got involved.\n  Now, I want to say something from the heart. I know all of my \ncolleagues agree with what I say. On an issue such as this one, which \nis kind of a once-in-a-lifetime--we certainly hope for us--issue, where \nwe are in a crisis situation, where we are being told by the \nPresident's men who have not handled this economy with any, in my \nopinion, skill at this moment in time, it is one of those votes that is \ngoing to be a vote of conscience for each of us. It is going to be a \nvote we think about. A lot of us are already losing sleep about this \nsubject. This is tough stuff. And no Presidential candidate is going to \ntell me how to vote--with all due respect to John McCain--whether he \nflies in or flies out or whatever he does. This Senator, and, frankly, \nI think Senators--Republicans, Democrats, Independents--each Senator \nwill vote their constituents' interests, what they think is best for \ntheir families, for the small businesses, to keep the economy going, \nwhat is right for taxpayers, what is right to get to the root cause of \nthe problem.\n  I want to say that as far as I am concerned, frankly, Senator McCain \nhas one vote, and so do I. My vote will be my vote and no one else is \ngoing to tell me how to vote for my people. I felt that passion in my \nfriend's remarks. It is very sad that we have lost the momentum that \nshe talked about. But I believe we will get it back.\n  I know our chairman of the Banking Committee, Chris Dodd, has an open \ndoor. I know he is waiting for the Republicans to walk back in and say: \nLet's get to work across party lines. We hope they will do that.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3999\n\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Klobuchar and myself, I ask \nunanimous consent to move a bill that would be very important for this \neconomy that we know is suffering, very important for jobs, and very \nimportant to save lives. It is a bill that would immediately make $1 \nbillion available to rebuild our Nation's bridges.\n  It passed out of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and it \npassed the full House of Representatives. Why? Because we do not want \nto see another bridge go down in Minnesota or any other place. Yes, we \nbelieve it is important to move in this direction to save lives, to \nrebuild our infrastructure, and to create jobs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 1050, H.R. 3999; that the bill be read a \nthird time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very disturbed and disheartened that \nour Republican friends would object to such a bill at such a time. \nDuring rush hour on August 1, 2007, the I-35 West bridge in Minneapolis \ncollapsed, sending dozens of cars into the Mississippi River. This \ntragedy, which every American remembers well, claimed the lives of 13 \npeople.\n  Just to see that bridge go down broke your heart. It served, though, \nas a wake-up call--at least we thought it did--that we cannot neglect \nour Nation's crumbling infrastructure. Half of all the bridges in this \ncountry were built before 1964, the average age of a bridge in the \nnational bridge inventory is 43 years old, and 26 percent of our \nbridges are deficient. Yet the Republicans will not allow this \nbipartisan bill to go through. It shouldn't take a tragedy such as the \none in Minneapolis to remind us that the safety of our bridges and \nhighways and other infrastructure can be a matter of life and death.\n  Senator Klobuchar and Chairman Oberstar have worked to address these \nproblems. That bill I asked unanimous consent to pass today, the \nNational Highway Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection Act of 2008, will \nbegin those repairs.\n  I beg my Republican friends to wake up and smell the roses. A bridge \ncollapsed. We need to rebuild our bridges and put people to work to do \nit. If we have enough money to rebuild Iraq, we ought to have enough \nmoney to rebuild bridges in this country that are a danger to our \npeople.\n  The I-35 tragedy claimed the lives of 13 people. It has also served \nas an urgent wake-up call that we cannot neglect our Nation's crumbling \ninfrastructure.\n  The National Transportation Safety Board has not yet issued the \nresults of\n\n[[Page S9603]]\n\nits investigation into the Minnesota bridge collapse, but we do know \nthat additional resources are needed to repair and replace aging \nbridges and highways across our Nation.\n  Half of all bridges in this country were built before 1964, and the \naverage age of a bridge in the National Bridge Inventory is 43 years \nold.\n  Of approximately 600,000 bridges nationwide, about 26 percent are \nconsidered deficient.\n  This means we need to make significant investments just to maintain \nour bridges at safe functioning levels, followed by even larger \ninvestments over the next 20 to 30 years to completely replace aging \nbridges.\n  It should not take a tragedy like the one in Minneapolis to remind us \nthat the safety of our bridges, highways, and other infrastructure can \nbe a matter of life and death.\n  Senator Klobuchar and Chairman Oberstar have worked together to \naddress problems with our Nation's bridges by introducing legislation \nentitled, the National Highway Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection Act \nof 2008.\n  The House version of this legislation, H.R. 3999, was approved by an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote of 357 to 55 in the House of \nRepresentatives on July 24 and was approved the Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works by voice vote on September 17.\n  This legislation makes changes to the requirements set forth in the \nHighway Bridge Program, while authorizing a one-time additional $1 \nbillion for bridge repair and replacement.\n  One key provision in this legislation is a requirement for the \nDepartment of Transportation to develop a national risk-based priority \nsystem for the repair, rehabilitation or replacement of each \nstructurally deficient or functionally obsolete bridge.\n  We have great challenges before us. But at the end of the day it is a \nmatter of setting priorities.\n  If we are going to keep our people safe and our economy strong and \nhealthy, we need to make a serious investment in our transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following letters of support \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          American Society of Civil Engineers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2008.\n     Hon. James Oberstar,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Transportation and \n         Infrastructure, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Mica,\n     Ranking Member, House Committee on Transportation and \n         Infrastructure, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica: On \n     behalf of the more than 140,000 members of the American \n     Society of Civil Engineers we offer our strong support for \n     the National Highway System Bridge Reconstruction Initiative \n     (H.R. 3999).\n       According to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), \n     approximately 74,000 U.S. bridges are classified as \n     structurally deficient. Furthermore, the U.S. DOT estimates \n     it would cost $65 billion to fix all existing bridge \n     deficiencies.\n       This proposal is an important step toward addressing the \n     problem of our nation's crumbling infrastructure. It makes \n     constructive improvements to the current system by outlining \n     bridge inspector qualifications and improving federal \n     oversight of state inspections. Any bridge safety program \n     should be based on providing for public safety first.\n       Successfully and efficiently addressing the nation's \n     failing infrastructure, bridges and highways and other public \n     works systems, will require a long-term, comprehensive \n     nationwide strategy--including identifying potential \n     financing methods and investment requirements. For the safety \n     and security of our families, we, as a nation, can no longer \n     afford to ignore this growing problem. We must demand \n     leadership from our elected officials, because without \n     action, aging infrastructure represents a growing threat to \n     public health, safety, and welfare, as well as to the \n     economic well-being of our nation.\n       Once again, ASCE is grateful for your leadership on this \n     most important problem. If we can be of any assistance in \n     this matter, please do not hesitate to contact Brian \n     Pallasch, ASCE Managing Director of Government Relations & \n     Infrastructure Initiatives, at (202) 789-7842 or at \n     bpallasch@asce.org.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  David G.

James Oberstar,\n     Chairman, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Oberstar: The American Road and \n     Transportation Builders Association (ARTBA) strongly supports \n     the National Highway Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection \n     Act, H.R. 3999. Your proposal would generate federal \n     leadership in response to a national need, setting priorities \n     and establishing the accountability Americans demand and \n     deserve.\n       The collapse of the 1-35 W Bridge August 1, 2007, is a \n     stark reminder the U.S. transportation system is not keeping \n     pace with the demands being placed on it and that tragic \n     consequences can occur when warning signs are not acted upon. \n     According to the Federal Highway Administration, more than \n     one-quarter of all bridges on the NHS are considered either \n     functionally obsolete or structurally deficient. The U.S. \n     Department of Transportation also estimates at least $65 \n     billion could be invested immediately in a cost-beneficial \n     fashion to address existing bridge deficiencies.\n       The nation has vast unmet bridge needs that are well \n     documented and irrefutable. The U.S., however, is not just \n     suffering from a bridge crisis; it is suffering from a \n     transportation infrastructure crisis. We need to dramatically \n     upgrade the nation's bridges, roadways and public \n     transportation facilities and increased investment is a \n     critical part of the solution. The U.S. transportation \n     network is a holistic system and we must begin the process of \n     addressing all of these needs in a meaningful way as soon as \n     possible. H.R. 3999 is a logical first step toward a \n     restructuring of the core federal highway and public \n     transportation programs to address unmet national needs in \n     the 2009 reauthorization of the federal highway and transit \n     programs.\n       ARTBA commends your leadership on this critical national \n     issue and pledges to work with you to ensure all U.S. \n     transportation infrastructure needs are met.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   T. Peter Ruane,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Federation of State Pirgs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2008.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative: One year after the tragic collapse of \n     the 1-35 W Bridge in Minneapolis, our country's bridges \n     remain in critical condition and in need of significant \n     funding for maintenance and repair. We strongly urge you to \n     support H.R. 3999, The National Highway Bridge Reconstruction \n     and Inspection Act.\n       The unmet needs of our nation's aging transportation \n     infrastructure endanger the safety and security of American \n     families. While billions in federal funds are spent annually \n     on new highway projects and lane expansion, our existing \n     assets have been left behind. According to the U.S. \n     Department of Transportation, approximately 74,000 bridges in \n     this country are classified as structurally deficient.\n       H.R. 3999 is an important first step towards addressing \n     this national problem. The legislation authorizes dedicated \n     funding for bridge repairs throughout the country and \n     provides minimum inspection standards.\n       The tragedy in Minnesota should serve as a wake-up call for \n     this Congress, which must embrace an approach to highway \n     spending that prioritizes maintenance and repair of our \n     existing roadways over new capacity. Our country can no \n     longer afford the cost of inaction as our bridges continue to \n     age and deteriorate. Please support H.R. 3999, The National \n     Highway Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection Act.\n           Thank You,\n\n                                                 John Krieger,\n\n                              Staff Attorney, U.S. Public Interest\n     Research Group.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   National Stone,\n\n\n                                    Sand & Gravel Association,\n\n                                                    July 15, 2008.\n     Hon. James Oberstar,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure, \n         House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Oberstar: On behalf of the National Stone, \n     Sand & Gravel Association (SSGA) I wish to commend you for \n     your continued efforts to address the nation's bridge \n     maintenance and repair problems so tragically highlighted by \n     the Minnesota bridge collapse. NSSGA joins our coalition \n     partners in supporting H.R. 3999, the ``National Highway \n     Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection Act.''\n       A key part of the problem facing the nation's \n     transportation system is that it is old with over half of the \n     bridges built before 1964. Interstate bridges, which were \n     primarily constructed in the 1960s, are at the end of their \n     service lives (estimated to be 44 years for bridges built at \n     that time). NSSGA supports the key goals of the legislation \n     that establishes a risk-based priority for replacing bridges \n     along the National Highway System and improving the bridge \n     inspection program. This legislation will ultimately make \n     travel safer and more efficient for all users as older \n     bridges are upgraded to current safety standards and are \n     rebuilt to accommodate increases in traffic.\n       As you are aware, from 1990 to 2005, there has been a 19 \n     percent increase in the nation's population, a 39 percent \n     increase in vehicle miles traveled, but only a 4 percent \n     increase in highway capacity. As you are also aware, a number \n     of reports, including the National Surface Transportation \n     Policy and Revenue\n\n[[Page S9604]]\n\n     Study Commission final report, detail the need for additional \n     funding for the nation's infrastructure along with a \n     suggestion for restructuring the Department of \n     Transportation. H.R. 3999 is a positive step forward in \n     addressing the nation's aging surface transportation \n     infrastructure.\n       According to the U.S. Geological Survey, NSSGA is the \n     largest mining association by product volume in the world and \n     represents the crushed stone, sand and gravel- or aggregate-\n     industries. Our member companies produce more than 90 percent \n     of the crushed stone and 70 percent of the sand and gravel \n     consumed annually in the United States. More than three \n     billion tons of aggregates (or 2.95 billion metric tons) were \n     produced in 2007 at a value of approximately $21 billion, \n     contributing nearly $38 billion to the GDP of the Unites \n     States. Without these important materials, the nation's \n     infrastructure could not be built or maintained, and the \n     commerce and quality of life would be severely reduced. The \n     aggregates industry workforce is made up of about 118,000 men \n     and women. Every $1 million in aggregate sales creates 19.5 \n     jobs, and every dollar of industry output returns $1.58 to \n     the economy. With over 11,000 operations nationwide, most \n     Congressional Districts are home to multiple operations.\n       NSSGA looks forward to working with you and our coalition \n     partners to advance the bridge initiative to improve the \n     safety and stability of the nation's transportation \n     infrastructure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Jennifer Joy Wilson,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Transportation Trades\n\n\n                                           Department, AFL-CIO\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2008.\n     Re: Support the National Highway Bridge Reconstruction and \n         Inspection Act.\n\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the Transportation Trades \n     Department, AFL-CIO (TTD), I urge you to vote in favor of the \n     National Highway Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection Act (H. \n     R. 3999) when it is considered by the House. This important \n     measure will improve the safety of American bridges and \n     decrease the chance of another catastrophic bridge collapse \n     like the one we witnessed almost a year ago in Minneapolis.\n       H.R. 3999 will improve bridge safety and invest in the \n     reconstruction of structurally deficient bridges. \n     Specifically, the bill requires the federal Department of \n     Transportation (DOT) to create a risk-based approach to \n     safety so that states may focus attention on bridges in need \n     of rehabilitation and replacement. In order to receive \n     federal assistance, states will be required to create a five-\n     year performance plan for highway bridge inspection, \n     rehabilitation and replacement specifically for federal-aid \n     highway bridges which are structurally deficient or \n     functionally obsolete.\n       For years, our nation's infrastructure has suffered from an \n     appalling lack of investment. The state of our nation's \n     highway bridges is just one example of what happens when we \n     neglect key aspects of our transportation system. According \n     to the DOT, one out of every eight bridges in the United \n     States is structurally deficient. While this classification \n     does not immediately imply that a bridge will collapse, \n     structurally deficient bridges require significant \n     maintenance and repair to remain in service and eventual \n     rehabilitation or replacement.\n       H.R. 3999 will ensure that bridges are being properly \n     inspected and facilities in need of improvement are \n     identified and prioritized. In addition, the bill authorizes \n     $1 billion to repair, reconstruct and replace structurally \n     deficient bridges. While this money will not fully meet the \n     needs to fix existing bridge deficiencies, it does represent \n     an important down payment and will provide immediate \n     assistance to states in desperate need of bridge repair \n     funding.\n       As we witnessed in Minneapolis, a bridge collapse can have \n     horrific consequences. In addition to the 13 people killed, \n     it is estimated that road user costs totaled $400,000 per day \n     in travel time delays and increased operational costs. \n     Overall, the state's economy lost $61 million for 2007 and \n     2008 as a result of the collapse. Transportation workers and \n     American motorists depend on a safe and reliable highway \n     network. It is clear that we must do more to support this \n     system.\n       Again, I urge you to pass H. R. 3999 and to ensure that \n     this bill becomes law as quickly as possible. If you have any \n     questions or need additional information, please contact me \n     or Brendan Danaher at 202/628-9262.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Edward Wytkind,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            The Associated General\n\n\n                                       Contractors of America,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 21, 2008.\n     Hon. James Oberstar,\n     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n         House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Associated General \n     Contractors of America (AGC), I am writing in support of H.R. \n     3999, the National Highway Bridge Reconstruction and \n     Inspection Act of 2008. As a targeted, nationwide bride \n     repair and reconstruction program, your initiative would \n     provide another $1 billion in critically-needed federal \n     resources for states to continue efforts to better identify \n     and address their most at-risk bridges.\n       Nearly one year after the tragic collapse of a span of the \n     I-35 bridge in Minneapolis, which brought national attention \n     to the state of the nation's bridges, the country continues \n     to under invest in its transportation infrastructure. In \n     2007, in response to this tragedy, Congress provided an \n     additional $1 billion for states to begin addressing their \n     most at-risk bridges; however, estimates show that the \n     problem is much more widespread--more than a quarter of the \n     nation's bridges have structural problems or fail to meet \n     current design standards. State departments of transportation \n     have undertaken additional inspections and emergency repairs \n     to ensure there are not imminent failures, yet the system \n     still needs an infusion of $65 billion to repair or replace \n     the significant number of bridges that are 50 years or older.\n       In addition, states are struggling to keep pace with the \n     rising prices of many construction inputs: asphalt prices \n     have more than doubled since the beginning of 2008, with \n     increases of as much as 40 percent announced in many regions \n     since July 1; on-highway diesel fuel costs have risen 68 \n     percent in the past 12 month; reinforcing steel (rebar) has \n     roughly doubled since the beginning of 2008; and the price of \n     construction plastics, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe \n     and plastic fencing and moisture barriers, have risen 10 to \n     25 percent since early 2008.\n       While bridges are a vital link in the nation's \n     transportation network, they are but one component of the \n     intermodal system that supports our $14 trillion economy. \n     Likewise, other system needs exist and require solutions to \n     address a variety of mobility challenges. Unfortunately, the \n     Minneapolis tragedy is but a symptom of a bigger, looming \n     infrastructure crisis in this country which involves all \n     modes of infrastructure in addition to surface \n     transportation, including aviation, water infrastructure, \n     flood control, and navigation. Recognizing the committee's \n     hard work to address these needs through other legislative \n     efforts, your bridge initiative is an important first step \n     towards fixing the long-term neglect of our nation's aging \n     and deteriorating infrastructure.\n       Again, AGC strongly supports H.R. 3999, and looks forward \n     to working with you to enact this worthy legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Stephen E. Sandherr,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               American Council on\n\n\n                                        Engineering Companies,\n\n                                     Washingon, DC, July 15, 2008.\n     Hon. James Oberstar,\n     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the American Council of \n     Engineering Companies (ACEC)--the voice of America's \n     engineering industry--I wanted to express our strong support \n     for H.R. 3999, the National Highway Bridge Reconstruction and \n     Inspection Act and applaud your leadership in addressing the \n     shortcomings of our national bridge program.\n       ACEC member firms are involved in every aspect of bridge \n     planning, design and inspection. As you know, ACEC members \n     testified before your committee and others about the need for \n     a risk-based approach to bridge inspections and repair and \n     rehabilitation decisions. Thank you for incorporating our \n     recommendations into the bill. Improving existing inspection \n     procedures and techniques, as called for in H.R. 3999, will \n     allow states and the federal government to better allocate \n     limited resources. The bill rightly calls for priority \n     consideration based on safety, serviceability, and the impact \n     on regional and national freight and passenger mobility.\n       ACEC strongly supports the requirement in the bill that \n     bridge program managers and critical bridge inspection team \n     leaders be licensed professional engineers. While we \n     recognize the value of experience in bridge inspections, \n     there is no replacement for the rigorous education, testing \n     and standards for professional licensing. We firmly believe \n     that a licensed professional engineer, qualified to practice \n     structural engineering, should be in ``responsible charge'' \n     of every bridge safety inspection.\n       Finally, ACEC appreciates the inclusion of a $5 million \n     grant program to evaluate the effectiveness, accuracy and \n     reliability of advanced condition assessment inspection \n     processes and technologies. As noted in our testimony, \n     inspectors are often limited in time and resources to visual \n     or other simple inspections that provide only an immediate \n     snapshot of bridge conditions, existing and emerging \n     deficiencies, and any potential hazards. Significant safety \n     improvements can be found in emerging technologies such as \n     fiber optic, vibrating wire, acoustical emissions, and peak \n     strain displacement for monitoring and evaluating the \n     structural health of a highway bridge. The pilot program in \n     the bill will help move these technologies forward.\n       For these reasons, ACEC supports passage of H.R. 3999. We \n     look forward to working with you on this and other \n     transportation infrastructure legislation in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 David A.

Mr. President, today Senator Ensign and I have introduced a \nresolution designating October 16, 2008, Lights On Afterschool Day. \nLights on Afterschool brings students, parents, educators, lawmakers, \nand community and business leaders together to celebrate afterschool \nprograms. This year, more than 1 million Americans are expected to \nattend about 7,500 events designed to raise awareness and support for \nthese much needed programs.\n  In America today, 1 in 4 youth, more than 14 million children, go \nhome alone after the school day ends. This includes more than 40,000 \nkindergartners and almost 4 million middle school students in grades \nsix to eight. On the other hand, only 6.5 million children, or \napproximately 11 percent of school-aged children, participate in \nafterschool programs. An additional 15 million would participate if a \nquality program were available in their community.\n  Lights On Afterschool, a national celebration of afterschool \nprograms, is celebrated every October in communities nationwide to call \nattention to the importance of afterschool programs for America's \nchildren, families, and communities. Lights On Afterschool was launched \nin October 2000 with celebrations in more than 1,200 communities \nnationwide. The event has grown from 1,200 celebrations in 2001 to more \nthan 7,500 today. This October, 1 million Americans will celebrate \nLights On Afterschool!\n  Quality afterschool programs should be available to children in all \ncommunities. These programs support working families and prevent kids \nfrom being both victims and perpetrators of violent crime. They also \nhelp parents in balancing work and home life. Quality afterschool \nprograms help to engage students in their communities, and when \nstudents are engaged, they are more successful in their educational \nendeavors.\n  In our work on the Senate Afterschool Caucus, Senator Ensign and I \nhave been working for more than 4 years to impress upon our colleagues \nthe importance of afterschool programming. It is our hope that they \nwill join us on October 16 to celebrate the importance of afterschool \nprograms in their communities back home.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

They have been indicating to \nus most of this year that we have a strong economy in this country and \nindicated that there have been some problems with toxic mortgage-backed \nsecurities that have gone sour and so they have dealt with them in a \nnumber of ways, but still indicated that the economy is essentially \nstrong and the fundamentals are all right.\n  But in recent weeks, especially, step after step taken by the \nTreasury Secretary and the Federal Reserve Board is to commit American \ntaxpayers' dollars to try to remedy some very serious problems in the \neconomy. The discussion these days--especially in the last few days--\nhas been about a proposal by the President and his Secretary of the \nTreasury for $700 billion as a rescue fund for the economy. What most \npeople are not talking about is the fact that we have already committed \n$1 trillion for this purpose before the Congress would vote on $700 \nbillion more. Let me describe why.\n  When Bear Stearns went belly up, the Federal Reserve Board provided \n$29 billion to buy Bear Stearns to J.P. Morgan, so that was taxpayer \nmoney. That is our guarantee: $300 billion through the Fed window \ndirect lending to investment banks. For the first time in the history \nof this country, the Federal Reserve Board opened its lending window to \nnonregulated, unregulated banks. So investment banks go to the Fed: \n$300 billion.\n  Fannie and Freddie. We assumed the liability of Fannie and Freddie. \nThat is $200 billion.\n  When Lehman went belly up, the funding was provided by the taxpayers \nfor J.P. Morgan to buy Lehman Brothers: $87 billion. American \nInternational Group: $85 billion. Propping up money market funds: $50 \nbillion.\n  That is $1.7 trillion in total, $700 billion of which is before this \nCongress as a proposition by the President for a rescue fund.\n  Now, the reason I wanted to visit about this today is it seems to me \nthis is a proposition--if you equate it to a bathtub--of suggesting \nthat we put water in the bathtub before we plug in the drain, you are \nnot going to fill the bathtub. You are just going to put water in the \ntop and it is going to drain out the bottom.\n  This morning I woke up, as did most Americans, to discover one of \nAmerica's largest banks had failed and had been purchased by an \ninvestment bank overnight. The purchase was arranged by the Federal \nReserve Board. So I was curious about this: Washington Mutual, one of \nAmerica's largest banks. I went back to take a look to see what the \npresident of Washington Mutual earned last year. Obviously, the bank \nwas headed, apparently, toward a crash landing someplace. Well, Mr. \nKerry Killinger, the president of Washington Mutual, which was bought \nlast evening by J.P. Morgan, earned $14 million in compensation last \nyear. Fourteen million dollars was paid--to the CEO of a company that \nlast night we were told was going belly up--with insured deposits, so \nour Government arranged a purchase by an investment bank called J.P. \nMorgan.\n  Now, there is another piece to the story. Washington Mutual, which \nfailed last evening, not only paid its CEO $14 million last year; it \nhired a new chief executive officer weeks ago. By the way, the new \nchief executive officer 3 weeks ago signed with a bonus of $7 million. \nAnd we are told this morning that the new CEO, having been on the job 3 \nweeks for Washington Mutual, now purchased by J.P. Morgan, will keep--\nlikely keep--the $7 million bonus signed 3 weeks ago, and 12 million \nadditional dollars as a severance. Three weeks' work: $19 million.\n  Now, I was trying to figure out: Here are some folks at the top of \nthe food chain on these big companies, how\n\n[[Page S9608]]\n\nmuch money they are making. Well, as I said, last year the CEO of a \ncompany that went belly up last night made $14 million, and the \nreplacement, working 3 weeks, will make $19 million. What does $19 \nmillion equate to? Well, I figured at $50,000 a year for an average \nsalary in this country, it would take 382 years for a worker to earn \nwhat this man is going to get in severance payments and bonuses for a \n3-week stint in a failed company. Unbelievable. Absolutely \nunbelievable. But it is a hood ornament on a carnival of greed that has \nexisted now for some while, unabated, in which people at the top have \nmade massive quantities of money. Then the whole thing comes crashing \ndown because they began creating exotic securities that were supported, \nin some cases, by worthless mortgages, placed by bad brokers and, in \nsome cases, bad mortgage companies; sold up the chain to hedge funds \nand investments banks, all of them making massive quantities of money, \nand then it goes belly up and everybody wonders why.\n  So I asked the question: What do all of these folks make? How much \nmoney did they make as this was collapsing? Well, some of these, I am \nsure, are perfectly good people with good reputations. Stanley O'Neal, \npeople tell me he is a good guy. Last year he made $161 million with \nMerrill Lynch. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs, last year he made $54 \nmillion. John Thain, Merrill Lynch, he made $83 million last year. I am \njust talking about 2007 published compensation numbers. John Mack at \nMorgan Stanley made $41 million. James Cayne at Bear Stearns made $34 \nmillion. Poor Martin Sullivan down here at AIG, that went belly up, he \nonly made $14 million, and we had to come up with $85 billion of the \ntaxpayers' money to backstop this company. The CEO made $14 million \nlast year.\n  I mentioned Washington Mutual went belly up last year; the biggest \nbank failure in the history of this country. What did the CEO make last \nyear? Fourteen million dollars in compensation.\n  So the question is: What does all this mean? On Wall Street--on Wall \nStreet alone--in the past 3 years--not salaries, bonuses--have \nrepresented $100 billion. Let me say that again. It is almost too big \nto comprehend. In the last 3 years on Wall Street, bonuses equaled $100 \nbillion.\n  In 2007, the 500 largest businesses in this country, the CEOs \naveraged $14.2 million. That is about 350 to 400 times the salary of \nthe average worker. Thirty years ago, the average CEO made 30 times \nwhat the average worker made.\n  Let me go back to ground zero and explain what caused all of this and \nthen why I am concerned about what is happening around here. I have \nspoken on the floor many times, but I am going to do it again, because \nI want people to understand what is at the root of all of this. They \nsay: Well, there are toxic securities being held by all of these \ninstitutions, and when you have toxic assets that have devalued and \naren't worth anything, it threatens the lifeblood of the institution. \nSome of them go belly up, right? So how do they have all of these toxic \nmortgages, these securities? Here is what they did. A bunch of the \nsmartest guys in the room, a bunch of high flyers, said: You know what \nlet's do? Let's securitize things and then we can move them up the \nchain and sell them and resell them.\n\n  It used to be: You want to get a home mortgage? Go downtown. Go to \nthe businesses that make home mortgages--a bank or a savings and loan--\nsit across from somebody who knows about it and negotiate it and sign a \npaper, and then they held your mortgage. And if you had a little \ntrouble, you said: I am having a little trouble making this month's \npayment. That is the way it used to work. Kind of a sleepy industry \nthat allowed people to get home mortgages in their hometown and that is \nwhere the mortgage paper was.\n  Now, if you go down and get a mortgage, or perhaps a broker will call \nyou and solicit you to get a mortgage under this regime, and they will \nsell it immediately, and then they will sell it up and somebody will \nsecuritize it with a bunch of other mortgages. Then they will resell \nthat, and pretty soon you have mortgage securities. As I have said \noften, it is like packing sausage in sawdust and slicing them up and \nselling them up the line. They didn't have the foggiest idea of what \nwas in these securitizations.\n  So this is all about big yields. This is all about greed. Here is the \norigin of that greed. The biggest mortgage company in the country is \nbankrupt now, taken over by somebody else. In fact, the guy who ran \nthis, Mr. Mozilo, escaped this with over $50 million, so he is sitting \npretty well. This company, Countrywide, here is what they advertised. \nThey said: Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \nmortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? Call us. We \nwill give you a loan. Bad credit? Call us. Biggest mortgage banker in \nthe country.\n  Mr. Mozilo, who grew this company, was given the Horatio Alger Award \na couple of years ago, listed as one of the most respected top \nbusinessmen in America. The company is gone, of course, now.\n  Millennia Mortgage. I don't know who ran Millennia Mortgage. Twelve \nmonths, no mortgage payment. That is right; we will give you the money \nto make your first 12 payments if you call in 7 days. We will pay it \nfor you. Our loan program may reduce your current monthly payment by as \nmuch as 50 percent and allow you no payments for the first 12 months. \nCall us today.\n  Here is the example that all of us have seen. Zoom Credit. I don't \nknow who ran this company. Credit approval is seconds away. Get on the \nfast track at Zoom Credit. At the speed of light, Zoom Credit will \npreapprove you for a car loan, a home loan, or credit card. Even if \nyour credit is in the tank, Zoom Credit is like money in the bank. We \nspecialize in credit repair and debt consolidation. Hey, listen: \nBankruptcy, slow credit, no credit, who cares? Come get a mortgage from \nus.\n  All over this country, people filled with greed, companies saying, \nCome and get a mortgage. In fact, I tell you what. We will allow you to \nget a mortgage from us with what is called a no doc loan. What does \nthat mean? It means you don't have to document your income. It is \ncalled a no doc loan. We will give you a mortgage and you don't have to \ndocument your income. In fact, here is what you find on the Internet \nabout that. No doc and low doc. Is that English? Yes, it is English. No \ndoc. These mortgage companies said, We would like to give you a \nmortgage, a home mortgage, and you don't have to document your income \nfor us. You just heard me say these companies say: You got bad credit, \nslow credit, no pay, been bankrupt? Come to us. They also say this: We \nwill give you one without having to document your income to us.\n  Then they say this: You know what. You don't have to pay any \nprincipal--interest only. No documentation of your income and interest \nonly. But they say, If that is not good enough, we will tell you what. \nYou not only pay interest only, we will make your first 12 months \npayments for you, and then you pay interest only. But if that is not \ngood enough, you don't pay any principal and you don't pay full \ninterest; we will actually cut part of your interest and have no \nprincipal and add it to the back end of your loan after you have gotten \na loan from us with no documentation of your income. Been bankrupt? Are \nyou a bad credit risk? Come to us.\n  So now here is the trick, and here is how it all worked. Once they \ngot you to do this, they locked in what was called prepayment \npenalties, and they said: If you get this mortgage, you should \nunderstand we are going to cut your monthly payment by a fourth. Are \nyou paying $800 a month now? Get a mortgage from us, it will cost you \n$200 a month. That is a good deal. Now, it is going to reset with a new \ninterest rate in 3 years. We want you to know that. We won't exactly \ntell you what that is going to mean; we will fuzz that up for you. But, \nof course, they never said you won't possibly be able to afford the \npayments in 3 years because the interest rate is going to go to 10 \npercent.\n  What they did is they put in a prepayment penalty that was very \nsubstantial which meant that when this reset with a much higher \ninterest rate and a much higher payment, people could not repay it, \nthey could not prepay it to get out of the mortgage. That is the basis \non which they slice up these mortgages and send them forward because \nthey said these have very\n\n[[Page S9609]]\n\nhigh yields with these prepayment penalties; we locked them into big \ninterest rates in the outyears.\n  Two million Americans are going to lose their houses this year \nbecause of this kind of trash. This is not good business. This is not \ncapitalism as we know it. This is unfettered greed.\n  Two million Americans will lose their homes this year. Think of that. \nThink of 2 million supper tables across this country, sitting around \nwith the kids and the spouse saying: We are going to lose our house and \nthere is not a thing we can do about it. Two million times this year?\n  In addition to that, which I think is the most important piece of \nthis sad story, in addition to 2 million people losing their homes, \nthen we see the consequences of all these bad, toxic securities, \nmortgage-backed securities lying in the bowels of these big investment \nbanks and regular banks as well, whose deposits are insured by the \nFederal Government. When they turn sour, it goes belly up. Then we wake \nin the morning and we hear big firms whose names we have been \naccustomed to for years that have been beneficial to this country, \nproviding investment capital for expansion of this country's economy, \nall of a sudden they have gone belly up. Why? Because they are laden \nnow with these toxic mortgages.\n  I went to the Internet yesterday and I found 300 examples of \ncompanies that want to provide loans today; 325 examples under ``home \nloans with no credit check.'' Just today. Try it. Go to the Internet \nand see if you can find companies advertising: Come to us. Bad credit? \nBeen bankrupt? No credit check. Hundreds of them are still doing it. \nThe question is, Why is that being allowed? ``You have bad credit? Get \napproved today.'' These examples I have taken off the Internet in the \nlast 24 hours.\n  Let me go back to one more part of the story. I wish to read \nsomething Franklin Delano Roosevelt said on March 12, 1933. I know with \nall the newfangled securitization, the new rules, new approaches, the \ngrowth of the investment banks and all that, what we have seen, I know \nit is probably old-fashioned to think this way, but here is what \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt did.\n  The banks went belly up during the Great Depression. He created a \nbank holiday and then reopened. But he wouldn't let them do what they \nused to do. The reason they went belly up is because banks were \ninvesting in real estate and securities and they were merging what has \nto be inherently safe and secure--that is banking, and it is not just \nbeing safe and secure with their balance sheet; it is having the \nperception of being safe and secure. If people think you are not safe \nand secure and they run on the bank, I don't care how strong your bank \nis, your bank is going to close its doors. A run on the bank and it is \nover. The perception of safety and security is critical.\n  What we had in the Great Depression is banks merging up with real \nestate. It was go-go time in the roaring twenties. We had banks with \nreal estate and securities and so on. Back in the Great Depression, \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt created something called the Glass-Steagall \nAct. He said: No more. We are separating basic banking from risk. You \nwant to gamble, I say go to Las Vegas. He didn't say it that way back \nin 1934. He said you can't gamble with respect to banks. If you want to \ndo securities, buy, sell, make money, lose money, God bless you, you \nhave the right to do that in this system. If you want to do real estate \nspeculation, you have a right to do that. But no longer will anyone \nhave the right to do that with respect to fundamental banking \nenterprises. He separated them.\n  In 1999, on the floor of this Senate, a financial modernization bill \ncalled the Financial Modernization Act came to this Senate. Senator \nPhil Gramm, Gramm-Leach-Bliley--we have to modernize the financial \nsystem. We are going to take apart Glass-Steagall. We are going to let \nfinancial homogenization occur. You can do one-stop shopping. Let \neverything happen under one big roof. We will create firewalls. It \nturns out the firewalls were made of thin paper.\n  Eight of us voted against that Financial Modernization Act that \nstripped bare the protections put in place in the 1930s that has served \nus 80 years. The Senator from Iowa voted against it. Eight of us voted \nagainst it. I voted against it.\n  I wish to show my colleagues what I said on May 6, 1999, during \ndebate on that bill. I wish I had not been right. But here is what I \nsaid:\n\n       The bill will also, in my judgment, raise the likelihood of \n     future massive taxpayer bailouts.\n\n  I sure wish I hadn't been right. That is exactly the position we find \nourselves in now.\n  I said during that debate:\n\n       Fusing together the idea of banking, which requires not \n     just the safety and soundness to be successful but the \n     perception of safety and soundness, with other inherently \n     risky speculative activity is, in my judgment, unwise . . .\n\n  I said on November 4, 1999, when the conference report came to the \nfloor of the Senate:\n\n     . . . we will in 10 years' time look back and say: We should \n     not have done that because we forgot the lessons of the past.\n\n  As I say, I wish I had not been right.\n  What I see happening these days are proposals I call no-fault \ncapitalism. Things go bad, things turn sour, things go under, you know \nwhat, we will have the taxpayer take care of that. That is not the way \ncapitalism is supposed to work.\n  I am not interested in seeing this economy go down or seeing the \nwreckage of this economy, but I am interested in seeing if we can \ndiscover, even as we try to think through how we fix this situation, \nputting in place protections that will give us some notion of safety as \nwe perceive it.\n  Here is what I think we should do:\n  Restore the firewalls that existed in Glass-Steagall in some form. We \nare going to propose a massive rescue fund of hundreds and hundreds of \nbillions of dollars and not fix this situation? That is unthinkable to \nme, absolutely unthinkable. It makes no sense.\n  Address the wildly excessive compensation on Wall Street. I described \nthe company that went belly up last night. The CEO of that company made \n$14 million last year. For what? The CEO they hired 3 weeks ago got a \n$7 million bonus for signing a new contract and has a $12 million \ntermination contract. So working for 3 weeks in a company that is now \nfailed, bought by an investment bank that is undergirded by the U.S. \ntaxpayers, being able to go to the Federal Reserve bank window for \ndirect lending, a guy who works 3 weeks is going to get $19 million. \nDoes anybody think we have solved this problem of wild speculation and \nwild CEO salaries? I don't think so. At least it doesn't seem that way \nto me.\n  Next, we have to regulate speculative investments by hedge funds and \ninvestment banks. I have been talking about this for 10 years in the \nCongress, and we cannot get it done. If we are not prepared to regulate \nhedge funds and regulate the trading in derivatives, of which, by the \nway there is $46 trillion to $56 trillion of notional value of credit \ndefault swaps right now in this country--think of that--and nobody \nknows exactly where they are, nobody knows who has them all, nobody has \nthe jeopardy of where they exist on someone's balance sheet. We don't \nknow because we have had lots of people in this Congress willing to \nprotect the institutions so they don't have to be regulated.\n  If we decide we are going to do something to provide stability to the \nfinancial system and decide we are not going to regulate hedge funds, \nwe are not going to regulate the trading in derivatives, shame on us. \nShame on us. Yet there is no discussion of that because, well, that is \ntoo complicated. Oh, really? That is more complicated than putting \ntogether $700 billion in a bailout or rescue package? I don't think so.\n  At the bottom of this discussion are the 2 million people who are \nsitting around the supper table talking about losing their homes. \nWouldn't it have been smarter and would it not be smarter that while \nthis repair is taking place that we decide to repair it at the bottom \nrather than pouring at the top, with respect to these toxic mortgages? \nHow about working out family to family, by county, by city, working out \nthe ability when a family can make payments, even at a lower interest \nrate, to keep that family in their house, to begin putting a floor \nunder those mortgages? Wouldn't that make much more sense for \neverybody, including the American taxpayers, including the financial \ninstitutions for whom it costs much more to have an empty home\n\n[[Page S9610]]\n\nforeclosed upon, to dispose of that? Wouldn't it make sense, especially \nfor the families who would like to find a way to work out their \nmortgage? It sure seems so to me.\n  The problem is, they cannot even find somebody to talk to because \nthat mortgage has been put in these little pieces of security sausage, \nso exotic a lot of people don't understand them, and sold upstream \nthree times, and they have all made a fortune. The problem is, the \nfamily is now going to get kicked out of their house, and all those \nfolks who bought these now have toxic mortgages on their balance \nsheets, and we are told: You know what, we should bear the \nresponsibility to solve that problem. I don't think so.\n  We ought to create a taxpayer protection task force to investigate \nand claw back the ill-gotten gains in this whole system. There has been \nno oversight. Regulators have been dead from the neck up for 10 years. \nWe pay them. They are on the job, but they are woefully blind, and \nshame on them. We have a right, it seems to me, and an expectation of \naggressive oversight to find out who cheated, who engaged in predatory \nlending, and who will be made accountable for it. Where is the \naccountability?\n  Finally, this Government has already done almost $1 trillion, let \nalone this $700 billion that is being proposed. Anything we do ought to \nmake certain that the U.S. taxpayers share in the increased values of \nthe very firms that have received the benefit of the backstop of the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  I see no discussion about these issues. All I see is a roundtable \ndiscussion about who is going to provide the money and when and can't \nwe hurry up.\n  I will say one additional thing. It is curious that this \nadministration and others spend most of their day talking this economy \ndown and raising panic. The fact is, this country would be a whole lot \nbetter off talking about how we fix that which caused this problem, \nbeginning with step 1.\n  What Franklin Delano Roosevelt did was not old-fashioned. In fact, it \nis exactly what we need to do now. We need to decide that we are going \nto get in some control of this financial system. Financial \nmodernization, my eye. That is what they called it, financial \nmodernization. It took apart the protection. It allowed an unbelievable \ncarnival of greed to occur with massive money being earned by a few. We \nare not talking about a lot of people. But virtually all the American \npeople now are being asked by some to pay for it. I think it makes no \nsense. I do not intend to support any plan that does not begin to \naddress these issues.\n  Again, I am not somebody who thinks you ought to put water in the \nbathtub before you put the drain in the plug. That is exactly what we \nwould be doing financially if we marched down this road and don't \nrestore Glass-Steagall, don't regulate hedge funds and derivatives, \ndon't deal with the wildly excessive compensation. If we don't do that, \ncount me out; I am not part of this process.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. First, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for perhaps \nthe most lucid and unencumbered description of where we are now and how \nwe got here. So many times we hear these people from Wall Street and \nthe investment firms and they talk in a language that not too many \npeople understand. But when the Senator from North Dakota boils it \ndown, he can get it down to its simple structures so people can \nunderstand. That is the great service that the Senator from North \nDakota has done, to bring it down, as they say, get the hay out so the \ncows can have at it, eat it. That is what he has done. He has gotten it \ndown so we can understand what we are talking about.\n  There is no real magic--``Harry Potter'' magic--in this stuff. This \nis basic finance that can be distilled down to its fundamentals. When \nwe look at those fundamentals, then we can begin to understand what was \ngoing on. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for, again, a very \nlucid presentation.\n  I ask my friend from North Dakota, one of the issues they are talking \nabout in this bailout is oversight. James Galbraith, an economist from \nthe University of Texas, has suggested strongly that we should--if a \nbank or one of these investment firms is going to offer this worthless \npaper for the taxpayers to buy--and, by the way, I keep seeing this as \na government bailout. I think we should call it what it is: a taxpayer \nbailout. The taxpayers have to fund this. But he suggested we should \nlook and make sure we understand and get the internals.\n\n  It is like when a company is going bankrupt and it comes into a bank \nto get a loan. The bank doesn't just say: Show me your balance sheet; \nthey want to know how you got there, what were your internals, what \nwere your models you used to build all this up so we can understand \nwhat is going on. I suggested this to Secretary Paulson the other \nevening. Oh, he said, this is too involved, too difficult to \nunderstand. Well, we better understand it.\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota if he doesn't think it would be \nwise to have some kind of an inspector general, a special kind of \nperson set up to get expertise from outside of the industry, and to \ndemand that if they want to have the taxpayers buy their worthless \npaper, we ought to at least look at everything to see how they got \nthere and what are the models they used. Because I suspect--and this is \nonly my suspicion--that one of the reasons they do not want us to see \nthat is because, as the Senator from North Dakota has pointed out, \nthere has been a lot of accounting fraud going on here.\n  It is like my buying something, then I sell it to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, and he turns around and sells it back to me, and I sell \nit back to him, and everybody makes a profit along the way. Isn't that \nneat? So I ask the Senator from North Dakota if he doesn't think it \nwould be wise, in order to protect the taxpayers now and in the future, \nto demand that we see all the internal operations of their company and \nhow they got there?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa makes a good \npoint. I know Professor Galbraith. He also said we should regulate \nhedge funds. Certainly we must do that, he said, in the context of all \nthis.\n  It is interesting. My dad said: Never buy something from somebody who \nis out of breath. There is a kind of breathless quality to what has \nhappened to us in the last week, with the Federal Reserve Chairman and \nthe Secretary of the Treasury saying, things are going to hell in a \nhand basket; you need to act in 3 days. And they send us a 3-page bill \nsaying, we want $700 billion and we insist no one be able to review our \nwork. There is a kind of a breathless quality to that, isn't there?\n  The Senator asked a question: If there is an investment--and we have \nalready made a good number of investments, almost a trillion dollars--\nif there is an investment in public firms, shouldn't there be some \nresponsibility for the Government and the taxpayer to have access to \nand to understand what is in the balance sheets of those firms? The \nanswer is: Absolutely.\n  We don't even have a standard. You wouldn't give kids an allowance \nwith the standard we have, would you? Almost every kid, in exchange for \ngetting an allowance, has to own up to some sort of chores or some \nduties. This proposition is: Time is of the essence, we have a crisis, \nload up the money and deliver. That makes no sense to me. I know others \nare waiting to speak, but I started yesterday with a quote that I have \nused often, and somehow, at the end of every single major debate we \nhave in this Congress, it ends up going back to that quote from Bob \nWills and the Texas Playboys. Most of my colleagues know it, from my \nhaving used it so often, but it is:\n\n       The little bee sucks the blossom and the big bee gets the \n     honey. The little guy picks the cotton and the big guy gets \n     the money.\n\n  It is always that way, it has always been that way, and it will \nalways be that way, unless we decide to change it. The question is \nwhether in the next days we will decide to do the right thing or we \nwill rush off breathlessly to, one more time on behalf of the American \ntaxpayer, bail out those at the top of the food chain--one of whom made \n$14 million last year as one of the largest banks in the country that \nhe ran and was apparently headed right into the ground.\n  I tell you what: There is a right way to do things and a wrong way to \ndo things, and the wrong thing for us at\n\n[[Page S9611]]\n\nthis point is to decide that we have to meet a midnight hour and ignore \nthe basics of what ought to be done--regulate hedge funds, regulate \nderivative trading, and reinstate some basic modicum of protection that \nexisted from Franklin Delano Roosevelt forward dealing with Glass-\nSteagall and protecting our banking institutions from the riskier \nenterprises. If we don't do those things, we will be back again because \nwe will not have solved the problems that caused this crisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First, before my friend from North Dakota leaves the \nfloor, let me say there is a big problem out there, and I agree with a \nlot of the things he has said. I took a position. I waited 4 days to \ntake a position against the particular approach that the Secretary of \nthe Treasury is recommending, and I did so because I wanted to wait \nuntil I understood as much of it as I could.\n  One of the biggest problems I saw is that, first, the magnitude of \n$700 billion is awfully hard to get your arms around; secondly, who \nwould make the determination as to which institutions we would be \napproaching, and within those institutions which assets, and how do you \nqualify those assets. Then I found out it would be asset managers. Now, \nwould that be 500 asset managers, 5,000? Maybe it will be some of these \nsame people who created the problem in the first place.\n  These are questions that I know people who have their hearts in the \nright place are trying to address. And I agree there is a problem \nlooming out there and we need to correct it, but I am not in any hurry \nto correct it by doing the wrong thing. It is too big a problem.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator from Oklahoma will yield for a question.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Certainly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank him for his courtesy in yielding.\n  I want to say one additional thing which I forgot to say, and ask a \nquestion while I do that.\n  No. 1, it may be that the cure that is being proposed is much worse \nthan the potential that exists without it. Let me tell you what I mean \nby that.\n  On Monday of this week, we had the largest 1-day drop in the value of \nthe U.S. dollar in history. We had the largest 1-day increase in the \nprice of oil in history, accompanied by a 350-point drop in the stock \nmarket. The analysts say it was because they thought people were \nworried about the unbelievable amount of debt, our fiscal policy, our \ntrade policy, and now the proposed bailout debt, but the unbelievable \namount of debt that would erode the value of the U.S. currency.\n  If the electronic herd of currency traders goes after our dollar and \ncollapses our dollar, the consequences for this economy can be far \nworse than that which is described by the Treasury Secretary and the \nFed Chairman. And I am saying it occurs to me that if $700 billion plus \ntips the balance in terms of currency traders evaluating whether they \nwant to come after the dollar, we face a greater peril than that which \nthey suggest if we do nothing.\n  I appreciate the Senator for yielding, because I wanted to make the \npoint about indebtedness. The Government is deep in debt, and we have \nto somehow put it back on track. This issue that is being proposed, as \nyou know, increases to $11.3 trillion our indebtedness.\n  I appreciate the Senator's yielding.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is true, and I think anytime you increase that debt, \nyou are going to be selling to large purchasers somewhere, and those \ncould be foreign countries and others.\n  Another thing I would observe is that things don't happen in a \nvacuum. The Senator from North Dakota mentioned it could result in a \ndevaluation of the dollar. If that happens, one of the major reasons we \nhave high gas prices at the pumps--the major reason is supply and \ndemand, but the other reason is the devaluation of the dollar. So that \nwould be affected also.\n  We need to consider all these things and we need to be deliberate. I \nknow a lot of smart people are in rooms now trying to figure out some \nsolutions, and I hope they come up with a good one and something I can \nsupport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9611-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Brandon Farley\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the reason I came here today was to \nrecognize and pay tribute to SSG Brandon Farley. He is from Haworth, in \nsoutheastern Oklahoma. Since April of 2007, he was assigned to the 1st \nBattalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, and 1st \nInfantry Division at Fort Hood.\n  Brandon died Thursday, September 18, of wounds sustained a day \nearlier when his patrol was attacked by enemy forces in Able Monti, \nAfghanistan. This was his third deployment, serving in Operation \nEnduring Freedom at Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan.\n  Brandon was born in Sulphur Springs, TX, and spent his teenage years \nin Haworth, OK, where he graduated from high school. Soon after \ngraduating from high school, he joined the Marines and served 4 years. \nIt was during those first 4 years in the military that he served his \nfirst tour in Iraq. So he was there first as a marine. Later, he was \nhonorably discharged, went into the National Guard, and then he missed \nthe regular services so he joined the Army. So he was stationed in Iraq \nand Afghanistan both as a marine and as an Army soldier, a truly \noutstanding young man.\n  His uncle William Gilpin is quoted as saying:\n\n       It was his intention to retire from the army. He had a \n     commitment to his country.\n\n  So he was going to stay there for a career; the kind of people we \nlook for all the time.\n  Corey, Brandon's brother, also spoke about his brother's commitment \nand service to the military and our Nation. He said:\n\n       He loved serving his country. He was a go-getter who had \n     talked about joining the military ever since he was 16.\n\n  As Corey talked to him about his deployments, Brandon told him that \nalthough there were good and bad times, he reenlisted because he \n``loved what he was doing.''\n  As the oldest of four, Brandon was committed to his family and \nenjoyed spending lots of time with them and his many friends. He leaves \nbehind his father Wade and mother Sherry, and many others. He is also \nsurvived by a brother and sister-in-law, Corey and Brandy, sisters \nAshlyn and Lauren, and two nephews.\n  Brandon loved being outdoors, four wheeling, and riding his \nmotorcycles around. Brandon's brother Corey said:\n\n       I can remember fishing down at the creek and being outside \n     when we were like 10 or 12 years old. Usually it had \n     something to do with a slingshot or a BB gun.\n\n  Brandon's sister Lauren left this heartfelt message to her beloved \nbrother on his on-line guest book:\n\n       Brandon, you are my brave big brother. I miss you so much--\n     words cannot describe. I sit here thinking of you day and \n     night. All the memories we had and all the memories that were \n     cut short. I am so proud of you. You will always be my big \n     brother. Thank you for all you have done for us. All my love, \n     your little sis Lauren.\n\n  Lauren's expression of Brandon's bravery is clearly true. With \nbravery and courage he faced war and fought for our freedom. He \nwillingly went into battle not only one time but three times. Brandon \nwas a true patriot who gave the ultimate sacrifice--his life--for his \ncountry.\n  A friend wrote in his journal--and I will end with this particularly \ntouching and revealing sentiment:\n\n       You were truly amazing. A dear friend, a top-notch soldier, \n     and a super human being. This is a great loss and it will be \n     grieved greatly. I am so proud of you and bragged about your \n     service all the time. I shed tears for you a little bit but I \n     smile knowing that you believe in God and accepted Christ as \n     your savior and that I will be reunited with you one day. \n     Thank you Brandon.\n\n  It is kind of coincidental. We had three other Oklahomans who died in \na helicopter crash that we visited about yesterday, and all three of \nthem also knew the Lord. So you kind of look at that and you say: Well, \nthis is a wicked time we are in right now, and we will be with you \nshortly. I say to Brandon's family: I pray you will feel God's peace \nand comfort and know that we appreciate you very much and the price \nBrandon paid for us. You will be together again soon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9611-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9611-S9613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, earlier this week I placed on my Web \nsite--\n\n[[Page S9612]]\n\nsanders.senate.gov--a letter to Secretary Paulson, and I asked people \nwho shared the sentiments of that letter to sign a petition. \nEssentially, kind of boiling it down, what the petition says is that at \na time when the middle class is shrinking, and millions of working \npeople are struggling to keep their heads above water; at a time when \nBush's economic policies have done so much harm to so many people--6 \nmillion people have left the middle class and gone into poverty; over 6 \nmillion people have lost their health insurance, millions have lost \ntheir pensions--it does not make a lot of sense for the middle-class \nand working families, who had nothing to do with causing this financial \nmeltdown, to be asked to go substantially more in debt--to the tune of \n$2,200 per person or $9,000 for a family of four. It is not fair; and \nthat, in fact, if a bailout is necessary, it should be the people who \nhave caused the bailout, the people who have benefitted from Bush's \neconomic policies, who should put their money at risk and not the \nmiddle class.\n  As you well know, since President Bush has been in office, there has \nbeen a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 1 \npercent. We have a situation where the top 400 individuals in America \ntoday, since Bush has been in office, have seen an increase in their \nwealth of $670 billion at a time when the middle class is \nshrinking. What the petition says in so many words is those are the \npeople, not working families, who should pay the costs of the bailout.\n\n  I was amazed at the kind of response we received. As of now, we have \nover 37,000 signatures on a petition to Secretary Paulson and President \nBush which says: Your friends, the people who have made out like \nbandits under your reckless economic policies, should pay for this \nbailout, not working families.\n  What I would like to do now is--in addition to these 37,000 \nsignatures on the petition, my office has received thousands of e-mails \nand phone calls, mostly from Vermont but sometimes from other States as \nwell. What I think would be appropriate and refreshing here in the \nSenate is, rather than people hearing my point of view, I think it \nwould be a good idea just to read a few of the e-mails I have been \nreceiving from the State of Vermont as to how ordinary people are \nresponding to President Bush's bailout proposal.\n  Let me start with an e-mail I received from a small town in northern \nVermont, Fairfield, VT:\n\n       Dear Senator Sanders, this e-mail and words themselves \n     cannot express the dismay and disbelief I feel about the \n     current Wall Street crisis and proposed bailout. After \n     pulling down 6, 7, and 8-figure bonuses for flying their \n     respective companies into the ground, these Wall Street \n     geniuses then pulled their golden parachutes and leave it up \n     to the taxpayers to clean up the mess and pay their bills. \n     Unbelievable, just unbelievable.\n       And to make a bad situation tragic, due to the ever-\n     escalating Federal deficit, the bill will be paid by my \n     children and grandchildren.\n       I wish I had a solution to offer you but I don't. All my \n     life I have strived to live within my means and pay my debts. \n     I guess the joke is on me--except I feel more like crying, \n     than laughing. Unbelievable.\n\n  This is from Springfield, VT, a town in southern Vermont:\n\n       Hold fast, Bernie. It took a long time for the banking \n     crisis to develop; don't be pressured into capitulating to a \n     half-baked solution. I'm among the Americans outraged at the \n     undisciplined, arrogant, reckless nature of the markets. Many \n     of us have been quietly toiling away on our workaday jobs and \n     now our wages--our fiscal support of the Federal Government--\n     are all that's between Wall Street and economic free fall. \n     Keep reminding them of who is finally paying the price for \n     that avarice.\n\n  This is from Chester, VT:\n\n       I may not always agree with you on every topic, but I most \n     certainly agree with you on opposing the current (or any \n     future) bailout for private corporations.\n       If I could ask you to share a message with your peers, it \n     would be this: You do not have my permission to take any--\n     any--not so much as a single near worthless penny--of my \n     hard-earned money to reward the people who have mismanaged \n     their businesses.\n       Senator Sanders, thank you for opposing this bailout \n     package.\n\n  From Rupert, VT:\n\n       We are absolutely sickened by the prospect that honest, \n     hard-working, fiscally responsible middle class Americans \n     will have to foot the bill for the Wall Street bailout. While \n     we realize that something must be done to prevent further \n     damage, we have a problem knowing that the very people who \n     caused the problem will literally sail off into the sunset on \n     their yachts. Some type of strictly defined framework must be \n     established to protect our tax dollars from being further \n     pilfered by the greedy denizens that are at the center of \n     this crisis. Also, what about some accountability for what \n     has already been done? What about being forced to pay back \n     the obscene bonuses and salaries earned in the course of this \n     unprecedented example of unscrupulous pillaging.\n       So many Vermonters are struggling to provide their families \n     with the basics right now. It's hard to imagine how something \n     as far-reaching as this crisis could have happened. Yeah, \n     let's hand over the Social Security next.\n       Please do what you can to insist that the bailout be done \n     with strict oversight.\n\n  Waterbury, VT:\n\n       Senator Sanders, you and I may seem to be very different. \n     You are the only one who calls himself a socialist in the \n     Senate. I am in favor of free markets and capitalism. \n     However, we can agree on one thing. The privatization of \n     profits and the socialization of losses is immoral and wrong. \n     To bail out the well-connected on Wall Street, those who \n     thrive on government regulations and monetary policy, is \n     unconscionable. I urge you to reject the bailout of Wall \n     Street that Bush, Paulson and Bernanke propose.\n\n  From Richmond, VT:\n\n       Dear Bernie, my wife and I are both 65 years of age. We \n     both retired this past January. For the past 8 years we have \n     lived under one of the worst administrations in U.S. history. \n     This administration is now asking Congress, just a few weeks \n     shy of one of our most important national elections, to \n     approve a massive financial bailout without strong \n     protections for the American people.\n       As two people who have worked hard all of our lives and who \n     have saved for our retirement, we strongly urge you not to \n     get caught up in this panic attack and to ensure that you \n     give taxpayers strong protections before approving Henry \n     Paulson's bailout.\n       As always, we appreciate your support.\n\n  Newport, VT, right near, on the Canadian border:\n\n       Dear Bernie, thanks for all you do for Vermonters and the \n     Nation. I am sure that you know that if this bailout plan is \n     rushed through, it will make it that much more difficult for \n     the next administration to address our already dire problems, \n     such as education and health care.\n\n  Brattleboro, VT, which is the other end of the State, down in the \nsouth:\n\n       Please vote against any bailout of these investment \n     concerns that have made risky, unwise actions and now expect \n     us to cover their mistakes. The Bush administration began \n     with the Enron debacle and it now seems that scheme to \n     deprive hard-working Americans of their money is being \n     applied to the country as a whole.\n       Congress has already given away sizable authority to the \n     executive branch via the PATRIOT Act in the wake of 9/11. It \n     has no right to give the White House and its Secretary of the \n     Treasury the power to transfer the people's money to the \n     richest bankers in the country. Vote no on the bailout \n     legislation.\n\n  Burlington, VT, the largest city in the State, where I live:\n\n       We know that you are a leader in this and are very \n     appreciative. We are very concerned about the Bush \n     administration's proposed bailout legislation. We don't \n     believe that extremely wealthy investment bankers who engaged \n     in irresponsible, risky behavior deserve to be bailed out. We \n     would like to see you craft the support legislation that \n     provides relief to homeowners facing foreclosure and middle \n     class people about to retire, for example. Please do not \n     force middle class folks in general to pay for the efforts of \n     the wealthiest people among us to further enrich themselves.\n       We hope Congress will not rush to pass legislation that it \n     and the American people will regret for a generation.\n\n  St. Albans, VT, in the northern part of the State:\n\n       Senator Sanders, I know you are busy, but I just wanted to \n     express my opposition to the latest bailout of the mortgage \n     industry. While I don't want to see the economy crash and \n     burn, I also don't want to see the banks and bankers \n     responsible just be able to wash their hands and walk away \n     while leaving generations of Americans paying for their mess. \n     I feel if we need to purchase these bad debts, we should do \n     so in true venture capitalist fashion and offer pennies on \n     the dollar, just enough so that the banks don't fail but not \n     enough for them to show any type of profit. In addition, \n     there should be a proviso denying any officer of any of the \n     banks that accept this bailout any sort of bonus.\n\n  Mr. President, these are just a handful of the e-mails my office has \nreceived. I know my office is not alone. I don't know how many hundreds \nof thousands of these e-mails have come to Capitol Hill, but the number \nis enormous. I think what most of them are saying--what the vast \nmajority of them are saying--is that after 8 years of Bush's economic \npolicies which have benefited the wealthy and the powerful at the \nexpense of the middle class, it\n\n[[Page S9613]]\n\nwould be immoral, it would be absurd to ask the middle class to have to \npay for this bailout.\n  I hope Members of the Congress will be listening to their \nconstituents, will show the courage to stand up to the wealthy \nfinancial campaign contributors who have so much influence over what we \ndo here and to say to the upper 1 percent: You are the people who have \nbenefited from Bush's policies. You are the people who are going to \nhave to pay for this bailout, not the middle class.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9613-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9613-S9614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LOOKING AFTER MAIN STREET\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I have listened to so many speeches today--really \nyesterday, this week--about our problems and our plight in this country \neconomically. I have listened to a lot of blame and, quite frankly, \nthere is a lot of blame to go around, including on the shoulders of \nevery one of us here.\n  But I think the American people are interested not in the past but in \nthe future. As our leaders have appointed designees to negotiate what \nhopefully will be a successful package, I think it is now time to start \ntalking about what can be rather than what was. And what can be is a \nreturn to prosperity and confidence in the United States of America.\n  I think there are four component parts that must be a part of this \npackage I believe our leadership is working on. First and foremost, \nthey need to understand we have to worry about Main Street and not Wall \nStreet.\n  In my State, Main Street is Slappey Boulevard in Albany; it is \nAbercorn Highway in Savannah; it is Whitlock Avenue in my hometown of \nMarietta; and it is Peachtree Street in downtown Atlanta. The people \nwho live on those streets, who have life savings and 401(K)s and IRAs, \nhave concerns. Let's talk about the prospects for the future. The \nprospects for the future right now are quite grim without an \narrangement, without an agreement in this Congress to deal with the \ncurrent financial stress that is taking place in our financial \ninstitutions.\n  We are going to have some protracted, difficult times. But if we rise \nto the occasion, if we, in fact, do what things we need to do in the \nnext 48 hours, we can change the future for the better. It is our \nresponsibility, and it is our job.\n  First of all, in looking after those Main Streets in our home States \nand our hometowns, what we need to do is return confidence. We need to \nreturn confidence by, first of all, having our financial institutions \nstrengthened. What Secretary Paulson proposed, what is now being \ncurrently debated in terms of a $700 billion authorization to purchase \nassets that are troubled from financial institutions is an important \npart of that solution.\n  It is also, and little has been said about this, an opportunity for \nthe United States of America to stabilize the financial markets and \nover time to recover not only the cost of stabilizing them but actually \nget a return. For example, if the Treasury is authorized to purchase \nmortgage-backed securities that today are on the books at marked-down \nmarket value to zero, at 50 cents on the dollar, hold those to \nmaturity. If those default rates on those mortgages hold, which today \nare somewhere between 9 and 12 percent, the margin could be as high as \n25 to 38 percent in terms of held to maturity. In fact, as the market \nreturns, those securities could, in fact, be sold by the Treasury at a \nmargin above the 50 cents on the dollar that was paid for them.\n  It is an opportunity that can work and, finally, an opportunity that \nwill make our financial markets much stronger. Will it bail out Wall \nStreet? No. Wall Street has taken its hits. Lehman Brothers is broke. \nAIG is liquidated. The remaining investment bankers on Wall Street have \nasked to come under FDIC regulation. And Bear Stearns lost 90 percent \nof its value. Wall Street has taken a hit, and a significant one.\n  We do not want Main Street to take it. This proposal has the \nopportunity to solidify the balance sheets of the local savings and \nloan and of the local bank that your customers and your citizens on \nMain Street deal with every day, which right now are under stress.\n  The second thing we need to do is to ensure the American people \nunderstand we have the oversight over the Treasury during the \ndisposition of these funds so that we know the funds are being handled \nin an accountable way. Our leaders are negotiating right now precisely \nthat type of oversight, so the Congress knows, not on a quarterly basis \nbut on a daily basis, what the Treasury is doing and how the program is \nworking.\n  Third, it has to include and address the fact that a lot of CEOs in a \nlot of troubled companies have run away with large packages of money. \nThat has been very offensive to the American people and, quite frankly, \nvery offensive to me, the most recent of which took place last night \nwith Washington Mutual.\n  It is appropriate if financial institutions come to the Treasury of \nthe United States and the taxpayers of our country and ask for \nassistance in the purchase of these securities in order to stabilize \ntheir balance sheets, that there be accountability in terms of \nexecutive compensation to those taxpayers who are funding that bill.\n  Then, fourth, we need to start talking about the greatness of this \ncountry and the confidence we have that we can return. Our difficulties \nnow are somewhat of a crisis of confidence in our country and in its \nfinancial system. As elected officials Republicans and Democrats alike, \nin these next 48 hours, it is critical for us to understand that \nnothing is more important in the financial markets than the confidence \nof the consumer. The American consumer is the person who resides on \nMain Street and is the person I was elected to represent and will.\n  We need to recognize also there is a second phase to this recovery. \nAfter we finally do get the financial markets stabilized--I think the \nproposal by the Secretary has the opportunity to do that--we need to \nunderstand three things have to happen. First, this country has to get \nits arms around our energy crisis and solve it.\n  I have enjoyed working with the Presiding Officer on programs such as \nthat. When we return in January, our first priority must be to open all \nof our resources, lessen our dependence, and become independent from \nforeign imported oil and independent with our own sources of energy. \nWhether it is biodiesel, whether it is diesel, nuclear, whether it is \ncoal-to-liquid, whether it is solar--it ought to be all of them. We are \na great country with enough natural resources to be independent in \nterms of our energy. Second, we have to get a handle on our debt, and \nthis package that is being negotiated has the opportunity to do that \nbecause a part of it should ensure that the proceeds we receive in \nreturn for the assets we buy at a discount in the beginning go not to \nthe general fund but go to pay the debt of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  In time, this exercise can in fact reduce our debt obligations rather \nthan increase them. But we need to ensure that is part of the package. \nThen, finally, it is very important for us to understand it is not just \nour income in balancing your balance sheets, it is our out-go. We have \nbeen spending too much money as a Congress of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  One of the more disappointing things I have experienced in the Senate \nhas been our failure on many years to not do appropriations bills in an \norderly fashion. We end up doing them as a combination, as a minibus or \nomnibus where instead of debating the finer points of a particular \nappropriation, we develop a gigantic piece of legislation that none of \nus knows every facet of when it comes to spending.\n  So as we look after Main Street today by finding a solution to bring \nstability to our financial markets, and we can do it, and do it in an \naccountable way, let's also recognize that when we return, as our \nmarkets solidify, let's do the things the people of America elected us \nto do: hold the Treasury accountable, find a solution to our energy \ndependence, make sure\n\n[[Page S9614]]\n\nwe do not spend too much money, and restore to the American people the \nconfidence in our budgetary process that they have in their own around \nthe kitchen table.\n  We are a great country because we have always risen to the occasion. \nThere may have never before been, domestically, a more difficult \nfinancial occasion than the one we face today. In the hours ahead, I \nhope we will rise and come to a conclusion that will benefit the \ntaxpayers on Wall Street and will ensure the financial stability and \nthe confidence of American consumers in this great economy and our \ngreat country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I rise to speak about H.R. 3999, which is the \ncompanion bill to the bill that Senator Durbin and I introduced in the \nSenate about bridges and bridge repair. Senator Boxer today asked that \nthis bill be called up. It successfully was passed through our \ncommittee, the Environment and Public Works Committee. She asked that \nthe bill be called up because, obviously, we are in the waning days of \nthe session, and we believed this was an incredibly important bill for \nthis country.\n  Unfortunately, the other side blocked this bill; they would not allow \nthis bill to be heard. I would like to make some comments about the \nobjection from the other side to this bill.\n  I do not understand it. I think everyone knows what happened in \nMinnesota. On August 1, our Nation was shocked to learn that this \neight-lane highway in the middle of Minnesota, the I-35W bridge, \ncollapsed. I have said many times after that terrible day that a bridge \nshould not fall down in the middle of America, not a bridge that is an \neight-lane freeway, not a bridge that is six blocks from my house, not \na bridge that I drive my 13-year-old daughter over every day.\n  Now, as you know, there has been great progress in rebuilding that \nbridge. In fact, we have a new bridge. That bridge opened about a week \nago, and that new bridge spans the river. We are very proud of the \nworkers who worked on that bridge. But it is also a spot of great \nsadness as we remember the 13 people who died, the 50-some people who \nwere injured, the 100-some cars that went into the river, and all of \nthe rescue workers who saved so many lives.\n  We must still get to the bottom of why this enormous bridge fell into \nthe middle of the Mississippi River. It did not happen because of an \nearthquake or a barge collision; something went terribly wrong. We need \nto get the answer. Evidence is accumulating that the bridge's condition \nhad been deteriorating for years, and that it had been a subject of \ngrowing concern with the Minnesota Department of Transportation.\n  This was not a bridge over troubled waters; this was a troubled \nbridge over waters. Still, as a former prosecutor, like the Presiding \nOfficer, I know we must wait until all of the facts and evidence are in \nbefore we reach a verdict. We will need to be patient as the \ninvestigation continues.\n  Mark Rosenker, the Chairman of the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, said last month that the NTSB investigation is nearing \ncompletion, that a final report should be ready for public release very \nsoon.\n  The chairman also said that photographs of the gusset plate, which \nwere a half inch thick and warped, were stressed by the weight of the \nbridge and may have been a key indicator to the dangerous state of the \nI-35W bridge.\n  Now we know that this was most likely a design defect in the bridge, \nbut the Chairman has said recently that these photographs show that \nthere were some visible problems. So we will await the report to see \nwhat the NTSB thinks about that. But clearly there was some indication \nthat there were problems with this bridge.\n  Finally, the bridge collapse in Minnesota has shown that America \nneeds to come to grips with the broader question about our \ndeteriorating infrastructure. The Minnesota bridge disaster shocked \nAmericans into realizing how important it is to have a safe, sound \ninfrastructure. Because we also have learned that another bridge in our \nState, and I think you have seen this across the country, had a similar \ndesign.\n  We have actually looked at all of our bridges in Minnesota. We have \nanother bridge that is also closed down in the middle of St. Cloud, MN, \na midsized city. This bridge has been closed down. And we look all over \nthe country and we have problems with our infrastructure.\n  According to the Federal Highway Administration, more than 25 percent \nof the Nation's 600,000 bridges are either structurally deficient or \nfunctionally obsolete.\n  Unfortunately, it took a disaster such as the bridge in our State to \nput the issue of infrastructure investment squarely on the national \nagenda. Of the 25 percent of the Nation's bridges that have been found \nto be in need of repair--the 600,000--74,000 come into the category of \nstructurally deficient. In my home State, that means 1,579 bridges are \nconsidered structurally deficient. There is virtually no way to drive \nin or out of any State without going over one of these bridges. When \nthe average age of a bridge in the country is 43 years and 25 percent \nof all American bridges are in need of repair or replacement, it is \ntime to act.\n  Recently, the Government Accountability Office released a study \nraising several issues regarding the Federal Highway Bridge Program. \nFirst, the program has expanded from improving deficient bridges to \ninclude funding criteria that make nearly all bridges eligible. Second, \nStates are able to transfer bridge program funds to other \ntransportation projects. Third, there are disincentives for States to \nreduce their inventories of deficient bridges since doing so would \nreduce their Federal bridge funds. Finally, GAO noted that the long-\nterm trend is more bridges in need of repair and the cost of repair \nrising as well. In other words, the Highway Bridge Fund is not fiscally \nsustainable.\n  A few weeks ago, Transportation Secretary Peters announced that the \nFederal highway trust fund would not be able to meet its obligations. \nWe replenished that fund, but that is not enough. We all know that is \nnot enough. That is why Senator Durbin and I introduced S. 3338, the \nNational Highway Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection Act, which is a \ncompanion bill to H.R. 3999, the bill Congressman Oberstar successfully \nauthored and moved through the House. In the House, there was much \nRepublican support for the bill. It passed by a wide margin.\n  The reason I care about it is, after we looked at what happened with \nour bridge in Minnesota, we found out that about 50 percent of the \nHighway Bridge Fund, Federal funds, had not been used for bridge \nmaintenance. It had been used for other things. This was all across the \ncountry. We found out they were used for a construction project, used \nto plant flowers, all kinds of things. We think if we have a Highway \nBridge Program, that money should be used for bridge maintenance and \nbridge reconstruction.\n  At the hearing Chairman Boxer had on this topic, we actually had some \ninteresting testimony from witnesses who talked about the fact that \nbridge maintenance is never a very sexy thing. People don't like to do \nthat as much because it doesn't involve cutting ribbons and new \nprojects. There are all kinds of actual reasons we have not been \nputting the money that we should into bridge maintenance.\n  What our bill does is require the Federal Highway Administration and \nState transportation departments to develop plans to begin repairing \nand replacing bridges that pose the greatest risk to the public. This \ntriages it and says: Let's look at the bridges that are most in need of \nrepair and let's put our money there first. I cannot believe my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle would object to that kind of \nidea, that we should actually make sure we are repairing the most \nseriously problematic bridges first.\n  It would also require the Federal Highway Administration to develop \nnew bridge inspection standards and procedures that use the best \ntechnology available. You wouldn't believe some of the old technology \nthat is still being used. As time goes on, we have developed new and \nmore advanced technology, and that technology is\n\n[[Page S9615]]\n\nwhat should be used in order to examine bridges and figure out what is \nwrong with them and which ones should be repaired. As I mentioned, \nbecause some of the States have been transferring their bridge repairs \nto highway maintenance programs to use for wildflower plantings or road \nconstruction, this bill also ensures that Federal bridge funds can only \nbe transferred when a State no longer has bridges on the national \nhighway system that are eligible for replacement.\n  Anyone out there, if they heard that bridge money was going to other \nthings, it wouldn't make sense to them, when we have bridges falling in \nthe middle of America.\n  Finally, this bill authorizes an additional $1 billion for the \nreconstruction of structurally deficient bridges that are part of the \nnational highway system.\n  When you look at what we do here, we first improve the safety of \nthese bridges. We do it by using a risk-based prioritization, a triage \nof reconstruction of deficient bridges. It has with it an independent \nreview. It has with it a performance plan. It doesn't allow earmarking. \nIt says: Let's look at where the most seriously deficient bridges are \nand go there first.\n  Secondly, it strengthens bridge inspection standards and processes. \nIt requires the immediate update of bridge inspection standards. We had \na lot of testimony on this as to why it is important because we have \nnew information and reasons we want to update the standards. Certainly, \nthe bridge collapse in Minnesota showed we want increased scrutiny of \ninspection standards. We are going to await that report. We do know \nthere may have been some problems with the inspection. It was a design \ndefect initially, but there may have been problems with the inspection. \nThat is why we want to upgrade.\n  Third, we increase the investment for the reconstruction of \nstructurally deficient bridges on the national highway system, $1 \nbillion. If they are spending $10 billion a month in Iraq, it boggles \nmy mind why the other side would block us from trying to spend $1 \nbillion on bridges in America that are sorely in need of repair.\n  That is our plan. That is what we are trying to do. It is a start. We \nall know there is a lot more work that needs to be done and that will \nbe done in the Transportation bill that our committee will be \nconsidering next year. We know work has to be done with funding with an \ninfrastructure bank, to look at other ways to fund our transportation \nsystem. We know we need to do better with the increasing cost of \ngasoline, with public transportation and other ways of travel. We also \nknow we have a burgeoning energy economy, which is exciting for the \nrural areas of my State, with wind and solar and geothermal and \nbiomass. As we know from projects across the country, we will need \nbetter transportation systems to transport energy to market. Yet we \nhave failed to improve our transportation system. If we are going to \nmove into the next century's economy, we cannot be stuck in the last \ncentury's transportation system.\n  This bill will at least make sure our most seriously dangerous \nbridges are repaired and maintained. It is a start. That is why I am \nasking my colleagues on the other side of the aisle not to block this \nbill, not to add a bunch of amendments that have not gone through \ncommittee because we are in the waning days of the session. We only \nhave the House bill now, because that is the easiest vehicle to use, \neven though the Senate bill was exactly the same. Then we don't have to \nhave a conference committee. We just want to get this done. I am \nhopeful this will head us in the right direction toward action. As we \nlearned that August 1 day in Minnesota, we cannot afford to wait. We \nhave to get this done.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 2 years ago I started conducting \noversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission. I did it only in \nresponse to a whistleblower who came to my office complaining that the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission supervisors were pulling their \npunches in their investigation of major hedge funds. Nearly a year and \na half ago, I came to this floor to introduce an important piece of \nlegislation based on what I learned from my oversight 6 months before. \nThe bill was aimed at closing a loophole in our security laws.\n  Now, in light of all the discussion going on about the problems of \nour financial markets and Wall Street and a very unusual weekend \nsession we are having, as people are attempting to work compromises to \nhelp on Wall Street in light of all this current instability, it is \ncritical that Senators take another look at this bill I introduced. It \nis S. 1402, introduced a year and a half ago, not just because it has \nbecome clear that we have a lot of financial problems up on Wall \nStreet. S. 1402 is called the Hedge Fund Registration Act. It is pretty \nsimple. It is only two pages long. All it does is clarify that the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission has the authority to require hedge \nfunds to register so the Government knows who they are and what they \nare doing. In other words, a little transparency that seems to be \nlacking in our ability to quantify the instruments that are securitized \nmortgages that are creating problems. So if there was a little more \ntransparency there, unrelated to the issue I bring before the Senate, \ntransparency makes a difference. We know what is going on. We quantify \nit.\n  Given the Securities and Exchange Commission's current attempts to \nhalt the manipulative short selling and other transactions by hedge \nfunds that threaten the stability of our markets, I am disappointed the \nSenate did not adopt this legislation a long time ago. If it had, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission might have more of the tools it \nneeds now in these very nervous markets.\n  One major cause of the current crisis is, as I have said just now, \nthe lack of transparency. Markets need a free flow of information to \nfunction properly. Transparency was the focus of our system of \nsecurities regulations adopted in the 1930s. Unfortunately, over time, \nthe wizards of Wall Street figured out a million clever ways of \navoiding transparency. The result is the confusion and uncertainty \nfueling the crisis we are trying to solve this weekend on the helping \nof Wall Street financially and stopping a credit crunch in this \ncountry. This bill would have been one important step toward greater \ntransparency on Wall Street, but so far it has been a lonely effort on \nmy part from the standpoint of this bill I introduced a year and a half \nago. Perhaps attitudes have changed in the last several months, so I \nwould urge my colleagues to support this legislation and help me assure \nit becomes law.\n  Technically speaking, the bill would amend section 203(b)(3) of the \nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940. It would narrow the current exemption \nfrom registration for certain investment advisers. This exemption is \nused by large, private pooled investment vehicles, commonly referred to \nas ``hedge funds.'' Hedge funds are operated by advisers who manage \nbillions of dollars for groups of wealthy investors in total secrecy. \nThey should at least have to register with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, such as other advisers do.\n  Currently, the exemption applies to any investment adviser who had \nfewer than 15 clients in the preceding year and who does not hold \nhimself out to the public as an investment adviser. The Hedge Fund \nRegistration Act I introduced narrows this exemption and closes a \nloophole in the securities laws that these hedge funds use to avoid \nregistering with the Securities and Exchange Commission and operate in \nsecret. Hedge funds affect regular investors. They affect markets as a \nwhole.\n  My oversight of the SEC has convinced me that the Commission and the \nself-regulatory organizations need much more information about the \nactivities of hedge funds in order to protect the markets. \nOrganizations that wield hundreds of billions of dollars in market \npower every day should be registered with the agency Americans rely on \nto regulate financial markets.\n\n[[Page S9616]]\n\n  As I explained when I first introduced this bill 1\\1/2\\ years ago, \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission has already attempted to do this \nby regulation. So bravo, SEC. In other words, they acted, and bravo to \nthem. But Congress needs to act now because of a decision by a Federal \nappeals court. In 2006, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals overturned an \nSEC administrative rule that required registration of these same hedge \nfunds. That decision effectively ended all registration of hedge funds \nwith the SEC unless and until Congress takes action--hence, my \nlegislation.\n  The Hedge Fund Registration Act would respond to the court decisions \nby narrowing the current registration exemption and bring much-needed \ntransparency to hedge funds. Most people say the devil is in the \ndetails. Well, let's go over the details so I am not trying to hide \nsomething.\n  The bill would authorize the Securities and Exchange Commission to \nrequire all investment advisers, including hedge fund managers, to \nregister with the SEC. Only those that meet all four of the following \ncriteria would be exempt. No. 1, managed less than $50 million; No. 2, \nhad fewer than 15 clients; No. 3, did not hold himself out to the \npublic as an investment adviser; and, No. 4, managed the assets of \nfewer than 15 investors, regardless of whether investment is direct or \nthrough a pooled investment vehicle, such as a hedge fund.\n  The Hedge Fund Registration Act is a first step in ensuring that the \nSEC simply has clear authority to do what it already tried to do and \nthe courts said it could not do. Congress must act to ensure that our \nlaws are kept up to date as new types of investments appear. \nUnfortunately, this legislation, introduced more than a year and a half \nago, has not had many friends. These funds do not want people to know \nwhat they do and have fought hard to keep it that way. Well, I think \nthat is all the more reason to shed some sunlight on them, to see what \nthey are up to so maybe a couple years from now we are not dealing with \nproblems the hedge funds have caused.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support this legislation, as we \nwork to protect all investors, large and small. It does not prohibit \nanything. It just makes sure these folks are registered and that you \nknow who they are and how many there are. That is something we ought to \nknow. It does need to be emphasized that we ought to know that in this \nday, when we are dealing with the problems we are here on this Friday \nnight and Saturday and Sunday and Monday to find a solution to, the \nWall Street problems this country now faces.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. WHITEHOUSE). Will the Senator withhold his \nsuggestion of the absence of a quorum?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Oh, yes. I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I commend our ranking member on the Finance \nCommittee for the excellent job he has done. He has talked a good bit \nabout what needs to be done for the future to make sure we do not get \ninto another crisis such as this. I share his view, and I believe now \nthis body will have to address, as soon as we come back after the \nelections, a wide range of articles and bills that have been \nintroduced.\n  I sent a letter, about 2 weeks ago, to the Secretary of the Treasury, \nthe Chairman of the Fed, and the Chairman of the SEC, with copies to \nthe leaders of the Banking Committee, talking about some of these \npieces of legislation.\n  One of the things the Senator from Iowa mentioned is the need to have \nmore transparency--transparency in hedge funds. Transparency has been \nlacking. We have seen Wall Street develop many new products, \nderivatives. There is a new thing called a credit default swap, which I \nsee that New York is regulating as an insurance product. Obviously, \nthat has played a significant role in financial activities and could \nprovide a problem if there is not proper oversight either as an option \nor as an insurance product. That is something we are going to have to \naddress.\n  A couple days ago, I introduced legislation which had been \nrecommended by the Secretary of the Treasury for a Mortgage Origination \nCommission. Essentially, right now, we have too many people who are \noffering mortgages that are not regulated under the existing systems. \nBanks and savings and loans, obviously, are regulated at the State \nlevel. But we have many people who are offering mortgages by fax and by \ne-mail. I cannot get good enough spam filters on my computer at home to \navoid getting those mortgage offers. But I can tell by looking at them \nthat they are too good to be true.\n  Many of these people offered subprime mortgages or alternate ``A'' \nmortgages, which essentially said: We will give you a mortgage, but we \nare not going to check your financial statement, we are not going to \nsee if you are bankrupt or have a criminal record or even if you have a \njob. They issued these mortgages at very attractive rates, with a \nsignificant spike after the initial term and penalties for prepayment, \nand then they went out and the geniuses on Wall Street sliced them and \ndiced them and they took these toxic products and spread the poison \nthroughout our financial system and throughout the world's financial \nsystem. That is why we are in a major crisis.\n  Another major savings and loan went down last night. We have had too \nmany toxic products out there that have not been regulated. The \nMortgage Origination Commission would set up the primary Federal \nregulators of products such as this to set standards for State \nregulation.\n  Having been a Governor, I believe that where a State regulation can \nhandle the protection of its citizens, it oght to do so. I hope my \ncolleagues will consider the Mortgage Origination Commission bill I \nintroduced and act on it because we cannot have unregulated mortgage \noriginators going out and offering ``too good to be true'' deals to \npeople who may be overly anxious to jump at too good a deal.\n\n  This and the emphasis on trying to get people in no downpayment home \nmortgages have been a significant part of the problem. As I have tried \nto say, taking a no downpayment mortgage sets you up to see your \nAmerican dream turn into your American nightmare. Home ownership does \nnot come without headaches. I know about those headaches. We had to \nhave our basement pumped out a few weeks ago. I have had a furnace go \ndown on me. We have to finance it. If you do not have the money to make \na downpayment, you probably are not in a position to take on the \nresponsibilities of a mortgage. Beyond that, before people take a \nmortgage, they need to understand their financial conditions.\n  When I traveled around the State of Missouri this spring, talking to \nhomeowners, to housing advocates, to local officials who had seen the \nforeclosures sweeping across their State, they were using some of the \nmoney I joined with Senator Dodd, the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, in introducing last year and passing last year to put $180 \nmillion in mortgage foreclosure counseling. They were making progress \non helping people restructure their loans. But the most important \nthing: Every single one of those people said: We need to make sure \nevery homeowner who is thinking about buying a home has appropriate \nfinancial counseling. Because if you go into a mortgage without making \nsure it is a mortgage you can afford, you are asking for terrible \ntrauma, disappointment, possibly bankruptcy, ruining your credit by \ntaking on a home you cannot afford or more of a home than you can \nafford. So there are a lot of things that need to be done.\n  I also urge stronger regulation of our government-sponsored \nenterprises. I also advocated that the Securities and Exchange \nCommission reinstate the uptick rule, meaning you can only make a short \nsale if the price is above the last price, preventing a group of hedge \nfunds getting together and driving the price of the stock so low it \ncauses commotion in the financial community and drives that stock down \nto a point where the company can no longer survive.\n  These are some of the steps that need to be taken. I trust we will \nput a high priority, when we return, of making\n\n[[Page S9617]]\n\nsure these regulations are tightened, that we get the kind of \nregulators for GSEs we need, that we enforce vigorously the ``no naked \nshort selling'' rule that should have been enforced and was not.\n  But, as I said earlier, we are in the middle of a crisis, and right \nnow we have some of our very best people working on coming up with an \nappropriate solution to this problem.\n  I came to the floor Tuesday morning and said we need to act, we need \nto act immediately, we need to act smartly and responsibly. That is \nwhat our leaders are doing. I said the three things that were missing \nfrom the Treasury Secretary's proposal were taxpayer protection, \naccountability, and transparency. Oversight is a very important part of \nthat as well. If we do not act now, and act responsibly, we could find \nnext week companies not able to make their payroll. Working families \nwould find that the paycheck they are expecting does not come in, \nbecause I am hearing from people in our State and across the Nation \nthat they cannot get credit. The credit markets are frozen. Possibly, \nthat means no payrolls. It means for small businesses they cannot get \nthe loans to continue to operate. They may be going out of business. \nLarger businesses may be put in a crisis state because they cannot get \ncredit. If the family has home loans, and they want to refinance them, \nthey may not be able to get them refinanced.\n  What this market crisis is doing to the value of retirement accounts \nis truly frightening. A neighbor told me that their 401(k) had dropped \nso much that they were going to have to work well past retirement. I \nsaid: If we can solve this crisis and get the liquidity into it that we \nneed, you can expect that the markets will come back, you can expect \nthat some of that which you have lost will be restored, and we will put \nthe economy back on track to move forward.\n\n  Make no mistake about it, this isn't just talking about big Wall \nStreet firms; this is talking about everybody on Main Street, whether \nit is businesses, whether it is families. For farmers in my country, in \nthe heart of Missouri, most farmers get operating loans in the late \nwinter so they can get the fertilizer, the fuel they need, the seeds \nthey need to plant, or the operations they need to support their \nlivestock industry to make sure they can take care of their cattle, \ntheir hogs. They are not going to be able to get it.\n  So we need to come together as a nation on a bipartisan basis and fix \nthis crisis. We cannot fail. We cannot leave and go home without doing \nsomething; otherwise, we are going to see the implications of this \ncredit crunch. We will see tremendous drops in the markets if we fail \nto do our job. Credit will not be available and this economy will come \nto a crashing halt. This is the kind of outcome we cannot afford.\n  I was very pleased that both Presidential candidates came back to \nmeet at the White House, taking time off from the Presidential \ncampaign, and that shows they are serious and they understand. We need \nto get this job done.\n  I believe most people have heard now that each body has appointed one \nRepublican, one Democrat to sit down and negotiate with the Secretary \nof the Treasury. On our side, I am very pleased that the distinguished \nranking member of the Budget Committee, Judd Gregg, is a negotiator. He \nis a former Governor. He understands the budget implications. I think \nhe is working to make sure the money that is recovered on the loans \nthat are bought is paid back into a debt-reduction fund. I hope that \nwill come out.\n  We need to have, as I said, accountability, transparency, and \nstability, and that is going to be a major part of taxpayer protection.\n  Purchasing the assets at the right value is going to make a big \ndifference. I have talked to people from banks that are operating in a \nsound manner, and they say: Well, why are you helping the people who \nmisbehaved? I said: We are not helping them when we pay 50 cents or 60 \ncents on the dollar for mortgages they hold for which they paid $1. \nWhat we are doing is putting liquidity back in the system.\n  People said: Well, haven't there been criminal violations? I have \nnoted on the floor previously that the FBI started some 1,300 \ninvestigations, as reported in the press. I don't have that fact of my \nown knowledge, but it was reported in the press that there are 1,300 \ncriminal investigations. I hope some of these people who are peddling \nbad paper actually, if they did it with criminal intent, are \nprosecuted. Also, there will be civil and criminal investigations of \nthe people who are operating the companies that went under. I think \npeople want to know there is going to be a very thorough check, to see \nthat if there is any criminal activity, it is appropriately punished. \nMy constituents want to know that.\n  My constituents want to make sure there are no golden parachutes, \nthat there are no bonuses for executives who caused their companies to \ncrash. I believe there has been agreement among the parties and with \nthe administration that those provisions will be included as well.\n  People want to see the economy get moving again. When people \ninitially heard about this, they worried: What are we going to pay $700 \nbillion for? We are not paying out $700 billion without getting \nsomething back for it. We ought to be buying it at a price where we can \nrecover most, if not all, of what we paid.\n  I hope we will get equity in the form of warrants or preferred stock \nfrom companies to cover any shortfall that may occur if we are not able \nto realize the value from the securities we purchased of the amount we \nput into them.\n  All of these things are being worked out. If it sounds complicated, \nif my description is complicated, it is because this is a complicated \npiece of legislation. We are having to act in a manner that is going to \ndemand the very best of all of us in this Chamber and in the other body \nto make sure we get it right and we can agree on it. I hope we will be \nable to take what our negotiators have presented and not try to pick it \napart because if we pick it apart, we are likely to see the whole thing \nfall and not get it done.\n  So we have Judd Gregg on this side. On the House side, my constituent \nand good friend Roy Blunt is leading the way. The House Republicans \nwanted to make sure they had their views heard. I know Roy Blunt will \nrepresent them well. When we went through the effort to get the House \nto pass the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act amendments that I \nworked hard to pass on this floor, Roy Blunt, as the assistant minority \nleader, did an outstanding job helping us negotiate with both \nRepublicans and Democrats to make sure we got the kind of bill that \ncould pass that body and our body. As a result, it did. So I have great \nconfidence in Judd Gregg and Roy Blunt.\n  I know also that the fine Democratic leaders from the heads of the \nbanking committees will do a good job. I hope they do it promptly \nbecause we need to have a solution. We need to take responsible action. \nWe need to make sure there is oversight.\n  I understand they have set up an oversight board that will watch what \nthe Secretary of the Treasury is doing. We will have suggestions for \nthe Secretary of the Treasury on how to make sure he uses the \nmarketplace fairly to get a good value and to use the best information \nthat is available to determine the value of these nonperforming loans, \nprovide homeowners relief, where possible, so they can continue in \ntheir homes, and still pay back enough to make sure the taxpayers are \ncompensated for the Federal dollars that are put up for it.\n  We need transparency, finally, to make sure Americans know their \nmoney is safe, know that the companies in which they have invested, \nhave stock, or have accounts are protected.\n  This is a critically important mission. I don't think anybody wants \nto be working on the weekend, but we are going to be working this \nweekend. I just hope we do it and do it well and do it in a bipartisan \nfashion. After it is over, if you want to throw brickbats at each \nother, we do that well, and there will be plenty of brickbats to throw \nand everybody will take part and we will have a healthy, spirited \ndebate before November. But until we get this solved, this has to be \n``job 1'' for every one of us who is elected to represent people in the \nCongress. We must do it, and we must do it right.\n  I urge my colleagues to give their good ideas to the negotiators for \neach party on each side of the body and follow what they are doing so \nwe can adopt this measure in time to get the\n\n[[Page S9618]]\n\ncredit markets functioning again, to see that our economy gets going.\n  So it is going to be a long, tough weekend, particularly for the \nnegotiators. I am jealous that I don't have the opportunity to stay up \nall night with them and help them, but we have selected good Members to \ndo that job. I wish them well, and I hope they have divine guidance \nbecause it is going to require a little bit of that, along with their \nother skills. It is important we get it done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to also speak about the turmoil \nin our financial markets and the urgent need for a legislative \nsolution. If people around here are looking a little frazzled, it is \nbecause we have been putting in long hours trying to get a solution to \nthis problem, and it is getting closer.\n  As everybody knows, on Wednesday Secretary Paulson and Chairman \nBernanke wrapped up their sales pitch to Congress on how to best rescue \nour economy. The fact remains that there are many questions today, as \nmany as there were before they got here--maybe even more. The U.S. \nTreasury continues to ask Congress for a $700 billion check with as \nlittle accountability as possible about how to spend it. Secretary \nPaulson and Chairman Bernanke have opposed oversight transparency, \nprotections for taxpayers, and everything else, except a check and an \nenvelope to deliver it in. We owe Americans more than just a \nrubberstamp on this proposal. Each American is going to loan $2,300 for \nthis plan. For that price, they want to know why it is necessary, where \ntheir money is going, and if the investment is going to work. \nUnfortunately, I am completely disappointed with the answers so far.\n  Members and staff have worked through the week to address these \nquestions to present a workable solution. Some have found ideas that \ndeserve serious consideration. Others are the same old ideas wrapped in \nnew packaging.\n  The best plan has to rely on three simple principles: accountability \nto the taxpayer, transparency to the Government function, and a clear \nplan of action. The worst plan would be to weigh down a bill with pet \nprojects and special interests that Members were unable to get in the \nlast housing bill.\n  Accountability to the taxpayer means protecting them against \nunexpected and unjustified costs. This is a serious concern of the \nTreasury's plan because no one knows the actual value of the assets the \ntaxpayers are buying, except the seller. The seller dictates the \npurchase price. To protect taxpayers from getting bilked, Treasury \nshould take an equity stake in the companies that participate in this \nplan. If these assets are worth what Treasury buys them for, the option \nwill never be exercised. But we must send a message to investors that \nAmerican taxpayers come first. Years of big firms' unconscionable \nlending has sent our economy into a spiral, and recovery cannot be a \nfree ride for the banks that put us there in the first place.\n  Transparency of Government function is the second necessary principle \nfor an economic fix. Treasury's original plan prohibited agency or \njudicial review of any kind. This provision would have granted complete \nimmunity to the Treasury Secretary and any future Secretary in the \noperation of this $700 billion slush fund. Good governance demands \ntransparency, including proper oversight of this asset portfolio. I \nsupport ideas that insulate the managers of these assets from political \ninfluence and create an independent entity with a chairman who is \naccountable to the taxpayer. Congressional oversight must also be \nvigorous. Congress should expect regular reviews of Treasury's actions, \nand Treasury should not expect mismanagement of the taxpayers' money to \ngo unseen or unpunished.\n  Finally, Congress needs a clear plan of action. The Treasury's \noriginal proposal was only three pages long. It has since grown in \ncomplexity. Secretary Paulson was unable to provide detailed answers to \nessential questions during the hearing at the Senate Banking Committee \non Tuesday. What is the process for hiring asset managers that ensures \nno conflicts of interest? How will the price of assets be set so that \nthey are not too low, causing more bank failures, or too high, crowding \nout private market investment? Perhaps the most important question is, \nWill it work?\n  Secretary Paulson calls this proposal an experiment. I am very \nuncomfortable passing a bill to give Secretary Paulson $700 billion in \ntaxpayer money for an experiment.\n  I understand the urgency of this problem, but our markets and the \nAmerican public need the confidence of a clear plan with measurable \nresults.\n  I again caution my colleagues that this crisis is not an opportunity \nfor Members to pass pet projects they were unable to attach to the last \nhousing stimulus package. In fact, I think there are some problems with \nwhat was done in the last housing stimulus package. Proposals for \nfinancing housing trust funds and authorizing bankruptcy judges to \nrenegotiate mortgages will not correct our markets or restore \nconfidence. These are old ideas with a new coat of paint. Members \ntrying to attach them to this legislation will only serve to politicize \na bipartisan issue and slow our progress toward finding a solution.\n  As I work with my colleagues on a solution to this economic crisis, I \nwill keep three principles in mind: accountability to the taxpayers, \ntransparency of Government function, and a clear plan of action.\n  We are talking about a fundamental change in our Nation's free market \nsystem. This change will come at a high price and with a considerable \namount of pain to Wall Street and to Main Street. However, apprehension \nabout the pain of recovery is no excuse to push a hastily written \nproposal through Congress without blinking. Now is the time these three \nprinciples are needed the most.\n  Our best economic experts state it is not just Wall Street facing \nthis problem. If this economic slide continues, businesses in Wyoming \nand other States could shut down. People could lose their jobs. In the \nworst case scenario, people would have less money to buy goods and \nservices, forcing more businesses to shut their doors and unemployment \nto increase. Banks could bar the gates on credit, effectively halting \nbusiness growth. Even people who have established excellent credit, who \nhave paid their bills on time and kept their financial houses in order \nmay not be able to get the financing they need. Students might not be \nable to get loans for college. Renters might have to stay renters \nbecause no one will loan them the money to buy a house. If no one is \nbuying cars because they cannot get loans, then car dealerships will \nnot be able to sell cars and automakers will not make any. Unemployment \nin this country could skyrocket.\n  These are some of the concerns on my mind as I seek to get a clearer \nidea of the scope and details of what we are dealing with. I have laid \nout the principles that I think are essential. It is my understanding \nthat most of those, in the discussions I have been a part of, are in \nthe package. I appreciate the efforts of those who are working on this \nlegislation, working toward a solution. I appreciate the thoughts and \ninformation I am getting from people in Wyoming.\n  I wouldn't say the majority party leadership said we are likely to \npostpone today's scheduled adjournment of the Senate and come back next \nweek. I say we have to work until we have an acceptable solution.\n  I hope everybody will keep track of what is happening, and I hope the \nprinciples where we have taxpayers' protection and executive \ncompensation limits wind up in the legislation so people who got us \ninto this mess feel the pain of getting us out. That means no golden \nparachutes, taxpayers need equity sharing, and I believe any profits \ngained from this package must be used to reduce the national debt.\n  As the money comes flowing back in from the $700 billion--and there \nwill be money coming back in from it--it has to be used to reduce the \nnational debt. Oversight and transparency--a congressional oversight \nboard has to be in charge of administering these funds. We need \nGovernment accountability. We need office audits. We need an \nindependent inspector general. Perhaps an additional idea that might be \nincluded would be that Congress would first provide Treasury with $250 \nbillion, then\n\n[[Page S9619]]\n\n$100 billion, and then another $350 billion as the oversight shows that \nit is working and it is needed.\n  This is a critical time in the life of our country. We need to come \ntogether and find a solution, and we need to make sure we are watching \nout for the people who are paying the bills--the American taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are all wrestling with what is a real \neconomic challenge and crisis for America. We have a situation where \ncredit, even in good companies and with good individuals in States such \nas Alabama, is becoming more difficult to come by and it has the \npotential to slow down development and economic growth. So I do not \ndeny that there is a real problem out there.\n  The President of the United States and the Secretary of the Treasury \nat some point made a decision that strong action was needed, and since \nthat point their rhetoric has changed from concern and separate and \ndistinct actions to make the situation better, to basically a bold \nthreat to Congress that this economy is in grave danger and that if we \ndon't pass the bill they propose, things could get even worse. That is \na powerful thing. When the President of the United States and the \nSecretary of the Treasury, who are very responsible individuals, make \nsuch a charge, all of us should take it seriously. And as I said, I am \naware of the definite slowdown, particularly in housing, in my State, \nand I don't dismiss that.\n  I will say that in recent days some of the comments made on \ntelevision and other places, to me, are a bit alarmist. It seems once a \ndecision has been made by the Wall Street crowd that this is the right \nthing to do, they use whatever excuse they can find or whatever \nargument they can make and propound that dramatically to ``force a \nrecalcitrant Congress'' to do what they would like to have us do.\n  Well, I have been around. I didn't just fall off the turnip truck. \nYou can turn on the TV and see all of this and get a feel for it. So I \nthink it is a matter of great seriousness, and I respect my colleagues \nwho are working on it, some of whom have been selected, in some way or \nanother, to represent us all; to go and meet with House Members, and I \nguess the administration officials and gurus, and they are going to \ntell us what all we need to do. And on the eve of the election, a big \nfat bill is going to be finally put together and we are going to be \nasked if we are for it or against it. I suspect it may well pass, \nbecause I think people would rather vote for something and go home.\n  Maybe our Secretary can save us. Maybe the master of the universe \nthat he is, he can figure out a way to take $700 billion, with very \nlittle control--he has always said what he wanted was ``maximum \nflexibility.'' What does that mean? It means freedom to do whatever he \nwants to do. Well, I understand now that at least somebody came up with \nthe idea to have an independent group to have oversight over this, or \nat least have the ability to say no at some point. So that is better \nthan where we were, I think. But I am troubled about this for a lot of \nreasons. I wish the administration had been more constrained, more \ntargeted in their relief, seeking to provide relief in a way that has \nthe minimal precedential value for some major incursion into the \neconomy the next time we have problems in our economy. I am worried \nabout that, and others are too.\n  I also wish to take a moment to express my admiration for the senior \nSenator from Alabama, who in 2005 chaired the Banking Committee, and he \npushed through, I think on a straight party-line vote--all the \nRepublicans, I believe, voted for it--a bill that would have put strict \ncontrols and oversight over Fannie and Freddie. At that time, Alan \nGreenspan, who was the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, made a \npowerful statement saying that our financial markets were at risk if we \ndidn't do something in 2005 about fixing the Freddie and Fannie \nproblem. It was a strong statement. Going back and looking at it today, \nit was a cause for concern. So they were able to pass it out of \ncommittee, but there wasn't enough support on the floor to pass it.\n  I was told recently that Freddie and Fannie, in one quarter, had more \npaid lobbyists than any other group in town, and they are supposed to \nbe a quasi-government operation. But at any rate, they were able to \nblock the reform. So we didn't do it, and now we are in a crisis.\n  I know Senator Shelby has expressed his concern, as one who has been \non top of this issue for some time, that this legislation is not a good \nway to handle it. He has made some suggestions. I wish they had given \nserious consideration to those. I think it would be a position better \nfor our country.\n  But the momentum is going forward, and I am not here to try to delay \nany votes. It is time for us to put up and shut up and cast our vote. I \npoint out a letter written to the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate. Two \nhundred or so economists question this plan. They make three points: \nFirst, they question its fairness. They consider it a ``subsidy to \ninvestors at taxpayers' expense. Investors who took risks to earn \nprofits must also bear the losses. Not every business failure carries a \nsystemic risk.''\n\n  No. 2, they question its ambiguity, noting:\n\n       Neither the mission of the new agency nor its oversight are \n     clear.\n\n  I think that is still true. We made some progress but it is still \ntrue.\n  They say purchases of opaque assets from troubled sellers must be on \nsuch terms that are ``crystal clear ahead of time and monitored \ncarefully afterwards.''\n  But the most important point, at least to me as a Member of the \nSenate, which is supposed to be the thoughtful body, the institution \nthat gives consideration of the long-term implications of what we do, \nthe third part is particularly impactful to me and struck a nerve with \nme. The third paragraph expresses concern for its long-term effects.\n\n       If the plan is enacted, its effects will be with us for a \n     generation. For all their recent troubles, America's dynamic \n     and innovative private capital markets have brought the \n     nation unparalleled prosperity. Fundamentally weakening those \n     markets in order to calm short-term disruptions is \n     desperately shortsighted.\n\n  They close their letter by saying:\n\n       For these reasons we ask Congress not to rush, to hold \n     appropriate hearings, to carefully consider the right course \n     of action, and to wisely determine the future of the \n     financial industry and the United States economy for the \n     years to come.\n\n  I just would say about those things, there are a lot of matters we \ncan discuss. I argued in committee and on the floor in opposition to a \nplan that some of my Democratic colleagues offered some time ago, and \nthen again recently, that would give a bankruptcy judge the right to \nrewrite the terms of a mortgage and, in fact, would allow a person who \ngoes into bankruptcy to cram down what they owed on a mortgage, to \nrewrite it and reduce it, for example, from $150,000 to $100,000 based \non the judge's evaluations, and just let them pay that amount.\n  I remember arguing that when you do not honor contracts, very \npernicious things tend to happen. So if a bank is going to loan you \nmoney and they think somebody might rewrite the contract and you would \nnot have to pay it back, then they may decide they have to raise \ninterest rates on everybody they loan to, to guard against that \npotential, or require an even bigger downpayment than they otherwise \nwould require.\n  I believe removing that provision was the right thing to do. But from \na moral position, I think it is a good deal harder for a Senator or \nMember of this body who deals with that issue to say it is a dangerous \nprecedent to allow a mortgage to be rewritten, but it is OK for a big \nbusiness with a CEO, paid $100 million a year--they can have their \ncontracts rewritten, they can get bailouts from the Government, they \ndon't have to pay the consequences of adverse economic fortune that we \nsay the individual has to pay.\n  I would say no one should doubt that the American commitment to an \nallocation of wealth in a market economy will be eroded dramatically if \nthis bill passes--I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n\n[[Page S9620]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We should make no mistake that this is a weakening of \nit. I would note the article in the Wall Street Journal quoted people \naround the world for seeing the irony in the United States bailing out \ncompanies while we have been advocating to them that when their \ncompanies get in trouble, their governments should not bail them out as \na matter of principle.\n  For those reasons, with due, great respect for my colleagues who see \nit differently, with full acknowledgment that this is an extremely \ntough decision and we do not know how the economy is going--and many do \nbelieve this step will help it--I will not be able to vote for it \nbecause I think it goes too far. I think it could have been more \nnarrowly drawn and should have been. It is a precedent that will come \nback to haunt us in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate one of the most \nsignificant books in human history, the Bible. As Senate cochair of \nNational Bible Week 2008, it is my honor to join the National Bible \nAssociation in promoting the nationwide recognition of the Bible's \nimportance in our daily lives.\n  One of the many important verses in the Bible that applies to us as \nleaders is found in Proverbs 21, verse 1:\n\n       The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord. Like the \n     rivers of water, He turns it wherever He wishes.\n\n  Our Nation has always recognized the power of an unseen hand guiding \nour fortunes and destiny, and during this important and critical \ncrossroads, our Nation will do well to turn once again to the Bible for \nstrength.\n  This year, from November 23 to November 30, communities, churches, \nand leaders across America will celebrate National Bible Week by \nreading and reflecting on the Bible's teachings and how it can help us \nlead better lives.\n  It is our responsibility as leaders to remind all Americans of the \nimportance of the Bible to individuals and to our history, life, and \nthe culture of our Nation. We gain much inspiration from the \nScriptures, and the light of God will shine through us if we hold fast \nto the Bible's principles and apply them to our daily lives.\n  I join my voice with my fellow National Bible Week cochair, Todd \nAkin, and the National Bible Week chairman, J. Willard Marriott, Jr., \nin urging all Americans to celebrate National Bible Week 2008.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I join with my colleague from Hawaii in \ncelebrating National Bible Week. I get together every Wednesday morning \nwith a group of our colleagues for our weekly prayer breakfast, and he \nis always such an inspiration. He is our song leader while we do, \nexcept for he and the Chaplain, some of the worst singing that can be \ndone. He is a great inspiration for all of us, and I commend him for \nbringing this resolution forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9620-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9620-S9621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, we all know that our country has seen \nbetter economic times. Across the United States and around the world, \nbusinesses and individuals are feeling the effects of this financial \nturmoil--not only on Wall Street, but at home on Main Street as well. I \ndon't need to remind this body of the volatility of our financial \nmarkets. Evidence of this market precariousness has been splashed \nacross the front pages of newspapers and television screens everywhere, \ncausing panic and further instability.\n  As the conversations in Washington continue over how to address our \nNation's financial crisis, and as the details of the problems in our \nfinancial sector are revealed daily, I am convinced that something must \nbe done and done soon.\n  But I want to be clear about congressional action: we must act \nbecause inaction could well cause serious harm to American families, \nfarms, and small businesses as well as community banks and other \nlenders, and we must do our dead level best to make the right \ndecisions, because action for the sake of expediency could put our \nNation at further risk. Nevertheless, I oppose to the old saying of \njust do something, even if wrong. We should not follow that logic.\n  Since last Thursday, I have talked to numerous bankers, economists, \nacademicians, as well as business leaders and owners who have told me \nthat doing nothing would lead to irreparable harm to our economy. And I \nhave heard from and talked to hundreds of Georgia taxpayers, virtually \nall of whom are opposed to the plan as originally presented. Everyone \nis concerned about doing the right thing. Georgians are furious at the \ncurrent situation and for good reason.\n  I am angry and upset that the oversight supposed to be afforded by \nthe regulatory bodies was not provided the way it should have been. The \nAmerican taxpayers should never find themselves in this situation \nagain, and that is why there must be confidence that what Congress \npasses will work--not for Wall Street but for Main Street, Georgia.\n  Before I give my support and work to pass legislation, it will have \nto have strong safeguards with accountable oversight. The plan must \nprovide that any revenue earned by the treasury on this effort will be \nused 100 percent to retire the debt and not one penny used to expand \nGovernment. I will fight any legislation that proposes to use one cent \nof these funds for pork barrel projects. Furthermore, I want to make \nsure that if fraud or other illegal acts took place that the people \nresponsible are tried and punished. And while much of the focus has \nbeen on assisting larger banks and lenders, I am working to make sure \nthat neighborhood banks and lenders are protected too. I intend to see \nthat every single American has access to his or her money at all times, \nand that Americans who need credit have it available to them.\n  As the Senate debate unfolds, any proposed legislation must protect \nthe citizens and taxpayers of Main Street, their savings, their \nretirement funds, their small businesses, their careers, their homes, \nand economic well being. This financial debacle on Wall Street must not \nbe allowed to infect Main Street anymore than it already has.\n  We have to clean up this mess and keep America on track. We must be \ncertain that those responsible do not profit from this legislation and, \nwhere appropriate, necessary compensation control policies be \ninstituted. Golden parachutes for any plan participants must not be \nallowed. And civil and criminal penalties should be levied and pursued \nwhen and where appropriate.\n  During these next critical hours and days, I will carefully review \nthe details of whatever package emerges, and I will fight for Georgians \nin this process. I will have my say. I am prepared to work through the \nweekend and into October and beyond--I will not vote for just any \nproposal--I will work for and vote for the proposal that I truly \nbelieve is in the best interest of Georgians and Americans, and I \npledge to work on this as long as it takes to get the job done right \nand to make sure we do this in a bipartisan way.\n  The fundamental necessity of a strong financial market is \ntransparency, liquidity and confidence. The tools to provide further \nclarity and integrity in our financial system are already available to \nour regulators. We need to ensure that these instruments are properly \napplied, so that we protect investors from deceptive practices.\n  Faith in the market is vital to its success. Security and soundness \nmust, and will, return to our financial system through more effective \noversight and guarantees of legitimate transactions. In turn, this \nsecurity will restore certainty and faith in performance of the market.\n  It is important to recognize the connection and significance of a \nstrong financial system in a capitalist society. We are still targets \nof terrorism because our freedoms enable us to be among the most \nprosperous, most powerful nations in the world. Recent economic \nshakeups will not alter these freedoms. Through the renewed faith and \ntrust of the American investor, we will return to the height of \nprosperity, and as a beacon of fundamental fiscal strength throughout \nthe world.\n  I look forward to the package that we hope will be forthcoming from \nour bipartisan, bicameral group that is\n\n[[Page S9621]]\n\nworking now as we speak to draft the legislation--to negotiate the \nlegislation that will ultimately be committed to a draft. I hope, as we \nreturn tomorrow, we see positive signs of a conclusion to the drafting \nof that legislation and that this body can have an opportunity to study \nit in as much detail as necessary, proceed to debate, and I am hopeful \nit is the kind of legislation that we can all rally around, support, \npass, and tell the American people that we are doing everything \npossible from a policy standpoint to protect them, to protect their \ncommunities, and to protect the financial institutions of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Many of us--as I know the distinguished Senator from \nMontana has--have lobbed in our thoughts and ideas, now we are waiting \nanxiously to see how they have fared in the negotiations.\n  And I would like to take this time while we wait to address another \nsubject because a few months from now our colleague, John Warner, will \nretire from the Senate after 30 years of service to the people of \nVirginia and the people of America. His work in this Chamber and all \nthese halls has made our country stronger. And in a place where \npartisan rancor too often rules the day, his is a legacy of honor and \ndignity that will stand long after he has gone. So I wanted to take a \nfew moments to salute this man.\n  When John Warner's country called, he answered. In 1945, at 17 years \nof age, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was sent to fight in World War \nII. When the war was over, John attended a great Virginia institution, \nWashington and Lee University, on the GI bill. And in 1949, he entered \nlaw school at my own alma mater, the University of Virginia. But \nAmerica called again, and John answered again, interrupting his studies \nto serve as a ground officer with the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing in \nKorea. He returned home again, went back to UVA, and received his law \ndegree in 1953. I would graduate almost 30 years after him. John \ncontinued to serve in the Marine Corps Reserves after the war, \nattaining the rank of captain.\n  John Warner's mother once said she hoped he would one day become the \nSecretary of the Navy. Well, in 1972 he fulfilled that hope, serving \nuntil 1974, during the challenging years of the Vietnam conflict. In \nthat office, he succeeded his dear friend John Chafee, a fellow marine, \nlater to become a U.S. Senator. It is John Chafee's seat that I am now \nprivileged to hold.\n  During his first campaign for the Senate, Senator Warner told the \nWashington Post:\n\n       When I was Secretary of the Navy I drove the admirals \n     crazy. When I went to visit a ship I liked to go all over it \n     and talk to sailors.\n\n  He is, in the words of ADM Mike Mullen, ``a man whose love of country \nis matched only by his love [of] those who defend it.''\n  In the Senate, John Warner's commitment to the men and women of \nAmerica's armed services is evident in nearly everything he does. \nAlternating as chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee with his dear friend Carl Levin of Michigan, he has fought to \nensure that those who serve this country receive the best possible \nhealth care and benefits. In 1999, they achieved for our troops their \nfirst major pay increase in 16 years--and this year, did it again.\n  In his 30 years in the Senate, John Warner has dedicated himself to \nhelping his constituents and keeping our Nation secure. He has \nsupported the hundreds of thousands of members of the military who are \nbased in Virginia and serve at more than 90 installations throughout \nhis State. He has helped keep Virginia's storied shipbuilding industry \nstrong, preserving jobs and sustaining communities on Virginia's \nAtlantic coast.\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, on top of our State House dome is a \nstatue of the Independent Man. The statue represents a spirit of \nliberty and freedom that has been cherished in Rhode Island back to the \ndays of Roger Williams. Well, John Warner is Virginia's Independent \nMan. Over and over again, he has put his country first and done what he \nthought was right no matter what the politics.\n  Senator Warner saw the need for a change of course in Iraq, and he \nhas worked for real, urgent solutions to the threat of global warming. \nAs part of the Gang of 14, he sought middle-ground answers to the \nchallenging, controversial topic of judicial nominations. He refused to \nsupport President Reagan's nomination of Robert H. Bork to the Supreme \nCourt in 1987--a principled stand with a political cost.\n  In 1994, when the Virginia Republican Party endorsed Oliver North for \nthe State's junior Senate seat, John Warner refused to support the \ncandidacy of a man who had been convicted of a felony. He said then:\n\n       I do not now, nor will I ever, run up my white flag and \n     surrender my fight for what I believe is in the best interest \n     of my country, my State and my party.\n\n  His relationship with our colleague, our fellow freshman in the \nSenate, Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, is a model for the rest of the \nSenate of collegiality, enabling them together to extract from the \ndifficult logjam of judicial nominations talented judges to serve \nVirginia.\n  Former Virginia Governor Linwood Holton paid Senator Warner what I'd \ncall the ultimate compliment around here:\n\n       He wants to solve problems.\n\n  We will all miss John Warner when he leaves the Senate this January. \nHis hard work and independent spirit have enriched Congress for the \npast 30 years. And I count myself very fortunate to have served with \nhim.\n  On a personal note, I thank John Warner for his exceptional, I \ndaresay even avuncular kindness to me in my first term. From the \nvantage point of 30 years' seniority, I am a mere speck in the sweep of \nhis tenure here. He has served with 273 Senators, I believe, and yet he \nhas made me feel so welcome. In that kindness, I am the beneficiary of \nhis friendship of many years with my father, a friendship that lasted \nas long as my lifetime to date. My father was a fellow World War II \nveteran, a fellow marine, a fellow public servant, and a man who I \nremember today as I express my affection and gratitude to the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Virginia.\n  Reporters interviewing John Warner have noted his tendency to close \nhis eyes and lean back in his chair while answering questions. It's not \na sign of disrespect, they know, but rather a sign of deep \nconcentration. I've seen him concentrating that way myself in \ndeliberations behind the heavy steel doors of the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  I envision sometime, when the press inquiries, staff updates, \nlegislative proposals and constituent requests have slowed, that \nSenator John Warner will take a moment to close his eyes, lean back in \nthat chair, and reflect on what an extraordinary career his has been. I \nhope he remembers all the good he has done and all the goodwill and \nadmiration he has earned among those who have been privileged to serve \nwith him. Senator Warner, I wish you, your wife Jeanne, and your family \nGodspeed and best wishes in all your future endeavors.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the morning we will likely come in at \n9:30, and we will have a half hour of debate prior to the vote at \naround 10 o'clock, and that will be in the wrap-up closing papers this \nevening.\n  I would also say to all Members, there are negotiations going on \nregarding the financial bailout. We are hopeful and confident something \ncan be reached in this regard, but we will see. Now all parties are \nnegotiating. We have had some concern today if that, in fact, was going \nto take place, and it has, and it is now going forward. So we would \nhope that if agreement can be reached, we will do it this weekend \nsometime. Therefore, we are going to have to be in session on Monday. \nIf we have a vote on Monday, it will be very early, as early as \npossible. That is to complete whatever work the negotiators had done \nover the weekend.\n  We understand that at sunset on Monday night there is a Jewish \nholiday. We will honor that every way we possibly can. We would not \nconsider being in session on Monday but for the fact that we have been \ntold by Secretary Paulson and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve that \nthere is a financial crisis out there, and that is what is being done \nin S-116 downstairs in the Foreign Relations Committee room today and \nwill go on throughout the night.\n  We are going to complete, before we leave here, the Defense \nDepartment authorization bill. It is important we do that. We have that \nfrom the House. We are going to complete that. Rail safety, Amtrak--we \nwill complete that before we leave. I have had a number of \nconversations with the White House. We are going to complete the India \nnuclear agreement before we leave.\n  Now, with all these things we are getting cooperation of Senators. If \nwe do not get cooperation, we can get them done anyway, it just takes a \nlot longer--a lot longer. So I would hope the people who have \nobjections to these pieces of legislation will be considerate, as I am \nsure they will be, to the schedules of other Senators. We have an \nelection on November 4. We have tried mightily to finish our work on \nthis Friday, today. But circumstances have weighed against us doing \nthat with the financial problems we have had.\n  The largest bank failure in the history of our country was yesterday. \nThe bank that failed had more than 2,000 separate branches. So we are \ngoing to have to continue our work here. We just cannot leave with all \nthe work we have to do.\n  The vote in the morning is an important vote. I hope we will have \ngood attendance at that vote. We will talk more in the morning to see \nif something has happened during the night that will change the \nstatement I made today. That will be the only vote tomorrow, the one we \nwill have at or around 10 o'clock in the morning. We hope we don't have \nto have a vote on Sunday. This is a cloture vote. There are 30 hours \nthat runs, and we would hope that everyone would understand, if cloture \nis invoked, there is not much to be gained by waiting and making \neverybody come back and vote. But we will see what happens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9622-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9622-S9624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FINANCIAL CRISIS\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, a man well acquainted with crisis, \nAbraham Lincoln, said this:\n\n       I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, \n     they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The \n     great point is to bring them the real facts.\n\n  I rise to affirm this confidence and lay out some of the basic facts \nand principles we face in this unprecedented financial crisis.\n  Fact No. 1: We live in a world which is very different from the \nrealities of a decade ago. The financial world is interconnected and \nreacts at the speed of digital transactions. There are no borders to \nhide behind or cooling off periods in which to contemplate at our \nleisure. Problems arise quickly and solutions must be found quickly yet \nresponsibly.\n  Fact No. 2: This crisis we face today touches each and every \nAmerican. As the recent market events have proven, the crisis has \nentered a new and critically dangerous phase in which our entire \nfinancial system and economy hangs in the balance. The crisis we face \ntoday is as serious as any I have faced in my 32 years of public \nservice. When the Secretary of the Treasury talks about the possibility \nof a collapse of the American financial system, that gets your \nattention, as it should.\n  Money market accounts, retirement savings, college and small business \nloans, and home mortgages are all at stake. This is not about Wall \nStreet but about Main Street. It is about every street on which \nAmerican families live.\n  Just think of what you have to tell your son or daughter if they got \naccepted to some great school, and you are about to get that loan that \nyou need to pay for that education, and then all of a sudden it is not \nthere.\n\n[[Page S9623]]\n\nCredit has dried up. Capital is not available. You are going to have to \nsay: By the way, you can't go there now. I am sorry. Mom and dad cannot \nafford it.\n  Small business owners depend on credit to stock their shelves, to \nsupply the goods we buy. If this system collapses, freezes, how are \nthey going to go about providing both goods and services to families, \nas well as the jobs of folks who work there? This is about every street \non which American families live.\n  Fact No. 3: This crisis, not unlike energy or health care, is too big \nfor one party to solve. We must work together--Democrats, Republicans, \nHouse and Senate, administration and Congress. There was a moment of \nopportunity yesterday with the White House, Senator Obama and Senator \nMcCain, and the leadership of both sides of the aisle from both Houses. \nAfter the debate tonight, we have to get back, as Americans, to figure \nout how we put this together to provide the stability this economy \nneeds.\n  People have asked a lot of questions about how we got there. Outright \ngreed and mismanagement, coupled with an outdated financial regulatory \nsystem, have all been part of bringing us to this point. People were \nsold loans they could not afford. In some instances, I heard of ninja \nmortgages: no income, jobs, or assets, and yet they got packaged and \nsecuritized and passed on and sold to investors throughout the country \nand the world. Now it seems these securities are not worth what was \npaid for them. It has not only put companies in dire straits but our \nentire financial system as well.\n  Our obligation now as Americans is to come together and do the right \nthing, and to do it now.\n  Fact No. 4: The American people are watching. I have already heard \nfrom over 11,000 Minnesotans who have called or written to my office \nwho have expressed their deep concerns about what is happening and what \nis being proposed. They say: Don't bail out Wall Street. My calls are \nrunning 10,000 against and maybe 100-and-something for. They say: Don't \nbail out Wall Street. Unfortunately, the way this stabilization plan \nwas presented was such in which the public watched and saw it that way.\n  Secretary Paulson proposed a $700 billion plan to rescue our \nfinancial system. People are concerned the plan did not provide for \nclear transparency, it did not provide for clear oversight. The \nconsensus is, it amounted to a bailout of Wall Street. This is not what \nthe American people want nor should they have that.\n  While I share the administration's sense of urgency to act, I share \nthe concerns of Minnesotans from all across the State and certainly \nAmericans all cross the country. So I want to assure folks back home I \nam not going to move forward on a plan unless it puts taxpayers first \nand holds Wall Street accountable. But I also want to tell my citizens \nthat it is our obligation and responsibility, before we get out of \nhere--before we get out of here this weekend--to in fact put in place a \nplan that puts taxpayers first and holds Wall Street accountable. We \nneed to get there. We must get there. We need a plan that provides \neffective oversight and transparency. We are not going to give the \nTreasury Department a blank check.\n\n  There is talk about taking some of the options that have been put on \nthe table and been discussed in the last days, that instead of $700 \nbillion as a blank check, that there are X dollars put up first, with \nthe obligation to come back for further approval, with very clear and \nspecific oversight, very clear and specific transparency. We must get \nthere with a plan that holds Wall Street executives accountable for the \nterrible mistakes they made getting us into this mess--no golden \nparachutes. We are going to have to deal with executive compensation. \nIf there is going to be Government assets involved, if they use the \nGovernment credit card, folks are going to have to comply with the \nterms and conditions.\n  We must look into other individuals who enrich themselves on \nmortgage-related assets while fully knowing of their dangers. There is \ngoing to be a lot of looking back. In the long run, shareholders have \nto have a greater say about executive pay. We must get there with a \nplan that gets taxpayers the best value for their dollar. If we, \nultimately, go forward with the Treasury's plan--or a variation of the \nplan because we are not going to go forward with that plan--this will \nbe a plan in which the concerns of my colleagues in the House--they \nhave expressed concerns; my colleagues in the Senate have expressed \nconcerns. We need to go forward in a way that assures that distressed \nassets are bought--and when I say ``bought''--that distressed assets \nare acquired--I want to be clear about that--acquired at prices that \nare fair to the taxpayer and any returns that we get as assets come \nback into this fund after expended, that they have to go to debt \nreduction.\n  We are talking about increasing the national debt from over $10.6 \ntrillion to over $11 trillion. As assets come back, as distressed \nassets regain value over time, as folks get back on their feet, we have \nto make sure those assets then are put into debt reduction, not more \nGovernment spending, not deepening the mess we are in already in this \ncountry.\n  Over the long term, we cannot go back to business as usual. We need \nto aggressively undertake fundamental financial regulatory reform. \nFirst and foremost, any reform must include stronger regulatory \noversight over the entire financial system. The sad reality is that \nsome of our current system goes back to the Civil War era. It is like \ntrying to fight a fire today with a bucket brigade. It is marked by \nineffective coordination among regulators and redundant oversight in \nsome areas and lack of oversight in others. Greater transparency and \naccountability must be factored in. We must ensure that market \nparticipants have a direct stake in their own actions so that taxpayers \nare not left holding the bag.\n  In many ways, it has been described to me as almost a 9/11 kind of \nmoment--that before 9/11, in the area of security, we were not able to \nthink the unthinkable, and we did not have in place a system that \nallowed us to see and understand that the unthinkable was about to \nhappen. In the situation we face now with this economy, we did not have \nthe regulatory oversight, the transparency to deal with the complex \nfinancial instruments that are being used today, so we both did not \nthink the unthinkable and we had no capacity to know that the \nunthinkable was about to happen. The unthinkable now stands in the \nshadows, as we talk about the potential meltdown of the American \neconomic system. That cannot happen, and we will not let that happen.\n  At the same time, we must put more cops on the beat to better detect \npossible threats to the financial system, such as conflicts of interest \nthat could undermine the integrity of the system. And, finally, we must \nensure greater regulatory flexibility in order to keep up with market \ninnovations. Regulators should have the ability to intervene before a \ncrisis reaches critical mass.\n  What happens after the opening bell rings on Wall Street every day \naffects the folks in Hibbing, MN, just as much as the people in New \nYork City. Wall Street executives must shoulder a great deal of \nresponsibility for this crisis. If taxpayers are being asked to \nsacrifice, Wall Street too must share in the cost of rescuing the \nfinancial system.\n  Hardworking Americans deserve to have the peace of mind that their \nstake in the financial system is appropriately safeguarded and that \nthey are not put on the hook for the mistakes of corporate America.\n  Times are tough. Folks are having a hard enough time dealing with \nhigh energy costs and making ends meet. In the short term, we need to \nact for the sake of our economy. In the long term, we need major reform \nthat protects the American taxpayer and works for our economy. \nMaintaining a viable and robust financial system is critical to each \nand every American's future.\n  We have to recognize there are a lot of questions out there, even at \nthis hour on Friday night, as we are moving toward what I hope will be \nputting in place a system that protects the taxpayer, that holds Wall \nStreet accountable. We are talking about assets, and there is a \ndiscussion about Government buying assets. At what price? If we buy it \nabove market price, are taxpayers being ripped off to protect \nshareholders and bondholders? That should not be\n\n[[Page S9624]]\n\nallowed to happen. If we are to buy assets, then what kind of system do \nwe need to have in place to evaluate and oversee those assets? Are we \ncreating more bureaucracy, more cost, for which, in the end, the \ntaxpayers will suffer? Could we avoid that, while looking at loans--\nsecure loans, of course, being preferable--but even in cases where \nthere are not enough assets to secure the loans, moving forward from a \nloan perspective?\n\n  These are the kinds of questions I know those at the table right now \nneed to answer. They need to answer them with a first and foremost \nprinciple that the taxpayers must be protected.\n  Finally, I wish to say that even as we move forward--as we have to \nmove forward to provide stability to the American economic system--we \nmust understand that this is not getting us out of the woods; that, in \nfact, those challenges to our economy are still there, including the \nthreat of the recession, or the reality of the recession, and I think \nthe economic numbers from this quarter will demonstrate that it is, in \nfact, where we are today. But greater danger lies ahead in our \nfinancial system, so the expenditure of Government resources now must \nbe done in a way that keeps in mind that there are going to be some \nmajor issues that are going to have to be confronted in the near \nfuture. There may have to be some further action by this Government to \nprovide stability in order to keep this country moving forward. Those \nconsiderations cannot be blocked out as we look at the crisis of the \nmoment. We need to recognize that there are challenges that still await \nus.\n  The American people throughout our history have come together at \nevery crisis that has threatened our national or economic security. We, \nin Congress, working closely with the administration, must protect \ntheir interests by working quickly, in a bipartisan way, to help secure \na better, safer, and sounder tomorrow. Now is the time for \nstatesmanship, not partisanship. Now is the time for leadership. Now is \nthe time to come together to generate confidence in the American body \npolitic and in the people that will then reflect confidence in our \neconomic system, that will give the opportunity for a better and \nbrighter future.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Because so many of our States and \ncounties depend on this Congress to get these bills done in a quick and \nefficient manner, it is disappointing to me as a member of the \ncommittee, despite how hard we have tried and despite the great efforts \nof our chairman, Senator Byrd, who has worked tirelessly to try to make \nthat happen. It, unfortunately, does not look as though that is going \nto happen as we come to an end of this session.\n  What we are debating tonight is a continuing resolution that will \nkeep the Government operating until, according to the date in the \ncontinuing resolution, I understand, March 6. Also through that \ncontinuing resolution we have attached to it the Defense appropriations \nbill, the Homeland Security appropriations bill, and the disaster \npackage which I, along with many other Senators, worked very hard to \nshape as we witnessed and participated in--in terms of rescue, help, \nand support--several of the last few disasters, starting with Hurricane \nFay that hit Florida but literally dropped feet of rain throughout many \nparts of the country, including Louisiana and other Southern \nStates. Then, only a few weeks later, we witnessed and participated and \ntried to help as Hurricane Gustav--another category four, then three, \nand as it went inland a category two--a very powerful storm, delivered \nhurricane force winds through all of Louisiana--all 64 parishes. Even \nfor a person such as myself, who is now sort of battle tested by \nhurricanes, it still is shocking that a hurricane could deliver such \nforceful winds all the way up to the northern boundary of a State that \nis over 400 miles. That is quite a storm. Then the winds were hardly \ndown, and the electricity not even turned back on, and Hurricane Ike \ncame roaring out of the gulf and hit Texas. Unfortunately for us, being \non the east side of Texas, a great deal of damage was done as those \nvery powerful winds and tidal surges again hit Louisiana.\n\n  So the people of my State, needless to say, are very weary and very \ntired and in great need of disaster assistance. So are the people of \nTexas. And let me say, I was pleased to be able to find time, even this \nweek, to host a hearing in my subcommittee, along with my ranking \nmember, Senator Domenici. We had four other Senators join us, for a \ntotal of six Senators, to listen to the very moving testimony of the \nmayor of Galveston, the mayor of Houston, the Lieutenant Governor from \nLouisiana, the Lieutenant Governor from Texas, and other key officials, \nas they came to this Congress seeking our help and our support to deal \nwith an unprecedented number of disasters that have happened along the \ngulf coast.\n  I don't want to forget the floods that happened in the Midwest or the \ngreat fires out in California. It has been quite a year for disasters \nin the heartland, and I know this Congress has given a great deal of \ntime and focused on Iraq and winning the war there. I understand we are \nfocused, as I have urged, on more resources for Afghanistan. We have \ndroughts and starvation and problems in other parts of the world, and \nwe will do what we can to address that. But right here in the \nheartland, right here in our homeland, we have had many disasters that \nneed our attention. So I was pleased, along with the other Members, \nRepublicans and Democrats, to try to fashion a disaster relief bill \nthat will actually make it to the President's desk so it can be signed. \nThere was some debate earlier as to whether that should be attached to \na stimulus, which was not passed today. That would have been a disaster \nin itself, because it would have gone down, as our stimulus package \ndid. But I and others leaned on the leadership to have this disaster \nrelief attached to something that was a must-pass, and I am very happy \nthat was accomplished and attached to the continuing resolution because \nthis resolution has to pass in some form or fashion prior to October 1, \nwhich is only a few days away, or of course the Government will shut \ndown.\n  For the people of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Arkansas, my \nneighboring States, they breathed a sigh of relief that at least $23 \nbillion in this bill was headed their way. There was some $2-plus-\nbillion set aside for the Corps of Engineers, because levees broke \neverywhere. Luckily, the levees in New Orleans for Gustav and Ike \nheld--barely held--but levees broke everywhere and thousands of people \nin urban areas, in suburban areas, in exurban areas, in rural areas, \nand farmers in the field are underwater. This is not enough, but at \nleast it is something. I will come back to that.\n  We have $6 billion for community development block grant disaster \nspecial aid. We laid this precedent down in 9/11, when this Congress \nrallied to New York's aid and sent a block grant of money. I believe \nthat might have been the first time, in 2001, following that disaster, \nto help New York City stand up. And when Katrina hit and when Rita hit, \nwe sent a similar block grant, although the money did not get divided \naccording to damage and appropriately, but at least we got a block \ngrant for disaster assistance. The Congress has decided again that the \ndamage was so bad for Gustav and Ike to send another $6.5 billion for \nthese States to share. It is more than just the States of Texas and \nLouisiana. And that is the good news.\n  But the bad news is that the number alone requested by Texas, \npreliminary\n\n[[Page S9625]]\n\nnumber--and this is before the mayor of Galveston got one person back \nin her city, because they came back yesterday--these numbers were \nsubmitted last week, so these are very preliminary numbers that came \nfrom the State of Texas--was 6.5 by itself. There is only 6.5 in the \nbill. I am going to predict the numbers and the need for Texas is going \nto go up exponentially in the next few days. And of course, with the \nneeds in Louisiana, in Iowa, in Missouri, in Arkansas, and in \nMississippi, 6.5 is a start but there is going to need to be a great \ndeal more assistance, particularly for the States of Texas, Louisiana, \nand some other States hard hit by these storms.\n  But this is a start, and we are going to make it work. And this money \nhas some flexibility. We can use it for a variety of projects that are \nimportant--building non-Federal levees, perhaps some support to our \nfarmers in our rural areas who are in great need. Then the bill goes on \nto provide some money for the Small Business Administration for \ndisaster loans. We have streamlined that process. I am proud of the \nwork I did in that area. Hopefully, this time it will work better.\n  There is some emergency highway relief money. I wish to show a \npicture of one of our highways, if we can get that. This is how our \nhighways looked after hurricanes came through.\n  There is money for the social services block grant of $600 million. \nWe still, after asking for 4 years, have yet to receive, after \nHurricane Katrina, any Federal funding to help the four hospitals that \nstayed open for that storm. There have been three since then, and these \nhospitals are using their own surpluses to take care of the injured and \nsick along the gulf coast. So we hope that included in this $600 \nmillion for the whole country that we will find the money to reimburse \nthose hospitals, which amounts to about $100 million to $150 million.\n  Then there is, luckily, $75 million for fisheries. Because while \nthese cameras focus a great deal on the buildings, as people are on \ntheir rooftops, and there are homes that are flooded and pictures of \nurban areas, what the cameras don't often catch, particularly in the \ngulf coast and particularly in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and \nTexas--America's working coast, America's energy coast--is the hundreds \nof fishing boats, trawlers, commercial fishermen and sports fishermen \nwhose boats, even though they try to protect them in these storms, end \nup as a pile of rubble, like matchsticks. And the Federal Government \nacts as if this is not a business. This is a multibillion dollar \nbusiness. These fishermen deserve our help.\n  This is the picture of Highway 1. I am sorry it is a little grainy, \nbut people would be shocked to know this is the highway that goes down \nto the very tip of Louisiana, with the gulf being out here. It is \ncompletely under water. This is not a minor highway. This is a major \nenergy highway--Highway 1--that runs from the tip of Louisiana all the \nway to Canada. So this is not a farm road. It is not a gravel road. \nThis is a main U.S. highway that we have been trying to build in \nLouisiana for the last 20 years, trying to get a few dollars here and a \nfew dollars there. Most of the offshore oil and gas that comes out of \nthe gulf finds its way in and around this road.\n  I finally got Senator Murray to designate this as a Federal priority \nhighway a couple of years ago, as the chairman of the appropriations \nsubcommittee. We have been pushing money to this. If we had \nrevenuesharing, this would have been built already, but that is another \nstory.\n  But this is what south Louisiana looks like, and the fishermen need \nmore help. This is Fort Fourchon. Again, this is a major oil and gas \nhub. When the tidal surge comes up--because we are not investing in the \ninfrastructure--and when the refineries shut down and the oil rigs shut \ndown, these are the conditions they are shutting down in.\n  To end this part, I hope I have demonstrated that while we are \ngrateful for this $23 billion, and we had unprecedented cooperation \nfrom the Governors of all of the States, Republicans and Democrats, and \nunprecedented cooperation putting this package together, this is only a \ndownpayment on the disasters we have to face. So in the continuing \nresolution there is the DOD appropriations bill, the Homeland Security \nbill, Military Construction, and luckily we were able to get in a $22 \nbillion disaster relief bill.\n  But the reason I am on the floor tonight--and let me ask how much \ntime I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The reason I am on the floor tonight is to call \nattention to the fact that despite this good help--and it is good help, \nand I am very appreciative--we have left out a very important segment \nof our population in disaster aid, and that is direct aid to our \nfarmers.\n  This is a farmer from Louisiana, in Cheneyville, LA. He is standing \nin his rice field. You know, rice can be grown dry or in water, but too \nmuch of it is a problem. And if it has salt in it, that is a problem. \nThe tidal surges that have come into Louisiana, and the floods, have \nbeen so great in central and north Louisiana, that even though some of \nour rice had been harvested, a great deal was in the fields when Gustav \nand Ike struck. So Fay came over the south and dumped a tremendous \namount of rain just as southern agriculture was preparing for the \nharvest. Fay came in the early part of August, as we prepare for the \nharvest in September and October.\n  Mr. President, you most certainly, being a rancher yourself, can \nappreciate what goes on over the course of a year, where farmers work \nhard and hold their breath and say a lot of prayers. They roll up their \nsleeves and get up early and see that the crop looks good; that the \nweather has been great. They have corn in the field, cotton out there, \nand they have soybeans. And corn is at a great price. The prices are \ngood for the first time in a long time. The farmers are thinking: Oh, \nmy gosh, we are going to have a great year. We have had a couple of bad \nyears lately. Well, all of a sudden, these storms come out of the gulf, \nand before you know it, they are barreling down on Mississippi, \nLouisiana, and Texas again, dumping huge amounts of rain, flooding the \nfields, and at the worst possible time.\n  I wish to put up another picture of our farms from another part of \nour State. As the staff does that, I wish to read some of the damages, \nin terms of numbers. Whether it was rice or sugarcane or cotton or \nsoybean, it has been a disaster. I will get to that in a moment.\n  Let me read to you Mr. Harwick's story. Mr. Harwick is a farmer from \nNewellton, LA. He produces 7,000 acres of cotton, corn, and grain. He \nis a very successful farmer. He is diversified. He uses the best risk \nmanagement practices. He also produces wheat. He is Vice President of \nthe National Cotton Council.\n  During Gustav, his family farm received more than 20 inches of rain. \nMr. President, I know you are from Montana. I don't think you had 20 \ninches of rain in several years. So our problem in Louisiana is \nmanaging an abundance of water. I know in the West you all struggle \nwith managing too little of it. Our problem is we drain two-thirds of \nthe continental United States. So if it rains in Arkansas, it is not \njust a problem for Arkansas, it is a problem for Louisiana. When it \nrains in Missouri, that water eventually finds it way down the Missouri \nand Mississippi Rivers, so this has been a constant battle for our \nfarmers for hundreds of years. Despite that, we have very productive \nfarming.\n  This is what the cotton crop looked like on Jay Harwick's farm. The \nspecialist from the University of Louisiana estimated that the cotton \ncrop will be reduced by $125 to $137 million; anywhere from a $52 to \n$57 million decline in farm-gate value.\n  It is also estimated that more than 80,000 acres of cotton will not \nbe harvested in Louisiana, and on the remaining acres, the yield losses \nwill be dramatic. That is just cotton.\n  My time is running out tonight, but I will be back tomorrow morning \nat 10 o'clock, as we vote, and then speaking for most of the day and \nnight on this subject. I do not most certainly have to take up anymore \ntime tonight as I try to call attention to the tremendous devastation \nin the South and in other\n\n[[Page S9626]]\n\nparts of this country and the need for this Congress, before we leave, \nto do something more significant for agriculture and to do it in a way \nthat provides direct assistance to farmers now.\n  I will conclude with this. The reason we cannot wait is the credit \ncrunch is real and now. No. 2, there is nothing to wait for because the \nnew farm program, the rules and regulations that we passed recently, \nwill not even be finished being written, let alone to be able to \nreceive applications for aid, until next year. That will be too late.\n  So for Jay Hardwick, the farmers I represent, the farmers in the \nSouth, I am going to stand here for quite a while and talk about their \nsituation and say that, most certainly, if we can spend a few weeks \ntrying to figure out how to save the financial markets and Wall Street, \nwe can spend a little bit of time and a little bit of money trying to \nhelp farmers who did not take out subprime loans, who managed their \nrisk well and got caught in circumstances well beyond their control \nthat were not manmade but were of nature's making.\n  The facts of Wall Street and the financial crisis were not natural \ndisasters. We all had a part in, I guess, making that happen. I am not \nhere to point fingers or to blame anyone else. But for these farmers, \nthis was not manmade. The men who grew these crops did everything they \nwere supposed to do, their families did everything they were supposed \nto do, and the rains came. If we do not give them help, they will not \nmake it until the spring.\n  I will be speaking about this for quite some time this weekend. We \nare grateful for the aid we received but there needs to be some changes \nbefore we leave, and I am going to do what I can to make that possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9626-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to mark the enactment of the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act amendments Act, S. 3406. Passed with \noverwhelming, bipartisan support in the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives, this important bill was signed into law this week. I \nam proud and honored to celebrate the occasion with my colleagues, \nparticularly Senator Harkin and Senator Hatch, who worked so hard to \ncraft the legislation and help guide it through Congress. The \ndisability, civil rights, and business stakeholders behind this \nlegislation deserve our recognition as well.\n  We are all part of a nation built on the promise of equal rights, \njustice, and opportunity for everyone. Eighteen years ago, we took a \nhistoric step toward fulfilling that promise with the passage of the \noriginal Americans with Disabilities Act. Unfortunately, we didn't \nexpect then that Supreme Court decisions would narrow the law's scope \ncontrary to congressional intent. As a result, the lower courts have \nnow gone so far as to rule that people with amputation, muscular \ndystrophy, epilepsy, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, cancer, and even \nintellectual disabilities are not disabled. The Supreme Court decisions \nfurther imposed an excessively strict and demanding standard to the \ndefinition of disability, although Congress intended the ADA to apply \nbroadly to fulfill its purpose.\n  The ADA Amendments Act finally rights these wrongs. For one, the new \nlaw directs the courts toward a broader meaning and application of the \nADA's definition of disability. More major life activities will also be \nincluded in the definition of disability, so that more people with \ndisabilities will be covered by the ADA. The amendments further clarify \nthat the ADA covers people who use ``mitigating measures,'' such as \nmedications or prosthetics, to treat their conditions or adapt to their \ndisability. Otherwise, they will continue to be in a catch-22 that \nforces them to choose between managing their disabilities or staying \nprotected from job discrimination. No one should have to make that \nchoice.\n  Thanks to the newly enacted amendments, the ADA's focus can return to \nwhere it should be--the question of whether the discrimination \noccurred, not whether the person with a disability is eligible in the \nfirst place. Simply put, the ADA Amendments Act restores the landmark \nAmericans with Disabilities Act to the civil rights law it was meant to \nbe.\n  Mr. President, we cannot rest on our laurels as we look ahead to the \nfuture. Today we reaffirm the principle that discrimination based on \ndisability doesn't belong in the workplace, but we cannot ignore the \nlow employment rates for people with disabilities who want to work. \nThey want to achieve to the best extent of their potential and enjoy \neconomic self-sufficiency, but this piece of the American dream remains \njust beyond their reach. Clearly, there is still much work to be done \nif our Nation is to realize the ADA's vision of full inclusion and \nacceptance of all people.\n  So let us renew our commitment to the goals and ideals of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. I look forward to continuing this \neffort on behalf of the American people, including all those in Nevada \nand throughout the country celebrating the enactment of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act Amendments Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9626-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 110TH BIRTHDAY OF SEARCHLIGHT, NEVADA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of a very special \nevent--the 110th birthday celebration of my hometown, Searchlight, NV. \nMy colleagues have heard me speak often of Searchlight, and they all \nknow how proud I am to call it home.\n  On July 20, 1898, Searchlight was established like many towns across \nthe West were--as a mining district. George Frederick Colton had struck \ngold the year before, bringing a rush of miners to the area. Over the \nnext 10 years, Searchlight provided millions of dollars of gold to the \nworld and grew to be one of the most populated areas in southern \nNevada. During the mines' most prosperous years, Searchlight was one of \nthe most modern, well-appointed towns in the State.\n  While Searchlight's mining boom may have ended 100 years ago, the \npioneering spirit lives on in our small community. And on Saturday, \nOctober 4, 2008, the residents of Searchlight will commemorate the \npassing of the town's 110th year with a BBQ dinner and various \nactivities. I join the community in thanking the Searchlight Museum \nGuild for organizing this celebration.\n  In particular, I would like to recognize my friend Jane Overy, \ncurator of the Searchlight Historic Museum. Jane was instrumental in \nthe founding of the museum, and she continues her work as Searchlight's \nresident historian in the planning of this year's birthday celebration \nprogram, ``Sharing Searchlight's Historic Memories.'' In addition to \nher work with the museum, Jane is involved with many town activities \nand is a well-known and well-loved figure in our community. She is a \nNavy veteran and she and her husband Carl, an Air Force veteran, have \nbeen very active members of Nevada's proud military community. Jane \ncurrently serves as the Department Commander for Nevada Disabled \nAmerican Veterans. She has been a dedicated collector and preserver of \nSearchlight's history, and I am grateful for her contributions to the \ncommunity.\n  In my office in the Capitol, I keep a picture of my childhood home in \nSearchlight. It serves as a reminder of how my hometown has shaped my \nwork on behalf of Nevada throughout my career in Congress. I am proud \nto recognize the historic occasion of Searchlight's 110th birthday, and \nI wish its residents a successful and enjoyable event.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9626-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9626-S9630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SENATORS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I wish to make a few comments about \nsome of our departing colleagues who will no longer be with us next \nyear. I have known some of them for just a little while, others I have \nknown for a long time. And, to all of them I bid a fond farewell and \nmahalo for their service to their State and to this country. They are \ndear colleagues and friends of mine and I know that even if they leave \nthis fine establishment, our friendships will continue long into the \nfuture.\n  The Senators that I am referring to are Senator John Warner from \nVirginia, Senator Pete Domenici from New Mexico, Senator Larry Craig \nfrom Idaho, Senator Chuck Hagel from Nebraska, and Senator Wayne Allard\n\n[[Page S9627]]\n\nfrom Colorado. Please allow me just one moment to reflect on my service \nwith each of these valuable members.\n  I want to extend my deepest appreciation and warmest mahalo to my \nfriend and colleague, Senator John Warner. His lifetime of devoted \npublic service is truly admirable, and his integrity and dedication to \nduty make him a role model for all Americans. Few that have ever held \nthe position of U.S. Senator have been able to combine his \ngraciousness, intelligence, and absolute commitment to the public good \nthat have allowed him to be such an effective bipartisan leader.\n  His experiences as both a sailor and a marine during a time of war, \ncombined with his executive responsibilities as former Secretary of the \nNavy, have given Senator Warner the ability to tackle complex policy \nissues during his time in the Senate. His leadership and experience on \nthe Armed Services Committee, as well as his ability to reach across \nthe aisle to get vital legislation passed, will be irreplaceable. He is \na gentleman of impeccable character, and will be sorely missed by us \nall. I am honored and humbled to serve with him.\n  Another good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from New \nMexico, Senator Pete Domenici has been serving the people of his home \nState and this Nation for 36 years. Like Senator Warner, Senator \nDomenici also works beyond party lines to address controversial issues \nand the concerns of stakeholders. He is truly an exemplary role model \nfor all members of Congress.\n  Senator Domenici is a man of his word and has respectfully worked \nwith members on both sides of the aisle. As a dedicated advocate he has \nhelped encourage informed debates in the Senate. He has been a \npassionate advocate for many causes and has sought workable solutions.\n  I have had the distinct pleasure to serve with Senator Domenici as a \nmember of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, as well as \nthe Senate Indian Affairs Committee. Senator Domenici has played an \nintegral role in overcoming difficult challenges and meeting our \ncountry's energy needs. As a member of these committees I have \nwitnessed his genuine concern and commitment to improve the well-being \nof and increase opportunities for indigenous communities in Hawaii, \nacross the Nation, and extending to our Insular areas.\n  Senator Domenici has been one of the leading advocates for mental \nhealth care in our country. He and Senator Paul Wellstone were great \npartners in trying to bring about mental health parity. Since Paul's \ndeath, Senator Domenici has led this initiative and worked with all of \nus in a continued effort to ensure that individuals can access \nessential treatment.\n  Senator Domenici is a statesman and a gentleman. It has been a \npleasure to work with him in the United States Senate. I am going to \nmiss Senator Domenici and I extend my warmest aloha and heartfelt well \nwishes.\n  I would be remiss were I not to mention the retirement of another of \nour colleagues, my friend Larry Craig. Senator Craig and I served \ntogether on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, which he chaired in the \n109th Congress. I will not forget Chairman Craig's willingness to bring \nthe committee from Washington to my home State of Hawaii, to hear the \nconcerns of Hawaii's veterans first hand. Under his leadership, the \ncommittee held an unprecedented series of field hearings on the needs \nof veterans living in Hawaii, the Nation's only island State. My \ncolleague made this possible, and I will not forget his generosity.\n  Senator Craig and I have not always agreed, but I am proud of the \nrelationship he and I maintained as counterparts on the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee. His willingness to find workable compromises, and to \nwork with, rather than against, those with opposing views, are both \nqualities in great need here in Washington. I wish him well as he \nreturns to his native Idaho. Surely he will now be able to have more \ntime with his wife, Suzanne, their three children, and their nine \ngrandchildren. I wish him happiness and the best with his future \nendeavors.\n  Another veteran that is leaving the Senate and a dear friend of mine \nis Senator Chuck Hagel. While he has elected to leave the U.S. Senate \nafter serving two terms, his service to this country started long \nbefore he became a U.S. Senator. In 1968, he and his brother served in \nVietnam, where he earned multiple military decorations and honors, \nincluding two Purple Hearts. His long career in public service began \nduring his tenure as an administrative assistant to Congressman John Y. \nMcCollister from Nebraska in 1971 until 1977. In 1981, he was nominated \nand confirmed to be deputy administrator of the Veterans Administration \nwhere had the privilege and honor to work for our Nation's veterans. \nSenator Hagel has served the State of Nebraska with great distinction \nand will be missed by all.\n  And, lastly, I wish a fond farewell to Senator Wayne Allard. For 18 \nyears, the people of Colorado and have benefitted from the leadership \nof Senator Allard. Through his service on numerous committees including \nAppropriations, Budget, Banking and Urban Affairs, our nation has \nbenefitted as well. I applaud his commitment to energy and science as \nthe founder of the Senate renewable energy and energy efficiency caucus \nas this is an issue that is also vitally important to me. On this 50th \nanniversary of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, I \nshould note that Senator Allard has been a champion of space science \nand technology research and I would like to thank him for his \nleadership in this arena. From his time as a Representative of Larimer \nand Weld Counties to his current position as the Senator from Colorado \nhe has been a dedicated and capable public servant and I wish him all \nthe best.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statements were ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I regret that I am not able to be \nin the Senate today to pay tribute to my friend and colleague, Senator \nPete Domenici of New Mexico.\n  Throughout my years in the Senate, I have been honored to serve with \nsome of the brightest, most committed elected leaders in our Nation. \nBut Senator Domenici stands out in particular. He has the unique \nability to rise above partisanship and find real solutions to real \nproblems.\n  He comes to every issue with a deep knowledge and desire to improve \nthe lives of the people of New Mexico and the Nation. It has been a \nspecial honor to work with him for nearly 36 years, including many \nyears on mental health issues. We both share a deep commitment to those \nissues because we know the immense toll that mental illness has taken \non beloved members of our families, his daughter Clare and my sister \nRosemary.\n  Pete and I are on opposites of the aisle in the Senate, but he has \nnever approached mental health issues in a partisan way. Instead, he \nthinks of himself as an advocate for mental health reform and basic \nfairness for all our citizens.\n  Through Pete's skillful guidance and leadership, Congress has made \nmajor progress in breaking down the walls of discrimination against the \nmentally ill, especially in the judicial system and in education. On \nreform in mental health care, it has been a long, difficult battle for \nover a decade, but Senator Domenici's will and dedication has never \nwavered.\n  Years ago, young Pete played baseball for the Albuquerque Dukes, \nwhich was part of the old Brooklyn Dodgers farm system. Back in those \ndays, disappointed Dodger fans coined the phrase, ``Wait 'til next \nyear'' after coming up short of a championship season so often.\n  Now, at last, because of Pete, Americans suffering from mental \nillness may not have to ``wait 'til next year'' any longer. We are now \ncloser than ever to finally passing mental health parity and putting an \nend to the longstanding shameful practice of discrimination in health \ninsurance against persons with mental illness. On this issue, Senator \nDomenici has been absolutely relentless and absolutely brilliant. We \ncould never have made it this far without him.\n  My only regret is that at the signing ceremony, when President Bush \nsigns this landmark bill into law and looks up and hands the signing \npen to Senator Domenici, we will all be sad that Pete is retiring from \nthe Senate this year. He has been a continuing source of hope and \ninspiration to me and to\n\n[[Page S9628]]\n\nmillions of other people and their families across the Nation. He has \nmade a truly extraordinary difference in the lives of families \nstruggling with mental illness. It has been a great honor to serve with \nsuch a talented and dedicated public servant as Senator Pete Domenici. \nI will miss him very much in the years ahead.\n\n\n                              John Warner\n\n  Mr. President, I wish very much that I could be here in person today \nto pay tribute to the extraordinary career of my friend John Warner. I \nknow that when we return to the Senate in January, all of us on both \nsides of the aisle will miss the decency, thoughtfulness, commitment, \nand friendship of our outstanding colleague from Virginia.\n  We often speak about the high value of friendship in the Senate, \nabout the importance of sustaining it despite the strong political and \nphilosophical differences that often erupt between Senators, and about \nthe way it sustains us in times of personal and political crisis. I \nknow that many of my colleagues feel the same way, and I am sure we all \ncherish our friendship with John Warner.\n  The Senate will not be the same without him. In many ways, he \nepitomizes the words of Shakespeare, that we should ``do as adversaries \ndo in law, strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.''\n  John's life is proof that individual persons make a difference for \nour country, if they have the will to try. From the time he enlisted in \nthe Navy at the age of 17 during World War II, to joining the Marine \nCorps in 1950 after the outbreak of the Korean war, to his service as \nSecretary of the Navy, and to his brilliant career as a Senator \nrepresenting the people of Virginia, John Warner has demonstrated a \ncommitment to public service that few people in the history of this \nNation can match.\n  As my brother, President Kennedy, once said: ``Any man who may be \nasked in this century what he did to make his life worthwhile, I think \ncan respond with a good deal of pride and satisfaction, `I served in \nthe United States Navy.' '' It is been a special privilege, as a member \nof the Armed Services Committee, to serve with John Warner, \nparticularly during his years as chairman or ranking member of the \ncommittee. John deserves immense credit for his contributions to our \ncountry, and America is a stronger and better Nation today because of \nhis life's work.\n  Perhaps more than anyone I know, Senator Warner understands that we \nare Americans first and members of a political party second. Throughout \nhis 30 years in the Senate, he has consistently demonstrated an all-\ntoo-rare willingness to reach across the aisle to achieve results for \nthe American people.\n  When the partisan passions of the day become heated in this Chamber \nand threaten progress on fundamental issues, we always know that John \nWarner is available to help find the way forward--even if it costs him \npolitically. President Kennedy would have called him a profile in \ncourage, and I agree.\n  It is no secret that John and I don't agree on everything, but even \nin times of disagreement, I have never questioned that his position was \nthe result of deep thought and his special wisdom and experience. Our \nFounders would regard the Senate career of John Warner as a shining \nexample of the type of person they envisioned should serve in this body \nof our Government.\n  I am sad to see him leave, but as John and his wife Jean look to the \nfuture and the new challenges and possibilities that lie ahead, we know \nthat he will always be available to answer the call of service, and we \nare very grateful for the opportunity to have served with him. We will \nmiss him very much.\n\n\n                              wayne allard\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak today regarding the \nretirement of my esteemed colleague from Colorado, Senator Wayne \nAllard. I have known Senator Allard since he joined Congress in 1991 \nand have worked closely with him in the Senate since 1996. Today, I am \nsure that I am joined by many of my colleagues in saying that his \nservice, his work ethic, and his friendship in this institution will be \nmissed.\n  A native of Colorado, Senator Allard was born in Fort Collins in \n1943. Using the skills he learned while growing up on a ranch, Senator \nAllard obtained a doctorate of veterinary medicine at Colorado State \nUniversity. Soon after, he and his wife Joan opened the Allard Animal \nHospital. Over the years that followed, Senator Allard successfully \nbuilt his practice and raised his family. He even continued his \npractice while serving in the Colorado State senate for 17 years. Ever \nthe citizen-legislator, Senator Allard brought this same attitude to \nthe U.S. Congress in 1991 and more specifically to our Senate \nlegislative body in 1996.\n  It was in 1996 that Senator Allard was elected to the Senate with a \npromise to only serve two terms. Not being one to back away from that \ncommitment, Senator Allard declared early in 2007 that he would not \nseek a third term because it would have gone against his word. It was \nthen that he declared it was a matter of integrity and of keeping his \ncommitments. And it is now, that I can say nothing could be truer about \nthe character of my good friend, Senator Allard. Born and raised in the \nWest, he understands what it means when he shakes your hand and gives \nyou his word. His integrity is of the character of which we need more \nof and his commitments are of the nature of which we will surely miss.\n  Indeed, for the last 17 years I have observed Senator Allard working \ntirelessly for the good people of Colorado. Throughout his tenure, the \ndemands placed on Senator Allard have been great, yet he always manages \nto find the time to listen, to engage, and to talk to Coloradans about \nthe things that are most important to them. Impressively, Senator \nAllard has held over 700 townhall meetings since he began his service \nin the Congress.\n  From his work on the Contract with America to his instrumental role \nin working with me to craft the current law promoting and regulating \nthe development of oil shale and tars sands in the United States, which \nwas passed as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Senator Allard has \nalways done the work of the people and he will be missed. I wish him \nand his lovely family the best and thank him for the years of service \nhe has provided to this body.\n  To my friend Senator Wayne Allard, I convey my highest admiration and \nrespect for what he has been able to accomplish while here in the \nSenate. As with any new chapter in our lives, our feelings are always \nmixed as we continue turning the pages that finish the tale of one \nstory while we hurriedly rush to the next. Yet the story of Senator \nAllard's journey in the Senate would not be complete without the \nsupport of his wife Joan and the love of his children and \ngrandchildren. Without question, our loss is their gain. It is to them \nthat I extend my deepest gratitude for the sacrifices they have made \nwhile their husband, their father, and their grandfather has served so \nwell these many years. I am certain they are excited to have Senator \nAllard back, but somehow I have a feeling that he will not be resting \nfor long.\n\n\n                              larry craig\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak today regarding the retirement of my \nfriend and colleague, the senior Senator from Idaho. At the conclusion \nof this Congress, Senator Larry Craig will end a political career that \nhas included over three decades of service to the people of his State. \nI am sure many of my colleagues will agree, Senator Craig's presence in \nthe Senate will be missed.\n  Senator Craig is a lifelong citizen of Idaho, having been born in \nCouncil, ID, and growing up on a ranch in Washington County. He \nattended college at the University of Idaho and later served in the \nIdaho National Guard. These close ties to his home state, I believe, I \nbelieve, informed almost every decision he made while serving in \nCongress.\n  Larry's career in public service began in 1974 when he was elected to \nthe Idaho State Senate. Six years later, he was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives, where he served five terms. In 1990, he was elected to \nhis first of three terms in the Senate, where his devotion to the \npeople of Idaho continued.\n  During his time in the Senate, Senator Craig became involved in a \nnumber of efforts to serve the people of his State and the country as a \nwhole. He has held prominent positions on the\n\n[[Page S9629]]\n\nAppropriations, Veterans' Affairs, and Energy and Resource Committees. \nHe also had a brief stint on the Senate Judiciary Committee when I was \nserving as chairman. Although his time on the Judiciary Committee was \nshort-lived, Senator Craig was always an active member of that panel, \npursuing immigration reform to help the farmers from his State and \nthroughout the country and vigorously supporting legislation to protect \ncivil liberties.\n  In recognition of these efforts, he was inducted to the Idaho Hall of \nFame in 2007.\n  Of course, no discussion of Senator Craig would be complete without \nmentioning ``The Singing Senators,'' the now famous barbershop quartet \nthat featured Senator Craig along with my good friends Trent Lott, John \nAshcroft, and James Jeffords. I think we all enjoyed the exploits of \nThe Singing Senators during their brief moment in the limelight. Sadly, \nwith the departure of Senator Craig, there will be no Singing Senators \nleft. I still have my copy of their album, ``Let Freedom Sing,'' and I \ncan only hope that Larry will be taking home with him his copies of the \nalbums I have recorded. If not, I am sure I can dig up some new ones \nfor him.\n  Mr. President, I want to close by saying that I have greatly admired \nSenator Craig for his devotion to the people of his state and his \nefforts to improve our country. I want to wish him and his family the \nbest of luck in any future endeavors.\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my very dear friend and \ncolleague, Senator Pete Domenici. Other than the members of the Utah \ncongressional delegation, Utah has had no better friend in the Senate \nthan the senior Senator from New Mexico. My State of Utah is made up \nmostly of public lands, and we have often relied on this good Senator \nfor the support and expertise of solving some of our most difficult \nnatural resource problems. Senators who understand the complexities of \nliving in a public-land dominated State are few and far between, \nespecially here in Washington. Having Senator Domenici in a leadership \non the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resource Policy has been \nmy State's salvation many times over.\n  In my personal view, Senator Domenici's crowning achievement was the \npassage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This was one of the most \ncomprehensive and bipartisan energy proposals ever passed by Congress. \nI have no doubt that this summer's energy crisis would have been \ndramatically worse had EPACT 2005 not been passed when it was. It was a \nmatter of dread and grave disappointment for some of us in the Senate \nto watch as the leadership of this Congress pursued efforts to turn \nback some of the most important steps that legislation took toward \nsecuring a better energy future for our people. And it is fitting that \nbefore this Congress ends along with Senator Domenici's Senate career, \nwe have voted to reinstate and to extend many of the provisions \nestablished in EPACT 2005.\n  In particular, I praise Senator Domenici for his unfailing vision and \nleadership in working with me to establish the possibility in this \ncountry of developing our Nation's gigantic untapped oil shale \nresources. A lot has been said in the media about how oil shale \ndevelopment has not been proven yet and therefore not likely to be \nsuccessful. However, what these critics fail to consider is that the \nGovernment has long had a policy to not develop its oil shale. We \nshould keep in mind that the United States controls about 72 percent of \nthe world's oil shale and that 73 percent of our resource is on Federal \nlands.\n  Without Senator Domenici's leadership, we would not have been able to \npass the Oil Shale and Tar Sands Development Act as part of EPACT 2005. \nWe would not now have a large, tristate environmental impact statement \non oil shale, a voluminous task force report on oil shale from the \nDepartment of Energy, a research and development lease program ongoing \nat the Bureau of Land Management, and the soon-to-be released final \nregulations on commercial oil shale leasing on Federal lands. He has \nmaintained the vision of oil shale's potential benefit to our Nation's \nfuture and has never relented. I will ever be grateful to Senator \nDomenici for that.\n  My friend from New Mexico is not flashy. And I mean that as a high \ncompliment. Where some Senators fight with rhetoric, Senator Domenici \nrelies on reason. Where others search around for wedge issues, Senator \nDomenici finds solutions. Where others in the Senate seek to widen the \naisle that divides us, Senator Domenici reaches across to bring us \ncloser. The Senate is a better place because the people of New Mexico \nhave sent us their senior Senator, and we will miss his presence here. \nAs this Congress comes to a close, I say to my friend, arrivederci, ti \nvoglio bene.\n\n\n                              Wayne Allard\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Senator Allard has spent many years \nworking for Colorado.\n  He came to the Senate in 1996 after serving three terms in the U.S. \nHouse.\n  As Colorado's senior Senator, he worked diligently to cut taxes, \neliminate wasteful spending, return power to State and local \ngovernments, and assure the security of America both at home and \nabroad.\n  Consistent with his belief that elected officials should be citizen \nlegislators, Senator Allard conducted more than 700 town meetings \nacross Colorado, visiting each of Colorado's 64 counties.\n  He was one of only two veterinarians in the Senate and provided \nleadership on small business issues from his practical experience.\n  He also led by example, returning more than $4.2 million in unspent \noffice funds to the U.S. Treasury.\n  As the Republican leader of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenator Allard worked to shape the Nation's spending priorities.\n  His work on the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act helped keep access \nto the Internet tax-free.\n  He also worked to increase military benefits, including legislation \nto increase the death benefits for families of fallen heroes from \n$12,000 to $100,000.\n  I will miss working with him in this Chamber, and I will miss his \nfriendship and support on the issues that matter most to America.\n\n\n                              Larry Craig\n\n  Mr. President, Larry Craig has a long history of service to the \npeople of Idaho.\n  In 1974, he was elected to the Idaho State Senate, where he served \nthree terms before winning the 1980 race for Idaho's first \ncongressional seat.\n  He was re-elected four times before winning a U.S. Senate seat in \n1990.\n  As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, he assured that the \nhealth care needs of our Nation's veterans were addressed, and he \nhelped increase the number of claims processors to try to help veterans \nreceive the benefits they deserve, with fewer delays.\n  Throughout his career, Senator Craig has been a forceful advocate for \ncommonsense, conservative solutions to our Nation's problems.\n  He has been a leader in the battle for lower taxes, private property \nrights, and greater accountability in government.\n  He has been recognized by national groups, including Citizens for a \nSound Economy, Citizens Against Government Waste, Watchdogs of the \nTreasury, and the National Taxpayers Union Foundation.\n  He is also one of America's foremost defenders of the second \namendment.\n  I wish Senator Craig well in his retirement.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  Mr. PRESIDENT, I have really enjoyed working with Chuck Hagel.\n  Senator Hagel honorably served our country by enlisting in the U.S. \nArmy during the Vietnam war.\n  While in Vietnam, he received the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, \nPurple Heart, Army Commendation Medal, and the Combat Infantryman \nBadge.\n  After working as Deputy Administrator of the VA, he became a \nsuccessful entrepreneur and business leader.\n  In 1996, Chuck Hagel was elected to the U.S. Senate.\n  Six years later, he was overwhelmingly reelected with over 83 percent \nof the vote, the largest margin of victory in any statewide race in \nNebraska history.\n  His knowledge and experience building a business and creating jobs \nwas invaluable to the Senate.\n  He was a leader on the Foreign Relations Committee and represented \nthe\n\n[[Page S9630]]\n\nU.S. Senate admirably as chair of the Senate Global Climate Change \nObserver Group.\n  On a personal note, he always sent me a souvenir from the College \nWorld Series in Omaha when the University of Texas or Rice University \nwas in the Finals, which I am proud to say was almost every year.\n  I will miss Chuck Hagel, and I wish him well.\n\n\n                              John Warner\n\n  Mr. President, John Warner is a Senator who has served his country \nheroically.\n  During World War II, at the age of 17, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. \nAt the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, Senator Warner interrupted \nhis law studies and started a second tour of Active military duty.\n  Senator Warner's next public service began with his Presidential \nappointment to be Under Secretary of Navy in 1969. He served as \nSecretary of the Navy from 1972 to 1974.\n  Following his work there, John Warner was appointed by the President \nto coordinate the celebration of America's bicentennial.\n  Beginning in 1978, Senator Warner has been elected to the Senate five \ntimes. In 2005, Senator Warner became the second-longest serving U.S. \nSenator from Virginia in the 218-year history of the Senate. Now \nserving in his 30th year in the Senate, Senator Warner rose to become \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In that capacity, and \nthroughout his career, he has shown unwavering support for the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces.\n  Every time I am with John Warner, I learn something new, valuable, \ninsightful or humorous. He is truly a unique blend of a military \nleader, country gentleman, historian, great storyteller and statesman. \nHis hard work and devotion will be missed by all his friends in the \nSenate.\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  Mr. President, last, but certainly not least, I would like to speak \nabout my great friend, Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico.\n  The longest serving U.S. Senator in New Mexico history, Pete has been \na respected leader on some of the most important issues of our time, \nincluding energy security, nuclear proliferation, and fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Pete was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972 and is serving his \nsixth term.\n  Pete is the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, having previously served as its chairman following a long \ntenure in charge of the Senate Budget Committee.\n  When he became chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nin 2003, Pete put his years of legislative experience to work to craft \nthe first major comprehensive Energy bill since 1992.\n  Many thought that the task was nearly impossible, but Senator \nDomenici gained bipartisan consensus and passage of the Energy Policy \nAct of 2005. This new energy law created incentives to accelerate U.S. \ndevelopment of its own energy resources--including solar, wind, and \nnuclear power.\n  Then, in late 2006, Domenici engineered the enactment of a new law \nthat will open areas of the Gulf of Mexico for energy exploration. This \ncould yield 1.26 billion barrels of American-owned oil and 5.8 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas in the near future.\n  Senator Domenici's commitment to America's prosperity is also \nexemplified in his work to make the U.S. more competitive in the global \nmarketplace. He is a coauthor of the America Competes Act, a landmark \nbill that will force substantial changes to promote science and \ntechnology education and ensure that the United States does not lose \nits place as the world's innovation leader.\n  Senator Domenici is a nationally recognized advocate for people with \nmental illness, having written the 1996 Mental Health Parity law to \nensure fair insurance coverage for people who suffer from that disease.\n  Pete has also been a champion in promoting New Mexico's economy. He \nhas worked to ensure equal opportunities for women and minorities. He \nhas worked to find consensus on difficult environmental issues. It has \nbeen a true honor to serve with him. The Senate will truly miss his \nleadership, and I will miss his friendship. Indeed, we will miss all \nour departing friends. I wish them well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9630-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9630-S9632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                      LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in addition to the many other \nvital matters the Congress has considered this year, the issue of pay \nequity remains of critical importance. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \nwould restore a fair rule for filing claims of pay discrimination based \non race, color, gender, national origin, religion, disability, or age. \nThis measure, which passed the House last year, has broad public \nsupport, and I hope the Senate will pass it as soon as possible. I ask \nunanimous consent to include in the Record a series of letters of \nsupport for the bill which I have received from civil rights and \nworkers' organizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Leadership Conference\n\n\n                                              on Civil Rights,\n\n                                    Washington DC, April 16, 2008.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Leadership Conference on \n     Civil Rights (LCCR), the nation's oldest, largest and most \n     diverse civil and human rights coalition, representing \n     persons of color, women, children, labor unions, individuals \n     with disabilities, older Americans, major religious groups, \n     gays and lesbians and civil liberties and human rights \n     groups, we urge you to co-sponsor and vote for the Fair Pay \n     Restoration Act (S. 1843) to correct the Supreme Court's \n     misinterpretation of Title VII regarding when a pay \n     discrimination claim is timely filed.\n       S. 1843 whose companion measure, H.R. 2831, passed the \n     House of Representatives July 31, 2007, is necessary to \n     ensure that victims of workplace discrimination receive \n     effective remedies. Title VII requires individuals to file \n     complaints of pay discrimination within 180 days of ``the \n     alleged unlawful employment practice.'' In Ledbetter v. \n     Goodyear Tire & Rubber, decided on May 29, 2007, the Supreme \n     Court held that the 180-day statute of limitations should be \n     calculated from the day a pay decision is made, rather than \n     from when the employee is subject to that decision or injured \n     by it. The Court's decision in this case was a sharp \n     departure from precedent and would greatly limit the ability \n     of pay discrimination victims to vindicate their rights. \n     Moreover, it has implications beyond Title VII, including for \n     pay discrimination claims brought under the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act. Congress must \n     make clear that a pay discrimination claim accrues when a pay \n     decision is made, when employees are subject to that \n     decision, or at any time they are injured by it, including \n     each time they receive a paycheck that is reduced as a result \n     of the discrimination.\n       As Justice Ginsburg pointed out in her dissent in \n     Ledbetter, Congress has stepped in on other occasions to \n     correct the Court's cramped interpretation of Title VII. The \n     Civil Rights Act of 1991 overturned several Supreme Court \n     decisions that eroded the power of Title VII. As Justice \n     Ginsburg sees it, ``[o]nce again, the ball is in Congress' \n     court.'' We agree and urge you to act expeditiously and \n     reaffirm that civil rights laws have effective remedies,\n       Thank you for your time and attention to this important \n     matter. If you have any questions. please feel free to \n     contact Nancy Zirkin at (202) 263-2880 or \n     Zirkin@civilrights.org, or Paul Edenfield. LCCR Counsel, at \n     (202) 263-2852 or Edenfield@civilrights.org.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wade Henderson,\n       President & CEO.\n     Nancy Zirkin,\n       Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Women's Law Center.\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2008.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Nationa1 Women's Law Center, \n     I am writing in support of S. 1843, the Fair Pay Restoration \n     Act. S. 1843 would reverse the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. and help to ensure \n     that individuals subjected to unlawful compensation \n     discrimination are able to effectively assert their rights \n     under the federal anti-discrimination laws. The bill would \n     reinstate prior law to make clear that pay discrimination \n     claims accrue whenever a discriminatory pay decision or \n     practice is adopted, when a person becomes subject to the \n     decision or practice, or when a person is affected by the \n     decision or practice, including whenever s/he receives a \n     discriminatory paycheck. A companion bill, H.R. 2831, has \n     already been passed by the House of Representatives, and we \n     urge you to enact S. 1843 without delay.\n       The Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision severely limits \n     workers' ability to vindicate their rights by requiring that \n     all charges of pay discrimination be filed within 180 days of \n     the employer's originally discriminatory decision. The \n     Court's decision upends prior precedent and is fundamentally \n     unfair to those subject to pay discrimination. Under\n\n[[Page S9631]]\n\n     the Ledbetter rule, victims of pay discrimination have no \n     recourse against--and employers are immunized from liability \n     for--the discrimination once 180 days have passed from the \n     employer's initial decision, even when the discrimination \n     continues into the present. The Ledbetter decision thus \n     creates incentives for employers to conceal their \n     discriminatory conduct until the statutory period has passed. \n     As Justice Ginsburg noted in her dissent, after that time the \n     Ledbetter rule renders employers' discriminatory pay \n     decisions ``grandfathered, a fait accompli beyond the \n     province of Title VII ever to repair.''\n       The decision also ignores fundamental workplace realities. \n     Pay information is often confidential, and few employees have \n     concrete information about the decisions underlying their own \n     compensation, let alone the compensation of their coworkers; \n     in fact, many employers explicitly forbid their employees \n     from discussing their wages. And unlike other forms of \n     discrimination, pay discrimination is not manifested as an \n     adverse action against the employee. As a result, an employee \n     may experience compensation discrimination for a long time \n     before he or she is aware of it. In addition, while employees \n     may be reluctant to challenge wage disparities that are small \n     at the outset, the disparities can expand exponentially over \n     the course of an employee's career, as raises, bonuses, and \n     retirement contributions are calculated as a percentage of \n     prior pay.\n       The Fair Pay Restoration Act responds to each of these \n     problems in a modest and targeted way--and indeed is the only \n     legislative approach that will fully address the obstacles \n     created by the Ledbetter decision. The Act will promote \n     voluntary compliance with the anti-discrimination laws; \n     because each discriminatory paycheck, rather than simply the \n     original decision to discriminate, triggers a new claim \n     filing period, employers have a strong incentive to eliminate \n     any discriminatory pay practices. The Act will also ensure \n     that employers do not benefit financially from \n     discrimination; while under the Ledbetter decision, employers \n     whose compensation decisions are not challenged within 180 \n     days get a windfall from continuing this discrimination, the \n     Act will hold employers accountable for ongoing \n     discrimination.\n       The Act also responds to the ways in which pay \n     discrimination is manifested in the workplace, as well as to \n     its impact over time. And it allows employees to assess the \n     validity of their claims before challenging compensation \n     discrimination. Under the Ledbetter rule, employees who wait \n     to challenge suspected pay discrimination run the very real \n     risk of forfeiting their right to any relief whatsoever. \n     Ledbetter thus creates the incentive for employees who \n     suspect that they have been subject to pay discrimination to \n     immediately file a charge with the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission. The Act will remove the incentive to \n     file preemptive charges and litigation--a result that serves \n     neither employees nor employers.\n       Moreover, the Act will restore a clear and familiar way of \n     evaluating the timeliness of compensation discrimination \n     claims. Far from imposing a new or unfair rule on employers. \n     the Act simply reinstates the law that had been applied by \n     the EEOC and nine of the twelve federal courts of appeals \n     before the Ledbetter decision. Accordingly, most courts and \n     the EEOC, as well as most employers, are already familiar \n     with the rule. In addition, both employers and employees \n     benefit from the certainty created by the rule, which ensures \n     that both plaintiffs and defendants will be able readily to \n     determine the timeliness of claims.\n       Finally, the Act will in no way lead employees to delay \n     challenges to pay discrimination. To the contrary, employees \n     will continue to have every incentive to challenge pay \n     discrimination as soon as possible. For one thing, the Act \n     leaves unaltered Title VII's two-year limitation on the \n     recovery of back pay. As a result, a plaintiff who delays \n     filing a pay discrimination claim will continue to sacrifice \n     the recovery of any pay s/he is owed for periods that predate \n     the two years preceding her charge.\n       More than four decades after Congress outlawed wage \n     discrimination based on sex, women continue to be paid, on \n     average, only 77 cents for every dollar paid to men. This \n     persistent wage gap can be addressed only if women are armed \n     with the tools necessary to challenge sex discrimination \n     against them. And it is critical that Congress reaffirm that \n     civil rights laws have effective remedies, and that all those \n     subject to pay discrimination are entitled to challenge \n     continuing discrimination against them.\n       We urge you to enact S. 1843, the Fair Pay Restoration Act, \n     without delay. Please feel free to contact Jocelyn Samuels, \n     Vice President for Education and Employment, with any \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Marcia Greenberger,\n     Co-President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Partnership for\n\n\n                                             Women & Families,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 2008.\n     Re Fair Pay Restoration Act, S. 1843.\n       Dear Senator: On May 29, 2007, the Supreme Court issued a \n     decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company \n     reversing a well-established legal standard and weakening \n     severely protections against pay discrimination that have \n     been critical for women in the workplace. We write to urge \n     you to support the Fair Pay Restoration Act, S. 1843, which \n     would correct this decision by restoring the timeliness \n     standard used to determine whether pay discrimination claims \n     have been filed in a timely manner. Without this legislation, \n     protections against pay discrimination are little more than \n     an empty promise and equal employment opportunity becomes an \n     unattainable ideal.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       Lilly Ledbetter, the only woman supervisor in her division \n     at the Goodyear plant, sued Goodyear for sex-based pay \n     discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964 (Title VII) after learning that she was paid \n     substantially less--15 to 40 percent--than her male \n     colleagues. A jury awarded Ms. Ledbetter over $3.2 million, \n     which was later reduced to $360,000 ($300,000 in compensatory \n     and punitive damages and $60,000 in backpay) due to Title \n     VII's damages caps.\n       A sharply divided Supreme Court ruled that Ms. Ledbetter's \n     claim was time-barred because she waited too long to file her \n     claim. Title VII requires employees to file within 180 days \n     of ``the alleged unlawfu1 employment practice.'' The Court \n     calculated the deadline from the day that Goodyear allegedly \n     made a discriminatory pay decision, rather than--as decades \n     of precedent recognized--from the day Ms. Ledbetter received \n     her last discriminatory paycheck. Because Ms. Ledbetter filed \n     her charge more than six months after the pay decision, the \n     Court concluded that her claim must fail, even though she \n     continued to make less money due to her sex for many years \n     after that decision and within 180 days of when she flied her \n     charge.\n\n\n    Restoring the Timeliness Standard for Pay Discrimination Claims\n\n       The Fair Pay Restoration Act (FPRA) would amend Title VII \n     to make clear that an unlawful employment practice occurs (1) \n     when a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice \n     is adopted, (2) when an individual becomes subject to a \n     discriminatory compensation decision or practice, or (3) when \n     an individual is affected by the application of a \n     discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, \n     including each time compensation is paid. This legislation \n     thus would reinstate the rule that had been in place for \n     decades--the paycheck accrual rule--which provides that the \n     180-day time limit for filing a charge of discrimination with \n     the EEOC begins to run anew after each discriminatory \n     paycheck is received.\n\n\n                            A Step Backward\n\n       The Ledbetter decision is a step backward for women and for \n     any employee alleging pay discrimination under Title VII. \n     Despite Title VII's guarantee of equal employment \n     opportunity, the Court's ruling would leave many victims of \n     pay discrimination without an effective remedy, even when \n     their rights have been violated. If allowed to stand \n     uncorrected, this decision authorizes employers to violate \n     Title VII's bar on pay discrimination with impunity as long \n     as they do not get caught within 180 days. Now employers will \n     have every reason to try to avoid liability simply by keeping \n     pay disparities hidden during the Title VII charge-filing \n     period.\n\n\n The Decision Disregards Workplace Realities and Discourages Informal \n                         Resolution of Disputes\n\n       The Supreme Court's decision ignores the realities of the \n     workplace and the realities of pay discrimination. Because \n     pay information is often confidential, employees are rarely \n     able to uncover such discrimination and file claims quickly. \n     In addition, pay disparities can start small but grow in \n     significance as the impact of raises--often set as a \n     percentage of prior pay--accrues over time. Employees might \n     be reluctant to raise a pay discrimination claim at the \n     outset over a minor salary discrepancy, when they have \n     incomplete or insufficient information. Now they must assume \n     discrimination in every situation and file claims \n     preemptively--and potentially prematurely--to preserve any \n     ability to challenge discriminatory pay decisions.\n       The Ledbetter decision, therefore, likely will have the \n     unintended consequence of encouraging an immediate \n     adversarial response to any questions regarding pay. \n     Employees who take the time to ask questions and gather \n     accurate information to determine whether they have a claim, \n     under Ledbetter, risk having their claims rejected as \n     untimely. Many claims that might otherwise be resolved \n     informally will be raised in a more adversarial setting and \n     create a greater potential for protracted litigation. As a \n     result, Ledbetter actually undermines one of Title VII's \n     primary goals--informal resolution of disputes.\n\n\n            Impact on Women's Wages and Closing the Wage Gap\n\n       Although the Court paints the discrimination that Ms. \n     Ledbetter faced as long past, the pay discrimination that Ms. \n     Ledbetter and so many others have endured is current and very \n     real. Many women are all too painfully aware that there is \n     nothing ``long past'' about the consequences of \n     discriminatory pay practices--they have a present-day impact \n     as they accumulate and grow over time. A woman loses ground \n     every day she is paid less pursuant to a policy of \n     discrimination. Unfortunately, this decision effectively \n     disregards the real economic impact of pay discrimination. \n     Further, pay discrimination is responsible for a significant \n     portion of the wage gap experienced by women and people of \n     color. The Supreme Court's decision makes it even more \n     difficult for women workers and employees of color to close \n     the wage gap.\n\n[[Page S9632]]\n\n       The decision in this case is not merely about sex \n     discrimination. Rather, it has broader implications for all \n     pay discrimination claims under Title VII, which bars \n     discrimination in compensation not only on the basis of sex, \n     but also on the basis of race, color, religion, and national \n     origin, and other antidiscrimination laws, including the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act. Accordingly, \n     this bill amends the timeliness standard for pay \n     discrimination claims under those laws as well.\n\n\n        Restoring the Law Imposes No Unfair Burden on Employers\n\n       Prior to the decision in this case, the EEOC, the majority \n     of lower courts, and the Supreme Court each allowed pay \n     discrimination claims to proceed on the basis of the issuance \n     of a paycheck that paid an employee a discriminatory wage. \n     The Court's decision in Ledbetter marks a reversal in the \n     law. The proposed FPRA would restore the previous legal \n     standard without placing an unfair burden on employers.\n       Although employers have suggested that a decision in favor \n     of Ms. Ledbetter would have left them defenseless against an \n     onslaught of pay discrimination suits going back many years, \n     this rhetoric strains credulity. There is no evidence that \n     employers were inundated with stale pay discrimination \n     lawsuits prior to Ledbetter, and there is no reason to \n     believe that a return to the state of the law pre/Ledhetter \n     would cause such a result now. Moreover, not only would undue \n     delay make it that much more difficult for a worker to prove \n     a claim of pay discrimination, but it also could provide an \n     employer with a defense--called laches--to chalIenge \n     unreasonably delayed claims.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The Court's unduly restrictive interpretation of Title VII \n     effectively guts the law's protection against pay \n     discrimination, leaving many victims of pay discrimination \n     without a remedy. Legislation is necessary to insure that all \n     workers receive a fair, nondiscriminatory wage and the \n     opportunity to participate in the workforce on equal ground.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Debra L. Ness,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            National Women's Political Caucus,\n\n                                               September 23, 2008.\n     Hon.

Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy and Senator Specter: Thank you for \n     your continued leadership on H.R. 2831, the Lilly Ledbetter \n     Fair Pay Act. I am writing on behalf of the National Women's \n     Political Caucus (NWPC) to endorse this important piece of \n     legislation and to support the analysis contained in a letter \n     sent to you by Sue Johnson, President of the Alaska Women's \n     Political Caucus, one of our state affiliates.\n       The National Women's Political Caucus was founded in 1971 \n     on the principle of achieving and protecting equal rights for \n     women, and this includes equal economic rights for women. One \n     fundamental tenet of our organization is fighting all forms \n     of discrimination, and this especially includes fighting pay \n     discrimination in the workplace. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \n     Act provides a way to ensure equal pay for equal work and to \n     equip women with a vital tool to combat pay discrimination. \n     With so many women heading up their households and being the \n     sole income earners, it is all the more important that their \n     work is fairly and equally compensated so that they may \n     provide for their families.\n       The National Women's Political Caucus and I appreciate your \n     steadfast work on issues of fundamental importance to women, \n     and stand behind your efforts in the passage of H.R. 2831.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Lulu Flores,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Alaska Women's Political Caucus\n\n                                Anchorage, AK, September 23, 2008.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy and Senator Specter: On behalf of the \n     Alaska Women's Political Caucus (AWPC). I write to thank you \n     for your continued leadership on H.R. 2831, the Lilly \n     Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The AWPC is an affiliate of the \n     National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC), a bipartisan \n     multicultural organization dedicated to increasing women's \n     participation in the political field and creating a political \n     power base designed to achieve equality for all women. NWPC \n     and its hundreds of state and local chapters support women \n     candidates across the country without regard to political \n     affiliation through recruiting, training, and financial \n     donations. AWPC focuses on wining equality for women and \n     supporting candidates who support AWPC's goals. Of the upmost \n     importance to breaking the glass ceiling restricting women, \n     is making certain that women can assert their right to remain \n     free from pay discrimination at work.\n\n\n       H.R. 2831 Is the Right Solution for Alaska's Working Women\n\n       Alaska is part of the Ninth Circuit, which for years (along \n     with a majority of the other federal circuits), recognized \n     the ``paycheck accrual rule'' in employment discrimination \n     cases. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, an \n     employee has 180 days a discrimination act to file a claim. \n     Before the Ledbetter v. Goodyear decision, if an employee in \n     Alaska brought a federal claim for pay discrimination, the \n     courts recognized that each new paycheck started a new clock \n     because each paycheck was a separate discriminatory act. This \n     meant that our workers in Alaska were able to bring a timely \n     claim as long as they could show that they had received a \n     paycheck lessened by discrimination in the required time \n     period. This had been the law in Alaska's federal courts for \n     years: See Gibbs v. Pierce County Law Enforcement Support \n     Agency, 785 F.2d 1396 1399 (9th Cir. 1986) (``The policy of \n     paying lower wages . . . on each payday constitutes a \n     `continuing violation'.'') (internal quotation omitted).\n       Unfortunately, in May 2007, in Lebetter v. Goodyear, the \n     Supreme Court overturned this common-sense practice that \n     plaintiffs and employers in Alaska had come to rely upon. \n     Now, if an employee does not know about the discrimination \n     within just a few months of the employer's illegal behavior \n     there is nothing that can be done--she can't have her day in \n     court or ever get her hard-earned wages back.\n       Certainly, in tough economic times, workers should be able \n     to earn and keep their fair wages. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair \n     Pay Act, H.R. 2831, would reinstate this common-sense \n     paycheck accrual rule. H.R. 2831 merely clarifies that pay \n     discrimination is not a one-time occurrence starting and \n     ending with a pay decision, but that each paycheck lessened \n     due to discrimination represents a continuing violation by \n     the employer. It is a very modest bill and is the right \n     answer for Alaska's working women.\n\n\nSenator Hutchison's Ledbetter ``Alternative'' Is Not the Right Approach\n\n       The clear, measured approach taken in H.R. 2831 is the only \n     way Congress can reverse the effects of the Ledbetter \n     decision. A newly-introduced bill from Senator Hutchison (R-\n     TX), S. 3209, purports to offer a solution for victims of pay \n     discrimination. But, in reality, Ms. Hutchison's legislation \n     would fail to correct the injustice created by the Ledbetter \n     decision, would create new, confusing, and unnecessary \n     hurdles for those facing discrimination, and would flood the \n     courts with premature claims and unnecessary litigation.\n       The approach of S. 3209 fails to recognize the basic \n     principle that as long as discrimination in the workplace \n     continues, so too should employees' ability to challenge it. \n     It is the wrong approach for working women, who depend on \n     every rightfully-earned dollar. Every time an employer issues \n     a discriminatory paycheck, that employer violates the law, \n     and victims of that discrimination should be afforded a \n     remedy.\n       Moreover S. 3209 would create new legal hurdles for \n     employees by requiring employees to show they filed their \n     claims within 180 days of when they had--or should have had--\n     enough information to suspect they'd been subjected to \n     discrimination. This ``should have'' known standard would \n     encourage employees to prematurely file discrimination claims \n     based on mere speculation or office rumors of wrongdoing just \n     to preserve their rights within the 180-day time frame. This \n     novel standard is not just bad for employees, but also for \n     employers who would be burdened with unnecessary litigation \n     and increased costs. Far from creating a new legal standard, \n     in contrast, H.R. 2831 would merely restore the law prior to \n     the Ledbetter holding and fairly protect employees' day in \n     court.\n       The AWPC commends you for helping to help make equal pay \n     for equal work a reality by supporting H.R. 2831 as the best \n     solution for the problems created by the Ledbetter decision.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Sue C.

Mr. President, I strongly oppose H.R. 6842. This \nbill would be a disastrous blow to gun safety in the District of \nColumbia. For almost three decades, the District's handgun and assault \nweapon ban has helped to reduce the risk of deadly gun violence. City \nresidents and public officials overwhelmingly supported the ban, and \ncourts have upheld it--until the Supreme Court's recent misguided \ndecision in the Heller case in June. Now, we are facing an orchestrated \nassault that jeopardizes public safety. It is hard to understand how \nthe increased availability of handguns and assault weapons in our \nNation's Capital will make residents and visitors safer.\n  Introducing more guns onto the streets and into the community will \nonly increase the number of violent deaths in DC, including homicides, \nsuicides, and accidental shootings. The increased availability of \nfirearms will\n\n[[Page S9633]]\n\nmake it more likely that deadly violence will erupt in our public \nbuildings, offices, and public spaces.\n  This bill will have dangerous consequences for residents and visitors \nalike. It removes criminal penalties for possession of unregistered \nfirearms. It legalizes the sale of assault weapons in the District. It \nallows handguns and assault weapons to be kept legally in the city's \nhomes and workplaces. It hobbles the authority of the Mayor and the \nCity Council to deal with gun violence. Absurdly, this bill even \nprevents the City Council from enacting any laws that ``discourage'' \ngun ownership or require safe storage of firearms.\n  As Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton has emphasized, this bill sets \nno age limit for possession of guns, including military-style weapons. \nIt permits a person who is voluntarily committed to a mental \ninstitution to own a gun the day after the person is released. It \nprevents gun registration, even for the purpose of letting police know \nwho has guns and tracing guns used in crimes. It prevents the DC \ngovernment from adopting any regulations on guns, leaving only a bare \nFederal statute that would leave DC with one of the most permissive gun \nlaws in the Nation.\n  This bill is a frontal assault on the well-established principle of \nhome rule. It is an insult to the 580,000 citizens of the District of \nColumbia. It tramples on the rights of its elected leaders and local \nresidents to determine for themselves the policies that govern their \nhomes, streets, neighborhoods, and workplaces. Congress wouldn't dare \ndo this to any State, and it shouldn't do it to the District of \nColumbia.\n  Congress has consistently opposed giving the residents of the \nDistrict the full voting representation in Congress they deserve. Many \nof our colleagues have frequently attempted to interfere with local \npolicymaking and spending decisions. This bill is a blatant \ninterference with DC law enforcement by denying the right of the City \nCouncil to regulate firearms and firearm ownership.\n  I commend Senator Feinstein and Senator Lautenberg for their \nleadership in opposing this shameful legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose this reckless, special-interest bill that will \nendanger the safety of the District of Columbia's residents and \nvisitors.\n  The solution to DC's gun crime problem lies in strengthening the \nNation's lax gun laws, not weakening those in the District. The tragic \nand graphic stories of gun violence that capture front-page headlines \nin the District show that current gun-safety laws need to be \nstrengthened, not abolished. I have long been committed to reasonable \ngun control laws, and I am concerned that the Supreme Court's decision \non the DC gun ban opens a Pandora's box. Much of the progress we have \nmade in making Americans safer by placing reasonable restrictions on \nthe possession of firearms is now in doubt. It is a bitter irony that \nthis gross setback comes in the name of a right to self-defense, and I \nurge the Senate to oppose it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9633-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9633-S9634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to explain why there are \nobjections to bringing up H.R. 3999, the National Highway Bridge \nReconstruction and Inspection Act of 2008. As has been mentioned by \nseveral of my colleagues on the floor today, the Highway Bridge Program \nin its current form needs to be reformed to make it more useable for \nStates. Unfortunately, H.R. 3999 hinders, rather than strengthens, \nStates' abilities to address their greatest bridge priorities. It would \nforce States to follow a risk-based system developed in Washington to \nprioritize the replacement or rehabilitation of bridges. There is great \nconcern that this one-size-fits-all approach would not allow for \nimportant local factors, such as seismic retrofit. This legislation \nalso forces States to spend scarce resources on new procedures that \nwill provide little or no new information to State bridge engineers.\n  SAFETEA-LU will expire on September 30, 2009. Any major policy \nchanges at this point in the process will distract from the overall \ngoal of completing a comprehensive bill on time. For that reason, a \npolicy change of this magnitude should be handled in the context of \nreauthorization. Furthermore, it is counterproductive to attempt to fix \nour crumbling infrastructure through piecemeal efforts. Comprehensive \nreform is necessary and should be addressed in a holistic approach in \nthe reauthorization bill the Environment and Public Works Committee \nwill work on in the coming months.\n  There has been a lot of press about the poor condition of the \nnation's bridges in the wake of the Minnesota tragedy. Our bridges are \ncertainly in need of additional investment, but the roads on the \nNational Highway System, NHS, are actually in greater need. According \nto the Federal Highway Administration, FHWA, the Nation's bridges \nreceive an average of 15 percent less funding from all levels of \ngovernment than the maximum amount that could be economically invested. \nIn contrast, the roads on the NHS receive 78 percent less funding than \nthe maximum economic level.\n  This is not to say that there are not enormous bridge needs. These \nare simply 20 year averages, and much more could be economically \ninvested in the short term. According to the same study by the FHWA, \n$62 billion could be invested immediately in a cost-beneficial basis. \nIt is critical, however, to view investment in the Nation's highways \nand bridges in a comprehensive fashion.\n  The authors of H.R. 3999 tout one of the benefits of the bill is that \nit prohibit transfers from the current bridge program to other highway \nprograms. I would like to take a few minutes to explain that while that \nsounds good, it will not accomplish what the authors of the bill want. \nMany States rely on the flexibility allowed under the Federal highway \nprogram to transfer money in between core highway programs as an \nimportant cash and program management tool. This flexibility in the \nbridge program is needed by States as bridges are enormous, ``lumpy'' \ninvestments and it often becomes necessary for States to wait a few \nyears between major bridge replacements. If they did not do so, bridges \nwould consume too much of their highway resources to address nonbridge \nneeds. This bill would prohibit all transfers from the bridge program \non the incorrect assumption that all transfers are bad.\n  Many States find the bridge program requirements too bureaucratic and \nprefer to replace or rehabilitate structurally deficient bridges using \nmore flexible programs. These States transfer money out of the bridge \nprogram and then obligate those same dollars to structurally deficient \nbridges. Also, when bridges are being replaced or rehabilitated as a \npart of a larger project, States frequently transfer money into a \nsingle category of funding that can be used on the entire project. \nBecause of the narrow eligibility of Highway Bridge Program funds, the \nflexibility to transfer funds is oftentimes necessary and does not \nnecessarily detract from the goals of the Highway Bridge Program.\n  H.R. 3999 incorrectly assumes that all bridge construction and \nreconstruction is done through the bridge program. In fact, only about \n55 percent of obligations on bridges are through the Highway Bridge \nProgram. The remaining obligations of funds on bridges, about $2.4 \nbillion, are done using other categories of funding. By prohibiting \ntransfers, H.R. 3999 would effectively punish States that are spending \nmore on bridges than is provided in bridge funding, by denying them an \nimportant cash and program management tool.\n  In addition, H.R. 3999 requires States to follow a risk-based system \ndeveloped in Washington to prioritize the replacement or rehabilitation \nof bridges. Many fear that this will produce a ``worst first'' approach \nto replacing and rehabilitating our bridges an approach that is widely \ncriticized among economists as it costs far more money than a targeted \napproach. In many aspects of government this is a prudent method to \nmake decisions, but the approach set forth in this bill lacks the \ncumulative factor analysis required to make the most cost-beneficial \nand safety-driven bridge investment decisions. Under H.R. 3999's risk-\nbased system, a lower rated bridge that is rarely used and poses no \npublic safety threat could be prioritized ahead of a slightly higher\n\n[[Page S9634]]\n\nrated bridge with more traffic, greater relative importance to the rest \nof the system, and overall more need for investment. This bill would \ncreate yet another level of bureaucracy to a bridge program over-\nburdened with red tape, as State risk-management plans will have to be \napproved by the Department of Transportation.\n  The requirements for the risk management system set forth in H.R. \n3999 are vague and unspecific. However, there is a wide concern among \nState departments of transportation that they will be interpreted by \nFHWA to force one-size-fits-all Federal standards that ignore local \nconsiderations and variations in risk factors across the country, such \nas seismic retrofit.\n  States are already using a highly effective bridge management system \nto address risk when making State-wide bridge investment decisions; \nthis bill will disrupt these efforts.\n  In closing I will reiterate that I fully agree that the current \nHighway Bridge Program needs work, but so does the entire Federal \nHighway Program and I believe we need a comprehensive solution. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to that end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9634-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN DEMOCRACIES\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, almost two decades after the fall of the \nBerlin Wall, democracy and the rule of law have become firmly \nentrenched in many Central and Eastern European nations. We must be \nforthright and firm in our support for the continued independence and \nterritorial integrity of the still fledgling CEE democracies.\n  The political and economic transformation of the region is nothing \nshort of breathtaking. After years of untold suffering under Soviet \nrule, these countries have boldly embraced common transatlantic values \nof liberty and democracy with profound and positive consequences.\n  Internal reforms, including increased government accountability and \nefforts to eradicate corruption, have spurred economic transformations \nreaching deep within each country. Respect for human rights and \ndemocratic reforms have invigorated civil society. The progress and \nachievements in the region are inspirational, and I join with the 22 \nmillion Americans of Central and Eastern European heritage in taking \ngreat pride in the democratization of these former Soviet bloc \ncountries.\n  But the great strides in freedom and democracy in the region are \nunder threat. Russia's recent military incursion into the neighboring \ncountry of Georgia was a dramatic wake-up call. Some have suggested the \nincursion is a harbinger of Russian desires to limit the sovereignty \nand pro-Western orientation of vulnerable neighboring countries. I hope \nthat is not the case.\n  Just last month, the leaders of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, \nand Ukraine stood together with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili \nto demonstrate solidarity in the face of Russia's incursion. The United \nStates pledged its support for the democratically elected Government of \nGeorgia and for Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty. \nEuropean leaders helped broker a cease-fire agreement. The United \nStates, Europe, and the CEE nations must continue to stand together in \nthe face of Russian aggression and interference in the region.\n  Nevertheless, as disturbing as Russia's behavior has been, we must we \nmust find a way to step back from the path of confrontation with \nRussia. It makes better sense to find common ground than to engage in \nconfrontation. This does not mean indulgence of Russia's recent \nactions. On the contrary, we must find a way to work with Russia \nwithout ceding freedom and democracy in the region.\n  Let me be clear. I am deeply committed to the continued freedom, \ndemocracy, and independence of the Central and Eastern European \nnations. At the same time, I fully support the democratization of \nRussia. Ultimately, we need to find a way to improve relations with \nRussia, but the effort cannot be one-sided.\n  It is in Russia's own economic interest to step up to the plate and \nbe a positive member of the international community. Our relationship \nwith Russia may be complicated, but we can find common ground in \nworking together to strengthen global security, economic stability, and \ndemocracy. Moreover, the United States needs Russia as a partner in \nbuilding a peaceful and prosperous Europe.\n  The United States does not have to choose between the Central and \nEastern European countries and Russia. We should be able to form real \npartnerships with both.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9634-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9634-S9635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DOMESTIC INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS POST 9/11\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it has been more than 7 years since al-\nQaida attacked us at home. There are many lessons those attacks should \nhave taught us, many things we should have been doing as a nation since \nthat date which we have yet to do. These post-9/11 gaps in our efforts \nand strategies need as much if not more attention today as they did on \nSeptember 12, 2001. The largest gap we face is a strategic gap between \nwhat we should have done and what this administration elected to do in \nresponse to the tragic events of 9/11. The administration chose to \nattack Iraq rather than complete the mission in Afghanistan--where the \n9/11 attacks were hatched--and address al-Qaida's expanding influence \nin northern Africa, Southeast Asia, and beyond. Those threats are real \nand have the continuing potential to manifest themselves again in \ndisastrous ways here at home and around the world.\n  There are other gaps--failures by this administration to address the \nreal challenges of our post-9/11 world. We have created a gap in the \nreadiness of our military. Our National Guard, an integral part of any \nlarge disaster response, has been severely strained. We continue to \nhave insufficient intelligence and information resources posted abroad. \nWe have insufficient diplomatic personnel, with insufficient language \nand other cultural experience, to cover the many places in the world \nwhere our national security interests require that we know more--and \ninteract with those who know us least. And while I applaud the efforts \nof this administration to encourage more of our citizens to engage in \ninternational volunteer programs, there is room for much more to be \ndone to strengthen our image and our impact abroad through citizen \noutreach and private diplomacy. In a post-9/11 world, these continuing \ngaps pose real threats to our security at home, and we cannot ignore \nthem at the expense of a strategically misguided and perilously \nexpensive ongoing military presence in Iraq.\n  Closer to home, we are now beginning to suffer serious challenges to \nour economic stability and longer term economic outlook. We are \nsquandering our wealth and failing to invest in our economic future and \nour domestic security. Osama bin Laden's stated goal was to bankrupt \nAmerica. Well, the cost of our presence in Iraq may ultimately exceed \nthe massive cost proposed to bail out our failed financial systems. And \nwhat do we have to show for the hundreds of billions spent in Iraq? \nWhat do Americans have as a return on their investment? A more perilous \nworld in which al-Qaida has a safe haven in Pakistan, our power and \ninfluence are diminished and our military might is badly overextended.\n  So where do we go from here? We go where Americans have always gone \nin times of challenge. We will take up the challenge we face head-on \nand work to close the gaps we face in the fabric of our domestic \nsecurity.\n  Here at home, we continue to have critical gaps in our domestic \nsecurity, in our infrastructure, in our first responder systems. We \nstill have not deployed an effective system to prevent the smuggling of \nradiological materials through our ports. We have not done everything \nwe can to secure chemical facilities that could be the source of \nmaterials for domestic car bombs like the ones we have seen cause so \nmuch damage in Baghdad. We have not fully implemented the command \nsystem needed to ensure that first responders know how to work together \nacross federal, state and local government.\n  We have also failed to establish the military forces needed to \nconduct medical triage, search and rescue, and decontamination in the \nwake of a WMD incident at home. I tried to offer an amendment to the \n2009 Defense authorization bill that would have mandated that these \nforces be established by the end of 2009 and that they be maintained at \nthe highest levels of readiness. This\n\n[[Page S9635]]\n\namendment would have addressed what the Commission on the National \nGuard and Reserves characterized as an ``appalling gap'' in our \ndomestic defenses. I was unsuccessful, but I will continue to press for \nenactment of this legislation. It is time that we get our priorities \nstraight and put the defense of the American people first.\n  State and local authorities will always be the first to defend the \nAmerican people in any disaster, whether manmade or natural. We need to \nensure that we give them the resources they need to fulfill their \nresponsibilities. That is why I have long supported adequate funding \nfor homeland security and emergency management grants. I opposed the \nadministration's proposal to reduce funding for these grants this year \nand am pleased that 2009 Homeland Security appropriations bill, which \nwe should vote on shortly, includes increased funding for these and \nother important State and local grant programs.\n  The security of our borders is another critical priority. While I had \nserious concerns about some provisions of the Comprehensive Immigration \nReform Act of 2007, the bill took some steps toward tightening border \nsecurity that I strongly supported, such as requiring the Department of \nHomeland Security, DHS, to develop a national border security strategy \nand border surveillance plan. The bill also required DHS to develop a \nschedule for implementing the US-VISIT exit-entry program, created new \ncriminal penalties for constructing border tunnels, provided grants to \nlaw enforcement agencies to address criminal activity along the border, \nand required the Government to work with countries south of the border \nto combat human smuggling and drug trafficking.\n  While that bill ultimately failed, I have supported other measures to \nenhance border security which have been signed into law, including \nfunding to hire 23,000 new Border Patrol agents, put in place vehicle \nbarriers along the border, install 105 radar and camera towers, remove \nand detain undocumented aliens, construct barriers, and purchase ground \nand aerial surveillance devices. Congress must take a practical \napproach to securing the borders and provide the resources necessary \nfor our Government to carry out that important responsibility.\n  From our borders to the first responders in our communities, we face \ntremendous challenges. As we work to close those security gaps, we must \nalso draw on America's boundless capacity for innovation and \ncreativity. We need those talents more than ever as we face \nunprecedented challenges in our energy sector and elsewhere. We remain \nhostage to foreign oil sources, yet we have not invested adequately in \nthe necessary alternatives. We face huge challenges in our \ntransportation systems, which consume the largest proportion of our \npetroleum resources. We are beginning to understand that fresh water \nmay be the next oil and that we have to use, conserve, and manage it as \nthe scarce resource that it is. And where do these alternatives \nnecessary to rebuild and sustain the economy of our future come from? \nOur history tells us they come from what President Eisenhower, in his \nfarewell address to the Nation, called the ``solitary inventor, \ntinkering in his shop''--the entrepreneurial small businessperson.\n  So we must invest in our skilled workers and our infrastructure. We \nmust find ways to invigorate our creative and entrepreneurial small \nbusinesses so that we can not only drive innovation and employment but \nstrengthen our own security in the process.\n  Two programs--the Small Business Innovation Research and Small \nBusiness Technology Transfer Programs--are prime examples of how we can \nencourage innovation to improve our security. These highly successful \nprograms not only need to be reauthorized, they need to be \nsubstantially increased and targeted at the key challenges of our time. \nOur domestic security, our innovative and entrepreneurial \nopportunities, our country's longer term employment prospects, and our \neconomic future are all directly benefited by these programs, which \nprovide Federal money for small business innovation. And the National \nResearch Council, after an exhaustive study of the SBIR Program, tells \nus that Congress could effectively increase funding of this effort. \nThis is the kind of investment we need to be making in our national \nsecurity and in our economic future.\n  As we make that investment, we should make security-related \ninnovation a stated priority of SBIR, not simply a byproduct of some \nSBIR-supported research. There are few, if any, Government programs \nbetter positioned to develop technologies to protect the American \npeople than SBIR. I have introduced legislation to make domestic \nsecurity, water security and quality, transportation, and energy top \nSBIR priorities. By focusing SBIR innovation and research in all of \nthese areas, but especially domestic security and water security and \nquality, we can do a great deal to address the security challenges we \nface.\n  Today there are many technologies addressing areas such as first \nresponder emergency responses, detection of radioactive materials, \ncargo scanning and cybersecurity, that demand more research and \ninnovation to meet our security needs in a post-9/11 world. Recent \nreports from the Government Accountability Office and the National \nAcademy of Sciences, for instance, identify troubling gaps in first \nresponders' ability to deal with hazardous releases in urban areas or \nour ability to better track and detect radioactive materials. SBIR can \nfund the research that can close these security gaps, and that \nprogram--and most importantly the small business innovators \nthemselves--deserve our full support in Congress.\n  Mr. President, as this administration comes to a close, we have an \nopportunity to revisit how best to address the gaps that have arisen in \nour national security both before and since 9/11. Our need to act is no \nless urgent now than it was 7 years ago, except that we have squandered \ntime and great resources in the intervening period. I urge those of us \nwho will return in the next Congress to work with the next \nadministration to address these gaps with a renewed perspective on the \nsense of urgency they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9635-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FIREARMS AND SUICIDE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a recent article in the New England Journal \nof Medicine examined the link between the presence of guns in the home \nand the chance of suicide. The article, written by Dr. Matthew Miller \nand Dr. David Hemenway, entitled ``Guns and Suicide in the United \nStates,'' illustrates a direct correlation between having a loaded \nfirearm in a home and the success rate of suicide attempts.\n  According to the article, in 2005, the most recent year mortality \ndata are available, suicide was the second leading cause of death among \nAmericans 40 years of age or younger. More than half of all suicides in \nthe United States are carried out by a firearm. An average of 46 \nAmericans per day committed suicide with a firearm in 2005, accounting \nfor 53 percent of all completed suicides.\n  Many of the attempts made at suicide are both impulsive and fleeting. \nThere is often a very short window between the time a person decides \nthey are going to attempt suicide and the time they follow through with \nthe attempt. These attempts are often made drastically, in reaction to \na specific event. However, as the initial reaction to the event \nsubsides, so often does the urge to attempt suicide. This is \nillustrated by the fact that more than 90 percent of the people who \nsurvive a suicide attempt, do not go on to die by suicide. \nUnfortunately, those attempt suicide using a firearm are rarely \nfortunate enough to survive and thus have an opportunity for \nreconsideration. Suicide attempts that involve drugs or cutting have a \nmuch lower mortality rate.\n  The article cites over a dozen studies that have found that there is \nbetween a two and ten times greater risk of suicide in a home with a \nfirearm than without. These risks do not only increase for the gun \nowner but also for the gun owner's spouse and children.\n  The simple fact is that guns increase the chance of suicide. Suicide \nprevention is a national problem that demands our attention and \ncommitment. Congress must do its part by taking such steps as ensuring \ngun manufacturers supply trigger locks and closing the loopholes that \nallow young people easy access to guns.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9636-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9636]]\n                             OVARIAN CANCER\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, ovarian cancer, the fifth most fatal \ncancer among women in the United States, is a serious and \nunderrecognized threat to women's health.\n  This year alone, there will be an estimated 21,650 new cases of \novarian cancer in the United States and it will cause more than 15,000 \ndeaths. In Delaware, there were 322 cases of ovarian cancer between \n1999 and 2003--the most recent data--and 211 deaths during that time.\n  Unfortunately, there is no screening test currently available for the \nearly detection of ovarian cancer despite the fact that it is highly \ntreatable when detected early.\n  Increased public awareness of this disease, its risk factors and its \nsubtle symptoms can save the lives of women across Delaware. Moreover, \nwomen's doctors must learn to recognize the warning signs of ovarian \ncancer, which are often the only early indication of illness.\n  Throughout this past September, the Delaware Chapter of the National \nOvarian Cancer Coalition has promoted ovarian cancer awareness \nactivities and encouraged every Delaware woman to become educated about \nthe symptoms and risk factors of ovarian cancer.\n  More ovarian cancer research will help to develop reliable \ndiagnostics, better therapies and prevention strategies, offering women \nin Delaware and throughout the United States an opportunity to win \ntheir battle against this tragic gynecologic cancer.\n  It is time for all women and their doctors to become more aware of \nthe warning signs of ovarian cancer and to become better educated about \nearly treatment options, because lives depend on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9636-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Renewable \nEnergy and Job Creation Act of 2008, which includes a provision that \nextends a credit under section 45 of the Tax Code to ``steel industry \nfuel.'' Steel industry fuel is a feedstock for the production of coke \nthat is important to our Nation because it provides significant energy, \nenvironmental, economic, and financial benefits.\n  The energy and environmental benefits include utilizing a high Btu \ncontent hazardous waste in a fuel product that is created using a \nprocess that has been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. \nThe use of steel industry fuel makes our domestic steel industry \neconomically more competitive by lowering production and operational \ncosts. This in turn provides national defense benefits from a stronger \ndomestic manufacturing base. It also provides financial benefits to \nsteel company employees and retirees who all gain from a more \ncompetitive steel industry.\n  The addition of steel industry fuel to the section 45 credit is \nintended to promote the use of the steel industry fuel process to \nmanufacture a feedstock for the production of coke that recaptures the \nBtu content of ``coal waste sludge.'' Coal waste sludge is the tar \ndecanter sludge and other byproducts of the coking process. These \nmaterials have generally been treated as hazardous wastes under \napplicable Federal environmental rules (and in the past have been \nstored in the ground and in lagoons). Coal waste sludge has an energy \ncontent ranging from 7,000 Btus to 16,000 Btus per pound.\n  Coal waste sludge can generally be disposed of by one of several \nmethods--use as part of a fuel product, steel industry fuel, \nincineration, or foreign land-filling. The most favorable method, from \nan energy resource and environmental perspective, is to use a process \nthat liquefies the coal waste sludge and combines the liquefied coal \nwaste sludge with coal to create steel industry fuel for use as a fuel \nproduct in steel producers' coke batteries. This method recaptures the \nsignificant energy content of the coal waste sludge and can be \nperformed onsite at the steel producers' coke operations. The disposal \nof coal waste sludge in this manner has been approved by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. See 50 Federal Register No. 120, June \n22, 1992.\n  The alternative methods of disposal are to transport the coal waste \nsludge offsite for incineration or to foreign countries for \nlandfilling. Offsite disposal has significant drawbacks, including the \nneed to physically convey a hazardous waste, which is a dangerous, \ncumbersome, and expensive undertaking, and the failure to recapture the \nenergy content of the coal waste sludge if it is incinerated or \nlandfilled in a foreign country. Incineration of coal waste sludge also \nrequires the utilization of energy resources to burn up another energy \nresource, the coal waste sludge.\n  Steel industry fuel is produced using a facility that liquefies and \ndistributes on each ton of coal approximately one-quarter to one-half \ngallon of coal waste sludge. Liquefied coal waste sludge in these \namounts avoids operational and equipment problems with the coke \nbatteries that use steel industry fuel as a feedstock to produce coke. \nAn excessive amount of coal waste sludge in the coke battery causes \nadverse and irreparable damage to the coke battery. Steel industry fuel \nfacilities include a facility that is comprised of one or more batch \ntanks and/or one or more storage tanks, steam and spray pipes, \nprocessing pumps, variable speed drives, a flowmeter, and related \nelectrical equipment.\n  Explanation of Credit: The refined coal credit for steel industry \nfuel in the act is intended to provide an incentive for the expanded \nproduction of steel industry fuel. This expanded production is intended \nto provide energy and environmental benefits by promoting the use of an \nalternative fuel that recaptures the energy content of a byproduct of \nthe coking process, coal waste sludge, which would otherwise be treated \nas a hazardous waste. Accordingly, a credit is provided for the barrel-\nof-oil-equivalent production of steel industry fuel. The steel industry \nfuel provision the Senate approved would modify the current credit \nunder section 45 with regard to the amount of the credit and the time \nperiod for the availability of the credit. This is necessary to \ndifferentiate the refined coal product that becomes steel industry fuel \nfrom the refined coal product currently eligible for a credit under \nsection 45. Without the distinctions passed in this legislation, steel \nindustry fuel would continue to be denied the tax treatment that will \nenable the steel industry to continue to produce coke domestically and \nprevent having to bury toxic waste into landfills.\n  To reflect differences between the refined coal currently eligible \nfor a credit and refined coal credit that is steel industry fuel, such \nas higher coal costs for the metallurgical coal used to manufacture \nsteel industry fuel, the steel industry fuel provision modifies Section \n45 with regard to the amount of the credit, the placed in service \nperiod, the credit period, and other items.\n  The steel industry fuel provision in the act is drafted to provide \ngreater certainty to steel industry fuel producers that their fuel \nproduction is eligible for the credit by providing specific definitions \nfor both ``steel industry fuel'' and ``coal waste sludge.'' This \ngreater specificity is designed to attract the outside investment that \nis needed to finance steel industry fuel projects and expand the use of \nthe steel industry fuel process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9636-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9636-S9637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an important \nissue for the people of the state of Wyoming. It is one that this body \nhas attempted to address several times over the last three years, but \nnever successfully: immigration reform.\n  Last year I introduced a ``Ten Steps to Health Care'' plan. This plan \nset forth 10 pieces of legislation that enacted as a group or \nindividually would make positive changes in America's health care \nsituation. I believe this approach will work well for the topic of \nimmigration reform so I created a principles document of six steps to \naddress this issue. This is not intended to be a comprehensive list--we \nhave tried comprehensive approaches in the past and it doesn't work. \nThis is a proposal of six reasonable items, based generally on \nproposals and ideas in other pieces of legislation.\n  Amnesty for illegal immigrants is not a part of this proposal. \nAmnesty rewards people for breaking the law and sends the wrong message \nto those\n\n[[Page S9637]]\n\nwishing to immigrate to our country legally. It puts illegal immigrants \nat the head of the line, in front of those who are following the rules \nin order to gain citizenship.\n  These six steps address border enforcement, interior enforcement, \ntemporary worker programs, the employer verification system, English as \nour national language, and a merit-based permanent alien program.\n  The first step is what I have always said must be the top priority of \nany immigration reform proposal. Our Nation must have control of its \nborders. The enforcement of our laws is constitutionally the \nresponsibility of the executive branch. Congress can ensure that we \nhave adequate authorization and funding for continuing to hire and \ntrain border agents and they must have the proper authorization and \nfunding to do their jobs. Congress already enacted the Secure Fence Act \nto increase the security along our Southern border. The enactment of \nthis law, however, has hit a number of snags. Congress should increase \noversight over the construction of the physical barriers and the \ndevelopment of the elements of the virtual fence. To ensure that \ncongressional intent is clear, any future legislation must include \nspecific construction and acquisition goals. We should also include \nmandates for the administration to report regularly if those goals are \nbeing met and if not, detailed explanations of why.\n  Interior enforcement is also the responsibility of the executive \nbranch and our law enforcement. Congress should use our authority to \nclarify the ability of local law enforcement to assist in the detention \nof illegal immigrants and the reimbursement of those costs from federal \nagencies. As a former mayor, I understand the burden placed on \nsherriff's departments, police departments, and highway patrols when \ntheir already strained budgets are impacted by the delays in receiving \nreimbursements. Congress should also close loopholes that allow so-\ncalled sanctuary cities to avoid and ignore enforcement of Federal \nimmigration laws. When these cities blatantly disregard Federal laws, \nthey put their own citizens at risk by harboring those with no driver's \nlicenses. These community leaders increase the burden on their \ntaxpayers when social services are provided to illegal immigrants. We \nalso should look at increasing the penalties for employers who \nknowingly and willingly, and especially those who repeatedly, hire \nillegal immigrants. Employers must have adequate protections, but we \nneed to show that no business can pay a simple fine and continue to \nhire illegal workers.\n  One of the best ways to help our businesses is by enacting some \ncommonsense changes in our temporary worker system. The current system \nis serving as a deterrent for following our country's laws. The \nproblems with this system are not about a policy debate in Washington, \nthey are about the ability of a small business owner to operate, stay \nin business, and provide for their family. In Wyoming, I have heard \nfrom hospitality businesses under the H-2B program, ranchers under the \nH-2A program, and high-tech businesses under the H-1B program. American \nworkers would always be the preference, but the reality is that some \nbusinesses and industries are not getting the workers they need from \nour domestic labor pool. Businesses must first look for domestic \nworkers--that is a fair requirement and I have not heard from any \nbusiness in my State that disagrees with that. I want to work with the \nbusiness community on this proposal to create language that truly \naddresses their workforce needs.\n  Some ideas we should consider for an updated temporary worker system \ninclude requiring uniform procedures at all consular offices so that \nboth employers and prospective employees understand their obligations, \nrequirements, and the process. We could also reduce the amount of \npaperwork required for businesses going through the temporary worker \nprocess. We must reexamine the congressionally mandated caps on the \nvisa numbers. The reality is that the need is much greater than what \nthe caps currently allow. Congress can raise the caps by reasonable \nlevels and then allow for market needs and usage to permit reasonable \nfluctuation in the numbers. Above all, Congress must listen to the \nbusinesses in our Nation and work with them to create a realist program \nthat meets security and economic needs. We cannot afford for even more \nsmall businesses to close or for large businesses to move overseas.\n  Another area affecting business is the employer verification system \nor E-Verify. I am hopeful that before the 110th Congress adjourns for \nthe year, we will address the expiring authorization. As we look to the \nfuture, we need to consider making this program permanent. I understand \nthere are some who are concerned about the accuracy of the program. We \nneed to encourage usage of the system to determine what shortfalls may \nexist and how to fix them. I am pleased that the President has directed \nthat all Federal Government contractors use E-Verify. We should enact \nthis requirement into law. We also need to give employers the option to \nverify the status of all employees and not just new hires. The U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Service, USCIS, should also be providing \nmonthly reports to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, with \ninformation that merits investigation. In order for this system to \nwork, information must be shared between federal agencies. Finally, I \nsupport USCIS creating a pilot system to provide small and rural \nbusinesses with the opportunity to use E-Verify.\n  One of the most common comments I have heard from the people of \nWyoming is support for English as our national language. My proposal \ncontains two elements addressing our national language. First, we \nshould declare English as our national language. Currently, 30 States \nhave laws in place doing so. A common language for our government \nunifies our citizens. We have a great Nation made up of immigrants and \nI encourage everyone, whether a new citizen or a 10th generation \nAmerican, to keep their family's traditions and cultures thriving in \ntheir homes and lives. This effort is about government documents and \nensuring all citizens know what to expect from their government. The \nsecond part of this proposal eliminates an Executive order that may \nhave been well intended, but has costly consequences. Executive order \n13166 was designed to help those with limited English proficiency have \naccess to government documents and services, but the fact that there \nwere no reasonable limitations set forth make this order effectively \nrequire that every document and every service be ready for access in \nevery possible language.\n  The final step in this plan is creating a merit-based permanent alien \nprogram. This concept is based on permanent alien programs of other \nindustrialized nations like Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and \nAustralia. The United States should have a similar program in place. \nThis concept does not eliminate permanent alien programs for families \nor those with refugee status but would allow our Nation to ensure that \na larger portion of green cards are going to those individuals who are \ncontributing to our economy.\n  Canada's point system allows for approximately 60 percent of \npermanent resident aliens to qualify based on their skills and their \nbenefit to the Canadian economy. The remaining 40 percent of permanent \nresident grants are based on family relations or refugee status. \nCurrent U.S. law allows about 70 percent of our annual 1 million \npermanent resident admissions be based solely on family relations and \nonly about 13 percent to be based on employment with the rest going to \nrefugees and diversity visas.\n  These six steps reflect ideas and concepts from a host of legislative \nproposals already introduced by my congressional colleagues. We could \nenact any one of these sensible proposals today and produce results \ntomorrow. I encourage my colleagues to listen to their constituents \nover the next several months. We need to get the message that Americans \nwant our country's borders secure and our laws enforced. We need to \nhear the needs of our businesses and the financial concerns of our \ncommunities. The message has not gotten through that there are ways to \nimprove our immigration system and make positive changes without \namnesty. The people of America want Congress to improve our immigration \nsystem and we have not yet listened to them.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9638-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9638]]\n                    ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT INFECTIONS\n\n  Mr. BURR Mr. President, I rise today to speak about legislation \npassed by the Senate yesterday, S. 3560. Antibiotic resistant \ninfections are a serious and growing threat to public health in the \nUnited States, and I am pleased that S. 3560 contains a provision to \naddress this threat.\n  The Institute of Medicine and the Infectious Disease Society of \nAmerica, among others, have been warning us about antibiotic resistance \nfor decades. We all know the therapeutics that work today against \ninfections will be less effective over time as bacteria mutate into new \nresistant strains--and the pipeline of new antibiotics is nearly empty. \nMy colleagues and I in Congress have been talking about the importance \nof developing new antibiotics for years, yet little has been done to \ncreate incentives to bring these anti-infectives to market.\n  In 2000, Senator Kennedy stated on the Senate floor, ``We are in a \nrace against time to find new antibiotics before microbes become \nresistant to those already in use.'' He could not have been more \ncorrect. That year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nestimated that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, was \nthe cause of 126,000 hospitalizations in the United States. Today, that \nrate has tripled to nearly 400,000 hospitalizations per year and MRSA \nis the cause of an estimated 19,000 deaths every year.\n  The number of MRSA infections in hospitals has increased 10-fold \nsince 1993. The University of North Carolina hospital systems reported \nearlier this year that 55 percent of patients with skin infections had \na resistant strain.\n  Perhaps more frightening than hospital-acquired infections are those \ninfections acquired in the community, including our elementary schools, \nathletic teams, and offices.\n  These numbers are more than statistics. Every Senator in Congress has \nconstituents who have been impacted by MRSA. These super bugs are \nattacking and in several cases, killing healthy children and adults.\n  Earlier this year, six otherwise healthy high school football players \nat East Forsyth High School in Winston-Salem were diagnosed with MRSA. \nAs the father of two boys who grew up in Winston-Salem and a former \nfootball player myself, this story hits close to home. Unfortunately, \nthis outbreak was far from isolated.\n  According to the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases, antimicrobial resistance is driving up health care costs, \ncontributing to the severity of disease, and increasing death rates \nfrom certain infections. In 2003, the economic burden for staph aureus \nassociated hospital stays in the United States was $14.5 billion.\n  As you may know, many pharmaceutical companies are abandoning or \nscaling back antibiotic research and development in favor of more \nprofitable drugs that treat chronic conditions. This is a regrettable, \nbut understandable, development as market forces that would lead \ncompanies to consider investing in new antibiotic development are weak. \nBecause antibiotics work so well and quickly in most cases, they are \nprescribed for only one or two weeks. That means antibiotics do not \nhave as large a market as drugs that patients take for years. Bottom \nline--increasing the number of safe and effective antibiotics available \nin the United States is crucial to protecting the public health.\n  Section 4 of S. 3560, entitled ``Incentives for the Development of \nand Access to Certain Antibiotics,'' is an important step forward to \nhelp spur research on new antibiotics and provide incentives for the \ncreation of additional generic antibiotics.\n  In the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, FDAMA, \nlegislation I sponsored in the House, Congress moved antibiotics from \nsection 507 to section 505 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act because \nit did not make sense to have antibiotics separate from other drugs in \nthe statue. Congress added language in FDAMA to ensure that antibiotics \napproved under section 507 would not be able to double dip on Hatch-\nWaxman benefits due to their new status under section 505. Those \nbenefits include 3-year and 5-year data exclusivity and patent term \nextension for drugs. The FDAMA language said that any application for \nan antibiotic that was submitted to the Secretary could not ``double \ndip.'' As a result, companies have no access to Hatch-Waxman incentives \nto develop drugs based on active ingredients of the old 507 antibiotics \nsubmitted to, but not approved by, the Food and Drug Administration, \nFDA.\n  Equally important, the FDAMA language also negatively impacted \ngeneric drug companies' ability to gain approval of and market generic \nequivalents of antibiotics approved under section 507.\n  Section 4 of S. 3560 says that any antibiotic that was the subject of \nan application submitted to the FDA, but not approved before FDAMA, can \nget the 3 year and/or 5 year Hatch-Waxman exclusivity or a patent term \nextension. According to the FDA, approximately 10 antibiotics fit this \ncategory of submitted but not approved and about half of those could \nnever be approved because of issues with the active ingredients. \nAccording to a Congressional Research Service legal expert, the Patent \nAct would apply to this language, and it would be legally confusing if \nit did not mention the available Hatch-Waxman patent term extensions. \nFor that reason, the provision authors added language providing the \noption of data exclusivity or a patent term extension.\n  This provision also addresses the negative consequences of the FDAMA \nlanguage on generic drugs. Section 4 of S. 3560 includes language \nclarifying the ability of generic drug companies to gain approval of \nand market generic equivalents of antibiotics approved under section \n507.\n  This provision was included in Senate-passed S. 1082, the Food and \nDrug Administration Revitalization Act, and was agreed upon in Senate-\nHouse conference negotiations. Due to a lack of funding in H.R. 3580, \nthe Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act, the House pulled this \nprovision before passage of H.R. 3580, Public Law 110-85.\n  I commend Senators Baucus, Grassley, Kennedy, Enzi, and Brown for \nmaking antibiotic incentives a priority at this time. It is important \nto encourage more treatments for the increasing number of resistant \nmicrobes we face.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9638-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9638-S9639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       IMPROVING ACCESS TO MAINSTREAM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONAL ACT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, too many Americans are left out of our \nmainstream financial institutions. Millions of working families do not \nhave a bank or credit union account. The unbanked rely on alternative \nfinancial service providers to obtain cash from checks, pay bills, and \nsend remittances. Many of the unbanked are low-and moderate-income \nfamilies that can ill afford having their earnings diminished by \nreliance on these high-cost and often predatory financial services. In \naddition, the unbanked are unable to save securely to prepare for the \nloss of a job, a family illness, a down payment on a first home, or \neducation expenses. There are few affordable alternatives for consumers \nwho need small loans quickly.\n  We need to enact S. 3410, the Improving Access to Mainstream \nFinancial Institutions Act of 2008. This legislation authorizes grants \nintended to help low- and moderate-income unbanked individuals \nestablish credit union or bank accounts. The legislation also \nauthorizes a grant program to encourage the development of affordable \nsmall loans at banks and credit unions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter of support \nfrom the Credit Union National Association, CUNA, for S. 3410 printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   August 1, 2008.\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: On behalf of the Credit Union National \n     Association (CUNA), I am writing in regards to S. 3410, the \n     ``Improving Access to Mainstream Financial Institutions Act \n     of 2008.'' CUNA is the nation's largest credit union advocacy \n     organization, representing nearly 90 percent of our nation's \n     8,300 state and federally chartered credit unions, their \n     state credit union leagues, and their more than 90 million \n     credit union members.\n\n[[Page S9639]]\n\n       CUNA applauds your efforts to encourage low and moderate-\n     income individuals to establish account relationships with \n     mainstream financial institutions and to assist financial \n     institution in offering low cost alternatives to payday \n     loans.\n       Promoting thrift is one of the core missions of credit \n     unions. Credit unions throughout the nation are dedicated to \n     developing and offering products that provide consumers \n     affordable payday lending alternatives. Credit unions also \n     strive to improve their members' economic well-being through \n     financial literacy programs and other initiatives. Because \n     the intent of S. 3410 and the mission of credit unions are so \n     well aligned, CUNA looks forward to the opportunity to work \n     with you and your staff to suggest operational improvements \n     to the bill as it makes its way through the legislative \n     process.\n       On behalf of CUNA, our state leagues, member credit unions \n     and their credit union members, I appreciate the opportunity \n     to share our views on S. 3410, and we look forward to \n     continuing to work with you on these and other issues \n     important to consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Daniel A.

HOLMES\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Kenny Perry and \nJ.B. Holmes for their contribution to the success of the 2008 United \nStates Ryder Cup team.\n  The 2008 Ryder Cup was recently held in my home State at the Valhalla \nGolf Club in Louisville, KY. On Sunday, the American team defeated the \nEuropeans 16\\1/2\\ to 11\\1/2\\. This was their first Ryder Cup victory \nsince 1999. If not for the remarkable performances by Mr. Perry and Mr. \nHolmes, this success would not have been possible.\n  Mr. Perry was born in Elizabethtown, KY, but calls Franklin, KY, his \nhome. He started playing golf at the age of 7 and spent years \nperfecting his game. He later went on to attend Western Kentucky \nUniversity and started golfing professionally in 1982. He has shown his \ndedication to the game of golf by building a public golf course in his \nhometown specifically designed for handicapped individuals. Perry's \nperformance at this year's Ryder Cup was exceptional as he finished \nwith a total record of two wins, one loss, and one tie. His \nachievements on and off the course are to be commended.\n  Mr. Holmes was born and currently resides in Campbellsville, KY. He \nhas played golf most of his life, including playing for his local high \nschool golf team as a third grade elementary student. He later went on \nto attend the University of Kentucky and started playing professional \ngolf in 2005. His hard work and dedication have earned him the right to \nbe named among the highest skilled golfers in the world. Mr. Holmes' \nperformance at the 2008 Ryder Cup was one of the best. He finished with \na total score of two wins, no losses, and one tie. It was a pleasure to \nwatch Mr. Holmes compete and I congratulate him on an outstanding \nperformance.\n  I now ask my fellow colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. Perry \nand Mr. Holmes for their remarkable performance and achievement. These \ntwo men have represented Kentucky and the United States well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9639-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NATIONAL FIRST RESPONDER APPRECIATION DAY\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor Idaho's \nfirst responders.\n  I have been joined by a bipartisan group of my Senate colleagues in \npassing a resolution that designates today, September 25, 2008, as \nNational First Responder Appreciation Day. I would like to celebrate \nthis day by showing my appreciation for the brave men and women who \nhave risked life and limb and sacrificed family time and personal \ncomfort to perform a task that is critical to citizens of the State of \nIdaho.\n  I would like to recognize the heroic efforts of all of Idaho's first \nresponders, our firefighters, EMTs, medical personnel, and law \nenforcement officers. Thousands of first responders have made the \nultimate sacrifice and have proven critical in leading the Nation \nthrough national tragedies like September 11 and natural disasters such \nas Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, through flooding in the Midwest, \nHurricane Katrina and wildfires across the Western United States.\n  In Idaho, fire is a way of life. During the 2007 fire season, over 2 \nmillion acres burned, more than at any other time in Idaho's recorded \nhistory. Generally, Idaho's fire season begins in mid-July and extends \ninto September, but in 2007, the Cascade Complex fire burned until the \nsnow fell. The Cascade Complex fire was only one of several very large \nfires last year. The East Zone Complex fire in central Idaho burned \nover 300,000 acres, and the Murphy Complex fire in south-central Idaho \nburned over 600,000 acres. During this trying time, our first \nresponders and firefighters went above and beyond the call of duty. \nIncident management teams and area command teams worked for weeks on \nend, battling flames and working to protect homes and lives. I have had \nthe opportunity to visit fire camps and speak to these heroes who, like \nour veterans, often endanger their own lives to save the lives of \nothers. Staff at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, ID, is \nto be commended for their tireless response coordination efforts.\n  While the severity of this fire season has not risen to the level of \nlast year's fire season in Idaho, firefighters and other first \nresponders have remained vigilant. The Oregon Trail fire in Boise, ID, \nbegan on August 25, 2008, when a brush fire, fed by 50 mph. winds, dry \nsage brush, high heat, and aided by sloped terrain, spread to the \nnearby Oregon Trail and Columbia Village subdivisions. The fire caused \nthe destruction of ten homes, damage to nine others, and claimed the \nlife of Mary Ellen Ryder, a professor at Boise State University. During \nthis trying time, my thoughts and prayers go out to the Ryder family \nand others who have homes that have been lost or damaged. Thankfully, \npreplanning and preparation enabled Boise firefighters to avert the \npossibility of greater damage and loss. Firefighters arrived at \nSweetwater Drive within 2 minutes of the first call, and they proceeded \nto risk their lives to draw a fire line between the burning houses and \nthe other nearby subdivisions, protecting more than 1,000 homes and \ncountless families.\n  The example of professionalism, strength, and bravery displayed by \nthe Boise Police and Fire Departments during the events of the Oregon \nTrail fire is just one of many examples I could cite to illustrate the \ninvaluable service wildland, municipal, and volunteer firefighters \nprovide to our communities. Likewise, our EMTs, medical personnel, law \nenforcement, and others put their lives on the line daily to help \nothers. Today, these efforts will receive recognition before the United \nStates Senate and the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9639-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9639-S9641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,000, are \nheartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting \nevery e-mail sent to me through an address set up specifically for this \npurpose to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will be \neasily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious \nattention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only \ndetail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       If you want to really understand what is going on with our \n     energy crises, please view all eight sections of: http://\nvideo.google.com/videoplay?docid=3870461488930715065.\n     Brad and Dee. \n                                  ____\n\n       These rising fuel prices are hurting my family and our \n     business! We own a logging company which, being all \n     mechanized, requires use of a lot of fuel. In addition, our \n     jobs are usually 100 miles or more away and even with our \n     employees commuting together, the cost is outrageous. In the \n     logging industry, it is not all that easy to pass the cost on \n     to the customer. The jobs we are doing right now were bid on \n     last year; therefore the price is set and was set without the \n     prediction that the fuel prices were going to be this high. \n     Our employees can forget\n\n[[Page S9640]]\n\n     raises, bonuses or benefits as we cannot afford them, \n     therefore it will be harder to keep and find new employees. \n     We subcontract our log hauling and the truck drivers that \n     have not quit driving completely are charging a fortune to \n     haul our logs to the mills. At this point, we are unsure of \n     our future as a business which, in turn, is affecting our \n     family and our employees' families.\n       We have to be careful with our spending and put money \n     aside. Forget that vacation to Yellowstone or any camping \n     this summer as the cost of hauling our camp trailer is too \n     high. Forget enjoying our beautiful lakes and rivers as the \n     cost of fueling our boat is too expensive. And even driving \n     to our favorite fishing hole is too costly. These things, our \n     Idaho way of life, that have always been inexpensive family \n     fun are now considered luxuries.\n       I have always and especially now support utilizing our own \n     natural resources and relying less on foreign sources for \n     anything. Although, I am suspicious that the rising fuel \n     costs can be more controlled and are not just a factor of \n     supply and demand. I wish I could do more other than tell my \n     story and something needs to be done now by those in power. I \n     feel powerless and controlled as you were saying, Mr. Crapo; \n     Idahoans have no choice with the distances we have to travel \n     and the lack of public transportation, and our jobs which \n     require the use of fuel. Thanks for your efforts but this \n     problem needs a solution immediately!\n     Deanna, Post Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       One way to give back to the community is to volunteer for a \n     non-profit. My wife does this regularly. The group that she \n     is with will do home visits to help a particular group of \n     people--those that are on the margin about to fail \n     financially. The idea is to give people a little boost and \n     prevent them from falling into a cycle of dependence for a \n     long time.\n       Frequently, she'd ask me to go with her as they always \n     require two people for safety reasons. I sit and watch the \n     faces of the people being harmed by the current inaction in \n     Congress. They know that so much is riding on what happens in \n     the near future. Today, they are proud and know that they pay \n     their own way. However, they fear having to live off the \n     backs of others, becoming a burden and losing their pride in \n     the process.\n       People know what is going on. Regarding Congress, the words \n     we speak at these meetings are pretty simple. The people \n     leading this country have worked for a long time to put us in \n     this position. They are pushing you to the ground, and then \n     grinding their heels into your head.\n       Many are suffering today--not because Congress does not \n     give them stuff, but because Congress erodes the foundation \n     of their prosperity--access to energy.\n     Robert.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a manager of low-income senior housing in Boise. Many \n     of our tenants are on a fixed income and no longer drive. I \n     have been transporting a few of my residents to the food bank \n     as a courtesy to those that cannot drive and who do not have \n     family to help. I have had to discontinue this charitable \n     action because I can no longer afford to drive around unless \n     it is absolutely necessary. This is truly unfortunate. One of \n     the residents told me they cannot afford a taxi (especially \n     now with the higher rates) so how are they supposed to get \n     around?\n       On a personal note, I used to enjoy recreational activities \n     throughout Idaho. I know I personally cut down on about half \n     of these trips due to the gas prices. This must have a \n     negative impact on tourism and small businesses. I would \n     drive up to Cascade to the Flea Market or to Horseshoe Bend \n     or Lucky Peak to go fishing. I haven't been able to go \n     camping or fishing yet this year. We need some relief from \n     the gas prices because it is impacting everyday quality of \n     life: the price of groceries, visiting friends and family, \n     normal daily activities become a tough choice.\n       Please help!\n     Amber, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Normally I wait until election time to express my opinions \n     through my right to vote. However, at this time, I feel so \n     strongly about a plague facing our country that I cannot bear \n     to sit idly by until November, praying for a change to take \n     place. This plague which I speak of is our current gas \n     prices. I am certain you are hearing about this on a daily \n     basis as a representative for the state of Idaho, but I want \n     to be included amongst those who choose to elevate this \n     issue.\n       Gasoline prices have been a concern since they crept up to \n     the $3/gallon mark for regular, so why is it that nothing is \n     seemingly being done about this by our government as those \n     prices further creep up above the $4/gallon mark? There is \n     plenty of talk, but no immediate action. According to the \n     Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average wages earned in Boise \n     for 2007 are $33,072, thanks to the high paying tech jobs \n     that the majority of Boise residents do not possess. \n     Supposedly, the average cost of living here is only $29,864. \n     So, that leaves the ``average'' Boisean with $267 a month to \n     pay their bills outside what is considered ``cost of \n     living'', and those are 2007 statistics. We haven't seen a \n     wage increase in our fair town to compensate for the fact \n     that we are paying double for gasoline what we paid a year \n     ago. Not only is gasoline cost eating up our income, but cost \n     of groceries has gone up as a direct result of cost incurred \n     while transporting food. Many of the people in this area you \n     represent are suffering over something that the government \n     you work for has indirect control over. I plead with you--\n     this issue needs to get resolved prior to the elections in \n     November. We as a country cannot wait five more months for \n     economic relief and then endure the growing pains the first \n     year with the President-elect brings. The rising cost of \n     gasoline and lack of an increase in personal income needs to \n     be addressed immediately. What are you doing to intervene on \n     behalf of the Idahoans? I ask rhetorically, but sincerely. \n     The answer is not to be found in requiring people to purchase \n     more gas-friendly vehicles (they can no longer afford the \n     monthly payment that a new car brings) nor is it to be found \n     in another pittance of a stimulus package. The answer is for \n     our government to be proactive in finding resources for our \n     glorious country to use that come at a considerably lower \n     cost.\n     Erica.\n                                  ____\n\n       In response to a detailed message as to the effect of gas \n     prices in our family budget, I would like to forward this \n     message; yes, it is another area where it is affecting \n     everyone in just about everything we do. In some ways, it is \n     a good thing to give us an awareness of mistakes we have made \n     in the past and bring about new solutions. One solution that \n     I am aware of is the use of a product called Ferox, which was \n     developed in 1986 from work done on experimental burn rate \n     modifiers for solid rocket propellant systems use in the \n     aerospace industry. Ferox is a catalysis which treats fuel \n     (gas or diesel) so it will burn at a near 100%. The results \n     is a average 20% increase in fuel efficiency, 95% reduction \n     in emissions, 80% increase in oil life, and increase in \n     horsepower as much as 15% & it works 100% of the time \n     doubling engine life. Very affordable to the point of less \n     than $20.00 it will treat up to 150 gallons of fuel giving \n     upwards to a 600% return on the $20.00 investment. We are \n     trying to get the word out to as many as we can, because it \n     is and will make a difference. For more on line information, \n     go to www.FeroxFuelTabs.com/FeroxUSA\n     Gordon, Twin Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       The environmental movement has just about brought this \n     nation to a standstill and is basically punishing the lower \n     wage earners just so they can try and change society into the \n     model that they feel is relevant for the next century. I \n     truly feel sorry for those people; especially since they are \n     the ones that the ``left'' supposedly is championing the \n     right of.\n       Drilling for oil is not dangerous to the environment any \n     longer. There is no basis for this thinking in fact, plus \n     there is no evidence that humans have ever been able to do \n     anything that has caused climate change, so we need to stop \n     this insanity and get our country moving forward again and \n     begin using our natural resources.\n       Are we going to remain hostage to the Arabs and the radical \n     fringe that is taken over this country of ours? Everyone \n     needs to step up and be accountable and do something so we do \n     not become a country that is irrelevant in the world we live \n     in.\n     Lowell.\n                                  ____\n\n       A really simple way to show your colleagues on Capitol Hill \n     how the high price of fuel is affecting the ``real people in \n     Idaho'' is to give up all the freebies our Senators and \n     Representatives get through the government and try living on \n     your actual salaries for 60 days. No free trips, free airfare \n     or lodging, discounted gas, food, benefits, medical \n     insurance, retirement savings, etc.\n       Have your families (wives & kids) try and live on what you \n     actually make, just like the ``real people in Idaho.'' Get \n     back in touch with reality and then maybe you will see why \n     some people have to choose between putting gas in the car or \n     food on the table. I know none of our distinguished \n     legislators will actually do this because then you would have \n     to face the facts that Americans are drowning and our \n     government is throwing us anvils to help.\n     Caralea, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I live in rural Idaho, and my wife and I have five \n     children. Since we have a large family, my wife drives an \n     SUV, which gets an average of 14-16 mpg. Each time we have to \n     run the children to piano, dance, clogging, baseball, etc., \n     it costs us $2-$3. Making several trips a day can cost as \n     much as $15-$20. If you multiply that by 5 days a week X 52 \n     weeks, it becomes very expensive. Our lifestyle has been \n     drastically changed, and I do not see any light at the end of \n     the tunnel. We drive less, we save less and we feel less \n     secure in our future and the future of our children.\n       The really sad thing is that, because of special interest \n     and environmental groups, we are not able to utilize the \n     resources we have at our disposal. In my opinion, we have sat \n     on our hands for far too long. Drill on the North Slope, \n     drill offshore and develop the technology to extract from oil \n     shale. Let the Middle East sell oil to the Chinese, the \n     Russians and each other. I do not think we can dramatically \n     reduce our consumption in the near future. $100+ a barrel oil \n     will destroy our economy; something needs to be done now!\n     Bryan.\n                                  ____\n\n       It is really unfortunate that the prices for gasoline have \n     risen to such extreme levels, but we know they will only get \n     worse. I have\n\n[[Page S9641]]\n\n     combated this by riding my bike everyday to and from work and \n     school but I know not everyone has this option. I think that \n     these prices are a wake-up call to us and should be taken \n     seriously. I hate it when people complain about the costs \n     when they are not realizing that driving their trucks and \n     SUVs on a 30-minute commute through town is awful for the \n     environment and completely irresponsible. Although our public \n     transport system [is not adequate], there are ways to work \n     around having to drive. Idahoans are just too lazy. There are \n     park and rides, regular buses, bikes, and the green belt that \n     we can utilize to commute. Congress needs to make it their \n     priority to not just focus on one ``fix'' to the situation, \n     but how we can utilize all of our resources. I think you can \n     promote more bikers if there were safer and larger bike \n     lanes, as well as a more publicized public transportation \n     system with bike racks on them. This problem will always be \n     the topic for summer because everyone wants to go out of town \n     and go camping, when it becomes an environmental issue more \n     so than an economical issue we can combat all of the \n     complaining and suffering. There needs to be a paradigm shift \n     that will only come by congress's support, education, and \n     from advertising these goals. Please consider what I have \n     said. I am in the same boat as other thousands college \n     students who are realizing our real problems and we need to \n     see some change towards clean energy. The only thing I do not \n     agree with, however, is the use of nuclear power. It is a non \n     renewable resource, what we want to get away from and the \n     amount of heating it causes to the water resource it uses is \n     bad for that ecological environment.

But you really got it \n     wrong voting against the energy bill. It is time to start \n     solving the problem not just pushing it out to the future, \n     where it is going to cost a lot more. You need to start being \n     part of the solution to these challenges, and not part of the \n     problem.\n     Rob, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       The rise in gas prices has caused me and my family of three \n     to cut back the number of times we eat out, visit the store \n     and go out for entertainment. We just do the essential things \n     now. If we do decide to do any entertainment, we pay for it \n     on a credit card, the balance of which has been continually \n     rising as our economy has declined.\n     Walt, Jerome.\n                                  ____\n\n       We need another ``Manhattan Project'' to solve the energy \n     problem. Private industry has focused its solution for the \n     energy crises on developing vehicles that will run on \n     something they can ``sell'' you. I noted that a Japanese \n     company (Genepax) is developing a car that runs on water. I \n     believe that a government initiative to develop a vehicle \n     such as that is needed. But, I would not stop there.\n       Once the technology is perfected, the U.S. should license \n     it to the remainder of the world. That would help to \n     underwrite the cost of the second phase of the solution.\n       Once the technology is developed, the government should put \n     out a bid for U.S. industry to build such an automobile. \n     (That would put American's back to work). Second, the U.S. \n     should give every taxpaying household one of the cars. (To \n     get one of the new cars you would have to turn in your old \n     car). That would be much better than ``tax cuts'' or \n     ``rebates'', and would serve to get a lot of the old, carbon \n     producing, gas guzzlers off the road.\n       This solution would, end our dependence on foreign oil; put \n     American's back to work; reduce the emissions problem; and \n     give every American family a boost up.\n       Of course, the cost would be enormous, but since we can \n     spend $900 billion on a farm bill and untold billions on the \n     Iraq war to maintain our oil supplies, it should not be out \n     of reach.\n     Charles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9641-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAN\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

I did work with the authors of the \nresolution, however, to come to an agreement on a few minor changes to \nthe resolution.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Battelle, one \nof Ohio's oldest and most respected organizations.\n  On October 22, 1938, 70 years ago next month, a sea change in \nprinting occurred, though no one but the inventor, Chester Carlson, and \nBattelle had the foresight to recognize it.\n  The invention of dry printing, forever memorialized by the etched \nwords ``10-22-38 Astoria,'' was the genesis of an American product so \nsuccessful its name became eponymous: Xerox.\n  Battelle, the world's largest nonprofit independent research and \ndevelopment organization, began its operations in 1929 at the behest \nand funding of founder Gordon Battelle's will. Within a few years, it \nwould make history with the same vision, risk taking, and wisdom its \nemployees display to this very day.\n  Even in today's increasingly paperless era, it is easy to see that a \nsimple, rapid, and inexpensive copying process was one of the 20th \ncentury's most important innovations. With the advent of the Xerox \nmachine, the world could make copies at the push of a button.\n  Battelle lies at the crossroads of necessity and creativity, an \nintersection we know as innovation. Taking on daunting, real-world \nchallenges with technical prowess and ingenuity is Battelle's hallmark.\n  In 1935, New York patent attorney and amateur physicist Chester \nCarlson began thinking of easier ways to duplicate material. Extra \ncopies of patent specifications and drawings, sometimes dozens or more, \nwere necessary with each new job. The man-hours needed for each project \nwere staggering.\n  So Carlson came up with the unconventional idea of copying by \ncreating a visible image on paper using an electrostatic charge. He \nfiled for a patent in 1937, calling the process electrophotography. He \nmade it work in a real world situation the next year.\n  Though he shopped for financial backing at more than 20 of America's \nlargest corporations, no one saw the value in Carlson's invention. \nThen, in 1944, he found Battelle. Even though America was in the midst \nof World War II, Carlson and Battelle signed a contract to further \ndevelop the electrophotography process. Four years later on September \n28, 1948 the first public demonstration of the new technology--then \nnamed xerography, Greek for dry writing--was performed in Detroit.\n  Partnering in 1959 with a company called Haloid Xerox, Battelle and \nCarlson forged ahead to produce the first fast, low-cost, and \nconvenient office copier--the 914 model. Xerox would go on to become \none of the world's largest corporations.\n  Battelle grew and diversified with earnings from xerography's \nsuccess. As a result, Battelle is currently the world's largest \nindependent R organization. It proves that success comes to those who \nare willing to take risks, develop needed technology, and nurture the \nfinal product with long-term commitment.\n  So today, 60 years after the production of the first photocopy, I \nwould like to commend Battelle for its role in the development of the \nXerox copy machine and its continued commitment to technological \nadvancement and investment in our Nation's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9641-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9641-S9642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO THOMAS J.

On September 26, 1939, he enlisted in Company B, 137th \nInfantry, 35th Infantry Division, Kansas Army\n\n[[Page S9642]]\n\nNational Guard at Emporia, KS. He was orded to Active Duty on December \n23, 1940, with the 60th Field Artillery Brigade, 35th Infantry Divsion \nand was commissioned a second lieutenant of the Field Artillery at Fort \nSill, OK, on October 1, 1941. General Kennedy was promoted to captain \nin December 1942 and served in the European Theater of Operations. He \nwas released from Active Duty in January of 1946 and assigned to the \nOfficer's Reserve Corps. In October of 1946, he was promoted to major \nin the Kansas National Guard and rose steadily in rank to brigadier \ngeneral. In May of 1968, General Kennedy retured to Active Duty during \nthe Pueblo Crisis. In 1968, he became the commanding officer of the \n69th Infrantry Brigade, 5th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, CO, until \nhis release from Active Duty on December 12, 1969. During his \ndistinguished military career, General Kennedy received numerous awards \nand honors, including his 1974 induction into the Artillery OCS Hall of \nFame located at Fort Sill. He has remained active in veterans' issues \nand fundraising for veterans memorials.\n  From 1977 to 1984, Kennedy served as the director of Alcoholic \nBeverage Control for the Kansas Department of Revenue. He also served \nas president of the National Conference of State Liquor Administrators. \nHis remarkable military and public service was recognized by the \nWashburn University with its Distinguished Service Award.\n  For more than 30 years, General Kennedy has been an active member in \nTopeka Fellowship and served as the program chair for the Kansas Prayer \nBreakfast. He worked diligently with Dr. Roy Brownng, Vernon Jarboe, \nClayton McMuray, and many volunteers to make this inspirational event, \nwhich promotes prayer for our national, State, and local leaders, \npossible. The dedication and volunteerism demonstrated by BG Tom \nKennedy serves as an example for the generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9642-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRATULATING THE INSTITUTE OF REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

CAESAR ARTHUR WALTER CLARK, SR.\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I honor the life of a highly \nrespected and gifted Baptist pastor, Caesar Arthur Walter Clark, Sr. \nBorn on December 13, 1914, in Shreveport, LA, Reverend Clark spent his \nlife devoted to the teaching of his faith, blessing many around the \nState and Nation by his work. He died Sunday, July 27, 2008, at age 93 \nin Dallas, where he spent more than five decades preaching at Good \nStreet Baptist Church.\n  Reverend Clark showed his passion for preaching throughout his life, \nstarting as a 19-year-old pastor of the Israelite Baptist Church in \nLongstreet, LA, where his fiery sermons earned him the nickname \n``Little Caesar.'' After joining Good Street Baptist Church in 1950, \nReverend Clark helped build the church into a 5,000 member \ncongregation. It was through his work with the local NAACP chapter that \nReverend Clark met Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., and invited him to \ngive a speech hosted by Good Street Baptist.\n  Reverend Clark cared as much about the presentation of his sermons as \nthe presentation of his actions. He sought to live what he preached to \nthe best of his ability, becoming a mentor to many. As a result, \nReverend Clark's sphere of influence extended far beyond the pulpit. \nFor example, he worked to improve the lives of his parishioners and \nmembers of the community by opening daycare centers, a credit union, a \nlegal clinic, and low-income housing. In addition, he served as vice \npresident of the National Baptist Convention and as president of the \nMissionary Baptist Association of Texas. Reverend Clark's service \ntouched many lives; in particular, Reverend R.E. Price, pastor at Mt. \nZion Baptist Church in Dallas. Reverend Price said, ``Dr. Clark was a \nman of great integrity and a speaker for all occasions. It was a \nprivilege to serve with him in various leadership roles as his advice \nwas always sage.

Mr. President, when the Texas A sailboat Cynthia \nWoods capsized off the coast of Texas, Safety Officer Roger Stone was \ntrapped below deck with two other men. It was a frightening event, \nwhich would have put anyone into a panic. But Stone, thinking of his \ncrewmates before himself, pushed Steven Guy and Travis Wright out of \nthe upturned sinking boat's cabin, saving their lives. He did not have \ntime to escape. Roger Stone was a heroic Aggie.\n  The remaining crew was rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard 26 hours \nlater. Only after Steven Guy and Travis Wright retold the story did \nRoger Stone's family find out what happened. While the pain of losing a \nloved one is tremendous, the Stone family should find some comfort in \nRoger's courageous and selfless acts. His brave sacrifice is a lasting \ntestament to his great character and personal strength.\n  Roger was originally from London, England, but came to Texas to work \nat the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. He had been \nsailing his entire life. Roger and his wife Linda were engaged on a \nsailboat and were married in the port--Veracruz--that the Cynthia Woods \nwas bound for. Throughout Roger's career he was always serving others, \nfrom teaching younger sailors to helping competitors. In addition to \nhis wife Linda Stone, Roger was survived by his daughter Elizabeth \nStone, son Eric Stone, mother Doris Stone, and sister Valerie Stone.\n  These heroic actions are something we all can admire. At the age of \n53 Roger gave his life to save the lives of others. This ultimate \nsacrifice is embodied in chapter 15, verse 13 of the Book of John, \n``Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his \nfriends.'' This courageous deed leaves a lasting legacy for his wife \nand his children.\n  While Roger's friends and family will mourn his loss, the people of \nTexas will honor with solemn pride his heroism. I join today in \ncommending his courage, and honoring his sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9642-4", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9642-S9643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ALBURNETT COMMUNITY EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I have the distinct honor of rising \ntoday to commemorate the 100th anniversary of a true Michigan success \nstory, the founding of General Motors Corporation. It was 100 years ago \nthis month that a man named Billy Durant who, after years in the horse-\ndrawn carriage business, founded General Motors in Flint, MI. Durant \nhad taken the helm at a small motor car company called Buick, and, in \nSeptember 1908, incorporated it into General Motors. Under his \nstewardship, Buick became the best-selling brand in the world, \naffording Durant the opportunity to buy a number of other small \ncompanies including Oldsmobile, Cadillac, and the company that would \neventually be known as Pontiac. Later he started Chevrolet and brought \nit into General Motors as well.\n  Over the century that followed its incorporation, GM would become the \nlargest company in the world, driven by the goal articulated by Alfred \nSloan, president of GM in the 1920s and 1930s, to build ``a car for \nevery purse and purpose.'' In that pursuit, the company time and again \noriginated innovations that continue to benefit consumers to this day, \nranging from the closed-body car, 1910, to the electric starter, 1912, \nto mass-produced automatic transmissions, 1940, to pollution controls, \n1963, to airbags, 1973, to the catalytic converter, 1974.\n  But the intertwined nature of the company with this nation's economic \ngrowth extends far beyond innovative technological contributions and \neven beyond balance sheets and metrics for economic growth.\n  You can ask just about anyone, ``What's the heartbeat of America?'' \nAnd years after that slogan last passed across our television screens, \npeople still know the answer is Chevrolet. And of course many Americans \nheeded the good advice to ``See the USA in your Chevrolet.'' Cadillac \nhas become a ubiquitous synonym for quality. The Pontiac GTO defined an \nera of muscle cars. The legendary ``409'' block engine became an \nAmerican icon.\n  During the Second World War, GM provided more than $12 billion of \ngoods to support the Allied effort, more than any other company. The \ncompany also played critical roles in the navigation system that sent \nAmericans to the moon for the first time, and designed and built the \nlunar rover, which was used by astronauts to travel around the Moon in \nsubsequent trips.\n  Today, GM employs more than 250,000 people, and in 2007 sold nearly \n9.37 million cars and trucks. And its next century is filled with \npromise. As the GM marketing team has noted, in 2008 we are in the \nmiddle of an American revolution.\n  The company that helped to make Michigan the arsenal of Democracy is \nworking on fuel cells that can make help break our democracy's \ndependence on foreign oil. The company that invented the electric \nstarter is going to be a leader in bringing a plug-in hybrid, the Volt, \nto consumers. The company that brought consumers the first automatic \ntransmission is striving to bring consumers the first zero-emissions \ncommute.\n  I offer my congratulations to the entire GM family on 100 remarkable \nyears, and wish them all the best in keeping the pedal to the metal for \n100 more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9647-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LIBERTY BAPTIST CHURCH 125TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, it is with great joy that today I \nrecognize the 125th anniversary of Liberty Baptist Church located in \nthe northwest Arkansas town of Dutch Mills in Washington County along \nthe historic Butterfield Stagecoach Route.\n  According to its members, Liberty Baptist was built in 1883 by the \nfounding families--Kimbrough, Bryant, Douthit, Fields, Greer, Grisham, \nHolman, Hodges, McCarty, and Seay--of what was then known as \nHermansburg, AR. In fact, Rufus Seay, the husband of Jennie Kimbrough \nand son-in-law to Thomas Kimbrough, donated the land for the church, \nand the Kimbrough, McCarty, English, Seay, Holland, Patterson, and \nHodges families funded the construction. It was a community effort as \nthe men built the church and the women provided food and encouragement.\n  While much has changed since Liberty Baptist's doors opened in 1883, \nthe community spirit and spiritual nourishment provided by Liberty \nBaptist Church remain a foundation for the citizens of Dutch Mills.\n  Liberty Baptist will commemorate its anniversary the week of November \n2 through 9 with community events and activities. Although I will be \nunable to attend the festivities, I want to take this opportunity to \nextend my congratulations and recognize them on this glorious \noccasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9647-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9647-S9648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF 4-H IN ARKANSAS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

Nearly 1 year \nago, on October 1, 2007, the 4-H Centennial Celebration kicked off in \nSearcy, AR, located in White County, where Arkansas 4-H began.\n  Founded as a boys' corn and cotton club in 1908, Arkansas 4-H soon \nexpanded to include girls' canning clubs and is now one of the largest \nyouth development programs in Arkansas. The mission of 4-H is to \nprovide opportunities for youth to acquire knowledge, develop life \nskills, form attitudes, and practice behavior that will enable them to \nbecome self-directing, productive, and contributing members of society.\n  It is exemplified in the pledge every Arkansas 4-Her recites: I \npledge my Head to clearer thinking; my Heart to greater loyalty; my \nHands to larger service; my Health to better living for my club, my \ncommunity, my country, and my world.\n  Mr. President, what great words to live by.\n  Approximately 133,000 young people, in all 75 Arkansas counties, \nparticipate in Arkansas 4-H clubs. Arkansas 4-H carries out its mission \nacross our diverse State in inner cities, suburbs, and rural \ncommunities. It seeks to break barriers among our youth by focusing on \na philosophy of learning by doing.\n  Associated with the University of Arkansas's Division of Agriculture, \nthrough the Cooperative Extension Service, 4-H members can select \nactivities in 82 project areas from automotive and clothing to space \ncamp and show horse competitions. In addition, Arkansas 4-H youth \nreceive more than $80,000 in college scholarships each year at the \nState level for their 4-H work.\n  So as Arkansas 4-H culminates its year long celebration, I want to \nextend my congratulations on a tremendous 100 years and wish 4-H the \nbest for another 100 years.\n  I would also like to take this time to recognize the over 40 clubs \nstatewide that joined the Centennial Club Circle to help fund \ncentennial activities this year.

JOHNSON\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, yesterday morning I met Doris \nJohnson of West Memphis, AR, who was selected by Experience Works as \nthe recipient of the 2008 Changing Lives Award for Outstanding Senior \nCommunity Service Employment Program, SCSEP, Participant. I want to \ncongratulate Mrs. Johnson on receiving this award and changing her life \nthrough participation in the SCSEP.\n  Prior to her participation in the program, Mrs. Johnson's sole work \nexperience was helping to run her family's sheet metal shop business \nfor nearly 45 years. She managed many of the day-to-day office tasks \nwhich included sending and receiving invoices on behalf of the \nbusiness. Unfortunately, in 1986, her husband's health began to \ndeteriorate, and she suffered a heart attack herself. It was at this \ntime that their son began running the company until it was eventually \nsold, when her husband passed away in 1996.\n  After her heart attack, Mrs. Johnson was not employed for nearly 20 \nyears. In fact, her husband's death was very painful, and she rarely \nvisited friends or ventured out of the house. But at the age of 77, \nrealizing she needed additional income just to make ends meet, she \ncontacted Experience Works.\n  For those who are not aware, Experience Works is the Nation's oldest \nand largest provider of job training and employment opportunities for \nolder Americans. Each year, Experience Works serves over 20,000 older \nworkers and local communities through the SCSEP.\n  Shortly before her 78th birthday, Mrs. Johnson was placed with the \nAmazing Grace Thrift Shop on a training assignment. She quickly learned \nto sort and fold clothes, as well as price and sell items. In a short \ntime, she and another SCSEP participant tripled the sales at the store.\n  She soon was encouraged to take a new job as a receptionist with the \nArkansas Rehabilitation Service, ARS. It was not an easy transition, \nthough. Mrs. Johnson suffered from hearing loss and was concerned about \nher ability to answer the phone. In addition, the phone system was \nrather intimidating, and she was unsure if she could adapt. The staff \nat ARS was impressed with her, though, and they worked to help her \nobtain new hearing aids. She was also a quick study during phone \ntraining. She not only developed the skills to become a good \nreceptionist but also took the initiative to take a phone list home so \nthat she could learn employee names and extensions. Her work ethic, \npeople skills, and ability to learn new task set her apart. In fact, \nher training supervisor has requested that she become the office \nassistant.\n  It has certainly made a difference in Mrs. Johnson's life. She says, \n``Being in the program has made a complete turnaround in my life.'' She \ndisplays a newfound confidence, and with some extra income, has \nreturned to becoming an active senior.\n  Mrs. Johnson, I want you to know that you are an inspiration, not \nonly to me and my colleagues but to the millions of seniors around our \ngreat State and across this country. Thank you for all you do, and good \nluck in your future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9648-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING EDWARD R.

Mr. President, yesterday morning I met Edward \nJohnson of Springdale, AR, who was selected by Experience Works, the \nNation's oldest and largest provider of job training and employment \nopportunities for older Americans, as the 2008 Outstanding Older Worker \nfrom the State of Arkansas. I want to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate Mr. Johnson on receiving this award and thank him for his \nsteadfast service to our country and my home State of Arkansas.\n  More than 60 years ago, as an 18-year-old young man, Mr. Johnson \nenlisted in the U.S. Army. Over the next 30 years, he served our \ncountry in outposts from Japan and Korea to the Panama Canal and \nVietnam. Upon his honorable discharge in 1978, he had earned the rank \nof sergeant major.\n  Without knowing what his next step in life would be, Mr. Johnson went \nto his local employment office to apply for unemployment benefits. Upon \narriving, he found his second calling and began a second 30-year career \nas the local veterans representative in the Fayetteville office for the \nArkansas Department of Workforce Services, DWS. In this capacity, Mr. \nJohnson has assisted countless veterans find employment and helped \ndisabled veterans find uses for their unique talents. He has said that \nthe pleasure of putting veterans to work and their excitement when \nhired is what motivates him.\n  Throughout his service, he has become like a father figure and \ninvaluable member of the DWS staff. It is not uncommon for him to go \nabove and beyond to assist in a variety of capacities around the \noffice. He is known to mentor new employees, especially veterans in the \nwork/study program, and takes it upon himself to recognize colleagues \nwith awards when they provide an outstanding level of service.\n  At the age of 78, Mr. Johnson is showing no signs of slowing down, \neither. He continues to learn how to use the newest technology needed \nto perform his job. He also likes to treat the staff by grilling \nhamburgers and hotdogs in the parking lot or bringing in his wife's \nhomemade soup.\n  Beyond his work, Mr. Johnson is a valuable member of his community. \nHe is a 23-year member of the Noon Lions Club, where he served as \npresident from 1988 to 1989, and in 1999, he served as the Rogers-\nLowell Chamber of Commerce Ambassador of the Year.\n  In closing, I want Mr. Johnson to know that he is an inspiration, not \nonly to me and my colleagues but to the millions of seniors around our \ngreat State and across this country. We are thankful for his many \ncontributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9648-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9648-S9649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BOB FELLER\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I honor and congratulate \nan outstanding community member, distinguished veteran of World War II \nand\n\n[[Page S9649]]\n\nBaseball Hall of Famer who played for my hometown team, the Cleveland \nIndians, on his upcoming 90th birthday on November 3.\n  Bob Feller, also known as ``Rapid Robert,'' was born in 1918, and \ngrew up in humble beginnings during the Great Depression on a farm \noutside Van Meter, IA. There he learned the importance of hard work, \nleadership and civic responsibility from his father Bill, who worked \nthe family farm, and his mother Lena, who was a nurse and a school \nteacher.\n  While doing chores around the farm--including milking the cows and \ntaking the hogs to market--Bob dreamed of becoming a Major League \nBaseball player. With the encouragement of his parents--especially his \nfather, who had been a semi-pro pitcher--Bob honed his skills and \nworked to achieve his dream.\n  Bob and his father spent countless hours playing pitch and catch on \nthe mound and a backstop his father had built between the barn and the \nhouse. When it was too cold to throw outside in the winter, they moved \npractice sessions into the barn.\n  As he grew, Bob's pitching speed increased, and by the time he was in \ngrade school he was regularly beating high schoolers. Word of his \ncurveball and strong arm quickly spread, and sports fans across the \ncountry began to take notice of the kid with the ``Heater from Van \nMeter.'' As interest in Bob's pitching grew, Bob's father expanded the \npitching mound and backstop into a full field with bleachers and a \nconcession stand. A team was formed with Bob as pitcher and his father \nmanaging. Hundreds of people traveled to each game at the farm to pay \n35 cents to watch young Bob dominate batters with his signature high \nwindup kick and blazing fastball.\n  Bob began the first of his 18 seasons with the Cleveland Indians \nafter his junior year of high school when he signed with the team and \njumped straight to the big leagues. In his first Major League start, he \nbacked up the hype and added to his legend by striking out 15 in a \nfour-to-one win over the St. Louis Browns. At age 17, the win made him \nthe youngest Major League pitcher to win a game--a record that still \nstands today.\n  After his rookie season, Bob returned to Iowa for his senior year of \nhigh school, and the eyes of the Nation followed him there. In fact, \nNBC covered his graduation live on national radio.\n  Back in Cleveland after graduation, Bob went on to establish himself \nas the premier pitcher in Major League Baseball, as he led the league \nin strikeouts in 1938, won 24 games in 1939 and, in 1940, threw the \nonly Opening Day no-hitter in major league history. That year he also \nwon a league best 27 games with an ERA of 2.61 and 261 strikeouts to \nwin the pitcher's Triple Crown.\n  Despite being at the height of his career, Bob traded his cleats and \nbaseball cap for a Navy uniform without a second thought after the \nJapanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941. Putting his country first, he \nsigned up just 2 days after the attack, making him the first major \nleaguer to enlist in the military to fight in World War II.\n  In the Navy, Bob was assigned to the battleship U.S.S. Alabama, where \nhe led an anti-aircraft gun crew and attained the rank of Chief Petty \nOfficer. During missions in the Atlantic and the Pacific, he fought \nadmirably along with his fellow shipmates in notable battles in the \nwaters off New Guinea, Guam and the Philippines. Though Bob earned 5 \ncampaign ribbons and 8 battle stars, he'll quickly tell you that he is \nmost proud that the Alabama never lost a man to the enemy in battle.\n  While on the Alabama, Bob stayed in shape by leading exercise classes \ntwice a day, and playing on the ship's baseball team; but his \ndedication to his mission and his shipmates was unquestioned. In fact, \nBob declined an invitation by Admiral Nimitz to leave the war zone and \nfly to Honolulu to pitch in the Army-Navy World Series game, telling \nthe admiral that he had more important things to do.\n  Bob missed all of the next 3 seasons--and nearly all of the 1945 \nseason--but he never had any regrets. His wife Anne says, ``For all \nthat Bob accomplished in baseball, and all that baseball means to him, \nI still think Bob's more proud about his service in the Navy.''\n  When the war was won, Bob returned to baseball. For many athletes, 3 \nyears off would be a difficult challenge to overcome, but not for Bob. \nHe returned to the Indians for the 1946 season and had arguably the \nbest season of his career, as he won 26 games, pitched a no-hitter, \ntwo-one hitters and struck out 348.\n  After the 1946 season, Bob played a major role in the desegregation \nof baseball. In a series of exhibitions played across the country \norganized by Bob and his good friend Satchel Paige, the Bob Feller All-\nStars matched up against the Satchel Paige All-Stars from the Negro \nLeagues. These games offered a great amount of national exposure, \nsmoothing the path for Jackie Robinson and other African Americans who \nwould later enter Major League Baseball.\n  Bob retired after the 1956 season as one of Cleveland's all-time \ngreat players. Throughout his career he won 20 or more games in a \nseason 6 times, pitched 3 no-hitters, was an integral part of the 1948 \nIndians team that won the World Series and played in the All Star Game \neight times. He still stands as Cleveland's all-time leader in \nshutouts, innings pitched, wins and strikeouts.\n  In 1962, Bob's achievements were recognized when he was elected to \nthe Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, becoming the first \npitcher to enter the Hall in his first year of eligibility since \ncharter member Walter Johnson.\n  More important than all of the records Bob holds are the lives he has \ntouched and the people he has inspired with his amazing gift. Like so \nmany other boys growing up in the 1940s and 1950s, Bob Feller was one \nof my heroes. Getting to know Bob and observe his down-home humility, \nenthusiasm for life and baseball and, more importantly, his commitment \nto his country, has been a great joy for me during my time as mayor of \nCleveland, Governor and now Senator for Ohio. I will never forget being \non the mound with Bob and President Clinton on opening day of the \ninaugural season for Jacobs Field in 1994, and I still treasure the \nbaseball he signed for me that day.\n  Since retiring from baseball, Bob has continued to touch countless \nlives, as he has devoted himself to serving the community with the same \npassion and work ethic that made him one of the best pitchers in \nbaseball history. He is well known for always taking time to sign \nautographs and visit with fans and has dedicated countless hours to a \nnumber of causes. Today he proudly lists the Salvation Army, the \nCleveland Indians Charities, the Little League of Gates Mills and the \nU.S.S. Alabama Foundation among his favorite charities. Bob also \nremains very active in the Major League Baseball Players Alumni \nAssociation and the Bob Feller Museum in Van Meter, IA.\n  Cleveland will be forever indebted to Bob for his contributions and I \nam proud he still fondly calls the area home. In fact, he currently \nlives with his beautiful wife Anne in nearby Gates Mills, where he \nremains in close touch with his three sons and grandson.\n  Despite all that he has accomplished, Bob remains the hard-working, \ndown-to-earth, patriotic and compassionate farm boy from Van Meter. \nWhen asked once if he could relive any one of the many great moments of \nhis life, Bob answered without hesitation, ``Playing catch with my dad \nbetween the red barn and the house.''\n  On behalf of a grateful Nation, I would like to congratulate Bob \nFeller on his upcoming 90th birthday, and thank him for his service to \nhis country, his dedication to the community and for sharing his love \nof baseball and the Cleveland Indians with so many. He is truly a role \nmodel that all of us should strive to emulate. I wish him continued \nhealth and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9649-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9649-S9650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO NANCY NEIGHBOR RUSSELL\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a great \nOregonian, Nancy Neighbor Russell. Not long ago, Nancy woke up and \ndemanded that her family take her to see the Columbia River Gorge. It \nwas not an unusual request because Nancy has been a tireless and \nfearless defender of the gorge for more than a quarter century. The \nscenic beauty of the gorge was her passion and protecting it was her \ncrusade.\n  What made this trip different was that Nancy suffered from \namyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, often referred to\n\n[[Page S9650]]\n\nas ``Lou Gehrig's disease.'' Taking her to visit the place she loved \nmost would not be easy. Her family hired an ambulance, placed Nancy in \nthe back, and drove east from her home in Portland. Once there, Nancy \nsaw her beloved gorge for the last time. On September 19, 2008, Nancy \nNeighbor Russell passed away.\n  While she is gone, her legacy is not. No individual has had the \nlasting and profound impact on a Pacific Northwest's landscape as Nancy \nRussell has had on the Columbia River Gorge. In my hometown newspaper, \nThe Oregonian reporter Katy Muldoon described her this way: ``a lion in \nconservation circles, a fearless but graceful negotiator, a dogged \nfundraiser, a mentor to young leaders and an inspiration to anyone who \nhad the pleasure of hiking or hunting wildflowers with her on the \ngrassy slopes above the Columbia River.''\n  Anyone who has seen the Columbia River Gorge know that its steep \ncliffs, dramatic rock formations, and graceful waterfalls makes it one \nof the most beautiful places on Earth. It is the crown jewel of a \nPacific Northwest landscape filled with a treasure trove of natural \nbeauty. But it took someone like Nancy Russell to recognize that the \ngorge's beauty, drama, and gracefulness needed to be protected. She \nwould devote the rest of her life to making sure it was.\n  In the early 1980s, she founded the Friends of the Columbia Gorge and \nbegan an unprecedented effort that in 1986 resulted in passage of the \nColumbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act. As Congressman of the \nThird Congressional District at the time, I was proud to stand with \nfriends and allies to vote for this historic legislation. That act \npreserved the gorge while protecting the valuable orchards and \nagriculture lands and acting as a catalyst to the tourism and \nrecreational values so important to the communities along the Columbia.\n  But Nancy didn't stop there. She continued to push the Federal \nGovernment to purchase important pieces of property from willing \nsellers so that stunning views of the gorge would remain open to the \npublic. She personally purchased more than 30 properties and donated \nthem to the public so hikers could enjoy them for generations to come.\n  Today, the Columbia Gorge faces issues that Nancy would have never \ncontemplated three decades ago. Fortunately, Nancy Russell leaves \nbehind what may be her greatest accomplishment--an organization with \nmembers who are inspired by her vision and determined to follow in her \nfootsteps. The gorge may have lost an ardent supporter, but it has not \nlost support. I am confident that Nancy's children and grandchildren, \nher countless friends, and Oregon's and Washington's leaders on both \nsides of the aisle will honor her by continuing to protect this great \nlegacy.\n  On those times when I return to Oregon and my flight takes me over \nthe Columbia River Gorge, I will think of Nancy Russell and her last \nvisit there. Knowing what I do about Nancy and all that she did for \nthat beautiful area, it will be hard to think of anything else. I pay \ntribute to her life well-lived today and thank her and her family for \nall of her many, lasting accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9650-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9650-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting nominations \nwhich were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9650-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9650-S9651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:00 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1014.

A bill to extend the special immigrant nonminister religious \nworker program and for other purposes, considered and passed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Special \nImmigrant Non-Minister Religious Worker Program Act, S. 3606, which \nwould extend the Special Immigrant Non-Minister Religious Worker Visa \nProgram until March 6, 2009.\n  The program provides for up to 5,000 special Immigrant visas per year \nwhich religious denominations or organizations in the United States can \nuse to sponsor foreign nationals to perform religious service in our \ncountry. Since its initial enactment in 1990, the Special Immigrant \nNon-Minister Religious Worker Visa Program has been extended four \ntimes. Yet some seem quick to discount the importance of the program. I \npoint out that the continuing resolution passed by the House of \nRepresentatives did not include language to extend the Special \nImmigrant Non-Minister Religious Worker Visa Program.\n  Among the important tasks nonminister religious workers perform are: \nproviding human services to the most needy, including shelter and \nnutrition; caring for and ministering to the sick, aged, and dying; \nworking with adolescents and young adults; assisting religious leaders \nas they lead their congregations and communities in worship; counseling \nthose who have suffered severe trauma and/or hardship; supporting \nfamilies, particularly when they are in crisis; offering religious \ninstruction, especially to new members of the religious denomination; \nand, helping refugees and immigrants in the United States adjust to a \nnew way of life.\n  To ensure that this program is not abused by fraud or other measures, \nthe proposed legislation requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nissue final regulations to eliminate or reduce fraud in the program \nbefore it goes into\n\n[[Page S9669]]\n\neffect. Additionally, the legislation requires the inspector general of \nthe Department of Homeland Security to submit to Congress a report on \nthe effectiveness of the aforementioned regulations.\n  I note that there are several religious organizations that support \npassage of my legislation, including The Church of Jesus Christ of \nLatter-day Saints, the American Jewish Committee, the Agudath Israel of \nAmerica, the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc., the Church \nCommunities International, the Conference of Major Superiors of Men, \nthe Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee \nService, the Mennonite Central Committee, the United States National \nAssociation of Evangelicals, the National Spiritual Assembly of the \nBahai of the United States, The Church of Scientology International, \nThe First Church of Christ, Scientist, Boston, MA, the United Methodist \nChurch, the General Board of Church and Society, the World Relief, and \nthe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n  There is no doubt that our country's religious organizations face \nsometimes insurmountable obstacles in using traditional employment \nimmigration categories to fit their unique situations. Fortunately, the \nNon-Minister Religious Worker Visa Program allows our country's \nreligious denominations to continue uninterrupted in their call to \nserve and provide support to those who are in the greatest need. I \ncommend their service and hope they know how much I respect their work.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Wyden, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 3608. A bill to establish a Salmon Stronghold Partnership program \nto protect wild Pacific salmon and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pacific \nSalmon Stronghold Conservation Act of 2008, together with my colleague \nfrom Alaska, Senator Murkowski. I am grateful for all the input and \ncollaboration from key stakeholders in Washington State that I have \nreceived on this legislation. I am especially grateful for the input \nfrom the Quinault Tribe, the Wild Salmon Center, and Bill Ruckelshaus.\n  While current Federal salmon recovery efforts are focused on \nrecovering salmon listed under the Endangered Species Act, ESA, seeking \nto ``restore what we've lost,'' the Salmon Stronghold Act seeks to \n``protect what we have.'' To this end, I have consistently fought for \nincreased funding for the Pacific Coast Salmon Recovery Fund and will \ncontinue to proudly do so. In addition, with this legislation we will \ndirect new Federal resources on protection of healthy salmon \npopulation.\n  Restoring threatened and endangered salmon in the Pacific Northwest \nis an imperative. Wild Pacific salmon are central to the culture, \neconomy, and environment of western North America. The Pacific Coast \nSalmon Recovery Fund, since its inception in 2000, has allowed my home \nState of Washington to focus the efforts of counties and conservation \ndistricts, on average, to remove 300 barriers to fish passage and to \nopen 300 miles of habitat each year. That is 2,400 barriers removed and \n2,400 miles of habitat restored. In 2007, for every Federal dollar \nspent on this program it leveraged about $2 in local and State dollars.\n  I will continue the fight to protect this salmon recovery funding. \nBut more must be done. This legislation will complement ongoing \nrecovery efforts to ensure the future viability of healthy wild Pacific \nsalmon runs by establishing a Federal program supporting voluntary \npublic-private incentive-based efforts to proactively maintain the \nrivers that are home to the thriving populations of Pacific salmon--\nknown as our ``Salmon Strongholds.''\n  This bill does that by establishing a new regional Salmon Stronghold \nPartnership program that provides Federal support and resources to \nprotect a network of the healthiest remaining wild Pacific salmon \necosystems in North America. The bill promotes enhanced coordination \nand cooperation of Federal, tribal, State and local governments, public \nand private land managers, fisheries managers, power authorities, and \nnongovernmental organizations in efforts to protect salmon strongholds.\n  It is time to increase funding to recovery efforts, but also focus on \nprevention. It is time to adopt the kind of comprehensive solution that \ncan solidify wild Pacific salmon's place in American culture for \ngenerations to come.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3608\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect citizens and legal residents of the United \nStates from unreasonable searches and seizures of electronic equipment \nat the border, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Today, I am joined by the junior Senator from \nWashington, Senator Cantwell, in introducing the Travelers' Privacy \nProtection Act of 2008. This bill restores privacy for law-abiding \nAmericans who, under current administration policy, may be required to \ngive customs agents unfettered access to the contents of their laptop \ncomputers and other electronic devices when they return from overseas \ntravel.\n  There is a compelling and immediate need for this legislation. Over \nthe last two years, reports have surfaced that customs agents have been \nrequiring American citizens and others lawfully residing in the U.S. to \nturn over their cell phones or give them the passwords to their \nlaptops. The travelers have been forced to wait for hours while customs \nagents reviewed and sometimes copied the contents of the electronic \ndevices. In some cases, the laptops or cell phones were confiscated, \nand returned weeks or even months later, with no explanation.\n  When the practice was challenged in court, the administration argued \nthat it can search the contents of American travelers' laptops without \nany suspicion of wrongdoing whatsoever, because a laptop is no \ndifferent than any other ``closed container.'' In other words, \naccording to this administration, there is no difference between \nrifling through the contents of your suitcase, and logging on to your \nlaptop, opening your files, and reviewing your photographs, medical \nrecords, financial records, e-mails, letters, journals, work product, \nor an electronic record of all the Web sites you have visited.\n  I am willing to bet that most Americans would disagree. Americans \nunderstand the importance of security at the borders, and the vast \nmajority of them accept that the government is entitled to look through \ntheir suitcases when they are returning from an overseas trip. But I \nsay to my colleagues: try asking your constituents whether the \ngovernment has a right to open their laptops, read their documents and \ne-mails, look at their photographs, and examine the Web sites they have \nvisited--all without any suspicion of wrongdoing--and see what they \nsay. I think you'll hear the same thing that I have heard: ``Not in the \nUnited States of America.''\n\n[[Page S9672]]\n\n  In June of this year, I held a hearing of the Constitution \nSubcommittee of the Judiciary Committee to examine this issue. At this \nhearing, we learned about the effect of suspicionless electronic border \nsearches on American businesses. The Executive Director for the \nAssociation of Corporate Travel Executives testified that, in a survey \nof ACTE members, 7 out of 100 respondents had experienced seizures of \ntheir laptops or other electronic equipment. Many companies are now \ntaking expensive and burdensome measures to protect their electronic \ninformation from forced disclosure at the border. The administration's \nintrusive border practices thus come with a hefty price tag for the \nAmerican business sector, at a time when the economy can ill afford it.\n  We also heard disturbing evidence suggesting that Muslim Americans \nand Americans of Arab or South Asian descent are being targeted for \nthese invasive searches. Many travelers from these backgrounds who have \nbeen subject to electronic searches have also been asked about their \nreligious and political views, including why they chose to convert to \nIslam, what they think about Jews, and their views of the candidates in \nthe upcoming election. This questioning is deeply disturbing in its own \nright. It also strongly suggests that some border searches are being \nbased, at least in part, on impermissible factors.\n  At the same time it was claiming the right to look at all of the \ninformation Americans carry with them across the border, the \nadministration was refusing to provide Americans or Congress with \ninformation about its policies for border searches. Requests by the \npublic and members of Congress were steadfastly ignored. DHS declined \nmy invitation to send a witness to the hearing, claiming that its \npreferred witness was unavailable on that day. But after the hearing \nsparked a flurry of press coverage and major newspapers criticized DHS \nfor its secrecy, the agency made public a written policy for border \nsearches dated July 16, 2008.\n  The DHS policy is truly alarming in the sweeping authority it claims. \nAccording to the policy, customs agents may ``analyze and review'' the \ninformation in Americans' laptops and other electronic devices ``absent \nindividualized suspicion.'' As part of this search authority, customs \nagents may ``detain'' the electronic device for an unspecified period \nof time, take it off-site, make copies of its contents, and send the \nequipment or the copies to other agencies or even private individuals \nin some cases. Although the policy purports to require probable cause \nto ``seize'' a laptop, as opposed to merely searching it, this \nsafeguard is almost meaningless given that DHS's definition of \n``search'' includes the right to ``detain'' the laptop indefinitely. \nMoreover the policy exempts officers' written notes from any \nconstraints, allowing customs agents to transcribe an electronic \ndocument verbatim and keep it forever without any level of suspicion.\n  Defenders of this policy outside the administration are hard to find. \nMajor newspapers across the country, including the New York Times, the \nWashington Post, and a host of other national and local outlets, have \npublished editorials condemning the policy and urging Congress to act. \nAs USA Today put it: ``[T]he notion that the government can arbitrarily \nhave a free crack at your e-mail, Web searches and other personal \nelectronic data is chilling. Given the government's abysmal record of \nsafeguarding private data, it's no wonder that business and civil \nliberties groups are protesting.'' In my home state of Wisconsin, the \nGreen Bay Press-Gazette put it this way: ``[T]he fact that this policy \nexists . . . is an affront to the core values of the United States of \nAmerica.''\n\n  In the fact of this public outcry, DHS has reacted like a traffic \nofficer standing by a 20-car pile-up and telling onlookers ``Nothing to \nsee here--move along.'' The agency claims that its July 16 policy \nspells out the practice followed by customs agents for years and across \nadministration. But that just isn't true. The Customs Directive that \ngoverned border searches of documents through the end of the Clinton \nAdministration stated that Customs agents could glance at documents--\nbut not read them--``to see if they appear to be merchandise.'' At that \npoint, ``reasonable suspicion [was] required for read and continued \ndetention'' of the documents. The reading of personal correspondence \nother than merchandise was expressly prohibited. This administration's \npolicy authorizing ``review and analysis'' of any and all electronic \ndocuments without a shred of suspicion thus represents a 180 degree \nturnaround from previous policy.\n  DHS alternatively defends its policy by arguing that the authority to \nconduct suspicionless searches of Americans' laptops is necessary to \ncapture terrorists and criminals. Yet the few specific examples DHS has \nseen fit to give have all been cases in which the search was anything \nbut suspicionless. For example, in one instance DHS has cited, the \nlaptop search took place after customs agents received a tip that the \ntraveler was a smuggler and discovered $79,000 in unlawful U.S. \ncurrency in his belongings. Despite many opportunities to do so, DHS \nhas yet to identify a single example in which a search that was \nconducted ``absent individualized suspicion'' resulted in the \napprehension of a dangerous criminal or terrorist.\n  This brings me to my next point. Both Secretary Chertoff and the \nDeputy Commissioner for Customs and Border Protection have tried to \ndownplay the extent of privacy violations by pointing out that DHS has \nlimited resources for conducting electronic searches at the border. \nThat may be true, but it hardly justifies suspicionless searches. To \nthe contrary, the limited nature of these resources makes it all the \nmore important to direct them toward people who actually do present \nsome objective basis for suspicion. As the DHS examples confirm, these \nare the cases in which electronic searches are most likely to yield \nresults. Using our limited resources to search the laptops of law-\nabiding Americans who present no basis for suspicion is frankly \nirresponsible.\n  This is not simply a matter of what the Constitution protects or \nallows. In fact, a few lower courts have agreed with the administration \nthat the Fourth Amendment does not protect Americans against \nsuspicionless searches of their laptops at the border. I happen to \nbelieve that these decisions incorrectly applied Supreme Court \nprecedent, but ultimately, that is beside the point. Not everything \nthat comports with the Constitution is sound policy. A government \npractice can satisfy minimum constitutional requirements and still \nviolate Americans' expectations for what they want and deserve from \ntheir government. In those cases, it is up to Congress to act.\n  The bill I am introducing today would require DHS agents to have \nreasonable suspicion before searching the contents of laptops or other \nelectronic equipment carried by U.S. citizens or other lawful residents \nof the U.S. ``Reasonable suspicion'' is a lower standard than \n``probable cause''; it simply requires DHS to have an objective basis \nfor suspecting that a particular person is engaged in illegal behavior. \nNo less should be required when the government seeks to encroach on \nsuch a significant privacy interest.\n  Like the current DHS policy, the bill I am introducing requires \nprobable cause in order for DHS agents to seize electronic equipment \nlent. Unlike the current policy, however, the bill defines ``seize'' in \na manner than is consistent with both legal precedent and common sense. \nIf DHS keeps your laptop or any of its contents for longer than 24 \nhours, there has clearly been a seizure, and the bill recognizes this. \nThe bill also reinforces the probable cause requirement by requiring \nDHS to obtain a warrant, while allowing DHS to hold on to the equipment \npending a ruling on the warrant application.\n  Most of the information DHS will review, even under a reasonable \nsuspicion standard, will prove innocuous. Recognizing this, the bill \ncontains provisions to protect law-abiding Americans' privacy by \nstrictly limiting disclosure of information that DHS acquires through \nelectronic border searches. The only disclosures that are permitted in \nthe absence of warrant or court order are limited disclosures to other \nfederal, state, or local government agencies. Those agencies in turn \nmay apply for a warrant--or, if the laptop appears to contain foreign \nintelligence information, a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nOrder--to seize the equipment.\n  If DHS damages the electronic equipment in the course of a search, \nthe\n\n[[Page S9673]]\n\nagency must compensate the owner for any resulting economic loss. The \nbill requires DHS to establish an administrative claims process to that \nend. Awards will be paid from agency funds, ensuring that the bill is \ndeficit-neutral.\n  The bill prohibits profiling based on race, ethnic, religion, or \nnational origin. Profiling based on these characteristics has no place \nin our society. It is repugnant to our values as a pluralistic nation, \nand it is counterproductive as a matter of law enforcement. At the \nhearing I held on this issue, all of the witnesses, those invited by \nmyself and those invited by Senator Brownback, agreed at that point.\n  Finally, the bill contains provisions to ensure that DHS provides the \ninformation about its policies and practices that Congress needs and \nthat the public is entitled to have. The agency must provide Congress \nand the public with any past, existing, or future policies relating to \nelectronic border searches, as well as information about the \nimplementation of those policies. Our ability to know what DHS claims \nthe right to do at the border should never depend on whether DHS \nchooses to send a witness to a congressional hearing.\n  Taken together, these provisions reverse this administration's \ndeparture from previous policy and, more importantly, bring the \ngovernment's practices at the border back in line with the reasonable \nexpectations of law-abiding Americans. Furthermore, they enhance the \nsecurity of our borders by focusing the government's resources where \nthey can do the most good. And they will enable all of us in this body \nto look our constituents in the eyes and say, ``You're right--that \ndoesn't happen in the United States of America.''\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues give this bill the \nenthusiastic support it deserves. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3612\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Law-abiding citizens and legal residents of the United \n     States, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or \n     national origin, have a reasonable expectation of privacy in \n     the contents of their laptops, cell phones, personal handheld \n     devices, and other electronic equipment.\n       (2) The Department of Homeland Security has taken the \n     position that laptops and other electronic devices should not \n     be treated any differently from suitcases or other ``closed \n     containers'' and may be inspected by customs or immigration \n     agents at the border or in international airports without \n     suspicion of wrongdoing.\n       (3) The Department of Homeland Security published a policy \n     on July 16, 2008, allowing customs and immigration agents at \n     the border and in international airports to ``detain'' \n     electronic equipment and ``review and analyze'' the contents \n     of electronic equipment ``absent individualized suspicion''. \n     The policy applies to any person entering the United States, \n     including citizens and other legal residents of the United \n     States returning from overseas travel.\n       (4) The privacy interest in the contents of a laptop \n     computer differs in kind and in amount from the privacy \n     interest in other ``closed containers'' for many reasons, \n     including the following:\n       (A) Unlike any other ``closed container'' that can be \n     transported across the border, laptops and similar electronic \n     devices can contain the equivalent of a full library of \n     information about a person, including medical records, \n     financial records, e-mails and other personal and business \n     correspondence, journals, and privileged work product.\n       (B) Most people do not know, and cannot control, all of the \n     information contained on their laptops, such as records of \n     websites previously visited and deleted files.\n       (C) Electronic search tools render searches of electronic \n     equipment more invasive than searches of physical locations \n     or objects.\n       (5) Requiring citizens and other legal residents of the \n     United States to submit to a government review and analysis \n     of thousands of pages of their most personal information \n     without any suspicion of wrongdoing is incompatible with the \n     values of liberty and personal freedom on which the United \n     States was founded.\n       (6) Searching the electronic equipment of persons for whom \n     no individualized suspicion exists is an inefficient and \n     ineffective use of limited law enforcement resources.\n       (7) Some citizens and legal residents of the United States \n     who have been subjected to electronic border searches have \n     reported being asked inappropriate questions about their \n     religious practices, political beliefs, or national \n     allegiance, indicating that the search may have been premised \n     in part on perceptions about their race, ethnicity, religion, \n     or national origin.\n       (8) Targeting citizens and legal residents of the United \n     States for electronic border searches based on race, \n     ethnicity, religion, or national origin is wholly ineffective \n     as a matter of law enforcement and repugnant to the values \n     and constitutional principles of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide certain high cost Medicare beneficiaries suffering from \nmultiple chronic conditions with access to Independence at home \nservices in lower cost treatment settings, such as their residences, \nunder a plan of care developed by an Independence at Home physician or \nIndependence at Home nurse practitioner; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, together with colleagues in the Senate and \nthe House, I am introducing the Independence at Home, IAH, Act. This \nlegislation will help Medicare and our Nation improve the efficiency \nand effectiveness of spending on Medicare beneficiaries with multiple \nchronic conditions. It will not only improve care for seniors suffering \nfrom serious illnesses but also save money.\n  Roughly 75 percent of the Nation's health care dollars are spent on \nchronic diseases. Yet spite this enormous investment, today's \nchronically ill only receive just over half, 56 percent, of the \npreventive and maintenance services that they need. Our Nation clearly \nneeds to do better.\n  Recent Medicare demonstrations have shown that a number of key \nimprovements could go a long way to help fix this situation: First, \nprimary care physicians and key health professionals must assume more \nresponsibility for care coordination; second, we need to target efforts \nat beneficiaries with multiple conditions; third, after-hours care \nneeds to be available so people can access medical help when they need \nit and avoid calling 911; and finally, there must be better use of \nhealth information technology to help manage care.\n  The optimal way to address the challenges of caring for persons with \nchronic conditions is to better integrate their care. Medical problems \nare best managed and coordinated by health care professionals who know \ntheir patients, their problems, their medications, and their other \nhealth care providers. Using this approach, the IAH provides a better, \nmore cost-effective way for Medicare patients with chronic conditions \nto get the care they need.\n  We do all these things in the legislation I am introducing along with \ncolleagues in the Senate and House: Our bill would put in place a \ndemonstration that improves at-home care availability for beneficiaries \nwith multiple chronic conditions to help people remain independent in \ntheir homes. Physicians would get paid better for managing care while \nat the same time they would be responsible for demonstrating at least 5 \npercent savings in the cost of their patients' care. The bill also \nincludes minimum performance standards for patient health outcomes, and \nwould measure patient, caregiver and provider satisfaction.\n  The Independence at Home Act establishes a three-year Medicare \ndemonstration project that uses a patient-centered health care delivery \nmodel to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic \nconditions can remain independent for as long as possible in a \ncomfortable environment; advances Medicare reform by creating \nincentives for providers to develop better and lower cost health care \nfor the highest cost beneficiaries; incorporates lessons from past \nMedicare demonstration projects; provides for physician and nurse \npractitioner-directed programs that hold providers accountable for \nquality, patient satisfaction, and mandatory annual minimum savings; \nand generates savings by providing better care to Medicare \nbeneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions and reducing duplicative \nand unnecessary services, hospitalization, and other health care costs.\n  The demonstration program will take place in the thirteen highest-\ncost states plus thirteen additional states. Persons eligible for the \nprogram include Medicare beneficiaries with functional impairments, two \nor more chronic health problems, and recent use of other health \nservices. Each IAH patient will receive a comprehensive assessment at \nleast annually. The assessment will inform a plan for care that is \ndirected by an IAH physician or nurse-practitioner and developed in \ncollaboration with the patient. Each patient will also have an IAH plan \ncoordinator. Electronic medical records and health information \ntechnology will be employed to improve patient care. The IAH \norganization will be required to demonstrate savings of at least 5 \npercent annually compared with the costs of serving non-participating \nMedicare chronically ill beneficiaries. The IAH organization may keep \n80 percent of savings beyond the required 5 percent savings as an \nincentive to maximize the financial benefits of being an IAH member.\n  I would like to thank my cosponsors in the House, Representatives Ed \nMarkey, Chris Smith and Rahm Emanuel for their support, along with my \nfellow Senate cosponsors, Senators Barbara Mikulski, Benjamin Cardin \nand Sheldon Whitehouse. I would also like to thank all our staff who \nworked so hard on this legislation, particularly Gregory Hinrichsen in \nmy office. Finally, we would like to thank the following groups for \nvoicing their support for this legislation: the American Academy of \nHome Care Physicians; the AARP; the American Academy of Nurse \nPractitioners; the National Family Caregivers Association; the Family \nCaregiver Alliance/National Center on Caregiving; the American \nAssociation of Homes and Services for the Aging; the Maryland-National \nCapital Home Care Association; the Visiting Nurse Associations of \nAmerica, and Intel Corp.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation to \nhelp Medicare patients get better care at lower cost.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3613\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Independence at Home Act of \n     2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the November 2007 Congressional Budget \n     Office Long Term Outlook for Health Care Spending, unless \n     changes are made to the way health care is delivered, growing \n     demand for resources caused by rising health care costs and \n     to a lesser extent the nation's expanding elderly population \n     will confront Americans with increasingly difficult choices \n     between health care and other priorities. However, \n     opportunities exist to constrain health care costs without \n     adverse health care consequences.\n       (2) Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions \n     account for a disproportionate share of Medicare spending \n     compared to their representation in the overall Medicare \n     population, and evidence suggests that such patients often \n     receive poorly coordinated care, including conflicting \n     information from health providers and different diagnoses of \n     the same symptoms.\n\n[[Page S9677]]\n\n       (3) People with chronic conditions account for 76 percent \n     of all hospital admissions, 88 percent of all prescriptions \n     filled, and 72 percent of physician visits.\n       (4) More than 60 percent of physicians treating patients \n     with chronic conditions believe that their training did not \n     adequately prepare them to coordinate in-home and community \n     services; educate patients with chronic conditions; manage \n     the psychological and social aspects of chronic care; provide \n     effective nutritional guidance; and manage chronic pain.\n       (5) Recent studies cited by the Congressional Budget Office \n     found substantial differences among regions of the country in \n     the cost to Medicare of treating beneficiaries with multiple \n     chronic conditions with lower cost regions experiencing \n     better outcomes and lower mortality rates. These studies have \n     suggested that Medicare spending could be reduced by 30 \n     percent if more conservative practice styles were adopted, \n     however, the current Medicare fee-for-service program creates \n     incentives to provide fragmented, high cost health care \n     services.\n       (6) Studies show that hospital utilization and emergency \n     room visits for patients with multiple chronic conditions can \n     be reduced and significant savings can be achieved through \n     the use of interdisciplinary teams of health care \n     professionals caring for patients in their places of \n     residence.\n       (7) The Independence at Home program, designed to fund \n     better health care and improved health care technology \n     through savings it achieves, uses a patient-centered health \n     care delivery model to permit the growing number of Medicare \n     beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions to remain as \n     independent as possible for as long as possible and to \n     receive care in a setting that is preferred by the \n     beneficiary involved and the family of such beneficiary.\n       (8) The Independence at Home program begins Medicare reform \n     by creating incentives for practitioners and providers to \n     develop methods and technologies for providing better and \n     lower cost health care to the highest cost Medicare \n     beneficiaries with the greatest incentives provided in the \n     case of highest cost beneficiaries.\n       (9) The Independence at Home program incorporates lessons \n     learned from prior demonstration projects and phase I of the \n     Voluntary Chronic Care Improvement program under section 1807 \n     of the Social Security Act, enacted in sections 721 and 722 \n     of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and \n     Modernization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-173).\n       (10) The Independence at Home Act provides for a chronic \n     care coordination demonstration for the highest cost Medicare \n     beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions that holds \n     providers accountable for quality outcomes, patient \n     satisfaction, and mandatory minimum savings on an annual \n     basis.\n       (11) The Independence at Home Act generates savings by \n     providing better, more coordinated care to the highest cost \n     Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions, \n     reducing duplicative and unnecessary services, and avoiding \n     unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency room visits.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require semiannual indexing of mandatory Federal \nfood assistance programs; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue that, \nin the midst of this devastating economic crisis, continues to plague \nmore and more Americans every day--hunger. Although hunger in this \ncountry may not be as obvious as it is in other nations, it nonetheless \nexists and has devastating consequences for those it affects. It \nweakens the body, making it more susceptible to illness. It impedes \nchild development and reduces a child's ability to learn. It saps \nvaluable energy, resulting in lowered productivity and less earning \npotential. In short, hunger has a devastating effect on those it \ntouches.\n  In 2006 alone, the United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, \nreported that 35.5 million Americans did not have enough money or \nresources to get food for at least some period during the year. This \nfigure was an increase of 400,000 over 2005 and an increase of 2.3 \nmillion since 2000. And, with the fragile state of our economy, we can \nonly assume that when the figures for 2007 and 2008 are released, the \nnumber of Americans living with hunger will be even greater.\n  Unfortunately, for these millions of Americans facing hunger, the \nability to afford the food they so desperately need has not become any \neasier over the past year. According to the Department of Labor, the \ncost of food at home rose 7.1 percent from July 2007 to July 2008. But, \nfor the nearly 28 million Americans receiving food stamps, the effects \nof food price inflation during that time period were even more \ndevastating. From July 2007 to July 2008, the cost of the ``Thrifty \nFood Plan''--the Government's estimate of what constitutes a \nnutritious, minimal cost meal plan--rose by 10 percent. As a result, \nthe benefits currently provided to food stamp participants are not \nenough to even cover the cost of this minimally adequate diet.\n  Each summer, the United States Department of Agriculture sets new \nfood stamp benefit levels based on the average of the previous year's \nfood price inflation. However, these new benefit levels are not \nimplemented until the first day of October each year, by which time \nthey already lag behind current prices. For instance, when updated food \nstamp benefit levels were provided to an average family of four in \nOctober 2007, they were already lagging $12.20 behind the monthly cost \nof the Thrifty Food Plan. By July of this year, that same family of \nfour was receiving $56 per month less than they needed to afford the \ncost of this minimal diet. for such low-income families, already facing \nrising home energy and transportation costs, and having non-negotiable \nexpenditures like rent or mortgage payments and child care expenses \nneeding to be paid, food purchases are often the only area of the \nmonthly budget where cuts can be made.\n  But, food price inflation is not only affecting the price families \nare paying for food at home. It is also affecting the prices schools \nare paying for foods provided through child nutrition programs like \nschool breakfasts, lunches, and after-school snack programs. While the \nFederal Government does reimburse schools for the costs of providing \nthese programs to children from low-income families, with ever rising \nfood prices, these reimbursements are not enough to cover the expenses \nof providing these meals.\n  Like food stamps, school meal reimbursement rates are updated every\n\n[[Page S9681]]\n\nsummer to account for inflation. But, by the time the school year \nbegins, these reimbursements already lag behind the true cost of \nproducing the meal. In fact, a recent survey by the School Nutrition \nAssociation found that 88 percent of responding school districts \nindicated that Federal reimbursement rates were not sufficient to cover \nthe costs of producing a meal during the 2007/08 school year. As a \nresult, 73 percent of these school districts said they plan to increase \nthe price other students pay for food services in this coming school \nyear to make up for the increased costs.\n  Congress can and must do more to ensure that Federal nutrition \nassistance programs can adequately cover the costs of food for those \nmost in need. That's why today I'm pleased to introduce the National \nHunger Relief Act of 2008. This act will make critical changes needed \nto help low-income families and schools cover the costs of purchasing \nhealthy, nutritious foods.\n  Under this act, when setting benefit levels for food stamps, Congress \nwould anticipate the food price inflation that will occur in the coming \nfiscal year, and would act to offset it by setting a higher benefit \nrate for October 1 than is currently provided. Beginning in fiscal year \n2010, recipients would receive 102 percent of the cost of the Thrifty \nFood Plan in the previous June. By fiscal year 2012, this benefit rate \nwould be ramped up to 103 percent of the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan \nin the previous June. This change would be consistent with the way food \nstamp benefits were regularly adjusted for food price inflation for \nmany years prior to 1996. By providing this higher benefit rate, food \nstamp benefits would be adequate to meet rising food prices over the \ncourse of the following year. As a result, low-income families \nparticipating in the food stamp program would have the necessary \nresources to purchase the foods their families need and be able to \nensure that their families do not suffer from the adverse effects of \nhunger.\n  To solve the problem of inadequate reimbursement rates for certain \nchild nutrition programs, this bill would provide for semi-annual \nreimbursement rate adjustments. In addition to the current annual \nupdate in July to reimbursement rates for school meal programs, \nreimbursement rates would also be adjusted for inflation each January. \nAs a result of this change, reimbursement rates for the National School \nLunch and Breakfast Programs, the Special Milk Program, the Child and \nAdult Day Care Program, and the Summer Food Service Program would more \naccurately reflect the costs that schools or service providers incur to \nprovide foods through these programs. This, in turn, would help to keep \nthe prices charged for foods provided to other children at schools more \nin line with the costs of procuring and providing those foods.\n  I am introducing this legislation today because it is critically \nimportant to begin the dialogue on finding ways to ensure that our \nnutrition assistance programs can continue to prevent hunger by \nproviding necessary nourishment to Americans of all ages. However, I \nalso recognize that we have a challenge to ensure that these nutrition \nassistance programs can operate in the most efficient and cost-\neffective manner possible while adequately serving the more than 35.5 \nmillion Americans who continue to be plagued by the threat of hunger. \nOver the coming months, as we continue to work on ways to eradicate \nhunger in this Nation and begin to consider the reauthorization of the \nChild Nutrition Act, I will continue seeking out ways to make reforms \nto this and other nutrition assistance legislation to ensure that--at \nthe end of the day--these programs can continue to effectively reach \nthose most in need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3614\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bi11 to establish a research, development, demonstration, \nand commercial application program to promote research of appropriate \ntechnologies for heavy duty plug-in hybrid vehicles, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Heavy Duty \nHybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act, along with \nmy colleague from California, Senator Feinstein. This bill will \naccelerate research of plug-in hybrid technologies for heavy duty \ntrucks.\n  The Department of Energy, DOE, administers several grants to speed \nproduction of hybrid cars, but DOE does not have a single grant \nspecifically intended for trucks. Truck operators in Maine and around \nthe country are being hit hard by high diesel prices. In 1999, a Maine \ntruck driver could purchase $500 of diesel fuel and drive from Augusta, \nME, all the way to Albuquerque, NM. Today, a driver who purchases $500 \nof diesel and leaves Augusta would not even make it to Altoona, PA, and \nbecause diesel prices may well continue to increase, the problem is \nonly getting worse. Plug-in hybrid trucks would make them less \nsusceptible to dramatic swings in oil prices.\n  Industries turn their trucks over faster than consumers do their cars \nand can therefore adopt new technologies faster. This means reducing \noil consumption by heavy duty trucks could go a long way toward reduce \nour Nation's oil consumption. DOE's National Renewable Energy \nLaboratory estimates that hybrid trucks could reduce fuel use by as \nmuch as 60 percent.\n  Current hybrid technology works well for cars because they can be \nmade with lightweight materials and run shorter distances. Trucks need \nto be able to carry heavy loads and, if they are going to be plug-in \nhybrids, travel long distances in between charges. So, the battery and \nother technologies needed to make plug-in trucks a reality are more \nadvanced than for cars.\n  The Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and \nDemonstration Act would direct DOE to expand its research in advanced \nenergy storage technologies to include heavy hybrid trucks as well as \npassenger vehicles. The focus on plug-ins builds on a proven technology \nfor cars that can drastically reduce our use of foreign oil and enhance \nthe efficiency of the electric grid.\n  Grant recipients will be required to complete two phases. In phase \none, recipients must build one plug-in hybrid truck, collect data and \nmake comparisons to traditional trucks, and report on the fuel savings. \nIn phase two, recipients must produce 50 plug-in hybrid trucks and \nreport on the technological and market obstacles to widespread \nproduction. To help with this second phase, grant applicants can \npartner with other manufacturers. The bill authorizes $16 million for \neach of fiscal years 2009-2011 for the grant program.\n  We need a comprehensive approach to addressing the energy crisis. The \nHeavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act \nis one vital piece of that approach. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 3619. A bill to establish the Susquehana Gateway National Heritage \nArea in the State of Pennsylvania, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould establish the Susquehanna Gateway National Heritage Area in York \nand Lancaster Counties, Pennsylvania. Since 1984, Congressionally-\ndesignated National Heritage Areas have fostered partnerships between \nthe public and private sectors for undertaking preservation, \neducational, and recreational initiatives in diverse regions throughout \nthe country. Through these efforts, National Heritage Areas have helped \nto protect our Nation's natural and cultural resources while promoting \nlocal economic development. Today, I am proud to join my colleague from \nPennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter to propose a bill that would grant \nnational recognition to the Susquehanna Gateway region, an area that \nhas played a key role in the development of our nation's cultural, \npolitical, and economic identity.\n  While the region boasts an impressive catalogue of historic and \nscenic resources, perhaps two examples in particular best underscore \nhow the distinct traditions and natural landscape of the Susquehanna \nGateway offer an insight into the broader American experience. For \ncenturies, the Susquehanna River, which forms a natural border between \nPennsylvania's York and Lancaster Counties and represents the heart of \nthe proposed National Heritage Area, has been at the center of \nagricultural, industrial, and recreational activity in the Mid-Atlantic \nUnited States. The river provided colonial settlers with a trading \nroute to Native American communities. It was an important shipping lane \nfor timber, iron, coal, and agricultural products throughout the \nnineteenth century and into the twentieth century. With the decline of \nindustry and commercial shipping in the region, the river today has \nassumed a new identity as a center of recreation for millions of \nboaters, fishermen, hunters, birders, and others. In tracing these \ndevelopments, we recognize that the story of the Susquehanna River \nValley reflects much of the American story. Passing the Susquehanna \nGateway National Heritage Area Act will allow more Americans to \ndiscover and better appreciate this narrative.\n  No less than in this tremendous natural resource, the Susquehanna \nGateway region's national significance is rooted in its populace. As \nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was founded in the spirit of providing \nrefuge to those suffering religious and cultural persecution, so did \nYork and Lancaster Counties offer a home to German Baptist immigrants \nwho created Amish and Mennonite farming communities. By their example \nof humility, hard work, environmental stewardship, and respect for \nothers, these ``Plain'' people continue to inspire millions of \nAmericans. Designating the Susquehanna Gateway National Heritage Area \nis the proper way to acknowledge their contributions to the story of \nAmerican agriculture and its transformative influence on the natural \nlandscape.\n\n[[Page S9683]]\n\n  Finally, I would like to recognize the leadership of Mark Platts, \nPresident of the Lancaster-York Heritage Region, and his colleague \nJonathan Pinkerton, Deputy Director. Through their tireless efforts, \nthey have developed a feasibility study for the Susquehanna Gateway \nNational Heritage Area that meets the National Parks Service's ten \ninterim criteria for designation of a National Heritage Area. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass the \nSusquehanna Gateway National Heritage Area Act soon so that the region \ncan begin to play a national role in sharing America's story.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3619\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Susquehanna Gateway National \n     Heritage Area Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) numerous sites of significance to the heritage of the \n     United States are located within the boundaries of the \n     proposed Susquehanna Gateway National Heritage Area, which \n     includes the Lower Susquehanna River corridor and all of \n     Lancaster and York Counties in the State of Pennsylvania;\n       (2) included among the more than 200 historically \n     significant sites, structures, districts, and tours in the \n     area are--\n       (A) the home of a former United States President;\n       (B) the community where the Continental Congress adopted \n     the Articles of Confederation;\n       (C) the homes of many prominent figures in the history of \n     the United States;\n       (D) the preserved agricultural landscape of the Plain \n     communities of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania;\n       (E) the exceptional beauty and rich cultural resources of \n     the Susquehanna River Gorge;\n       (F) numerous National Historic Landmarks, National Historic \n     Districts, and Main Street communities; and\n       (G) many thriving examples of the nationally significant \n     industrial and agricultural heritage of the region, which are \n     collectively and individually of significance to the history \n     of the United States;\n       (3) in 1999, a regional, collaborative public-private \n     partnership of organizations and agencies began an initiative \n     to assess historic sites in Lancaster and York Counties, \n     Pennsylvania, for consideration as a Pennsylvania Heritage \n     Area;\n       (4) the initiative--\n       (A) issued a feasibility study of significant stories, \n     sites, and structures associated with Native American, \n     African American, European American, Colonial American, \n     Revolutionary, and Civil War history; and\n       (B) concluded that the sites and area--\n       (i) possess historical, cultural, and architectural values \n     of significance to the United States; and\n       (ii) retain a high degree of historical integrity;\n       (5) in 2001, the feasibility study was followed by \n     development of a management action plan and designation of \n     the area by the State of Pennsylvania as an official \n     Pennsylvania Heritage Area;\n       (6) in 2008, a feasibility study report for the Heritage \n     Area--\n       (A) was prepared and submitted to the National Park \n     Service--\n       (i) to document the significance of the area to the United \n     States; and\n       (ii) to demonstrate compliance with the interim criteria of \n     the National Park Service for National Heritage Area \n     designation; and\n       (B) found that throughout the history of the United States, \n     Lancaster and York Counties and the Susquehanna Gateway \n     region have played a key role in the development of the \n     political, cultural, and economic identity of the United \n     States;\n       (7) the people of the region in which the Heritage Area is \n     located have--\n       (A) advanced the cause of freedom; and\n       (B) shared their agricultural bounty and industrial \n     ingenuity with the world;\n       (8) the town and country landscapes and natural wonders of \n     the area are visited and treasured by people from across the \n     globe;\n       (9) for centuries, the Susquehanna River has been an \n     important corridor of culture and commerce for the United \n     States, playing key roles as a major fishery, transportation \n     artery, power generator, and place for outdoor recreation;\n       (10) the river and the region were a gateway to the early \n     settlement of the ever-moving frontier;\n       (11) the area played a critical role as host to the \n     Colonial government during a turning point in the \n     Revolutionary War;\n       (12) the rural landscape created by the Amish and other \n     Plain people of the region is of a scale and scope that is \n     rare, if not entirely unknown in any other region, in the \n     United States;\n       (13) for many people in the United States, the Plain people \n     of the region personify the virtues of faith, honesty, \n     community, and stewardship at the heart of the identity of \n     the United States;\n       (14) the regional stories of people, land, and waterways in \n     the area are essential parts of the story of the United \n     States and exemplify the qualities inherent in a National \n     Heritage Area;\n       (15) in 2008, the National Park Service found, based on a \n     comprehensive review of the Susquehanna Gateway National \n     Heritage Area Feasibility Study Report, that the area meets \n     the 10 interim criteria of the National Park Service for \n     designation of a National Heritage Area;\n       (16) the preservation and interpretation of the sites \n     within the Heritage Area will make a vital contribution to \n     the understanding of the development and heritage of the \n     United States for the education and benefit of present and \n     future generations;\n       (17) the Secretary of the Interior is responsible for \n     protecting the historic and cultural resources of the United \n     States;\n       (18) there are significant examples of historic and \n     cultural resources within the Heritage Area that merit the \n     involvement of the Federal Government, in cooperation with \n     the management entity and State and local governmental \n     bodies, to develop programs and projects to adequately \n     conserve, support, protect, and interpret the heritage of the \n     area;\n       (19) partnerships between the Federal Government, State and \n     local governments, regional entities, the private sector, and \n     citizens of the area offer the most effective opportunities \n     for the enhancement and management of the historic sites \n     throughout the Heritage Area to promote the cultural and \n     historic attractions of the Heritage Area for visitors and \n     the local economy; and\n       (20) the Lancaster-York Heritage Region, a 501(c)(3) \n     nonprofit corporation and State-designated management entity \n     of the Pennsylvania Heritage Area, would be an appropriate \n     management entity for the Heritage Area.\n\n     SEC. 3.

TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY.\n\n       The authority of the Secretary to provide financial \n     assistance under this Act terminates on the date that is 15 \n     years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to thank my \ncolleague and fellow Senator from Pennsylvania, Bob Casey, for \nintroducing a bill designating the Susquehanna Gateway National \nHeritage Area. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  National heritage areas are designated by Congress and recognized by \nthe National Park Service for their natural, cultural, and historic \nsignificance. The proposed National Heritage Area is currently a State \nheritage area known as the Lancaster-York Heritage Region and meets the \ncriteria for national designation.\n  This region of southern Pennsylvania encompasses Lancaster and York \ncounties and the portion of the Susquehanna River that connects the two \ncounties. This area is home to numerous nature and wildlife preserves, \nState and local parks, trail systems and conservation areas, which \ncelebrate and utilize the natural resources of the Susquehanna River \nand surrounding rural landscape. Both Lancaster and York counties have \ndemonstrated a strong commitment to maintaining the open space and \nagricultural heritage for which this area of Pennsylvania is known \nthroughout the State and country.\n  This region is perhaps most renowned and culturally distinctive for \nthe Amish and Mennonite communities that have made Lancaster County \ntheir home for hundreds of years. Pennsylvania has the largest Amish \npopulation in the world, and Lancaster County has one of the largest \nOld Order Amish communities. The Old Order Amish have retained a \ntraditional way of life and have resisted the incorporation of modern \ntechnology into their society. Visitors to Amish Country have a unique \nopportunity to observe how the world looked and people behaved hundreds \nof years ago.\n  This area is also rich in historical significance. Among the sites \nlocated in Lancaster and York counties that tell the story of our \nNation's history is the home of James Buchanan, the only President from \nPennsylvania, and the location where the Continental Congress adopted \nthe Articles of Confederation. Scattered throughout the two counties \nare centuries-old churches, train stations, homes, and other \nstructures, many of which played important roles in history including \nstops on the Underground Railroad and sites visited by President \nLincoln on his way to Gettysburg to deliver the Gettysburg Address.\n  This region is defined by the natural, cultural, and historical \nqualities that most certainly qualify it for National Heritage Area \ndesignation. I have been contacted by all six county commissioners, \nother local public officials, chambers of commerce, large corporations, \nsmall businesses, historical societies, preservation advocacy groups \nand others, urging congressional designation of the Susquehanna Gateway \nNational Heritage Area. Additionally, I am informed that National Park \nService Northeast Regional Director Dennis Reidenbach has stated that \nthis region meets Park Service standards for recognition as a national \nheritage area. Accordingly, I again thank Senator Casey and urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 3620. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to enable States to \ncarry out quality initiatives, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nBlanche Lincoln to introduce a very important bill for our Nation's \nworking families, the Child Care Investment Act of 2008. Throughout our \nNation, so many families today are struggling to provide for their \nfamilies. One important action we can take to support working parents \nis to help ensure that their children are taken care of in safe and \naffordable childcare, and, most importantly, that this childcare is \navailable to them. Unfortunately, we know that so many families are not \nable to access childcare, much less childcare that is high quality. \nThis leads some to leave their children with unqualified caregivers, \nand, too often, in a dangerous situation.\n  Because families were facing such dire shortages of affordable child \ncare, Congress developed the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act \nof 1990 that founded the CCDBG program. Since that time, this program \nhas benefited low-income families by providing them with the help they \nneed to remain employed, care for their children and have the peace of \nmind that their children are being well cared for. However, much more \ncan be done to support and increase the funding for this important \nprogram. Recently, the National Association of Child Care Resource and \nReferral Agencies, NACCRRA, released a report on the cost of child care \nfor parents in our Nation.Their findings were startling and further \nunderline the call to action that Senator Lincoln and I feel is \nnecessary for working parents. The NACCRRA report says that the cost of \nchild care is rising at nearly twice the rate of inflation in most \nstates. In fact, my home state of Oregon is the ninth least affordable \nstate for infant care in a child care center. They found that in \nOregon, on average, nearly 46 percent of a single parent's salary goes \ntowards child care for an infant. This study also found that in every \nregion of our Nation, child care costs more than food.\n  During difficult economic times, the resources of families in our \nNation become even more stretched. Decisions are often made within \nfamily budgets and sacrifices are made during times of lean. However, \nwe owe it to our Nation's children to ensure that they are safe and \ncared for by responsible care providers while their parents work. Low-\nincome parents should not be placed in a situation when they have to \nchoose between their job and the safety of their children.\n  The bill that Senator Lincoln and I are introducing today will work \nto ensure more quality children care is available as the cost of this \ncare increase and family budgets are squeezed. This bill will increase \nfunding for the CCDBG program from $2.9 billion to $4 billion. It will \nalso incorporate new quality goals for States to ensure quality care is \ngiven to our Nation's children.\n  I thank Senator Lincoln for her continuing commitment to this issue \nand to children in our Nation and ask my colleagues for their support \nof this legislation and quick passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 3622. A bill to establish a grant program to promote the \nconservation of the Great Lakes and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Great Lakes \nConservation Education Act.\n  From orbit in space, the Great Lakes are the most recognizable \nfeature of the North American landscape. And no wonder. The Great Lakes \nare the largest single source of fresh surface water in the world. They \nhold 90 percent of America's fresh surface water. They hold 20 percent \nof the world's fresh surface water.\n  Forty-two million people call the Great Lakes basin home and rely on \nit for clean, safe water.\n  What is not evident from space, though, is the trash and other debris \nthat litter the shorelines of the Great Lakes. Debris, in fact, is one \nof the most pervasive pollution problems affecting America's waterways. \nDebris detracts from the beauty of our Nation's coasts, threatens \nfreshwater life, poses public health and safety concerns, and \ninterferes with commercial and recreational boats and ships.\n  Over the weekend, I participated in the Adopt-a-Beach clean-up on \nLake Michigan. We started at Montrose Beach, stopped at both North Ave. \nand the 12th Street Beaches, and worked our way down to the 57th Street \nBeach. It was heartening to meet so many people who are committed to \ncleaning up the lake.\n  The Adopt-a-Beach program is one volunteer effort to clean up the \nbeaches of the Great Lakes and increase public awareness of the \nseriousness of the litter problem. The program is run by the Alliance \nfor the Great Lakes, a group dedicated to the conservation and \nrestoration of this national treasure.\n\n[[Page S9686]]\n\n  Adopt-a-Beach began in Illinois in 2002 and has quickly spread to \nneighboring states. It is a year-round program, but its chief event is \na beach clean-up day each September, coordinated with the Ocean \nConservancy's annual International Coastal Clean-up.\n  Citizens, organizations, and businesses are working together on \nefforts to restore the Great Lakes shorelines clean. We need to expand \non these efforts and educate people throughout the Great Lakes about \nhow they can help to cleanup and restore the lakes.\n  That is why I am introducing the Great Lakes Conservation Education \nAct. This bill would authorize a new program within the Department of \nCommerce to provide funding for non-governmental organizations, \nmuseums, school, consortiums, and others to support conservation \neducation and outreach programs to restore the Great Lakes.\n  I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to make this \nprogram a reality. We have a long way to go to restore the lakes and \nthis legislation will make it possible for organizations through out \nthe Great Lakes to educate students, teachers, and the general public \nabout the steps they can take to improve the lakes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3622\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to \nauthorize appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for \nfiscal years 2008 and 2009, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nauthorize appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security--the \nfirst comprehensive DHS authorization bill introduced in the Senate in \nthe 5-year history of this agency created in response to the attacks of \n9/11.\n  This bipartisan bill is cosponsored by my friend and colleague, \nranking member Senator Susan Collins, who has long been one of the \nSenate's great leaders in our efforts to make our nation more secure.\n  I understand there is not time in this session for full consideration \nand passage of this legislation but we offer it as a blueprint for the \nnext administration and the 111th Congress outlining key areas of \nimprovement we think can make DHS more efficient and effective in its \nmission to safeguard our homeland.\n  Before I offer more detail on this bill, I would like to briefly \nreview the history of the Department that has brought us to where we \nare today.\n  The attacks of 9/11 made it clear that oceans are no longer a defense \nagainst those who mean to harm our Nation. After a series of hearings, \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee proposed \nlegislation pulling more than 22 different agencies responsible for \ndifferent areas of homeland defense into one Department whose \noverarching mission was the protection of the American people.\n  Success was not guaranteed. The administration and many in Congress \nat first opposed the creation of a Department of Homeland Security. But \nwe persevered in our mission and President Bush signed legislation \ncreating the Department in January 2003.\n  We all knew at the time that creating a new Department with a single \nidentity out of 22 different agencies would be difficult. Each agency \ncame into the Department with its own culture--not to mention its own \nprocurement, personnel and computer systems. In some cases, they came \nafter having been neglected in other Departments where homeland \nsecurity had been an afterthought. There was, and remains, much work to \nbe done.\n  But over the past 5 years, the men and women who work at the \nDepartment, under the leadership first of Secretary Tom Ridge and now \nof Michael Chertoff, have worked hard, often under difficult \ncircumstances, to systematically improve the Nation's security.\n  Our committee has also written and helped pass several pieces of \nimportant legislation to strengthen and guide DHS as it evolved into a \nmore mature agency. I would like to briefly mention some of them \nbecause I am proud of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee's work under former Chairman Susan Collins and during my own \ntenure as chairman, because we truly worked as partners across party \nlines.\n  In the 108th Congress, our committee led the effort to enact the \nrecommendations of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon \nthe United States--otherwise known as the 9/11 Commission--a Commission \nwhich, had been created through the Committee's work in the previous \nCongress. The resulting Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention \nAct of 2004 implemented most of the 41 recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission, including a number directed at the work of the new \nDepartment.\n  In the 109th Congress, in the wake of the catastrophe of Hurricane \nKatrina, our committee conducted a far-reaching investigation into the \nactions at all levels of government that contributed to the disastrous \nresponse to the hurricane.\n  The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held 22 \nhearings, interviewed hundreds of witnesses, reviewed hundreds of \nthousands of pages of documents, and issued a comprehensive, 700-page \nreport on what went wrong.\n  The committee's findings on shortcomings at FEMA and DHS led us to \ndraft the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, which \nstrengthened and elevated FEMA within the Department, brought together\n\n[[Page S9687]]\n\ninto a single agency those charged with preparing for disasters with \nthose responsible for responding to them; required planning for \ncatastrophic events; and helped ensure that the resources of the whole \nDepartment would be available in a catastrophe.\n  The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act was signed into law \nin October 2006, and the results of that Act can be seen in the much \nimproved--though admittedly still imperfect--Federal response to the \nseries of recent tornadoes in the Midwest and devastating hurricanes \nthat have hit the Gulf Coast.\n  In the 109th Congress, our Committee helped draft and pass the SAFE \nPorts Act, to strengthen the Department's port security efforts, and we \npassed legislation to provide DHS authority to better secure dangerous \nchemical facilities.\n  In this Congress, after many hearings and much hard work, legislation \nimplementing the final recommendations of the 9/11 Commission was \nsigned into law. This legislation addressed a diverse array of issues \nat DHS, from homeland security grants to information sharing to \ninteroperable communications to transportation security.\n  So while we offer this authorization bill as DHS readies for its \nsixth year as a department--and its first Presidential transition--this \ncommittee has been working hard all along to give DHS both the support \nit needed and the oversight--sometimes harsh--to steadily improve its \ncapacity to carry out its critical mission.\n  With this authorization act we continue that important work and I \nwould like to touch on key portions of the bill.\n  This bill can be summarized under three major themes: integration, \naccountability, and effectiveness.\n  As I have already noted, we knew when we passed the Homeland Security \nAct that the process of creating a new, unified Department out of many \ndiverse component agencies would be both challenging and time \nconsuming--and the process is not yet complete. Therefore, a number of \nprovisions of this bill would improve the integration of the \nDepartment. These provisions are collectively intended to help the \nDepartment to perform its missions at a level that is greater than the \nsum of its parts.\n  First, the bill would create an Under Secretary for Policy, to ensure \nthat there is policy coordination across the Department.\n  The bill would also require the Secretary to develop and maintain the \ncapability to coordinate operations and strategically plan across all \nof the component organizations of the Department. To this end, it \npermits the establishment of an Office of Operations Coordination and \nPlanning within the Department, making it easier for the staffs of \nagencies such as the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, CBP, \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, and FEMA to work together on \nkey operational activities, such as planning for the upcoming DHS \ntransition.\n  The bill would enhance the statutory authorities of the Chief \nInformation Officer, allowing for greater control over IT investments \nin the Department. It also gives the Assistant Secretary for \nInternational Affairs of DHS new authority to coordinate the \ninternational activities of the Department. The bill would establish \nthe Office of the Chief Learning Officer, who would coordinate training \nand workforce development activities on a Department-wide basis.\n  Finally, the bill would require the establishment of a consolidated \nheadquarters for the Department of Homeland Security, which is long \noverdue. Currently, the Department is spread throughout 70 buildings \nand 40 sites across the National Capital Region making communication, \ncoordination, and cooperation among DHS components a significant \nchallenge. The deplorable condition of the present headquarters complex \nalso makes it harder for DHS to recruit and retain talented \nprofessionals--directly affecting homeland security--and I will \ncontinue to push Congress and the administration to get the funding \nnecessary for the headquarters consolidation to proceed.\n  The second major theme of the bill is accountability. The bill \ncontains a number of provisions intended to enhance oversight and \nensure that the Department is held accountable for the decisions that \nit makes.\n  The bill requires that DHS have certified program managers for all \nmajor acquisition programs, and directs the Department to report to \nCongress on its use of various contracting authorities and on task \norders within two of its major acquisition vehicles.\n  The bill creates a statutory requirement for a formal investment \nreview process within the Department, and for investments where there \nare significant technological challenges, requires a formal testing and \nevaluation process prior to investment. These provisions will help to \nensure that the Department does not again move forward with costly \nacquisitions without first proving that the underlying technology will \nwork.\n  The bill also requires reports to Congress on a number of other \nactivities, including the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity \nInitiative and the Department's efforts to improve minority \nrepresentation among its employees.\n  The third major theme of the bill is effectiveness. There are a \nnumber of homeland security mission areas where the Federal government \nneeds new or expanded authorities to effectively address threats that \nface us.\n  For example, the bill addresses growing concerns about the \ncybersecurity threat by establishing a robust National Cyber Security \nCenter with the mission of coordinating and enhancing Federal efforts \nto protect government networks, and by enhancing the statutory \nauthorities of the National Cyber Security Division.\n  The bill would enhance our nation's border security by authorizing an \nincrease in the number of CBP officers and ensuring that they receive \nsufficient and appropriate training. It also recognizes the essential \nwork of the agriculture specialists at the border, who perform plant \ninspections and help protect against both devastating pests and \npotential bioterrorism events, authorizes an increase in the number of \nagriculture specialists and requires measures to improve their \nrecruitment and retention.\n  The bill addresses the threat of improvised explosive devices, IEDs, \nby including provisions that would authorize the DHS Office of Bombing \nPrevention, OBP, as well as authorize an increase in its budget to $25 \nmillion. OBP would lead bombing prevention activities within DHS, and \nwould coordinate with other Federal, State, and local agencies to \nensure that existing gaps in Federal bombing prevention efforts are \nfilled.\n  Building upon changes already being implemented in the Post Katrina \nAct, the bill also seeks to continue improvement in the Nation's \npreparedness. It would require that DHS work with other Federal \nagencies to develop plans for responding to potential catastrophic \nscenarios, and would authorize a pilot program to assign National Guard \nplanners to State emergency planning offices, to foster better State-\nFederal planning coordination. In addition, it would authorize the \nMetropolitan Medical Rescue System to assist States and localities \nprepare for mass casualty events. It would reauthorize the Pre-Disaster \nHazard Mitigation Program, which provides grants to States for \nmitigation measures designed to reduce losses in disasters.\n  Collectively the measures in this bill will improve the ability of \nthe Department to carry out its missions and become a more mature and \neffective entity.\n  I believe that the reforms and enhancements contained in this \nlegislation, along with continued, vigorous oversight, will make DHS a \nstronger agency in the years to come. And reform, not thoughtless \nreorganization, is the course future Ccngresses should follow when it \ncomes to DHS. Five years into its mission, and ignoring some noticeable \nimprovements in its performance, there are still those who believe DHS \nshould be chopped up and its parts shipped off to other agencies.\n  I believe that is exactly the wrong course to take. It makes no sense \nto disrupt the development of the Department, and weaken the hand of \nthe next Secretary, at a time when the challenges she or he must face, \nfrom preventing nuclear terrorism, to securing our borders, to ensuring \nmore effective responses to catastropies of all kinds remain daunting. \nIt took decades for the Department of Defense to become a\n\n[[Page S9688]]\n\ncoherent whole, and its work is still not complete. Just as DHS and its \ncomponent arts are beginning to gel into an effective organization \nready to deal with disasters visited upon our nation by nature or \nterrorists, it makes no sense to plunge responsibility for our homeland \nback into the chaos that existed before 9/11.\n  This is a course I have fought and will fight in the years to come.\n  In their report to the nation, the 9/11 Commissioners wrote: ``The \nmen and women of the World War II generation rose to the challenges of \nthe 1940s and the 1950s. They restructured the government so it could \nprotect the country. That is now the job of the generation that \nexperienced 9/11.''\n  The Department of Homeland Security was part of that response to the \nnew dangers we face and must remain so.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3623\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This bill would make it easier for families to \ndecrease the cost of health insurance and encourage savings for \nretirement health care costs.\n  Briefly stated, this bill would enhance and improve Health Savings \nAccounts by addressing some of the questions and concerns that have \nbeen raised sine HSAs were first enacted in 2003 but were not addressed \nby the Health Opportunity Patient Empowerment Act of 2006.\n  Health Savings Accounts were created as an alternative to traditional \nhealth insurance. HSAs allow participants to pay for current medical \nbills while saving for future health care expenses. One of the most \nattractive features of these accounts is the high degree of control the \nparticipants have over how to spend the money and how to manage \ninvestments within the account.\n  Since their creation, HSAs have become increasingly popular. Part of \nthe reason for this is that Health Savings Accounts offer several \nimportant tax incentives. Earnings accrued on savings in an HSA are not \ntaxed. Funds can also be withdrawn from an HSA 100 percent tax free, so \nlong as the withdrawal is related to medical care. HSAs are very easy \nis set up. Anyone can go to his or her local bank, credit union, \ninsurance company, or sometimes even their employer and request to \ncreate an HSA.\n  Broad agreement now exists that Congress must advance reform that \nwill ``bend the growth curve'' in health care inflation. In recent \nyears American families--often along with the businesses they own or \nwork for--have been addressing this inflation on their own, by turning \ntoward health savings account-eligible health plans.\n  According to one survey, there are now 6.1 million people covered \nunder health plans that are eligible for an HSA, including over 70,000 \nin my home state of Utah. This is a 35 percent increase over the \nprevious year, and it is clear that businesses large and small see \nthese plans as an innovative solution for their employees' health care \nneeds.\n  In addition, because HSAs offer lower premiums, existing businesses \nfind that they are able to maintain coverage, while new businesses are \nable to extend health insurance to their employees. And increasingly, \nthese businesses are funding their employee's HSAs just as they would a \n401(k) plan. At the same time, the financial burden on families \ngenerally decreases under these plans due to lower premiums and a cap \non out-of-pocket expenditures.\n  Given these attractive features, HSA-eligible health plans will only \nexpand over time. In fact, a recent report estimates that the number of \nHealth Savings Accounts will double between January 2008 and January \n2009. It is appropriate, therefore, to continue to make common sense \nreforms to improve these plans for the families and businesses that are \nchoosing them.\n  That is what this bill is all about. Among other things, the bill I \nam introducing would allow a husband and wife to make catch-up \ncontributions to the same HSA; clarify the use of prescription drugs as \npreventive care that will not be subject to the deductible; promote \nwellness by expanding the definition of qualified medical expenses to \nencourage more exercise and better diet; and establish a more equitable \ntax treatment of health insurance by allowing individuals and families \nwithout employer-sponsored insurance the ability to pay for their \nhealth insurance premiums with tax-deductible dollars.\n  This proposal is certainly not a substitute for broader health care \nreform. Instead, it seeks to improve an important and growing \ninnovation that is a partial answer to the health care puzzle.\n  As the Senate prepares for a comprehensive health care debate in the \ncoming months, it is important that we do what we can now to promote \nwellness, decrease costs, and increase coverage. By taking the \nintermediate steps proposed in this bill, we can facilitate broader \nreforms by decreasing costs and assisting businesses and families as \nthey seek to make affordable health care choices.\n  I expect the popularity of HSAs will one day elevate the acronym to \nthe level of IRAs, where no further clarification is required. Today, I \nask my colleagues to join me in a bipartisan effort to accelerate that \nprocess by supporting this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nanalysis be printed in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n          Family and Retirement Health Investment Act of 2008\n\n\n                     Section-by-Section Description\n\n       This bill is designed to make certain enhancements and \n     improvements to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) by addressing \n     some of the questions and concerns that have been raised \n     since HSAs were first enacted in 2003 but were not addressed \n     by the HOPE Act of 2006.\n     Section 1. Short Title.\n     Section 2. Catch-up Contributions by Spouses May Be Made to \n         One Account.\n       Current law allows HSA-eligible individuals age 55 or older \n     to make additional catch-up contributions each year. However, \n     the contributions must be deposited into separate HSA \n     accounts even if both spouses are eligible to make catch-up \n     contributions. Section 2 would allow the spouse who is the \n     HSA account holder to double their catch-up contribution to \n     account for their eligible spouse.\n     Section 3. Provisions Relating to Medicare.\n       a. HSA-eligible seniors enrolled in Medicare Part A only \n     may continue to contribute to their Health Savings Accounts.\n       Current law restricts HSA participation by Medicare \n     beneficiaries, which means that once a person turns 65, they \n     usually may no longer contribute to their HSA (although they \n     may continue to spend money from an existing HSA). For most \n     seniors, enrollment in Medicare Part A is automatic when \n     receiving Social Security and is difficult to delay or \n     decline enrollment. However, the current deductible for \n     hospital coverage under Medicare Part A is very high, over \n     $1,000 per admission, nearly equal to the minimum deductible \n     required for HSA-qualified plans. Section 3(a) allows \n     Medicare beneficiaries enrolled only in Part A to continue to \n     contribute to their HSA accounts after turning 65 if they are \n     otherwise eligible to contribute to an HSA.\n       b. Medicare enrollees may contribute their own money to \n     their Medicare Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs).\n       Current law prohibits Medicare beneficiaries enrolled \n     Medicare Medical Savings Account from contributing their own \n     money to their MSAs. Although created in the 1997 Balanced \n     Budget Act, Medicare MSAs are a relatively new type of plan \n     under the Medicare Advantage program. MSA plans allow\n\n[[Page S9709]]\n\n     seniors to enroll in a high-deductible plan and receive tax-\n     free contributions from the federal government to HSA-like \n     accounts. However, the government contribution is \n     significantly lower than the plan deductible, and the \n     beneficiary may not contribute any of their own money to fill \n     in the gap. Section 3(b) allows Medicare beneficiaries \n     participating in a Medicare MSA plan to contribute their own \n     tax-deductible money to their MSAs to cover the annual \n     shortfall.\n     Section 4. Expanded Opportunities for Veterans\n       Current law prohibits veterans from contributing to the \n     their HSAs if they have utilized VA medical services in the \n     past three months. The bill would remove those restrictions \n     and allow veterans with a service-connected disability to \n     contribute to their HSAs regardless of utilization of VA \n     medical services.\n     Section 5. Expanded Opportunities for Native Americans\n       Current law prohibits Native Americans from contributing to \n     their HSAs if they have utilized medical services of the \n     Indian Health Service (IHS) or a tribal organization. The \n     bill would remove those restriction and allow Native \n     Americans to contribute to their HSAs regardless of \n     utilization of IHS or tribal medical services.\n     Section 6. Improved Opportunities to Roll Over Funds From \n         FSAs and HRAs to Fund HSAs.\n       The HOPE Act of 2006 (H.R. 6111) allowed employer that \n     offered Flexible Spending Arrangements (FSAs) or Health \n     Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs) to roll over unused funds \n     to an HSA as employees transitioned to an HSA for the first \n     time. However, the unused FSA funds may not be rolled over \n     the HSAs unless the employer offers a ``grace period'' that \n     allow medical expenses to be reimbursed from an FSA through \n     March 15 of the following year (instead of the usual ``use or \n     lose'' by December 31). In addition, the amount that may be \n     rolled over to the HSA cannot exceed the amount in such an \n     account as of September 21, 2006. This provision effectively \n     limits most employees from ever being able to use unused \n     funds in an FSA or an HRA to help fund their HSAs. Section 6 \n     clarifies current law to provide employers greater \n     opportunity to roll over funds from employees' FSAs or HRAs \n     to their HSAs in a future year in order to ease the \n     transition from FSAs and HRAs to HSAs.\n     Section 7. Expanded Opportunity to Purchase Health Insurance \n         with HSA Funds.\n       Under current law, people can only use their HSA account to \n     pay for health insurance premiums when they are receiving \n     federal or state unemployment benefits or are covered by a \n     COBRA continuation policy from a former employer. In \n     addition, HSA funds may not be used to pay for a spouse's \n     Medicare premiums unless the HSA account holder is age 65 or \n     older. Section 7 allows HSA account funds to be used to pay \n     premiums for HSA-qualified policies regardless of their \n     circumstances. This section also clarifies that Medicare \n     premiums for a spouse on Medicare are reimbursable from an \n     HSA even though the HSA account holder is not age 65.\n     Section 8. Greater Flexibility Using HSA Account to Pay \n         Expenses.\n       When people enroll in an HSA-qualified plan, some let a few \n     months elapse between the time when their coverage starts \n     (e.g., January) and when the health savings bank account is \n     set up and becomes operational (e.g., March). However, the \n     IRS does not allow for medical expenses incurred in that gap \n     (between January and March) to be reimbursed with HSA funds. \n     Section 8 allows all ``qualified medical expenses'' (as \n     defined under the tax code) incurred after HSA-qualified \n     coverage begins to be reimbursed from an HSA account as long \n     as the account is established by April 15 of the following \n     year.\n     Section 9. Expanded Definition of ``Preventive'' Drugs\n       Current law allows ``preventive care'' services to be paid \n     by HSA-qualified plans without being subject to the policy \n     deductible. Although IRS guidance allows certain types of \n     prescription drugs to be considered ``preventive care,'' the \n     guidance generally does not permit plans to include drugs \n     that prevent complications resulting from chronic conditions. \n     Section 9 expands the definition of ``preventive care'' to \n     include medications that prevent worsening of or \n     complications from chronic conditions. This would provide \n     additional flexibility to health plans that want to provide \n     coverage for these medications and remove a perceived barrier \n     to HSAs for people with chronic conditions.\n     Sections 10-12. Expanded Definition of ``Qualified Medical \n         Expenses.''\n       With the increasing need to encourage Americans to take \n     better care of their health and reduce the prevalence of \n     obesity, Section 10 and 11 modify the definition of \n     ``qualified medical expenses'' in Section 213(d) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code to include the cost of:\n       Exercise and physical fitness programs, up to $1,000 per \n     year (Sec. 10)\n       Nutritional and dietary supplements, including meal \n     replacement products, up 7 to $1,000 per year (Sec. 11)\n       The modification would affect all health care programs \n     using the definition, including HSAs, HRAs, FSAs and the \n     medical expense deduction when taxpayers itemize.\n       Finally, the current definition of ``qualified medical \n     expenses'' generally does not include fees charged by primary \n     care physicians that offer pre-paid medical services on \n     demand because there is no direct billing for individual \n     services provided by the physician and the arrangement is not \n     considered ``insurance.'' Section 12 would allow amounts paid \n     by patients to their primary physician in advance for the \n     right to receive medical services on an as-needed basis to be \n     considered a ``qualified medical expense'' under the tax \n     code. The modification would affect all health care programs \n     using the definition, including HSAs, HRAs, FSAs, and the \n     medical expense deduction when taxpayers itemize.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 3627. A bill to improve the calculation of, the reporting of, and \nthe accountability for, secondary school graduation rates; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this fall our Nation's high school \ngraduation class of 2012 took their first steps into their local high \nschool as freshmen. The best research based on data from all 50 states \ntells us that \\1/3\\ of that class of freshmen will not walk across a \nstage and receive their diploma with their peers in four years.\n  Tragically we face a national high school drop out crisis. Every year \nan estimated 1.23 million students drop out of high school. To put that \nnumber in perspective, it is equivalent to the entire population of the \nninth largest city in the country, Dallas.\n  What are the facts of the Nation's dropout epidemic? We know that if \nyou are Black or Hispanic it's essentially a 50-50 chance that you will \ngraduate in 4 years. This disparity exists even in my home State of \nIowa, one of the best states in the Nation in terms of graduating kids \nin 4 years. According to data from the Editorial Projects in Education \nResearch Center, 58 percent of African-American students in Iowa \ngraduate in 4 years--almost 30 points lower than white students--while \nthe graduation rate for Hispanic students is only 54 percent.\n  Just as the data on racial and ethnic minorities paints a grim \npicture, a look into the Nation's graduation rates for students with \ndisabilities shows many students continue to be failed by the system. \nThe most recent data indicates that slightly more than half of all \nstudents with disabilities graduated from high school with a regular \ndiploma. Those rates go down when examining different categories of \nstudents with disabilities. For instance, only 43 percent of students \nwith emotional disturbances graduate from high school with a regular \ndiploma. Bear in mind that many of these students do not have a \nlearning disability, and with the proper supports and interventions \nthey can achieve at the same levels expected of their non-disabled \npeers.\n  But these statistics may not even tell the full story. Too few States \nuse a ``cohort rate,'' which tracks students from high school entrance \nthrough exit. Because of the flexibility in No Child Left Behind, many \nStates choose to employ a method of calculation that produces inflated \nreports due to undercounting dropouts. In 2005, the Government \nAccountability Office first documented troubling and inconsistent \ntrends in graduation rate reporting. Unfortunately, because we lack of \nuniform measure of graduation rates, hundreds of thousands of children \nare unaccounted for each year.\n  We owe it to these students to do a better job of tracking their \nprogress towards graduation, and ensuring that they receive their high \nschool diploma in 4 years. Census Bureau data shows there is a $9,000 \ndiscrepancy between the average income of a high school graduate and a \nhigh school dropout. In the middle of an economic crisis that is \naffecting American families' savings, an extra $9,000 would go a long \nway.\n  But looking beyond the individual impact, an education system that \nproperly educates its young people and graduates them in 4 years \nprovides economic security for the country. Research by Cecilia Rouse, \nprofessor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, \nshows that each drop out, over his or her lifetime, costs the Nation \napproximately $260,000. If more than 1 million students continue to \ndropout of high school each year, in 10 years that will amount to a \ncost of $3 trillion to our Nation.\n  Clearly, we have our work cut out for us. Today I introduce the Every \nStudent Counts Act, legislation that directly addresses the nation's \ndropout\n\n[[Page S9710]]\n\ncrisis through the creation of one consistent graduation rate across \nall 50 states and by setting meaningful graduation rate goals and \ntargets for schools, districts and States.\n  As we roll up our sleeves and get down to the serious business of \nsolving the dropout crisis, we cannot waste our energy and our time \narguing over whose data is correct. As I noted above, today we have 50 \nStates with 50 different ways of measuring dropouts. In addition, we \nhave many well-meaning education organizations with their own figures \non high school graduation. It should be no surprise that they do not \nmatch up.\n  Take for example the difference in the graduation rates between those \ncompiled by the independent Editorial Projects in Education Research \nCenter, whose data is employed in Education Week's ``Diplomas Count'' \nannual report, and those currently reported by the States. While I \nthink most would expect those rates to be relatively similar, they are \nnot. In some States the difference between the two graduation rates is \nas much as 30 percentage points.\n  That is why the first thing the Every Student Count Act will do is \nmake graduation rate calculations uniform and accurate. The bill \nrequires that all States calculate their graduation rates in the same \nmanner, allowing for more consistency and transparency. This bill will \nbring all 50 States together by requiring each State to report both a \n4-year graduation rate and a cumulative graduation rate. A cumulative \ngraduation rate will give parents a clear picture of how many students \nare graduating, while acknowledging that not all children will graduate \nin 4 years.\n  But agreement on one graduation rate is only half the battle here. \nSchools, school districts and States that are not already graduating a \nhigh number of students must be required to make annual progress to \nhigh graduation rates. The Every Student Counts Act sets a graduation \nrate goal of 90 percent for all students and disadvantaged populations. \nSchools, districts and States with graduation rates below 90 percent, \nin the aggregate or for any subgroup, will be required to increase \ntheir graduation rates an average of 3 percentage points per year in \norder to make adequate yearly progress required under the No Child Left \nBehind Law.\n  Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to thank the growing list \nof organizations representing the interests of children across the \ncountry who have signed on to support the Every Student Counts Act. \nSpecifically, I recognize the Alliance for Excellent Education and \ntheir President, former Governor of West Virginia Bob Wise, who have \nbeen champions in the movement to improve our high schools and turn \nback the dropout crisis.\n  I would also like to recognize the work of my colleague in the House, \nRepresentative Bobby Scott of Virginia, who is the chief sponsor of the \ncompanion to this legislation and has long championed education for \ndisadvantaged young people.\n  We have no more urgent educational challenge than bringing down the \ndropout rate, especially for minorities and children with disabilities. \nFor reasons we all understand--poverty, poor nutrition, broken homes, \ndisadvantaged childhoods--not all of our students come to school every \nday ready to learn. In some cases, it's as though they have been set up \nto fail. They grow frustrated. They drop out. As a result, they face a \nlifetime of fewer opportunities and lower earnings. Economically, our \nNation cannot afford to lose one million students each year. Morally, \nwe cannot allow children to continue to fall through the cracks. I \nbelieve the Every Student Counts Act puts us on the right track towards \nturning back the tide of high school dropouts and I ask my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 26, 2008.\n     Senator Tom Harkin,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin:  We, the undersigned education, civil \n     rights, and advocacy organizations thank you for introducing \n     the Every Student Counts Act to ensure meaningful \n     accountability for the graduation rates of our nation's \n     students. As you know, educators and policymakers at all \n     levels of government agree that change is necessary on this \n     issue.\n       Only 70 percent of our nation's students graduate with a \n     regular diploma. Worse, just over half of black and Hispanic \n     students graduate on time. Special education students also \n     have graduation rates of just over 50 percent. Such poor \n     graduation rates are untenable in a global economy that \n     demands an educated workforce. According to the Department of \n     Labor, 90 percent of the fastest-growing and best-paying jobs \n     in the United States require at least some postsecondary \n     education. It is imperative that the nation's schools prepare \n     their students to succeed in the twenty-first-century \n     workforce.\n       The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) has focused the \n     nation's attention on the unacceptable achievement gap and \n     the need to improve outcomes for all students, particularly \n     those of minority students, English language learners, and \n     students with disabilities. However, NCLB does not place \n     enough importance on graduating the nation's high school \n     students. Furthermore, current federal policy on graduation \n     rates permits the use of inconsistent and misleading \n     graduation rate calculations that overestimate graduation \n     rates, does not require meaningful increases in graduation \n     rates over time, and does not require the graduation rates of \n     student subgroups to increase as part of Adequate Yearly \n     Progress (AYP) determinations.\n       As a response, the Secretary of Education has created \n     proposed regulations to address these concerns. Although the \n     proposed regulations are a laudable step in the right \n     direction, we believe that the Every Student Counts Act is a \n     better approach to ensuring that all students are treated \n     equally in calculating graduation rates and for \n     accountability purposes.\n       The Every Student Counts Act would do the following: \n     require a consistent and accurate calculation of graduation \n     rates across all fifty states to ensure comparability and \n     transparency; require that graduation rate calculations be \n     disaggregated for both accountability and reporting purposes \n     to ensure that school improvement activities focus on all \n     students and close achievement gaps; ensure that graduation \n     rates and test scores are treated equally in AYP \n     determinations; require aggressive, attainable, and uniform \n     annual growth requirements as part of AYP to ensure \n     consistent increases in graduation rates for all students; \n     recognize that some small numbers of students take longer \n     than four years to graduate and give credit to schools, \n     school districts and states for graduating those students \n     while maintaining the primacy of graduating the great \n     preponderance of all students in four years; and provide \n     incentives for schools, districts and states to create \n     programs to serve students who have already dropped out and \n     are over-age and undercredited.\n       Again, we thank you for introducing the Every Student \n     Counts Act and for your leadership on this critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alliance for Excellent Education.\n       American Foundation for the Blind.\n       Association of University Center on Disabilities\n       Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law\n       Big Brothers Big Sisters\n       Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity \n     Disorder (CHADD)\n       Council for Learning Disabilities\n       Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund\n       Easter Seals\n       First Focus\n       GLSEN--the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network\n       Helen Keller National Center\n       Higher Education Consortium for Special Education\n       Learning Disabilities Association of America\n       League of United Latin American Citizens\n       Knowledge Alliance\n       National Association for the Education of Homeless Children \n     and Youth\n       National Center for Learning Disabilities, Inc.\n       National Coalition on Deaf-Blindness\n       National Collaboration for Youth\n       National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform\n       Project GRAD\n       Teacher Education Division of the Council for Exceptional \n     Children\n       Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages, Inc. \n     (TESOL)\n       The Advocacy Institute\n       The Arc of the U.S.\n       United Cerebral Palsy\n       United Way of America\n       YouthBuild USA\n       Joel Klein, Chancellor, New York City Public Schools\n       Joan L.

A bill to amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to \nestablish provisions with respect to religious accommodations in \nemployment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I introduced a piece of legislation \nthat\n\n[[Page S9711]]\n\nworking on for over 10 years, the Workplace Religious Freedom Act.\n  Religious pluralism is a source of strength for this country. It \nalways has been. That is why I support the Workplace Religious Freedom \nAct or WRFA, as I have ever since I first introduced it back in 1996.\n  My personal involvement with this issue goes back to two Catholic \nwomen working at a dog-racing track in Raynham, Massachusetts. They \nwere fired from their jobs because they refused to work on Christmas \nEve. They felt it was against their religion to do business that night. \nWe need to pass WRFA to make it clear that here in America, living out \nyour faith is not a reason to lose your job.\n  The bill is designed to protect people just like those two women: \nworkers suffering from on-the-job discrimination because of their \nreligious beliefs and practices. It requires employers to make a \nreasonable accommodation for an employee's religious practice or \nobservance, such as time off or dress. It protects, within reason, time \noff for religious observances. And it protects Yarmulkes, Hijabs, \nTurbans, Mormon garments--all the distinctive marks of our religious \npractices. All the things that everyone should be proud of and nobody \nshould ever be forced to hide.\n  All of us should have the freedom to abide by and to express our \nreligious beliefs--they are crucial to our individual and communal \nidentities, and collectively, they are a crucial part of our national \nidentity as a diverse and tolerant country.\n  Writing religious freedom into law is by necessity a balancing act \nbetween universal values--such as religious tolerance and equal \ntreatment--with the particulars that each of our faiths demand of us. \nJust as religious scholars wonder whether God can create an \nindestructible rock and then destroy it, scholars of religious \npluralism have to answer a similar riddle: does a pluralism that's \nbased on tolerance, tolerate intolerance?\n  Squaring this circle will always be a balancing act. Religious \nfreedom in America doesn't mean the absolute right to impose your \nreligion on others. With WRFA we have achieved that balance by \nprotecting not only religious practices in the workplace but also by \nprotecting those that don't share the same faith or choose not to \npractice at work.\n  I find that if you look at the vast, vast majority of actual cases, \nprotecting religious freedom turns out to be a matter of common sense.\n  Consider the case of Jack Rosenberg, a 35-year-old Hasidic Jew from \nRockland County, New York. Jack signed up for the Coast Guard and \npassed his training, only to .discover that he wasn't allowed to wear \nhis yarmulke. ``As soon as I got sworn in and got ready to put on the \nuniform,'' Mr. Rosenberg said, ``the commander came to me and said it's \ngoing to be a problem.'' As Mr. Rosenberg said, ``If my religion \nrequires it, ``there's not a choice.'' I agree: No American should \nraise his or religion with an employer and be told: ``it's going to be \na problem.'' I am proud to say that the Coast Guard changed their \nregulations to allow for religious headgear. We fought for Jack \nRosenberg and we won.\n  Another case involves a server at a Red Robin restaurant who belongs \nto the ancient Egyptian Kemetic religion, which doesn't allow him to \nhide his religious tattoos. Red Robin fired him for a wrist tattoo less \nthan a quarter-inch wide. In the end, he won in court and Red Robin \nagreed to train managers to better understand religious discrimination.\n  This isn't about litigation. It is about protecting the right of free \nexpression and ensuring that religious people feel comfortable in the \nworkplace. We must never leave anyone with the idea that practicing \none's religion and being American are in conflict. That is fundamental \nto how we live as Americans, and I will fight to make sure that our \nlaws governing religious freedom are worthy of our values.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 3629. A bill to create a new Consumer Credit Safety Commission, to \nprovide individual consumers of credit with better information and \nstronger protections, and to provide sellers of consumer credit with \nmore regulatory certainty; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are in difficult times. The \nadministration has informed us that the financial markets stand on the \nbrink of collapse and that Congress must act quickly to allow the \nTreasury to intervene in the markets. We must not simply bail out the \ncompanies whose subprime mortgage practices put us in this situation in \nthe first place. Many of us are working to include help for homeowners \nin any stabilization we consider.\n  But we must also look beyond the immediate crisis and take steps to \nprevent similar abuses and errors in the future. This crisis started \nwhen lenders sold too many faulty mortgages to families who had too \nlittle protection against such practices. Once this immediate crisis \npasses, Congress must act to ensure that this never happens again.\n  Our financial system requires a fundamental overhaul, so that the \nneeds of American families stand above the interests of Wall Street.\n  To start that discussion, today I am introducing the Consumer Credit \nSafety Commission Act. This bill would put a single government agency \nin charge of ensuring that the offering of financial products to \nconsumers is responsible, accountable, and transparent.\n  This new agency would look out for consumers first, so that the Fed, \nthe FDIC, and the rest of the alphabet soup of financial regulators can \nfocus more effectively on the safety and soundness of our financial \nsystem while not letting consumer protection fall by the wayside.\n  This agency would be able to move quickly to protect consumers from \nnew predatory practices, much faster than Congress ever could. It would \nprovide continuous oversight of the financial services market, and hold \ncompanies accountable when they abuse, deceive, or take advantage of \nthe consumers they claim to be helping.\n  Let me put it this way, as Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren has \ndone: why is it that 1 in 10 toasters do not catch fire in our homes, \nbut 1 in 10 home mortgages are failing? The answer is that toasters are \nproperly regulated and financial products are not.\n  I do not believe that the Government should regulate the freedom out \nof our markets, and I do not believe that we should eliminate prudent \nrisk taking.\n  On the contrary: moderate, sensible, and targeted regulation creates \nan environment in which the entrepreneurial spirit of America can \nthrive, but without the unnecessary booms and busts of the Wild West.\n  The Consumer Credit Safety Commission will add consumer protection to \nthe factors lenders must consider in creating and offering financial \nproducts. It will identify the practices that undermine sound markets \nand put a stop to them before they bring the entire financial market to \nits knees.\n  Starting early next year, Congress will try to establish the \noversight and accountability mechanisms that will foster a dynamic and \nmore responsible environment for financial products. This bill provides \nus with a good place to start. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsponsoring this legislation and working to create an agency that truly \nputs consumers first.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3629\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n\n[[Page S9712]]\n\n       (1) the Nation's multi-agency financial services regulatory \n     structure has created a dispersion of regulatory \n     responsibility, which in turn has led to an inadequate focus \n     on protecting consumers from inappropriate consumer credit \n     practices;\n       (2) the absence of appropriate oversight has allowed \n     excessively costly or predatory consumer credit products to \n     flourish; and\n       (3) the creation of a regulator whose sole focus is the \n     safety of consumer credit products would help address this \n     lack of consumer protection.\n\n     SEC. 3.

PROCEDURES AND RULEMAKING.\n\n       (a) Commencement of Proceeding; Publication of Prescribed \n     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking; Transmittal of Notice.--A \n     proceeding for the development of a consumer credit safety \n     rule shall be commenced by the publication in the Federal \n     Register of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking which \n     shall--\n       (1) identify the objective or objectives specified in \n     section 6(a) for the consumer credit safety rule;\n       (2) include a summary of each of the regulatory \n     alternatives under consideration by the Commission;\n       (3) include information with respect to any existing \n     voluntary standard known to the Commission which may be \n     relevant to the proceedings, together with a summary of the \n     reasons why the Commission believes preliminarily that such \n     standard does not achieve an objective identified in \n     paragraph (1);\n       (4) invite interested persons to submit to the Commission, \n     within such period as the Commission shall specify in the \n     notice (which period shall not be shorter than 30 days or \n     longer than 60 days after the date of publication of the \n     notice), comments with respect to the proposed rulemaking, \n     the regulatory alternatives being considered, and other \n     possible alternatives for achieving the objective or \n     objectives identified in paragraph (1); and\n       (5) invite any person (other than the Commission) to submit \n     to the Commission, within such period as the Commission shall \n     specify in the notice (which period shall not be less than 30 \n     days after the date of publication of the notice), an \n     existing voluntary standard or a portion of such a standard \n     as a proposed consumer credit safety rule.\n       (b) Transmittal to Congress.--The Commission shall transmit \n     such notice within 10 calendar days to the relevant \n     congressional committees.\n       (c) Voluntary Standard; Publication as Proposed Rule; \n     Notice of Reliance of Commission on Standard.--If the \n     Commission determines that any standard submitted to it in \n     response to an invitation in a notice published under \n     subsection (a)(5) if promulgated (in whole, in part, or in \n     combination with any other standard submitted to the \n     Commission or any part of such a standard) as a consumer \n     credit safety rule, would achieve the objective or objectives \n     identified in paragraph (1), the Commission may publish such \n     standard, in whole, in part, or in such combination and with \n     nonmaterial modifications, as a proposed consumer credit \n     safety rule.\n       (d) Publication of Proposed Rule; Preliminary Regulatory \n     Analysis; Contents.--No consumer credit safety rule may be \n     proposed by the Commission unless, not later than 60 days \n     after the date of publication of the notice required in \n     subsection (a), the Commission publishes in the Federal \n     Register the text of the proposed rule, including any \n     alternatives, which the Commission proposes to promulgate, \n     together with a preliminary regulatory analysis containing--\n       (1) a preliminary description of the potential benefits and \n     potential costs of the proposed rule, including any benefits \n     or costs that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and an \n     identification of those likely to receive the benefits and \n     bear the costs;\n       (2) a discussion of the reasons any standard or portion of \n     a standard submitted to the Commission under subsection \n     (a)(5) was not published by the Commission as the proposed \n     rule or part of the proposed rule; and\n       (3) a description of any reasonable alternatives to the \n     proposed rule, together with a summary description of their \n     potential costs and benefits, and a brief explanation of why \n     such alternatives should not be published as a proposed rule.\n       (e) Transmittal of Notice.--The Commission shall transmit \n     such notice not later than 10 calendar days after the date of \n     publication of the notice to the relevant congressional \n     committees.\n       (f) Final Issuance.--Any proposed consumer credit safety \n     rule shall be issued within 12 months after the date of \n     publication of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under \n     subsection (a) relating to the consumer credit involved, \n     unless the Commission determines that such proposed rule is \n     not a reasonable means of achieving the objective or \n     objectives identified in subsection (a)(1) with respect to \n     such proposed rule or an objective specified in section 6(a), \n     or is not in the public interest. The Commission may extend \n     that 12-month period for good cause. If the Commission \n     extends such period, it shall immediately transmit notice of \n     such extension to the relevant congressional committees. Such \n     notice shall include an explanation of the reasons for such \n     extension, together with an estimate of the date by which the \n     Commission anticipates such rulemaking will be completed. The \n     Commission shall publish a notice of such extension and the \n     information submitted to the Congress in the Federal \n     Register.\n       (g) Promulgation of Rule.--\n       (1) Timing.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     publication under subsection (c) of a proposed consumer \n     credit safety rule, the Commission shall--\n       (A) promulgate a consumer credit safety rule, if it makes \n     the findings required under subsection (h); or\n       (B) withdraw the applicable notice of proposed rulemaking \n     if it determines that such rule is not--\n       (i) a reasonable means of achieving the objective or \n     objectives identified in subsection (a)(1) with respect to \n     such proposed rule or an objective specified in section 6(a); \n     or\n       (ii) in the public interest.\n       (2) Extension.--The Commission may extend such 60-day \n     period in paragraph (1) for good cause shown (if it publishes \n     its reasons therefor in the Federal Register).\n       (3) Title 5.--Consumer credit safety rules shall be \n     promulgated in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United \n     States Code, except that the Commission shall give interested \n     persons an opportunity for the oral presentation of data, \n     views, or arguments, in addition to an opportunity to make \n     written submissions. A transcript shall be kept of any oral \n     presentation.\n       (h) Expression of Objective; Consideration of Available \n     Product Data; Needs of Elderly and Handicapped.--\n       (1) Objectives.--A consumer credit safety rule shall \n     express in the rule itself the objectives identified in \n     subsection (a)(1) with respect to such rule.\n       (2) Considerations.--In promulgating such a rule, the \n     Commission shall--\n       (A) consider relevant available data, including the results \n     of investigation activities conducted generally and pursuant \n     to this Act; and\n       (B) consider and take into account the special needs of \n     elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities to \n     determine the extent to which such persons may be affected by \n     such rule.\n       (i) Findings; Final Regulatory Analysis; Judicial Review of \n     Rule.--\n       (1) Findings.--Prior to promulgating a consumer credit \n     safety rule, the Commission shall consider, and shall make \n     appropriate findings for inclusion in such rule with respect \n     to--\n       (A) the degree and nature of the benefit to consumer \n     protection that the rule is designed to achieve or promote;\n       (B) the approximate number of consumer credit products, or \n     types or classes thereof, subject to such rule;\n       (C) the need of the public for the consumer credit product \n     subject to such rule, and the probable effect of such rule \n     upon the utility, cost, or availability of such services to \n     meet such need; and\n       (D) any means of achieving the objective of the order while \n     minimizing adverse effects on competition or disruption or \n     dislocation of the provision of consumer credit.\n       (2) Regulatory analysis.--The Commission shall not \n     promulgate a consumer credit safety rule, unless it--\n       (A) has prepared, on the basis of the findings of the \n     Commission under paragraph (1) and on other information \n     before the Commission, a final regulatory analysis of the \n     rule containing--\n       (i) a description of the potential benefits and potential \n     costs of the rule, including costs and benefits that cannot \n     be quantified in monetary terms, and the identification of \n     those likely to receive the benefits and bear the costs;\n       (ii) a description of any alternatives to the final rule \n     which were considered by the Commission, together with a \n     brief explanation of the reasons why these alternatives were \n     not chosen; and\n       (iii) a summary of any significant issues raised by the \n     comments submitted during the public comment period in \n     response to the preliminary regulatory analysis, and a \n     summary of the assessment by the Commission of such issues;\n       (B) finds (and includes such finding in the rule)--\n       (i) that the rule (including its effective date) is \n     reasonably appropriate to achieve an objective identified in \n     subsection (a)(1) with respect to such proposed rule or \n     specified in section 6(a);\n       (ii) that the promulgation of the rule is in the public \n     interest; and\n       (iii) that the benefits expected from the rule bear a \n     reasonable relationship to its costs.\n       (3) Publication.--The Commission shall publish its final \n     regulatory analysis with the rule.\n       (4) Limit on judicial review.--Any preliminary or final \n     regulatory analysis prepared under subsection (c) or (i)(2) \n     shall not be subject to independent judicial review, except \n     that when an action for judicial review of a rule is \n     instituted, the contents of any such regulatory analysis \n     shall constitute part of the whole rulemaking record of \n     agency action in connection with such review. The provisions \n     of this paragraph shall not be construed to alter the \n     substantive or procedural standards otherwise applicable to \n     judicial review of any action by the Commission.\n       (j) Effective Date.--Each consumer credit safety rule shall \n     specify the date on which such rule is to take effect, not to \n     exceed 180 days from the date on which it is issued in final \n     form, unless the Commission finds, for good cause shown, that \n     a later effective date is in the public interest and \n     publishes its reasons for such finding. The effective date of \n     a consumer credit safety rule under this Act shall be set at \n     a date that is at least 30 days after the date of issuance in \n     final form, unless the Commission for good cause shown \n     determines that an earlier effective date is in the public \n     interest. In no case may the effective date be set at a date \n     which is earlier than the date of issuance in final form.\n       (k) Amendment or Revocation of Rule.--The Commission may, \n     by rule, amend or revoke any consumer credit safety rule. \n     Such amendment or revocation shall specify the\n\n[[Page S9715]]\n\n     date on which it is to take effect, which shall not exceed \n     180 days from the date on which the amendment or revocation \n     is published, unless the Commission finds for good cause \n     shown that a later effective date is in the public interest \n     and publishes its reasons for such finding. Where an \n     amendment involves a material change in a consumer credit \n     safety rule, subsections (a) through (h) shall apply. In \n     order to revoke a consumer credit safety rule, the Commission \n     shall publish a proposal to revoke such rule in the Federal \n     Register, and allow oral and written presentations in \n     accordance with subsection (d)(2). The Commission may revoke \n     such rule only if it determines that the rule is not a \n     reasonable means of achieving an objective identified in \n     subsection (a)(1) with respect to such proposed rule or an \n     objective specified in subsection 6(a).\n       (l) Petition to Initiate Rulemaking.--The Commission shall \n     grant, in whole or in part, or deny any petition under \n     section 553 (e) of title 5, United States Code, requesting \n     the Commission to initiate a rulemaking, within a reasonable \n     time after the date on which such petition is filed. The \n     Commission shall state the reasons for granting or denying \n     such petition.\n\n     SEC. 11. PROHIBITED ACTS.\n\n       It shall be unlawful for any person--\n       (1) to advertise for or offer for sale any consumer credit \n     which is not in conformity with an applicable consumer credit \n     safety rule under this Act;\n       (2) to advertise for or offer for sale any consumer \n     credit--\n       (A) which has been declared a banned product by a rule \n     under this Act;\n       (B) in a manner that does not comply with any requirements \n     for the provision of any warnings or other information \n     regarding such credit; or\n       (3) to fail or refuse to permit access to or copying of \n     records, or fail or refuse to establish or maintain records, \n     or fail or refuse to make reports or provide information to \n     the Commission as required under this Act or any rule \n     thereunder, other than section 9.\n\n     SEC. 12. PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS.\n\n       (a) Criminal Penalties.--\n       (1) Knowing and willful violations.--Any person who \n     knowingly and willfully violates section 11 after having \n     received notice of noncompliance from the Commission shall be \n     fined not more than $500,000 or be imprisoned not more than \n     one year, or both.\n       (2) Executives and agents.--Any individual director, \n     officer, or agent of a corporation who knowingly and \n     willfully authorizes, orders, or performs any of the acts or \n     practices constituting in whole or in part a violation of \n     section 11, and who has knowledge of notice of noncompliance \n     received by the corporation from the Commission, shall be \n     subject to penalties under this section, without regard to \n     any penalties to which that corporation may be otherwise \n     subject.\n       (b) Civil Penalties.--\n       (1) In general.--Any person who violates section 11 shall \n     be subject to a civil penalty to be established at the \n     discretion of the Commission. A violation of section 11 shall \n     constitute a separate civil offense with respect to each \n     consumer credit transaction involved.\n       (2) Publication of schedule of penalties.--Not later than \n     December 1, 2009, and December 1 of each fifth calendar year \n     thereafter, the Commission shall prescribe and publish in the \n     Federal Register a schedule of maximum authorized penalties \n     that shall apply for violations that occur after January 1 of \n     the year immediately following such publication.\n       (3) Relevant factors in determining amount of penalty.--In \n     determining the amount of any penalty to be sought upon \n     commencing an action seeking to assess a penalty for a \n     violation of section 11, the Commission shall consider the \n     nature of the consumer credit product or service, the \n     severity of the unreasonable risk to the consumer, the number \n     of products or services sold or distributed, and the \n     appropriateness of such penalty in relation to the size of \n     the business of the person charged.\n       (4) Compromise of penalty; deductions from penalty.--Any \n     civil penalty under this section may be compromised by the \n     Commission. In determining the amount of such penalty or \n     whether it should be remitted or mitigated and in what \n     amount, the Commission shall consider the appropriateness of \n     such penalty to the size of the business of the person \n     charged, the nature of the consumer credit, the severity of \n     the unreasonable risk to the consumer, the occurrence or \n     absence of consumer injury, and the number of offending \n     products or services sold. The amount of such penalty when \n     finally determined, or the amount agreed on compromise, may \n     be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to the \n     person charged.\n       (c) Collection and Use of Penalties.--The Commission shall \n     retain ownership over criminal and civil fees collected and \n     shall apply these fees to defray the costs of the \n     Commission's operation or, where appropriate, provide \n     restitution for harmed consumers.\n\n     SEC. 13. REPORTS.\n\n       (a) Reports to the Public.--The Commission shall determine \n     what reports should be produced and distributed to the public \n     on a recurring and ad hoc basis, and shall prepare and \n     publish such reports on a web site that provides free access \n     to the general public.\n       (b) Report to President and Congress.--The Commission shall \n     prepare and submit to the President and the relevant \n     congressional committees at the beginning of each regular \n     session of Congress a comprehensive report on the \n     administration of this Act for the preceding fiscal year. \n     Such report shall include--\n       (1) a thorough appraisal, including statistical analyses, \n     estimates, and long-term projections, of the incidence and \n     effects of practices associated with the provision of \n     consumer credit that are inconsistent with the objectives \n     specified in section 6(a), with a breakdown, insofar as \n     practicable, among the various sources of injury as the \n     Commission finds appropriate;\n       (2) a list of consumer credit safety rules prescribed or in \n     effect during such year;\n       (3) an evaluation of the degree of observance of consumer \n     credit safety rules, including a list of enforcement actions, \n     court decisions, and compromises of civil penalties, by \n     location and company name;\n       (4) a summary of outstanding problems confronting the \n     administration of this Act in order of priority;\n       (5) an analysis and evaluation of public and private \n     consumer credit safety research activities;\n       (6) a list, with a brief statement of the issues, of \n     completed or pending judicial actions under this Act;\n       (7) the extent to which technical information was \n     disseminated to the scientific and consumer credit \n     communities and consumer information was made available to \n     the public;\n       (8) the extent of cooperation between Commission officials \n     and representatives of industry and other interested parties \n     in the implementation of this Act, including a log or summary \n     of meetings held between Commission officials and \n     representatives of industry and other interested parties;\n       (9) an appraisal of significant actions of State and local \n     governments relating to the responsibilities of the \n     Commission;\n       (10) with respect to voluntary consumer credit safety \n     standards promulgated as consumer safety rules under section \n     10(c), a description of--\n       (A) the number of such standards adopted as rules; and\n       (B) the nature and number of the consumer credit products \n     and services which are the subject of such adopted rules and \n     the approximate number of consumers affected;\n       (11) such recommendations for additional legislation as the \n     Commission deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this \n     Act; and\n       (12) the extent of cooperation with and the joint efforts \n     undertaken by the Commission in conjunction with other \n     regulators with whom the Commission shares responsibilities \n     for consumer credit safety.\n\n     SEC. 14. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall be effective 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN:\n  S. 3633. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nrequire country of origin labeling on prescription and over-the-counter \ndrugs; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in the past year, 149 Americans died after \ntaking tainted Heparin, a widely used blood thinner. It was later \nlearned--as reported in the New York Times--that the contaminant \nderived from pig intestines was produced in ``largely unregulated'' \nChinese workshops. Unfortunately, Heparin is not the only drug that \nrelies on this dangerous brand of outsourcing. More and more, drug \ncompanies are taking advantage of cheap labor and weak safety standards \nfound outside of the U.S. to manufacture the pharmaceuticals later used \nin American hospitals and households. According to a Pfizer \nrepresentative who testified before the Senate Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions in April, Pfizer outsources the \nmanufacture of 17 percent of its drug products.\n  Consumers have a right to know where their drugs are produced. That \nis why I am today introducing the Transparency in Drug Labeling Act. \nThis bill would require country-of-origin labeling for both active and \ninactive ingredients on all pharmaceuticals, both prescription and \nover-the-counter. These new drug labels would list all the countries \nthat played a role in the manufacturing of ingredients for the drug. \nThe order of the list would be determined by the percentage of the drug \nproduced in each country, with the largest contributors appearing at \nthe top.\n  This bill would raise consumers' awareness of where their drugs are \nbeing produced. It would also allow companies who produce their drugs \nin the U.S. to advertise that fact. Drug companies that produce their \ndrugs in the U.S. and follow the corresponding safety and regulatory \nstandards should be rewarded with increased consumer confidence in \ntheir products.\n\n[[Page S9716]]\n\n  This bill takes a proactive approach to keeping Americans safe in our \nglobal, interdependent economy. When we import from overseas, we are \nimporting the health, labor and environmental standards of those \ncountries as well. Consumers have a right to know where their \nmedications originate. This bill would satisfy that reasonable demand.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 3634. A bill to reduce gun trafficking by prohibiting bulk \npurchases of handguns; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the End Gun \nTrafficking Act of 2008. I am proud to be joined by my colleague from \nNew Jersey, Senator Menendez, in introducing this bill.\n  Trafficking in illegal guns is a serious problem that fuels crime, \ndrug activity, and gang violence in our communities and on our streets.\n  Under current Federal law, gun purchasers are able to buy--and gun \ndealers are able to sell--unlimited numbers of handguns. All too \nfrequently, these bulk handgun purchasers turn around and sell those \nhandguns on the black market. The guns are sold to criminals and gang \nmembers--people who are barred under Federal law from buying guns \nthemselves.\n  This pipeline of illegal guns threatens States' abilities to protect \ntheir own residents, as guns are often purchased in bulk in States with \nweak gun laws and sold to criminals in States with tougher gun laws.\n  My State of New Jersey has some of the strongest gun violence \nprevention laws in the country, including a ban on assault weapons, \nchild access prevention requirements, and permitting requirements for \ngun ownership. Unfortunately, because of the gun trafficking pipeline, \nillegal weapons make their way onto New Jersey's streets and place all \nNew Jerseyans in danger.\n  In 2007, 72 percent of the guns recovered from New Jersey crime \nscenes that were traced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, \nand Explosives came from out of State. Just six States accounted for \nnearly 50 percent of those traced guns.\n  As these numbers make all too clear, we will only give full effect to \nNew Jersey's and other State's effort protect their residents when we \nshut down the ``iron pipeline'' of gun trafficking. To stop gun \ntrafficking, we must stop the bulk sales of handguns.\n  The legislation that I introduce today would do exactly that. The End \nGun Trafficking Act of 2008 would limit gun buyers to one handgun every \n30 days.\n  This ``one-handgun-a-month'' approach is proven. Today, States--\nVirginia, Maryland, and California--have such laws. Before enacting \nthis law in 1993, Virginia was the supplier of choice for criminals up \nand down the East Coast. A 1995 study showed drastic reductions in the \nflow of Virginia guns to criminals in other States: the percentage of \ncrime guns traced back to Virginia fell by 71 percent in New York and \n72 percent in Massachusetts. Unfortunately, despite these results, \nVirginia significantly weakened its law in 2004.\n  I hope that New Jersey will be the fourth State to limit handgun \npurchases to one a month. In July, the New Jersey Assembly approved a \none-handgun-a-month bill that is awaiting action in the State Senate. I \nstrongly support this legislation, which will help cut down on the \nillegal gun trade within New Jersey.\n  But to really combat interstate gun trafficking, we need a national \nsolution. The End Gun Trafficking Act is an important step in that \ndirection. Specifically, this legislation would prohibit gun dealers \nfrom selling a handgun to an unlicensed person who they know or have \nreason to believe has purchased another handgun within the previous 30 \ndays.\n  It would prohibit unlicensed individuals from purchasing more than \none handgun during a 30-day period.\n  It would make exceptions for exchanges, Government, and law \nenforcement purchases and curios and relics.\n  It would ensure that the background check system checks whether a \nbuyer has purchased a handgun within the last 30 days and block handgun \nsales to such buyers.\n  It would increase the maximum penalty from 1 year to 5 years for gun \ndealers who make false statements in their gun sale records.\n  It would require that background checks be kept for at least 180 days \ninstead of the current 24 hours, to allow dealers to find out whether \nan individual has purchased another handgun within the previous 30 days \nand make unlicensed gun dealers who sell more than one handgun a month \nto an unlicensed individual subject to the same laws as licensed gun \ndealers.\n  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to pass this \nlegislation and reduce gun violence.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3634\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize a loan forgiveness program for students \nof institutions of higher education who volunteer to serve as mentors; \nto the Committee on health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is \nvery near and dear to my heart: the importance of mentoring. A good \nmentor can make all the difference in the world, serving as friend, \nrole-model and advocate for children who need it most. We should be \nrewarding those young people who commit to public service, including \nmentoring at-risk children, and offering incentives to encourage wider \nparticipation.\n  I am proud to introduce the Supporting Mentors, Supporting Our Youth \nAct, which would forgive $10 of student loans for every hour of \nmentoring with a minimum commitment of one year of service. I'm pleased \nthat my friend and colleague, Congressman Jim Crowley, is introducing \nthis legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  I have long been an advocate for mentoring and for supporting \nmentoring programs like the ones you run across the country. Last year, \nI joined my colleague Senator Kerry in introducing the Mentoring \nAmerica's Children Act, which built upon the Mentoring Program in No \nChild Left Behind. This legislation will help reach the 15 million \nyoung adults who could use mentor--esspecially young people in foster \ncare and other young adults who could benefit the most from a role \nmodel, advisor, and advocate. I've long been a champion for mentoring \nand for supporting mentoring programs like the ones you run across the \ncountry.\n  Public service is the lifeblood of our communities and mentoring at-\nrisk children is particularly important. Tomorrow, September 27th, is \nthe National Day of Action and I could not think of a better way of \nsupporting the thousands of communities who will mobilize across the \ncountry then by introducing this legislation to encourage more people \nto serve.\n  Earlier this month, I joined Senators Kennedy and Hatch in \nintroducing the Serve America Act. The legislation would build a new \nservice corps focused on addressing areas of national need such as \neducation, energy and the environment. The bill would increase \nopportunities to participate in service for Americans of all ages by \nencourage students to make service a part of their lives, establishing \ntax incentives for employers who allow employees paid leave for \nservice, and structuring service opportunities for seniors and \nretirees.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the Senate \nand the House to stand up for our most vulnerable children, while \nmaking college more accessible and more affordable.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON, of Florida:\n  S. 3638. A bill to reauthorize the National Windstorm Impact \nReduction Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation on a subject that is never far from the minds of citizens \nin my home State of Florida and others living along our coasts and in \ntornado alley: the threat of windstorms, and the havoc that these \nevents can wreak on our communities.\n  We were all transfixed by the non-stop news coverage as Hurricanes \nGustav and Ike grew into monster storms and crossed the Caribbean and \nGulf of Mexico, leaving a trail of misery in their wake. In Florida \nthis year, these storms, along with Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricane \nHanna, reminded us of our vulnerability in the face of Mother Nature. \nWe are not out of the woods yet. Hurricane season lasts for another two \nmonths, and other severe storms can generate damaging tornadoes at any \ntime of year. In fact, more than 2,000 tornadoes had hit the United \nStates by mid-September, causing more than 120 fatalities and making \n2008 the deadliest year for windstorm-related fatalities in a decade.\n  Although windstorms are a perpetual hazard, particularly in Florida, \nwe have learned a great deal from these events and have taken steps to \nmake our homes, businesses, and infrastructure more resilient. In 1992, \nHurricane Andrew devastated South Florida and revealed a number of \nproblems with how we designed and constructed buildings in areas \nsubject to high winds. The lessons learned from Andrew drove the \nadoption of stronger buiding codes in Miami-Dade and Broward counties \nin 1994, codes that still serve as models for the Nation. In 2001, \nFlorida's State legislature adopted a statewide building code, which \nmade building requirements stronger and more consistent across the \nstate.\n  These actions have already started paying dividends. In 2004, when \nHurricane Charley made landfall near Captiva Island as a Category 4 \nhurricane, communities across Southwest Florida suffered tremendous \ndamage from high winds and floodwaters. In Charlotte County alone, the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, estimated that 80 percent of \nthe buildings were damaged and all mobile homes were destroyed. Across \nthe Florida peninsula, 30 deaths were linked to the storm and property \ndamage was estimated at $14.6 billion. But there was some positive news \nto be found amongst the devastation. Government and private-sector \nexperts who reviewed Charley's damage found that homes designed and \nconstructed with the stronger, post-Andrew building codes performed \nwell, even in Punta Gorda, one of the hardest-hit areas. There can be \nno doubt that many lives were saved and millions in additional damages \nwere avoided as a direct consequence of earlier decisions to build \nstronger and safer.\n  While our experience in Charley shows that we are on the right track \nin antiipating and avoiding windstorm impacts, we cannot rest on our \nlaurels. Millions in Florida and across our Nation live in structures \nbuilt either before there was a building code in effect or before \nimportant wind-resistant materials and practices became required. Much \nwork remains to find feasible and cost-effective ways to retrofit these \nolder structures, and to educate our citizens on the need to take \nactions now to reduce their vulnerability to future windstorms.\n  To help address these outstanding needs, I am introducing the \nNational Windstorm Impact Reduction Reauthorization Act of 2008. This \nlegislation would extend and enhance the National Windstorm Impact \nReduction program, the primary goal of which is to achieve major, \nmeasurable reductions in losses of life and property from windstorms.\n  This is a program that I have a long history of supporting. In July \n2004--just weeks before four hurricanes, Charley, Frances, Ivan, and \nJeanne struck my State--I introduced the National Windstorm Impact \nReduction Act of 2004. This bill sought to focus the Federal efforts to \nidentify wind hazards and assess and mitigate windstorm impacts. In the \nwake of the 2004 hurricanes, Congress saw the need to better coordinate \nand invest in wind-related research and mitigation, and passed separate \nlegislation establishing NWIRP in October of that year. At that time, \nCongress's vision was for NWIRP to improve our understanding of \nwindstorms and then mitigate potential impacts through nationwide data \ncollection and analysis, risk assessment, outreach, technology \ntransfer, and research and development.\n  Since its enactment in 2004, NWIRP has struggled to get off of the \nground. The Bush Administration has not adequately supported the \ndevelopment and implementation of the program, failing to request any \nappropriations for\n\n[[Page S9718]]\n\nNWIRP activities at the primary agencies: the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, the National Science Foundation, the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration and FEMA. Despite explicit \nlanguage from Congress in its report accompanying the fiscal year 2008 \nomnibus appropriations bill, the Administration has refused to allocate \nthe more than $11 million designated for NWIRP. I find this lack of \ncooperation on NWIRP, a program that can help save lives and avoid \nproperty damage, to be particularly troubling as millions of people on \nthe Gulf Coast and in Florida struggle to recover from recent \nhurricanes.\n  While I will continue my efforts to obtain additional funding for \nNWIRP, Congress must help by extending the program past its expiration \non September 30th of this year. My legislation would extend NWIRP \nthrough 2013, and make several other programmatic changes that are \nneeded to put the program on a stronger footing moving forward.\n  I propose shifting primary authority and responsibility for managing \nNWIRP from the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy to \nNIST, an agency that has excelled in leading the National Earthquake \nHazards Reduction Program since 2004. My legislation would also clarify \nthe roles and responsibilities of all Federal agencies participating on \nNWIRP's Interagency Working Group on Windstorm Impact Reduction. Three \nFederal agencies with current missions that provide valuable data or \nexpertise that support NWIRP's goals will be added to the program, \nnamely the Department of Transportation, National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Lastly, the \nlegislation would set a deadline for NIST to assemble the National \nAdvisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction, a group charged with \nproviding guidance to NIST and the Interagency Working Group on \nwindstorm-related research, mitigation, outreach, and other program \npriorities. The Advisory Committee will include representatives from a \nbroad array of NWIRP stakeholders, including state and local \ngovernments and experts from the research, technology transfer, \nbuilding design and construction, insurance, and finance communities.\n  I did not want to return to Florida this fall without taking action \nto keep us focused on reducing the impacts of windstorms on our \ncitizens and our economy. That is why I felt it important to propose \nthis legislation to extend, revamp, and revitalize the National \nWindstorm Impact Reduction Program.\n  In closing, I would like to recognize the efforts of Representative \nDennis Moore of Kansas, who is introducing a companion measure in the \nU.S. House of Representatives today. Kansas is particularly vulnerable \nto the devastation that tornados and hailstorms can cause, so I know \nthat he shares my desire to ensure that our constituents have \ninnovative, effective, and affordable tools available to help reduce \ntheir vulnerability to windstorms. I also understand that three members \nof the Florida delegation in the House, Representatives Alcee Hastings, \nIleana Ros-Lehtinen, and Mario Diaz-Balart, are original cosponsors of \nRepresentative Moore's bill. In addition to demonstrating how important \nthis legislation is to the State of the Florida and the Nation, I \nwelcome the bipartisan support that these cosponsors provide. I look \nforward to working with Chairman Inouye, Ranking Member Hutchison and \nthe other members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation to debate this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3638\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to secure the Federal voting rights of persons who \nhave been released from incarceration; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in a democracy, no right is more \nimportant than the right to vote; in our democracy, no right has been \nso dearly won. This country was founded on the idea that a just \ngovernment derives its power from the consent of the governed, a \nprinciple codified in the very first words of our Constitution: ``We \nthe People of the United States.'' From the Civil War through the \nwomen's suffrage movement through the Voting Rights Act of 1965 through \nthe 26th Amendment, the continuing expansion of the franchise, a \nbroadening of who ``we the people'' are, is one of our great American \nstories.\n  So today I will introduce the Democracy Restoration Act of 2008. This \nbill will guarantee that citizens who are not incarcerated have the \nright to vote in Federal elections. I am pleased that the Senator from \nRhode Island, Sen. Whitehouse, and the Senator from Maryland, Sen. \nCardin, have agreed to be a cosponsor.\n  Once, only wealthy White men could vote in this country. Once, \nAfrican Americans, ethnic minorities, women, young people, the poor, \nand the uneducated were all excluded. Today, we look back at those \ntimes and wonder how our country could have denied its citizens such a \nfundamental right for so long. And yet today, we continue to \ndisenfranchise an estimated 4 million of our fellow citizens who were \nconvicted of felonies but are no longer in prison. Two million of these \npeople have fully served their sentences, and the other two million are \non probation, parole, or supervised release. These people are living \nand working in the community, paying taxes, and contributing to \nsociety. But they cannot vote.\n  At this time, 10 states still strip people who have completed their \nsentence--who have paid their debt to society--of their right to vote. \nSome 35 States deny the vote to people on parole, and 30 of those \nStates also deny the vote to people on probation. I believe that the \npractice of stripping our fellow citizens of their voting rights is un-\nAmerican. It weakens our democracy. It is an anachronism, one of the \nlast vestiges of a medieval jurisprudence that declared convicted \ncriminals to be outlaws, irrevocably expelled from society.\n  This principle was called ``civil death'' and in medieval Europe, it \nwas reserved for the worst crimes. Yet today, here, in the greatest \ndemocracy in the world, we continue to sentence 4 million people--\npeople who have served their time, people who are contributing members \nof society--to civil death.\n  One might ask how something as undemocratic as civil death could have \nsurvived to the present day. Unfortunately, Mr. President, the practice \nof disenfranchising people with felony convictions has an explicitly \nracist history. Like the grandfather clause, the literacy test, and the \npoll tax, civil death became a tool of Jim Crow.\n  Across the country, 13 percent of African-American men are \ndisenfranchised because of a felony conviction. As of 2004, in 14 \nstates, felony disenfranchisement provisions had stripped more than 10 \npercent of the entire African-American voting-age population of the \nright to vote. In 4 states, they had disenfranchise more than 20 \npercent of eligible African-American voters.\n  The architects of Jim Crow would be proud of their handiwork, and how \nit has lasted long after the rest of their evil system was dismantled. \nThe rest of us should be ashamed, and yes, outraged. If we believe in \nredemption, we should be outraged. Because civil death has denied 4 \nmillion Americans a chance at redemption. If we believe in progress, we \nshould be outraged. Because civil death keeps this country chained to \nthe worst moments of our past. If we believe in democracy, we should be \noutraged. Because civil death strikes at the heart of our democracy.\n  There is a growing movement across the country to expand the \nfranchise and restore voting rights to people coming out of prison and \nreentering the community. In the last decade, 16 States have reformed \ntheir laws to expand the franchise or ease voting rights restoration \nprocedures. This bill continues that movement. It provides that the \nright to vote for candidates for Federal office shall not be denied or \nabridged because a person has been convicted of a crime unless that \nperson is actually in prison serving a felony sentence. It gives the \nAttorney General of the United States the power to obtain declaratory \nor injunctive relief to enforce that right. And it gives a person whose \nrights are being violated a right to go to court to get relief.\n  The bill also requires Federal and State officials to notify \nindividuals of their right to vote once their sentences have been \nserved. This is an important part of the bill, given the long history \nof these civil death provisions. Even after this bill passes, many ex-\noffenders may not know their rights, and we should take affirmative \nsteps to make sure that they do. No one should be disenfranchised \nbecause of lack of information.\n  Upon signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, President Johnson said:\n\n       The vote is the powerful instrument ever devised by man for \n     breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls \n     which imprison men because they are different from other men.\n\n  When prisoners return to their communities after serving their \nsentences, we expect and hope that they will reintegrate themselves \ninto society as productive citizens. Yet, without the right to vote, \nrehabilitated felons are already a step behind in regaining a sense of \ncivic responsibility and commitment to their communities. If our \ncountry wants ex-offenders to succeed at becoming better citizens, who \nboth abide by the law and act as responsible individuals, then we need \nto restore this most fundamental right. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3640\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Democracy Restoration Act of \n     2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The right to vote is the most basic constitutive act of \n     citizenship. Regaining the right to vote reintegrates \n     offenders into free society, helping to enhance public \n     safety.\n       (2) Article I, section 4 of the Constitution of the United \n     States grants Congress ultimate supervisory power over \n     Federal elections, an authority which has repeatedly been \n     upheld by the Supreme Court.\n       (3) Basic constitutional principles of fairness and equal \n     protection require an equal opportunity for Americans to vote \n     in Federal elections. The right to vote may not be abridged \n     or denied by the United States or by any State on account of \n     race, color, gender or previous condition of servitude. The \n     14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution empower Congress \n     to enact measures to protect the right to vote in Federal \n     elections.\n       (4) There are three areas where discrepancies in State laws \n     regarding felony convictions lead to unfairness in Federal \n     elections:\n\n[[Page S9721]]\n\n     (A) there is no uniform standard for voting in Federal \n     elections which leads to an unfair disparity and unequal \n     participation in Federal elections based solely on where a \n     person lives; (B) laws governing the restoration of voting \n     rights after a felony conviction are unequal throughout the \n     country and persons in some States can easily regain their \n     voting rights while in other States persons effectively lose \n     their right to vote permanently; and (C) State \n     disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact racial \n     ethnic minorities.\n       (5) Disenfranchisement results from varying State laws that \n     restrict voting while under some form of criminal justice \n     supervision or after the completion of a felony sentence in \n     some States. Two States do not disenfranchise felons at all \n     (Maine and Vermont). Forty-eight States and the District of \n     Columbia have disenfranchisement laws that deprive convicted \n     offenders of the right to vote while they are in prison. In \n     thirty-five States, convicted offenders may not vote while \n     they are on parole and thirty of these States disenfranchise \n     felony probationers as well. In ten States, a conviction can \n     result in lifetime disenfranchisement.\n       (6) An estimated 5,300,000 Americans, or about one in \n     forty-one adults, currently cannot vote as a result of a \n     felony conviction. Nearly 4,000,000 (74 percent) of the \n     5,300,000 disqualified voters are not in prison, but are on \n     probation or parole, or are ex-offenders. Approximately \n     2,000,000 of those individuals are individuals who have \n     completed their entire sentence, including probation and \n     parole, yet remain disenfranchised.\n       (7) In those States that disenfranchise ex-offenders, the \n     right to vote can be regained in theory, but in practice this \n     possibility is often illusory. Offenders must either obtain a \n     pardon or order from the Governor or action by the parole or \n     pardon board, depending on the offense and State. Offenders \n     convicted of a Federal offense often have additional barriers \n     to regaining voting rights.\n       (8) In at least 16 States, Federal offenders cannot use the \n     State procedure for restoring their civil rights. The only \n     method provided by Federal law for restoring voting rights to \n     ex-offenders is a Presidential pardon. Few persons who seek \n     to have their right to vote restored have the financial and \n     political resources needed to succeed.\n       (9) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact \n     ethnic minorities. Thirteen percent of the African American \n     adult male population, or 1,400,000 African American men, are \n     disenfranchised. Given current rates of incarceration, three \n     in ten of the next generation of black men will be \n     disenfranchised at some point during their lifetime. Hispanic \n     citizens are also disproportionately disenfranchised since \n     they are disproportionately represented in the criminal \n     justice system.\n       (10) Disenfranchising citizens who have been convicted of a \n     felony offense and who are living and working in the \n     community serves no compelling State interest and hinders \n     their rehabilitation and reintegration into society.\n       (11) State disenfranchisement laws suppress electoral \n     participation among eligible voters and damage the integrity \n     of the electoral process. State disenfranchisement laws \n     significantly impact the rate of electoral participation \n     among the children of disenfranchised parents.\n       (12) The United States in the only Western democracy that \n     permits the permanent denial of voting rights to individuals \n     with felony convictions.\n\n     SEC. 3. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS.\n\n       The right of an individual who is a citizen of the United \n     States to vote in any election for Federal office shall not \n     be denied or abridged because that individual has been \n     convicted of a criminal offense unless such individual is \n     serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution or \n     facility at the time of the election.\n\n     SEC. 4.

An \n     estimate of the remaining amount of construction costs as of \n     January 31, 2011, as adjusted, shall be provided by the \n     Secretary to each contractor no later than June 30, 2010;\n       (B) require that, notwithstanding subsection (c)(2), \n     construction costs or other capitalized costs incurred after \n     the effective date of the contract or not reflected in the \n     schedule referenced in subparagraph (A), and properly \n     assignable to such contractor, shall be repaid in not more \n     than 5 years after notification of the allocation if such \n     amount is a result of a collective annual allocation of \n     capital costs to the contractors exercising contract \n     conversions under this subsection of less than $5,000,000. If \n     such amount is $5,000,000 or greater, such cost shall be \n     repaid as provided by applicable Reclamation law, provided \n     that the reference to the amount of $5,000,000 shall not be a \n     precedent in any other context;\n       (C) provide that power revenues will not be available to \n     aid in repayment of construction costs allocated to \n     irrigation under the contract; and\n       (D) conform to the Settlement and this part and shall \n     continue so long as the contractor pays applicable charges, \n     consistent with subsection (c)(2) and applicable law.\n       (4) All such contracts entered into pursuant to paragraph \n     (2) shall--\n       (A) require the repayment in lump sum of the remaining \n     amount of construction costs identified in the most current \n     version of the Central Valley Project Schedule of Municipal \n     and Industrial Water Rates, as adjusted to reflect payments \n     not reflected in such schedule, and properly assignable for \n     ultimate return by the contractor, no later than January 31, \n     2014. An estimate of the remaining amount of construction \n     costs as of January 31, 2014, as adjusted, shall be provided \n     by the Secretary to each contractor no later than June 30, \n     2013;\n       (B) require that, notwithstanding subsection (c)(2), \n     construction costs or other capitalized costs incurred after \n     the effective date of the contract or not reflected in the \n     schedule referenced in subparagraph (A), and properly \n     assignable to such contractor, shall be repaid in not more \n     than 5 years after notification of the allocation if such \n     amount is a result of a collective annual allocation of \n     capital costs to the contractors exercising contract \n     conversions under this subsection of less than $5,000,000. If \n     such amount is $5,000,000 or greater, such cost shall be \n     repaid as provided by applicable Reclamation law, provided \n     that the reference to the amount of $5,000,000 shall not be a \n     precedent in any other context; and\n       (C) conform to the Settlement and this part and shall \n     continue so long as the contractor pays applicable charges, \n     consistent with subsection (c)(2) and applicable law.\n       (b) Final Adjustment.--The amounts paid pursuant to \n     subsection (a) shall be subject to adjustment following a \n     final cost allocation by the Secretary upon completion of the \n     construction of the Central Valley Project. In the event that \n     the final cost allocation indicates that the costs properly \n     assignable to the contractor are greater than what has been \n     paid by the contractor, the contractor shall be obligated to \n     pay the remaining allocated costs. The term of such \n     additional repayment contract shall be no less than 1 year \n     and no more than 10 years, however, mutually agreeable \n     provisions regarding the rate of repayment of such amount may \n     be developed by the parties. In the event that the final cost \n     allocation indicates that the costs properly assignable to \n     the contractor are less than what the contractor has paid, \n     the Secretary is authorized and directed to credit such \n     overpayment as an offset against any outstanding or future \n     obligation of the contractor.\n       (c) Applicability of Certain Provisions.--\n       (1) Notwithstanding any repayment obligation under \n     subsection (a)(3)(B) or subsection (b), upon a contractor's \n     compliance with and discharge of the obligation of repayment \n     of the construction costs as provided in subsection \n     (a)(3)(A), the provisions of section 213(a) and (b) of the \n     Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (96 Stat. 1269) shall apply to \n     lands in such district.\n       (2) Notwithstanding any repayment obligation under \n     paragraph (3)(B) or (4)(B) of subsection (a), or subsection \n     (b), upon a contractor's compliance with and discharge of the \n     obligation of repayment of the construction costs as provided \n     in paragraphs (3)(A) and (4)(A) of subsection (a), the \n     Secretary shall waive the pricing provisions of section \n     3405(d) of the Reclamation Projects Authorization and \n     Adjustment Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-575) for such \n     contractor, provided that such contractor shall continue to \n     pay applicable operation and maintenance costs and other \n     charges applicable to such repayment contracts pursuant to \n     the then-current rate-setting policy and applicable law.\n       (3) Provisions of the Settlement applying to Friant \n     Division, Hidden Unit, and Buchanan Unit long-term water \n     service contracts shall also apply to contracts executed \n     pursuant to this section.\n       (d) Reduction of Charge for Those Contracts Converted \n     Pursuant to Subsection (a)(1).--\n       (1) At the time all payments by the contractor required by \n     subsection (a)(3)(A) have been completed, the Secretary shall \n     reduce the charge mandated in section 10007(1) of this part, \n     from 2020 through 2039, to offset the financing costs as \n     defined in section 10010(d)(3). The reduction shall be \n     calculated at the time all payments by the contractor \n     required by subsection (a)(3)(A) have been completed. The \n     calculation shall remain fixed from 2020 through 2039 and \n     shall be based upon anticipated average annual water \n     deliveries, as mutually agreed upon by the Secretary and the \n     contractor, for the period from 2020 through 2039, and the \n     amounts of such reductions shall be discounted using the \n     Treasury Rate; provided, that such charge shall not be \n     reduced to less than $4.00 per acre foot of project water \n     delivered; provided further, that such reduction shall be \n     implemented annually unless the Secretary determines, based \n     on the availability of other monies, that the charges \n     mandated in section 10007(1) are otherwise needed to cover \n     ongoing federal costs of the Settlement, including any \n     federal operation and maintenance costs of facilities that \n     the Secretary determines are needed to implement the \n     Settlement. If the Secretary determines that such charges are \n     necessary to cover such ongoing federal costs, the Secretary \n     shall, instead of making the reduction in such charges, \n     reduce the contractor's operation and maintenance obligation \n     by an equivalent amount, and such amount shall not be \n     recovered by the United States from any Central Valley \n     Project contractor, provided nothing herein shall affect the \n     obligation of the contractor to make payments pursuant to a \n     transfer agreement with a non-federal operating entity.\n       (2) If the calculated reduction in paragraph (1), taking \n     into consideration the minimum amount required, does not \n     result in the contractor offsetting its financing costs, the \n     Secretary is authorized and directed to reduce, after 2019, \n     any outstanding or future obligations of the contractor to \n     the Bureau of Reclamation, other than the charge assessed and \n     collected under section 3407(d) of Public law 102-575, by the \n     amount of such deficiency, with such amount indexed to 2020 \n     using the Treasury Rate and such amount shall be not be \n     recovered by the United States from any Central Valley \n     Project contractor, provided nothing herein shall affect the \n     obligation of the contractor to make payments pursuant to a \n     transfer agreement with a non-Federal operating entity.\n       (3) Financing costs, for the purposes of this subsection, \n     shall be computed as the difference of the net present value \n     of the construction cost identified in subsection (a)(3)(A) \n     using the full Treasury Rate as compared to using one half of \n     the Treasury Rate and applying those rates against a \n     calculated average annual capital repayment through 2030.\n       (4) Effective in 2040, the charge shall revert to the \n     amount called for in section 10007(1) of this part.\n       (5) For purposes of this section, ``Treasury Rate'' shall \n     be defined as the 20 year Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) \n     rate published by the United States Department of the \n     Treasury as of October 1, 2010.\n       (e) Satisfaction of Certain Provisions.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon the first release of Interim Flows or \n     Restoration Flows, pursuant to paragraphs 13 or 15 of the \n     Settlement, any short- or long-term agreement, to which 1 or \n     more long-term Friant Division, Hidden Unit, or Buchanan Unit \n     contractor that converts its contract pursuant to subsection \n     (a) is a party, providing for the transfer or exchange of \n     water not released as Interim Flows or Restoration Flows \n     shall be deemed to satisfy the provisions of subsection \n     3405(a)(1)(A) and (I) of the Reclamation Projects \n     Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-575) \n     without the further concurrence of the Secretary as to \n     compliance with said subsections if the contractor provides, \n     not later than 90 days before commencement of any such \n     transfer or exchange for a period in excess of 1 year, and \n     not later than 30 days before commencement of any proposed \n     transfer or exchange with duration of less than 1 year, \n     written notice to the Secretary stating how the proposed \n     transfer or exchange is intended to reduce, avoid, or \n     mitigate impacts to water deliveries caused by the Interim \n     Flows or Restoration Flows or is intended to otherwise \n     facilitate the Water Management Goal, as described in the \n     Settlement. The Secretary shall promptly make such notice \n     publicly available.\n\n[[Page S9826]]\n\n       (2) Determination of reductions to water deliveries.--Water \n     transferred or exchanged under an agreement that meets the \n     terms of this subsection shall not be counted as a \n     replacement or an offset for purposes of determining \n     reductions to water deliveries to any Friant Division long-\n     term contractor except as provided in paragraph 16(b) of the \n     Settlement. The Secretary shall, at least annually, make \n     publicly available a compilation of the number of transfer or \n     exchange agreements exercising the provisions of this \n     subsection to reduce, avoid, or mitigate impacts to water \n     deliveries caused by the Interim Flows or Restoration Flows \n     or to facilitate the Water Management Goal, as well as the \n     volume of water transferred or exchanged under such \n     agreements.\n       (3) State law.--Nothing in this subsection alters State law \n     or permit conditions, including any applicable geographical \n     restrictions on the place of use of water transferred or \n     exchanged pursuant to this subsection.\n       (f) Certain Repayment Obligations Not Altered.--\n     Implementation of the provisions of this section shall not \n     alter the repayment obligation of any other long-term water \n     service or repayment contractor receiving water from the \n     Central Valley Project, or shift any costs that would \n     otherwise have been properly assignable to the Friant \n     contractors absent this section, including operations and \n     maintenance costs, construction costs, or other capitalized \n     costs incurred after the date of enactment of this Act, to \n     other such contractors.\n       (g) Statutory Interpretation.--Nothing in this part shall \n     be construed to affect the right of any Friant Division, \n     Hidden Unit, or Buchanan Unit long-term contractor to use a \n     particular type of financing to make the payments required in \n     paragraph (3)(A) or (4)(A) of subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 10011. CALIFORNIA CENTRAL VALLEY SPRING RUN CHINOOK \n                   SALMON.\n\n       (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the implementation of the \n     Settlement to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation \n     regarding restoration of the San Joaquin River and the \n     reintroduction of the California Central Valley Spring Run \n     Chinook salmon is a unique and unprecedented circumstance \n     that requires clear expressions of Congressional intent \n     regarding how the provisions of the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) are utilized to achieve the \n     goals of restoration of the San Joaquin River and the \n     successful reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring \n     Run Chinook salmon.\n       (b) Reintroduction in the San Joaquin River.--California \n     Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon shall be \n     reintroduced in the San Joaquin River below Friant Dam \n     pursuant to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 (16 U.S.C. 1539(j)) and the Settlement, provided that \n     the Secretary of Commerce finds that a permit for the \n     reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring Run \n     Chinook salmon may be issued pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A) \n     of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1539(a)(1)(A)).\n       (c) Final Rule.--\n       (1) Definition of third party.--For the purpose of this \n     subsection, the term ``third party'' means persons or \n     entities diverting or receiving water pursuant to applicable \n     State and Federal laws and shall include Central Valley \n     Project contractors outside of the Friant Division of the \n     Central Valley Project and the State Water Project.\n       (2) Issuance.--The Secretary of Commerce shall issue a \n     final rule pursuant to section 4(d) of the Endangered Species \n     Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(d)) governing the incidental take \n     of reintroduced California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook \n     salmon prior to the reintroduction.\n       (3) Required components.--The rule issued under paragraph \n     (2) shall provide that the reintroduction will not impose \n     more than de minimus: water supply reductions, additional \n     storage releases, or bypass flows on unwilling third parties \n     due to such reintroduction.\n       (4) Applicable law.--Nothing in this section--\n       (A) diminishes the statutory or regulatory protections \n     provided in the Endangered Species Act of 1973 for any \n     species listed pursuant to section 4 of the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533) other than the \n     reintroduced population of California Central Valley Spring \n     Run Chinook salmon, including protections pursuant to \n     existing biological opinions or new biological opinions \n     issued by the Secretary or Secretary of Commerce; or\n       (B) precludes the Secretary or Secretary of Commerce from \n     imposing protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) for other species listed pursuant to \n     section 4 of that Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) because those \n     protections provide incidental benefits to such reintroduced \n     California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon.\n       (d) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than December 31, 2024, the \n     Secretary of Commerce shall report to Congress on the \n     progress made on the reintroduction set forth in this section \n     and the Secretary's plans for future implementation of this \n     section.\n       (2) Inclusions.--The report under paragraph (1) shall \n     include--\n       (A) an assessment of the major challenges, if any, to \n     successful reintroduction;\n       (B) an evaluation of the effect, if any, of the \n     reintroduction on the existing population of California \n     Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon existing on the \n     Sacramento River or its tributaries;

Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for Mrs. Boxer) proposed an amendment to the \nbill S. 906, to prohibit the sale, distribution, transfer, and export \nof elemental mercury, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mercury Export Ban Act of \n     2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) mercury is highly toxic to humans, ecosystems, and \n     wildlife;\n       (2) as many as 10 percent of women in the United States of \n     childbearing age have mercury in the blood at a level that \n     could put a baby at risk;\n       (3) as many as 630,000 children born annually in the United \n     States are at risk of neurological problems related to \n     mercury;\n       (4) the most significant source of mercury exposure to \n     people in the United States is ingestion of mercury-\n     contaminated fish;\n       (5) the Environmental Protection Agency reports that, as of \n     2004--\n       (A) 44 States have fish advisories covering over 13,000,000 \n     lake acres and over 750,000 river miles;\n       (B) in 21 States the freshwater advisories are statewide; \n     and\n       (C) in 12 States the coastal advisories are statewide;\n       (6) the long-term solution to mercury pollution is to \n     minimize global mercury use and releases to eventually \n     achieve reduced contamination levels in the environment, \n     rather than reducing fish consumption since uncontaminated \n     fish represents a critical and healthy source of nutrition \n     worldwide;\n       (7) mercury pollution is a transboundary pollutant, \n     depositing locally, regionally, and globally, and affecting \n     water bodies near industrial sources (including the Great \n     Lakes) and remote areas (including the Arctic Circle);\n       (8) the free trade of elemental mercury on the world \n     market, at relatively low prices and in ready supply, \n     encourages the continued use of elemental mercury outside of \n     the United States, often involving highly dispersive \n     activities such as artisinal gold mining;\n       (9) the intentional use of mercury is declining in the \n     United States as a consequence of process changes to \n     manufactured products (including batteries, paints, switches, \n     and measuring devices), but those uses remain substantial in \n     the developing world where releases from the products are \n     extremely likely due to the limited pollution control and \n     waste management infrastructures in those countries;\n       (10) the member countries of the European Union \n     collectively are the largest source of elemental mercury \n     exports globally;\n       (11) the European Commission has proposed to the European \n     Parliament and to the Council of the European Union a \n     regulation to ban exports of elemental mercury from the \n     European Union by 2011;\n       (12) the United States is a net exporter of elemental \n     mercury and, according to the United States Geological \n     Survey, exported 506 metric tons of elemental mercury more \n     than the United States imported during the period of 2000 \n     through 2004; and\n       (13) banning exports of elemental mercury from the United \n     States will have a notable effect on the market availability \n     of elemental mercury and switching to affordable mercury \n     alternatives in the developing world.\n\n     SEC. 3.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of Calendar No. 1086, H.R. 2631.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2631) to strengthen efforts in the Department \n     of Homeland Security to develop nuclear forensics \n     capabilities to permit attribution of the source of nuclear \n     material.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs with an amendment to strike all after the enacting \nclause and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n                               H.R. 2631\n\n  Be it enacted by the Senate and House Representatives of the United \nStates of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The threat of a nuclear terrorist attack on American \n     interests, both domestic and abroad, is one of the most \n     serious threats to the national security of the United \n     States. In the wake of an attack, attribution of \n     responsibility would be of utmost importance. Because of the \n     destructive power of the weapon, there could be little \n     forensic evidence except the radioactive material in the bomb \n     itself.\n       (2) Through advanced nuclear forensics, using both existing \n     techniques and those under development, it may be possible to \n     identify the source and pathway of a weapon or material after \n     it is interdicted or detonated. Though identifying \n     intercepted smuggled material is now possible in some cases, \n     pre-detonation forensics is a relatively undeveloped field. \n     The post-detonation nuclear forensics field is also immature, \n     and the challenges are compounded by the pressures and time \n     constraints of performing forensics after a nuclear or \n     radiological attack.\n       (3) A robust and well-known capability to identify the \n     source of nuclear or radiological material intended for or \n     used in an act of terror could also deter prospective \n     proliferators. Furthermore, the threat of effective \n     attribution could compel improved security at material \n     storage facilities, preventing the unwitting transfer of \n     nuclear or radiological materials.\n       (4)(A) In order to identify special nuclear material and \n     other radioactive materials confidently, it is necessary to \n     have a robust capability to acquire samples in a timely \n     manner, analyze and characterize samples, and compare samples \n     against known signatures of nuclear and radiological \n     material.\n       (B) Many of the radioisotopes produced in the detonation of \n     a nuclear device have short half-lives, so the timely \n     acquisition of samples is of the utmost importance. Over the \n     past several decades, the ability of the United States to \n     gather atmospheric samples, often the preferred method of \n     sample acquisition, has diminished. This ability must be \n     restored and modern techniques that could complement or \n     replace existing techniques should be pursued.\n       (C) The discipline of pre-detonation forensics is a \n     relatively undeveloped field. The radiation associated with a \n     nuclear or radiological device may affect traditional \n     forensics techniques in unknown ways. In a post-detonation \n     scenario, radiochemistry may provide the most useful tools \n     for analysis and characterization of samples. The number of \n     radiochemistry programs and radiochemists in United States \n     National Laboratories and universities has dramatically \n     declined over the past several decades. The narrowing \n     pipeline of qualified people into this critical field is a \n     serious impediment to maintaining a robust and credible \n     nuclear forensics program.\n       (5) Once samples have been acquired and characterized, it \n     is necessary to compare the results against samples of known \n     material from reactors, weapons, and enrichment facilities, \n     and from medical, academic, commercial, and other facilities \n     containing such materials, throughout the world. Some of \n     these samples are available to the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency through safeguards agreements, and some \n     countries maintain internal sample databases. Access to \n     samples in many countries is limited by national security \n     concerns.\n       (6) In order to create a sufficient deterrent, it is \n     necessary to have the capability to positively identify the \n     source of nuclear or radiological material, and potential \n     traffickers in nuclear or radiological material must be aware \n     of that capability. International cooperation may be \n     essential to catalogue all existing sources of nuclear or \n     radiological material.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, in January 2005, Senator Hatch and I wrote \nto the Register of Copyrights out of a concern that the length of \ncopyright terms was having an unintended consequence of creating a \nclass of ``orphan works''--works that may be protected by copyright, \nbut whose owners cannot be identified or located. Creative works are \ncollecting dust because those who would like to bring them to light are \nrespectful of the copyright laws and will not use those works if they \ncannot locate the owners. This unfortunate situation is keeping \ncreative and cultural works from the public, and does not advance the \npurpose of the copyright laws.\n  Today, the Senate completes work on legislation I introduced along \nwith Senator Hatch to remedy this situation. The Shawn Bentley Orphan \nWorks Act of 2008 is designed to enable use of works whose copyright \nstatus and ownership is uncertain without the user facing prohibitive \nstatutory damages.\n  The act does not dramatically restructure current copyright law--it \ndoes not impose new registration requirements, nor does it provide for \na transfer of copyright ownership or rights. The bill simply provides \nfor a limitation on remedies in discrete, limited circumstances in \nwhich, among other things, the owner of the work is not locatable. Any \ninfringer who wishes to use an orphan works limitation on remedies must \nperform a diligent search in good faith, document that search, and, in \nthe event that the owner emerges, negotiate with the copyright owner in \ngood faith regarding reasonable compensation. If any of these \nconditions, or others set forth in the bill, is not met, the limitation \non remedies is unavailable and an infringer faces the full statutory \ndamages as well as costs and attorney's fees.\n  At its core, the bill seeks to unite users and copyright owners, and \nto ensure that copyright owners are compensated for the use of their \nworks. It does not create any orphans, and it does not create a license \nto infringe. By providing an incentive to search, in the form of a \nlimitation on remedies, more users will find more owners; more works \notherwise hidden will be used; and more copyright owners will receive \ncompensation. The Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act will thus allow the \npublic to enjoy works that are currently left unseen and unused. I hope \nthe House can take up this measure, and send it to the President for \nsignature.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my continued \nsupport for the Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008, S. 2913, which \nI introduced with Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy. \nThis bill represents years of hard work and collaboration by the \nSenate, industry stakeholders, and U.S. Copyright Office officials. \nPassing S. 2913 is long overdue.\n  I want to thank Chairman Leahy for naming S. 2913 as the Shawn \nBentley Orphan Works Act of 2008. It honors my long-time staffer and \nformer colleague, Shawn Bentley. As many of you may remember, Shawn \nworked for the Judiciary Committee for a decade and worked on several \nimportant pieces of landmark intellectual property legislation. In \nfact, he initiated what we have now introduced as an orphan works bill. \nMany in this body were greatly saddened by Shawn's untimely death at \n41. He was a one-of-a-kind individual. I believe this bill is a fitting \nway to acknowledge his continuing contributions to intellectual \nproperty law.\n  Countless artistic creations around the country are effectively \nlocked away in a proverbial attic and unavailable for the general \npublic to enjoy because the owner of the copyright for the work is \nunknown. These are generally referred to as orphan works.\n  Unfortunately, it is not always easy to identify an owner of a \ncopyrighted work, and in many cases, information about the copyright \nholder is not publicly known. To make matters worse, many are \ndiscouraged from using these works for fear of being sued should the \nowner eventually step forward.\n  Many libraries, museums, State and local historical societies, and \narchives across the country that have significant amounts of orphan \nworks, which are not currently available publicly.\n  Think of the new educational opportunities that will be opened to \nstudents, scholars, and the public alike when these works become \naccessible. The potential for learning, scholarship, and enjoyment of \nthe works of previous generations are unlimited.\n  Without doubt, passage of S. 2913 addresses the orphan works problem.\n\n[[Page S9870]]\n\n  Yesterday, Marybeth Peters, Register of the Copyrights, wrote the \nfollowing about the importance of orphan works legislation:\n\n       The legislation is sensible: it would ease the orphan \n     problem by reducing, but not eliminating, the exposure of \n     good faith users. But there are clear conditions designed to \n     protect copyright owners. A user must take all reasonable \n     steps, employ all reasonable technology, and execute the \n     applicable search practices to be submitted to the Copyright \n     Office by authors, associations, and other experts.\n       The user must meet other hurdles, including attaching an \n     orphan symbol to the use, to increase transparency and the \n     possibility that an owner may emerge. If an owner does \n     emerge, the user must pay `reasonable compensation' or face \n     full liability. Reasonable compensation will be mutually \n     agreed by the owner and the user or, failing that, be decided \n     by a court; but it must also reflect objective market values \n     for the work and the use. This framework would facilitate \n     projects that are global (think rare text in the hands of a \n     book publisher) as well as local (think family portraits in \n     the hands of a photo finisher), while preserving the purpose \n     and potential of copyright law. It would not inject orphan \n     works prematurely into the public domain, create an automatic \n     exception for all uses, or create a permanent class of orphan \n     works. Nor would it minimize the value of any one orphan work \n     by mandating a government license and statutory rate.\n\n  Ms. Peters continues by stating:\n\n       Some critics believe that the legislation is unfair because \n     it will deprive copyright owners of injunctive relief, \n     statutory damages, and actual damages. I do not agree.\n\n  Let me repeat, The Register of Copyrights does not believe the \nlegislation is unfair, or that it will deprive copyright owners of \ninjunctive relief, statutory damages, and actual damages.\n  With 43 years of experience working in the Copyright Office, 14 of \nthem as the Register, I trust that Ms. Peters knows a few things about \ncopyright law. And I want to take this opportunity to thank her and her \nstaff and the many other stakeholders for their tremendous assistance \nin crafting this important legislation.\n  I also want to thank my counsel Matt Sandgren and Aaron Cooper, \nSenator Leahy's counsel, for their perseverance and hard work on this \ninitiative.\n  In my view, a solution to the orphan works problem is achievable and \nthe pending legislation is both fair and responsible. I urge my \ncolleagues to pass S. 2913 without further delay.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Kyl \namendment at the desk be agreed to; the committee-reported amendment, \nas amended, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read the third time \nand passed; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that \nany statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mercury Export Ban Act of \n     2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) mercury is highly toxic to humans, ecosystems, and \n     wildlife;\n       (2) as many as 10 percent of women in the United States of \n     childbearing age have mercury in the blood at a level that \n     could put a baby at risk;\n       (3) as many as 630,000 children born annually in the United \n     States are at risk of neurological problems related to \n     mercury;\n       (4) the most significant source of mercury exposure to \n     people in the United States is ingestion of mercury-\n     contaminated fish;\n       (5) the Environmental Protection Agency reports that, as of \n     2004--\n       (A) 44 States have fish advisories covering over 13,000,000 \n     lake acres and over 750,000 river miles;\n       (B) in 21 States the freshwater advisories are statewide; \n     and\n       (C) in 12 States the coastal advisories are statewide;\n       (6) the long-term solution to mercury pollution is to \n     minimize global mercury use and releases to eventually \n     achieve reduced contamination levels in the environment, \n     rather than reducing fish consumption since uncontaminated \n     fish represents a critical and healthy source of nutrition \n     worldwide;\n       (7) mercury pollution is a transboundary pollutant, \n     depositing locally, regionally, and globally, and affecting \n     water bodies near industrial sources (including the Great \n     Lakes) and remote areas (including the Arctic Circle);\n       (8) the free trade of elemental mercury on the world \n     market, at relatively low prices and in ready supply, \n     encourages the continued use of elemental mercury outside of \n     the United States, often involving highly dispersive \n     activities such as artisinal gold mining;\n       (9) the intentional use of mercury is declining in the \n     United States as a consequence of process changes to \n     manufactured products (including batteries, paints, switches, \n     and measuring devices), but those uses remain substantial in \n     the developing world where releases from the products are \n     extremely likely due to the limited pollution control and \n     waste management infrastructures in those countries;\n       (10) the member countries of the European Union \n     collectively are the largest source of elemental mercury \n     exports globally;\n       (11) the European Commission has proposed to the European \n     Parliament and to the Council of the European Union a \n     regulation to ban exports of elemental mercury from the \n     European Union by 2011;\n       (12) the United States is a net exporter of elemental \n     mercury and, according to the United States Geological \n     Survey, exported 506 metric tons of elemental mercury more \n     than the United States imported during the period of 2000 \n     through 2004; and\n       (13) banning exports of elemental mercury from the United \n     States will have a notable effect on the market availability \n     of elemental mercury and switching to affordable mercury \n     alternatives in the developing world.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON SALE, DISTRIBUTION, OR TRANSFER OF \n                   ELEMENTAL MERCURY.\n\n       Section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. \n     2605) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f) Mercury.--\n       ``(1) Prohibition on sale, distribution, or transfer of \n     elemental mercury by federal agencies.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), effective beginning on the date of enactment \n     of this subsection, no Federal agency shall convey, sell, or \n     distribute to any other Federal agency, any State or local \n     government agency, or any private individual or entity any \n     elemental mercury under the control or jurisdiction of the \n     Federal agency.\n       ``(2) Exceptions.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to--\n       ``(A) a transfer between Federal agencies of elemental \n     mercury for the sole purpose of facilitating storage of \n     mercury to carry out this Act; or\n       ``(B) a conveyance, sale, distribution, or transfer of \n     coal.\n       ``(3) Leases of federal coal.--Nothing in this subsection \n     prohibits the leasing of coal.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON EXPORT OF ELEMENTAL MERCURY.\n\n       Section 12 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. \n     2611) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a) by striking ``subsection (b)'' and \n     inserting ``subsections (b) and (c)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Prohibition on Export of Elemental Mercury.--\n       ``(1) Prohibition.--Effective January 1, 2010, the export \n     of elemental mercury from the United States is prohibited.\n       ``(2) Inapplicability of subsection (a).--Subsection (a) \n     shall not apply to this subsection.\n       ``(3) Report to congress on mercury compounds.--\n       ``(A) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of \n     enactment of the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008, the \n     Administrator shall publish and submit to Congress a report \n     on mercuric chloride, mercurous chloride or calomel, mercuric \n     oxide, and other mercury compounds, if\n\n[[Page S9875]]\n\n     any, that may currently be used in significant quantities in \n     products or processes.

LONG-TERM STORAGE.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Program.--Not later than January 1, \n     2010, the Secretary of Energy (in this section referred to as \n     the ``Secretary'') shall accept custody, for the purpose of \n     long-term management and storage, of elemental mercury \n     generated within the United States and delivered to a \n     facility of the Department of Energy designated by the \n     Secretary.\n       (b) Fees.--\n       (1) In general.--After consultation with persons who are \n     likely to deliver elemental mercury to a designated facility \n     for long-term management and storage under the program \n     prescribed in subsection (a), and with other interested \n     persons, the Secretary shall assess and collect a fee at the \n     time of delivery for providing such management and storage, \n     based on the pro rata cost of long-term management and \n     storage of elemental mercury delivered to the facility. The \n     amount of such fees--\n       (A) shall be made publically available not later than \n     October 1, 2009;\n       (B) may be adjusted annually; and\n       (C) shall be set in an amount sufficient to cover the costs \n     described in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Costs.--The costs referred to in paragraph (1)(C) are \n     the costs to the Department of Energy of providing such \n     management and storage, including facility operation and \n     maintenance, security, monitoring, reporting, personnel, \n     administration, inspections, training, fire suppression, \n     closure, and other costs required for compliance with \n     applicable law.

Patrick Rowan, of Maryland, to be an Assistant Attorney \n     General.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate confirmed the nomination \nof J. Patrick Rowan to be Assistant Attorney General in charge of the \nNational Security Division at the Department of Justice.\n  We continue in our efforts to rebuild the Department of Justice after \nthe scandals of the Gonzales era and the Bush administration. We have \nalready confirmed 35 executive nominations so far this Congress, \nincluding the confirmations of 12 U.S. attorneys, seven U.S. Marshals, \nand a new Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, and Associate \nAttorney General. We are poised to add to this total, having reported \nout of committee this month another 6 high-level executive nominations, \nincluding the nomination of Greg Garre to be Solicitor General of the \nUnited States, one of the highest and most prestigious positions at the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, the Judiciary Committee began its \noversight efforts. Over the 9 nine months, our efforts revealed a \nDepartment of Justice gone awry. The leadership crisis came more and \nmore into view as I led a bipartisan group of concerned Senators to \nconsider the United States Attorney firing scandal, a confrontation \nover the legality of the administration's warrantless wiretapping \nprogram, the untoward political influence of the White House at the \nDepartment of Justice, and the secret legal memos excusing all manner \nof excess and subverting the rule of law.\n  What our efforts exposed was a crisis of leadership that took a heavy \ntoll on the tradition of independence that has long guided the Justice \nDepartment and provided it with safe harbor from political \ninterference. It shook the confidence of the American people. Through \nbipartisan efforts among those from both sides of the aisle who care \nabout federal law enforcement and the Department of Justice, we joined \ntogether to press for accountability.\n  That resulted in a change in leadership at the Department, with the \nresignations of the Attorney General and virtually all of its highest-\nranking officials.\n  But the oversight efforts did not complete our work. We continue in \nthe waning days of the Bush administration to try to return to the \nright track and ensure that the rule of law is restored as the guiding \nlight for the work of the Department. Mr. Rowan, who currently serves \nas acting head of the National Security Division, has an opportunity \nnow and if confirmed to playa significant role in that restoration.\n  In the wake of the tragic attacks on September 11, 2001, and toward \nthe end of President Bush's first year in office, this country had an \nopportunity to show that we could fight terrorism, secure our Nation, \nand bring the perpetrators of those heinous acts to justice, all in a \nway that was consistent with our history and our most deeply valued \nprinciples. A number of us reached out to the White House in an effort \nto craft a thoughtful, effective bipartisan way forward. The White \nHouse, supported by the Republican leadership in Congress, chose \nanother path. They diverted our focus from al-Qaida and capturing Osama \nbin Laden to war and occupation in Iraq. They chose to enhance the \npower of the President and to turn the Office of Legal Counsel, OLC, at \nthe Department of Justice into an apologist for White House orders--\nfrom the warrantless wiretapping of Americans to torture. In my view, \nthat approach has made our country less safe.\n\n  We are all too familiar now with the litany of disastrous actions by \nthis administration: rejecting the Geneva Conventions--which the \nPresident's counsel referred to as ``quaint''--against the advice of \nthe Secretary of State; establishing a system of detention at \nGuantanamo Bay in an effort to circumvent the law and accountability; \nattempting to eliminate the Great Writ of habeas corpus for any non-\ncitizen designated by the President as an enemy combatant; setting up a \nflawed military commission process that, after 6 years, has finally \nresulted in its first trial of a terrorist after more than 80 have been \ntried successfully in our court system; and permitting cruel \ninterrogation practices that in the worst cases amount to officially \nsanctioned torture.\n  These misguided actions and policies have rested upon a legal edifice \nbuilt in secret by OLC opinions that have turned the rule of law on its \nhead by interpreting laws Congress has passed. This week the Judiciary \nCommittee authorized subpoenas relating to those opinions. For the \nbetter part of 8 years, OLC's work has largely been kept secret from \nthis oversight Committee, despite our efforts. Keeping binding \ninterpretations of secret law from Congress is wrong.\n  The advice we have seen from OLC has been deeply flawed, sloppy, and \nflat out wrong--but it has been permitted to happen because secrecy has \nprevented our oversight. Unjustified secrecy continues to prevent the \nreview by this Committee that would provide a check and some control on \nhow the administration is interpreting the law that is Congress's \nconstitutional responsibility to write. That obsessive secrecy even \nprevents us from knowing the subject matter on which OLC has written \nopinions.\n  There is no justification for keeping OLC legal interpretations \nsecret from this committee, let alone the index I have long sought. \nThat is why I sought and now have the authorization for subpoenas after \nyears of being rebuffed and slow-rolled in our attempts to find out how \nthis administration has interpreted and applied the laws written by \nCongress.\n  Another one of the misguided policies of the Bush-Cheney \nadministration was rebuked earlier this summer in the Supreme Court's \n5-4 decision in Boumediene v. Bush. That decision reaffirmed our core \nAmerican values by concluding that detainees at Guantanamo have the \nright to bring habeas corpus claims in Federal court. I applauded that \ndecision because I have maintained from the beginning that the \nprovisions of the Military Commission Act that purported to strip away \nthose rights were unconstitutional and un-American.\n  This should not have been a hard decision, but I hope Mr. Rowan \nunderstands that it was a vitally important one. The Courts have a long \nhistory of considering habeas petitions and of handling national \nsecurity matters, including classified information. I have great \nconfidence in our system of justice and its ability to handle these \nissues. The administration made this mess by seeking to avoid judicial \nreview at all costs, causing years of delay and profound uncertainty. \nIt has now been rebuked four times by the Supreme Court. Habeas Corpus \nis the ultimate guarantee of fairness and a check on executive excess.\n  It is vital that we ensure that we have a functioning, independent \nJustice Department, and that this sad era in the history of the \nDepartment is not repeated. We have seen what happens when the rule of \nlaw plays second fiddle to a President's agenda and the partisan \ndesires of political operatives. It is a disaster for the American \npeople. Both the President and the Nation are best served by a Justice \nDepartment\n\n[[Page S9878]]\n\nthat provides sound advice and takes responsible action, without regard \nfor political considerations--not one that develops legalistic \nloopholes and ideological litmus tests to serve the ends of a \nparticular administration.\n  I congratulate Mr. Rowan and his family on his confirmation today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/26/senate-section/article/S9878-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask \nunanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the \nfollowing treaty transmitted to the Senate on September 26, 2008, by \nthe President of the United States: Agreement on Conservation of \nAlbatrosses and Petrels, Treaty Document No. 110-22. I further ask \nunanimous consent that the treaty be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \naccession, I transmit herewith the Agreement on the Conservation of \nAlbatrosses and Petrels, with Annexes. In addition, I transmit for the \ninformation of the Senate the report of the Department of State, which \nincludes a detailed analysis of the Agreement.\n  The Agreement, done at Canberra on June 19, 2001, and that entered \ninto force on February 1, 2004, was adopted pursuant to the Convention \non the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (the \n``Convention''), done at Bonn on June 23, 1979. Although the United \nStates is not a Party to the Convention, the United States may \nnonetheless become a Party to the Agreement. The Agreement's objective \nis to achieve and maintain a favorable conservation status for \nalbatrosses and petrels.\n  I believe the Agreement to be fully in the U.S. interest. Its \nprovisions advance the U.S. goals of protecting albatrosses and \npetrels.
