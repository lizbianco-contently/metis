Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nand minority leader for allowing me to welcome and congratulate our \nguest chaplain today, Rev. Cathy Quinn, who has been noted as the \nsenior assistant rector at St. John's Episcopal Church here in \nWashington, DC. That church, as my colleagues know, is also referred to \noccasionally as the Church of the Presidents.\n  Reverend Quinn plays an integral role in leading the congregation in \ntheir faith and spiritual growth. She is not new to Capitol Hill, \nhaving served as a legislative assistant for former New York \nCongressman Amo Houghton. Her experiences while at Yale Divinity School \nranged from working at hospitals ministering to patients in the \npediatric intensive care units and the oncology ward to assisting with \nthe Children's Mission at St. Paul and St. James Episcopal Church. Her \nmany accomplishments have prepared her well for a life of ministry. \nAlong with her growing number of ministerial duties at St. John's, \nReverend Quinn also manages to balance the needs of her family--her \nhusband Peter, who is in the Chamber today, and her two daughters, Nora \nand Molly. Her level of commitment to both aspects of her life is a \nmodel for many to follow.\n  I wish to thank Reverend Quinn for her contributions to her community \nand for her service to the members of St. John's Church.\n  So I wish to acknowledge her good work and her spiritual guidance. I \nam particularly pleased because I have a parochial interest. As I said, \nnot only\n\n[[Page S8222]]\n\ndoes my family belong to that church, but my wife Lilibet serves on the \nvestry there. So not only am I always tuned in, but I pay particular \nattention in this case.\n  Again, we are very proud of her and the work she does, the work of \nSt. John's, and all who are associated with that church and that \nministry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8222-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we have a limited number of workdays \nbetween now and November, so we will obviously have to focus our \npriorities starting with the Defense authorization bill which the \ndistinguished majority leader was just discussing, which is now before \nus. Among other things, the bill authorizes a much deserved pay raise \nfor America's military men and women. Of course, an authorization bill \nonly gets us halfway there. In order for this military pay raise to \nreach the families it is intended for, the Senate will need to pass an \nappropriations bill as well. So my suggestion is that we begin \nprocessing amendments to the Defense bill today, as the majority leader \nhas indicated, starting with the first four amendments which will be \nvoted on later today. We weren't, unfortunately, able to vote on any \namendments yesterday. As everyone knows, the Defense bill is typically \na heavily amended bill. It usually takes 2 or 3 weeks to complete, but \nit is my hope we can make some good forward progress today. Kentucky is \nhome to two major military installations and more than 357,000 \nveterans. They, and the rest of America's veterans, deserve our full \nattention.\n  We have time but not a lot of time. Tomorrow, we will be taking some \ntime out to remember the 9/11 attacks. Friday, we have an all-day \nenergy summit. So let's use our time wisely. If we do, it is my hope we \ncan work together and, with cooperation, finish this bill, at least \nearly next week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8222-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, Sunday's announcement by Treasury \nSecretary Paulson that the Treasury Department and the Federal Housing \nFinance Authority would be placing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into \nconservatorship should be recognized for what it is: This is a landmark \nintervention by the Federal Government into our private markets, the \nhousing markets. We are literally nationalizing half of the American \nhousing market. The Bush economic policies and the irrational \nexuberance of the mortgage banking industry have driven us into this \nbox canyon. The U.S. economy is hurting, with dramatic job losses, home \nvalues reeling, and middle-income families struggling to pay for the \nbasic necessities.\n  While it may have been necessary and may have been the best of many \nbad options, this certainly raises significant long-term questions \nabout how we organize and regulate mortgage financing in this country. \nThis move may stop the rot for now, but real reform must follow.\n  With this administration's days numbered and only a few months left, \nit will be up to the next President and the next Congress to face these \nissues honestly and quickly.\n  For my part, I intend to make the case in the coming months that \nthere is a sensible role for Government to play in the regulation of \nmarkets, regardless of what some may argue to the contrary. Letting our \nprivate sector markets run amok can lead to excessive booms and \nbailouts, as last weekend's actions evidence.\n  There are two things that merit immediate attention. I have written \nto the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, Federal Housing \nFinance Authority Director Lockhart, and the incoming CEOs of Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac asking two things: First, it is unconscionable to \nreward the outgoing CEOs of these companies with golden parachutes that \nwill literally cost the taxpayers millions of dollars--some estimate \n$24 million--in farewell gifts; second, that we focus on restructuring \nthe mortgages owned or serviced by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Our goal \nneeds to be structuring mortgages so troubled homeowners can keep up \nwith their house payments and not lose their homes.\n\n  According to analysts cited in news coverage, the two ousted CEOs of \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac may be entitled to over $24 million as a \nfarewell gift from American taxpayers for running their companies into \nthe ground. With taxpayers across America now facing the burden of \npaying up to $200 billion in bailout costs for these agencies, I find \nthis unconscionable.\n  Income equality in our country continues to grow. Middle-class \nfamilies continue to work hard for paychecks that can't keep up with \nthe cost of living. Yet compensation for senior executives has risen \ndramatically over the last 8 years.\n  My colleague, Senator Jim Webb, not that long ago, in response to the \nState of the Union Address, noted that in the 1960s the CEOs of major \ncorporations made 20 times more than the average worker. Today, they \nmake 400 times more than the average worker. That means that literally \neach day a CEO works, he makes more than the average American worker \nmakes in a year. How can we be asked to enshrine this inequity with \ntaxpayers' dollars? We are being asked to reward incompetence and to \nlavish millions of dollars on the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nwho have failed in their assignment. A worker who doesn't do his job \nwill be given a pink slip, but a failed CEO of Fannie Mae or Freddie \nMac is given a multimillion-dollar windfall.\n  I understand that both of these individuals were brought on the job \nto try to save failing agencies, but it is also true that in the case \nof the head of Fannie Mae, Daniel Mudd, he was paid $11.6 million as an \nincome last year as Fannie Mae was headed into the tank. Mr. Syron, \nRichard Syron, who headed up Freddie Mac, was paid $18.3 million last \nyear and given stock options. It turns out those stock options have \nbecome almost worthless. The fact is that they are still being \nrewarded--unless we do something--with farewell gifts and golden \nparachutes as they leave.\n  When Mr. Mudd took over Fannie Mae some 4 years ago, the shares were \ntrading at $70. On Friday, the day the news of the possible takeover \nstarted to leak out, Fannie Mae shares were trading at $7. On Monday, \nthe shares closed at 73 cents.\n  Freddie Mac had its own accounting problems when Mr. Syron took over \nin December of 2003. The company was forced to admit it had inflated \nits earnings by nearly $5 billion. Like Mr. Mudd, Syron--who had served \nas a chief executive at other companies before--had been brought on \npledging to fix the company and get it back on track. Freddie's shares, \nwhich traded for about $55 when Mr. Syron took over in 2003, dropped to \nabout $5 last Friday and then to 88 cents on Monday.\n  You don't have to be a subscriber to the Wall Street Journal to \nrealize these two men failed in their assignments. Given 3 or 4 years \nto right the ship and steady the course, they failed. Yet, in their \nfailure and departure, they are asking for a rich reward--literally \nmillions of dollars to be paid by the taxpayers. That, to me, is \nindefensible. That is why I have joined others in Congress, including \nSenator Obama, Senator Reid, and Senator Schumer, in writing to the \nTreasury Secretary and the head of the Housing Finance Authority and \ntelling them to stop the\n\n[[Page S8223]]\n\ngolden parachutes for Mr. Mudd and Mr. Syron.\n  However, there is more that needs to be done. Last Sunday, Secretary \nPaulson called me to explain what was going to happen with Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac.\n  I told him I didn't know what else he could do. To allow these two \nhousing giants to fail could literally cause reverberations across the \neconomy, hurting many innocent companies, shareholders, and workers. I \nthought we had to step in. We had no choice. But it is not enough. To \nride to the rescue of Bear Stearns, as our Government has, or to the \nrescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as we have, is, of course, an \neffort to avert a worse disaster. But there are literally hundreds of \nthousands of small-scale disasters taking place every day, which still \nevidence a serious problem in the American economy. I am speaking, of \ncourse, of foreclosures. Despite the passion this administration has \nfor making sure corporations survive bad times, they don't have a \nsimilar passion for families facing foreclosure.\n  The letter I have written to the Treasury Secretary calls on him, as \npart of this restructuring of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to at least \nconsider a helping hand for those facing foreclosure.\n  When IndyMac Federal Bank was taken over by the FDIC in July, the \nFDIC instituted a systematic plan to refinance troubled mortgages to \nhelp those homeowners avoid foreclosure. It set up strict criteria for \nthose who would be eligible. It would not help speculators but those \nwho had their homes at stake. It initiated restructurings for all of \nthe mortgages that qualified. However, when it comes to the other \nmortgages across America, I am afraid there is a sad story to tell, \nwhere there has been a failure to refinance, a failure to create \nopportunity for people to stay in their homes. Foreclosure is a \ndisaster for any family facing it, but it is also a disaster for their \nneighbors. The value of my home in Springfield, IL, has diminished \nbecause some of my neighbors have gone through foreclosure. Of course, \nit affects the overall housing market. It affects whether people will \nbuy or build homes. Unless this cloud is removed from our housing \nmarket, then one of the pillars of the American economy has been shaken \nand may crumble.\n  That is why we have called on the Treasury Department and this \nadministration to step in as part of restructuring Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac to avert foreclosures. Now, the Mortgage Bankers \nAssociation--the group that brought us this subprime mortgage \ndisaster--has been arguing not just for months, but for years, that \nvoluntary efforts by financial institutions are enough, that these \nbanks will come forward and help these families. But there is no \nevidence of that whatsoever; foreclosures still are occurring at a \nrecord historic rate.\n  We cannot expect to emerge from this weak and failing economy until \nwe address the root cause, which is the failure of the housing market. \nThe Bush economic and tax policies have brought us to this disastrous \nmoment--this moment where we have a Tax Code that rewards the \nwealthiest instead of helping middle-income families, a moment where \nthe administration rushes to the rescue of the big banks but forgets \nAmerican families who are struggling to keep a roof over their heads, \nstruggling to protect the only asset they have in life against an \neconomy that is making it difficult for them to survive.\n  Foreclosures continue to skyrocket. We have set a new record high in \nthe last quarter, according to the Mortgage Bankers' own data. The Hope \nNow Alliance, which is run by bankers with the support of this \nadministration, is supposed to be riding to the rescue. But they don't \nrequire banks to do anything to help homeowners, but just gives them \n``guidelines.'' Let me tell you something: Guidelines will not save a \nhome. Guidelines will not avoid foreclosure. Guidelines won't keep you \nout of bankruptcy. That is what many homeowners are facing.\n  We tried, unsuccessfully, to convince this Senate and this \nadministration to allow those homeowners facing bankruptcy and \nforeclosure to have one last chance in the bankruptcy court, to let the \ncourts sit down with the bank and the family and try to find a way to \nkeep them in their home. It was rejected. The ``sanctity of the \ncontract'' is what we were told, we cannot violate the sanctity of the \nmortgage contract. Why, that would be unconscionable. It would shake \nthe very foundations of the private sector economy in America.\n  But what happened last week? What happened to the sanctity of the \ncontract when our Government and taxpayers rode to the rescue of Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac? We decided there was a greater good. The greater \ngood was stabilizing this economy, averting a disaster if these two \nagencies failed. We said we would step in and do something \nextraordinary for the good of America. Why is it we will step in with \nbillions of dollars for the good of America when it comes to major \nbanks and major financial institutions but consider it anathema, \nunacceptable, heretical to step in when it comes to helping a family \nsave a home?\n  That is the difference in the thinking here. When it comes to the \npriorities of this administration in Washington, those at the top, \nwhether it is the banks or the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they \nalways come out fine. They are always going to find themselves at the \nend of the day quite comfortable. But when it comes to helping working \nfamilies--middle-income families who are struggling to get by--the \npolicies of this administration have not been kind.\n  This Hope Now Alliance still won't report to the public how many \nfamilies are receiving real mortgage relief, through a reduction in \nwhat is owed. We can assume that not many are getting help. Now that \nFannie and Freddie have been taken over by the Government, we can do \nsomething about it. These companies need to systematically restructure \nmortgages so we can prevent as many foreclosures as possible. Everyone \nwins if we do that. Families get to stay in their homes, taxpayers \nspend less money covering foreclosure losses, Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac reduce their future exposure to failed loans, and it is the right \nand smart thing to do. As our economy continues to struggle, we should \ntake advantage of every opportunity we have to step in and help.\n  Saving the taxpayers from overpaying failed CEOs and helping families \nstay in their homes and avoid foreclosure are two such opportunities. \nIn this letter, I have urged the administration to seize both \nopportunities.\n  On November 4, the American voters will have a chance to speak to the \nrecord of this administration, to decide whether we are going to make \nthe change in Washington that is needed to steer a different course, to \nbring, I hope, a stronger economy. Many of us believe the strength of \nthat economy and future of that economy is with the working families of \nthis country, the middle-income families who struggle every day, pay \ntheir taxes, try to keep gasoline and groceries available, pay for \ncollege education and health expenses, and are having a hard time \ngetting by. There hasn't been enough sensitivity in the actions and \npolicies of this Congress or this administration when it comes to these \nfamilies.\n  The fact is we have a chance in this election to change things in \nWashington, to bring some new thinking, some new priorities, and some \nnew values. Those values don't include multimillion dollar golden \nparachutes for failing CEOs, or putting banks as a priority above \naverage working people who have always been the strength of this \ncountry. I certainly hope we have that opportunity and seize it on \nNovember 4.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to visit about an issue we \nhave all been talking about for some time: energy. In fact, truth be \nknown, we have been talking about energy for over 30 years in this \ncountry, since the first energy crisis in the early 1970s.\n  Over the August recess, I had the opportunity to go around the State \nof Montana--I logged hundreds of miles on my vehicle--and talk with \nMontanans virtually from all over the State about energy and our \nNation's energy future. Every visit to the great State of Montana is \nanother reminder\n\n[[Page S8224]]\n\nto me that many of the best ideas--if not all of the best ideas--are \nfound outside of Washington, DC. From a dairy farm in western Montana \nthat converts cow manure into enough electricity to power that farm and \nits neighbors through hydrogen fuel cells that keep the lights on in \ncollege classrooms, to a generator that turns tree bark into \nelectricity, Montanans are finding innovative ways to meet their energy \nneeds. That can not only help Montana, but it can help the whole \ncountry's energy future.\n  It is no wonder, as I traveled around the State, as we see in \nMontana, gas prices a little under $4 a gallon, and as we see winter \ncoming in and the potential of a cold winter and the potential for high \nheating oil and natural gas prices, that Montanans are very concerned \nabout their energy future.\n  This fall, over the next few weeks, we have an opportunity to address \nthis country's energy future both in the short term and in the long \nterm. Hopefully, we will address it. Hopefully, we can put the \npartisanship away. Hopefully, we will be more concerned about energy \nfor this country's citizenry than about who is going to win the next \nelection.\n  Back in 1978, one of the other times we had energy problems in this \ncountry, Montana put out this book. It says 1978 on the bottom, and it \nis called ``Montana's Energy Almanac.'' This book contains information \nabout oil and gas and coal. It also contains information about \nelectricity transmission, solar power, geothermal, renewable energy, \nand a myriad of other issues. This book could have been written in \n2008. The fact is we had a format to move forth with this country's \nenergy future, and it didn't happen. We had the ability to develop a \nlong-term energy plan for this country, and it didn't happen--30 years \nago, it didn't happen; a generation ago, it didn't happen.\n  We need to make it happen this fall. It is critically important for \nthis country. It is critically important for this Nation's security. As \nwe come forth with an energy plan over the next few weeks, it will \ninclude drilling, make no mistake about it, and it should. Also \nremember this: It is not going to significantly decrease the prices at \nthe pump right now. That doesn't mean it is the wrong thing to do. It \nis the right thing to do, because the truth is that if we can take our \nreliance off of places such as Venezuela, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, \nthat is a good thing. You also must note that, right now, we are \ndrilling. In fact--and I have stated this before on the floor--right \nnow, it would be difficult to find a rig in the United States to punch \na hole for gas or oil, because they are already doing that. If you are \nlucky enough to find a rig, you would be hard pressed to find the \ncasing to put in that hole once it is drilled.\n  The truth is we need to drill, and how much we drill will probably \ndepend upon the availability of rigs and casings, and right now they \nare being used up. Drilling is part of the plan. We also need to invest \nin renewables, because drilling should be a bridge. We talk about \nbridges, but we never talk about where that bridge is going to go. It \nwill go to nowhere unless we invest in renewables such as solar, wind, \ngeothermal, biofuels, and cellulosic ethanol, and it is critically \nimportant for our long-term energy future. So we need to invest in \nthose things by a myriad of ways.\n  My colleague in the Senate, Max Baucus, has a bill that will do \nexactly that. That bill needs to be a part of the Energy plan to invest \nin solar, wind, geothermal, biofuels, cellulosic ethanol--the list goes \non and on--because there is tremendous opportunity out there. We need \nto invest in R in clean coal, battery technology, hydrogen \ntechnology, high-mileage cars, hybrids, and electric. We need to \nencourage innovation in R It will happen because it is happening on \nthe ground in places such as Montana now. We need to encourage the \ninnovation.\n  As this book said on all these issues, we also need to invest in \ntransmission. We need to invest in the grid. If we are going to get \nelectricity to consumers in a way that makes sense, in a way that is \nefficient and cost-effective, we need to invest in transmission.\n  Finally, and potentially the most important of all these points, we \nneed to eliminate the redtape. A few years ago, we eliminated the \nredtape for gas and oil companies. We need to do the same thing for \nrenewable energy. The agencies have been understaffed and, quite \nfrankly, it occupies a lot of time now to get a project through.\n  We have a Montana-Alberta tie line project to move electricity from \nMontana to Alberta and from Alberta back to Montana with renewable \nenergy on that line. It has been 3 years in progress. The redtape needs \nto be eliminated.\n  I will be introducing a bill to cut through the redtape and encourage \nthese kinds of renewable energy projects because, for the long-term \nfuture of this country, it is absolutely what we need to do.\n  In closing, I wish to say this: Oil is hovering around $100 a barrel \nright now. It has backed off somewhat. Back in the seventies, we saw \noil peak and then back off, and this book was put on the shelf and \nnever looked at again, and probably every State in the Union had a book \nsuch as this.\n  The truth is, we have an opportunity right now to address this issue \nfrom a short-term and a long-term standpoint. This issue is not going \nto go away. We have 3 percent of the reserves. We use 25 percent of the \noil. We need to figure out not only ways to maximize our own oil \ncapacity but also how we are going to take renewables into the future \nand other energy sources into the future so it makes sense for this \ncountry and its consumers and this country's security.\n  As I said earlier, with countries such as Venezuela, Russia, and \nSaudi Arabia determining our energy future, that is no way to run a \ncountry. We need to address our energy problems, and we need to do it \ntogether today by all of us giving a little bit to find common ground \nto move forward.\n  As we move across the next 57 days to the election, we ought to \nforget about it. We ought to forget about the election and do what is \nright for this country and develop a short-term and long-term energy \nplan that addresses current demand, future demand, affordability, and \nsustainability. Thirty years from now, I don't want to see a Senator \nstanding up on this floor holding this book up saying: In 2008 we had \nthis same problem, and we need to deal with it today.\n  We need to deal with it now in 2008, this fall. We cannot blow this \none.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday the CBO gave us their estimates \nof what the deficit is going to be and what the deficit for next year \nwill be, and it is not good news. The deficit has more than doubled. It \nis projected now to be $407 billion. That is up from about $160 \nbillion. That has all occurred under the leadership of this Democratic \nCongress. Obviously, the administration takes significant \nresponsibility, but the Congress, under the law, under the \nConstitution, controls the purse strings, and the Congress has the \ncontrol over the check writing of the Government. As a result, the \nfirst responsibility for fiscal restraint and fiscal discipline is with \nthe Congress, and it has failed that test.\n  It is hard to imagine how the deficit could jump this much in this \nshort period of time. Most people will say it is the result of the \nwar--or people on the other side will say that. It is not. This jump in \nthe deficit, to the extent it was controllable from the Federal \nGovernment's standpoint--in other words, it wasn't caused by the \nslowdown in the economy--was purely a function of increased spending on \nnondefense--not purely but was significantly increased by spending on \nnondefense activities and a dramatic increase in spending.\n  The problem is that not only is this deficit now at $400 billion and \ngoing up\n\n[[Page S8225]]\n\nunder this Congress, but the outyears are even more severe that the \nrisk for us as a nation is even more dramatic from the standpoint of \nfiscal policy because looming over the horizon is the problem with \nentitlement spending which will expand dramatically as the baby boom \ngeneration retires and where we already know there is more than $60 \ntrillion of unfunded liability.\n  What has this Congress's response been to this situation? It is the \nworst record in the last 20 years. One appropriations bill--one \nappropriations bill--freestanding, has been passed in the last 2 years, \nthe Defense appropriations bill last year. There have been Omnibus \nappropriations bills passed. Then this year, we are going to pass, it \nlooks like, not an Omnibus appropriations bill but simply a continuing \nresolution; a complete abdication, a complete abandonment of the budget \nprocess, of the responsibility--the first responsibility of the \nCongress, other than defending the country--of setting up a fiscal \nprocess for managing the taxpayers' dollars has occurred under the \nleadership of this Democratic Congress. It is truly the worst record in \nthe last 20 years. Nothing like this has happened where so much that \nCongress is supposed to do has not been done. No appropriations bills \nhave been brought to the floor of the Senate, and no appropriations \nbills have passed the Senate and the House. None. We are supposed to \npass 12 bills. None have been passed.\n  The debt has gone up over $1 trillion, $1 trillion added to the debt \nin the last 2 years. The deficit has doubled, and yet there has been no \neffort at all not only to do the day-to-day responsibility of managing \nthe Government, which, after all, is the responsibility of the \nCongress, by passing appropriations bills, but to address the issue of \nthe looming crisis in our entitlement accounts--no effort to address \nentitlement reform or even at the margin to try to control the rate of \ngrowth of entitlement programs. Even the most simple ideas which are \nreasonable and could have been accomplished have not been pursued, \nideas such as making wealthy people pay for some portion of their Part \nD premium.\n  Today, Warren Buffett, who qualifies for a drug benefit under \nMedicare, does not have to pay for any of that or pays only a marginal \namount of that cost compared to what he should be paying as a high-\nincome individual. That adjustment has been ignored. Ideas such as that \nwhich make sense that would at least save us some money have not even \nbeen brought forward; zero effort in the area of Medicare reform, in \nthe area of Medicaid reform, and in the area of entitlement reform by \nthis Congress, zero effort in the area of controlling spending. Not one \nprogram has been reduced, not one program has been eliminated, not one \nprogram has been adjusted downward. Everything has gone up and up and \nup. Thousands of earmarks have been proposed, thousands--7,000 or \n11,000, I have forgotten the number. Senator Coburn knows it off the \ntop of his head. But it is so many you can't even keep track of them.\n  It is a true dereliction of duty by this Democratic Congress the way \nthe fiscal house of this country has been managed. They do debt, they \ndo deficits, and they do nothing, and they deserve a D minus when it \ncomes to managing our fiscal house.\n  It is unfortunate because all these costs which we are running up \nrepresent radical increases in borrowing which means dramatic burdens \nfor our children and our grandchildren as they have to pay these bills \nwhen they come due in the outyears instead of paying as we go, which is \nthe appropriate way to proceed with spending. We are simply borrowing \nfrom our children.\n\n  In fact, the pay-go rules, which were supposed to discipline \nspending, have been waived, adjusted, and gamed time after time to the \npoint where over $399 billion under this Congress has been spent or put \non the books as an obligation which should have all been subject to a \npay-go point of order. But those pay-go points of order have been \nadjusted, waived, or gamed so they did not even get raised or, if they \ndid get raised, they got run over by the majority in this Congress.\n  So the rules which this Congress put in place to try to discipline \nspending and which we so often hear chest beating about from the other \nside of the aisle--I am for pay-go--have been eviscerated. I call it \n``Swiss-cheese go.'' It has no relevance at all any longer because the \nspending around here occurs in a manner which is profligate and there \nis no attempt to adjust spending to reflect revenues, to attempt to \nbring down the deficit. In fact, the deficit is now double.\n  It is not good news for the American taxpayer. Here we are in a \nsituation where we are facing some very serious fiscal times, and we \nought to at least be able to discipline our budgets in a more effective \nway. We ought to at least do the business of the Congress, which is to \npass appropriations bills which are within the budget rather than pass \nsupplemental emergencies which are outside the budget.\n  This is a problem, and it is a significant problem. It is brought \nabout in large part because this Congress has failed to do its job of \nmanaging the fiscal house or even taking up the bills which are \nsupposed to manage the fiscal house.\n  There is another subject I want to touch base on--I see the majority \nleader is here and as a courtesy, I will proceed to those comments so I \ndon't take up too much of his time--and that is the issue of the \nhighway trust fund needing to be replenished to meet obligations which \nit has incurred.\n  A little bit of history is important, if the majority leader will \nallow me to proceed briefly to outline the history.\n  We passed something called SAFETEA back in 1995. That bill set out \nhighway spending which was supposed to be paid for from the highway \nfund, which the highway fund is paid for by gas taxes. But that bill \nwas intentionally structured--intentionally structured--so that the \nspending would exceed the income. We knew one day during the term of \nthat bill--people thought it would be later in the process--the highway \ntrust fund would be spent out and there would be a problem.\n  Why do we know that? Because that bill included 6,000 earmarks \ntotaling $24 billion which we knew were not going to be able to be \ntotally paid for by gas tax revenues even if the gas tax revenues had \nmaintained themselves.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n  What happened was that the gas tax revenues have fallen because of \nthe increase in gas prices and the American people's appropriate effort \nto try to conserve their use of gasoline. So the day of reckoning has \ncome earlier, much earlier, than expected, but we knew there was going \nto be a day of reckoning because the bill was structured to fail. All \nthese 6,000 projects that were put in there, $24 billion of spending we \nknew was not going to work or be paid for under the present bill. So \nnow the suggestion is that rather than pay for them in a responsible \nway, we should raid the general fund, take that money and use it in the \nhighway trust fund.\n  The highway trust fund has always been a separate entity. The whole \npurpose of the highway trust fund was to fund highways and have them \nhave their own stream of revenues to fund them and to not commingle \nthose funds with the general fund.\n  The argument has been made--and it is a straw dog argument of the \nmost extraordinary level--that back in 1998, the highway trust fund \nlent $8 billion to the general fund, and they are just trying to \nrecover that now as an accounting event. That puts a whole new spin on \nthe concept of accounting. Even the people who did Enron's internal \naccounting would have found that one a hard sell. That was a movement \nin 1998 of nothing more than paper.\n  This event is a real addition to the Federal debt of $8 billion. This \nis real money; that had no real money involved. This has a real effect; \nthat had no real effect involved. So that argument is truly a straw dog \nargument put out there to try to legitimize a raid on the general fund \nin order to settle up the highway fund.\n  Now, I know I am going to lose this fight, and I am not trying to \nstop the fight. I am not trying to stop the event. I haven't suggested \nwe need 60 votes to go through this. What I have suggested--and I will \nask unanimous consent to accomplish this--is that we simply have two \namendments: One--mine--would put back in place pay-go rules and the \nByrd rule prospectively--so it doesn't even affect this event--so\n\n[[Page S8226]]\n\nthis doesn't happen again. Both of those should be disciplining events \non how we fund roads, and it is the right procedure. It is not an \noutrageous request to proceed that way. The other is the Coburn-DeMint \namendment, which says that any money that is taken out of the highway \nfund will be used for building roads or bridges, as I understand it, \nand not be used for things such as bike paths and basketball arenas.\n  So those are the two amendments; that those amendments be brought up, \ndebated, and voted on in a very short and very constricted timeframe \nand then we have a final passage vote. The majority leader has asked \nfor an amendment to his proposal, so if either one of these proposals \nwere to pass, it is going to go back to the House.\n  The argument that this is going to slow the process doesn't really \nhave legs because, first off, we may lose both our amendments, but even \nif we don't lose them, the majority leader has proposed a unanimous-\nconsent request which has an amendment in it, and that amendment will \npass because, in effect, it is an effective date amendment. But that \nwill send it back to the House and it will have to be done again, \nanyway. So as a practical matter, these proposals aren't going to slow \nthe process.\n  It does seem to me it is reasonable to have two amendments and then \nfinal passage or three amendments and then final passage rather than \njust one amendment and have final passage, and do it all within a \nframework that has a reasonable timeframe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8226-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8226-S8227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 6532\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance \nCommittee be discharged and the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 6532, the highway trust fund bill, under the \nfollowing agreement: that the Baucus amendment at the desk changing the \nenactment date be agreed to and the only other amendments in order be \nthe Gregg amendment on budget discipline and the Coburn on nonessential \nprojects, the text of which is at the desk, with 30 minutes of debate \non each amendment and 1 hour on the bill equally divided in the usual \nform. I further ask unanimous consent that upon disposition of the \namendments and following the use or yielding back of the time, the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote \non passage without any intervening action. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that no points of order be waived by virtue of this agreement.\n  So the maximum amount of time that would be involved here would be 2 \nhours, and then there would be a vote on final passage.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, the one thing \nI am not going to do is get into a debate on the Senate floor with the \nSenator from New Hampshire on the rules relating to the budget. He \nknows them inside out and upside down. The only person I know who is \nqualified to debate him on these issues is Senator Conrad. So his \namendment is something I am not going to discuss at all because, \nwithout in any way demeaning myself, I am not capable of doing that.\n  But I can say a few things about the Coburn nonessential projects \namendment. My friend, the junior Senator from Oklahoma, has held up \nscores of bills. His definition of nonessential is unique to him. For \nexample, we all know--we have been through it before--that he has held \nup the Lou Gehrig bill, which would allow a registry to be set up so we \ncould start doing research on this dread disease that is killing people \nas we speak. The Senator from Oklahoma has held up the Christopher and \nDana Reeve Paralysis Act, which is so important to people who are \nparalyzed. Postpartum depression--I don't know if anyone has had this \nin their family, situations where this disease has reared its ugly \nhead. It is very severe. A woman has a baby, and following the woman \nhaving a baby, she becomes emotionally unstable and needs help. We need \nto do research on this to try to find out what we can do to alleviate \nthis very serious problem. The Senator from Oklahoma has held that up. \nConquering childhood cancer--held up. Breast cancer research was \nstopped by Senator Coburn. The Emmett Till Unsolved Crimes Act--\nstopped. Child pornography prosecution--stopped. Enhancing child \npornography prosecution--stopped. Funding victims for torture--stopped.\n  So, Mr. President, I have great respect for my friend from New \nHampshire, but the President of the United States and his Cabinet \nofficer, the Secretary of Transportation, called me personally to say \nthey needed this legislation done Monday. They have said they want it \ndone Monday. They want it done now. All 50 States are facing a highway \nfunding crisis if we don't get this bill to the President's desk \nimmediately. His Transportation Secretary, Mary Peters, after opposing \nour efforts for months to do this, has stated that the crisis has \nbecome so severe that the bill needs to be on the President's desk no \nlater than Friday of this week. The Department of Transportation has \ntold us that by this Thursday, States will be reimbursed to the tune of \n62 cents on the dollar. That will mean immediate layoffs, immediate \nterminations of existing contracts.\n  We don't have time for debating frivolous amendments. The amendment \nmy friend talks about is one the President wants and can be completed \njust like that. We need to get this done. We need to pass the bill now \nwith an immediate implementation date so that our Governors and our \nhighway workers will know they will have the Federal funds they are \nowed. Anything short of that is playing Russian roulette with our \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, it speaks volumes that we are here, as we should be, \ntalking about how much money $8 billion is. Keep in mind that we want \nto take that money and put it in the highway trust fund to keep jobs, \nto keep people from being laid off, when yesterday it was announced by \nthe administration that we are going to have the highest deficit in the \nhistory of our country this year. Where is President Bush when we have \nbeen talking about these deficits for such a long time?\n  So, Mr. President, with all due respect to my friend, the senior \nSenator from New Hampshire, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, might I inquire of the majority leader----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator from New \nHampshire has expired. The Chair is informing him of that. This is the \nRepublican time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 \nminutes to enter into a dialog with the majority leader and that it not \naffect the 15 minutes that has been reserved for the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Might I inquire of the majority leader, 2 days ago, the \nmajority leader--yesterday--proposed a unanimous-consent request, and I \ndidn't note in that request that he had a recorded vote involved. Also, \nif I heard his statement correctly, if the Senator from North Dakota \nwere to agree to my amendment, would he be willing to place it into \nthis amendment?\n  Mr. REID. No. Mr. President, what I said is that I am not going to \ndebate these very complicated issues relating to budgetary matters with \nthe Senator from New Hampshire. I said the only person who I think is \nas knowledgeable of the budgetary provisions of the law and precedents \nhere in the Senate is the Senator from North Dakota. So I have every \nbelief that the Senator from North Dakota is not going to come and do \nthis, and I have an even stronger belief that the Senator from North \nDakota would not agree to what the Senator suggests.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, I suspect the Senator knows the position of the \nSenator from North Dakota well.\n  Mr. REID. I would also say this, Mr. President: I would be happy to \npropound a unanimous-consent request. My request, which I have done on \ntwo separate occasions--Monday and Tuesday, and now it is Wednesday--\ncalled for passage by unanimous consent with no rollcall vote. I would \nbe happy to change that so that we have a rollcall vote on this. That \nrollcall vote would be scheduled forthwith.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to talk to the majority leader \nabout that.\n\n[[Page S8227]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized under a previous order.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would request I be notified when I have \nused 12 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague from New Hampshire in \nraising some alarm--not intemperate, not hysterical alarm, but alarm \nnonetheless--about the recent reports that the Federal deficit has now \nrisen in excess of $400 billion. Of course, what that means is that the \nFederal Government continues to spend money it does not have, and I \nthink the American people are rightfully concerned that we are on a \ncourse of significant fiscal irresponsibility for which a tremendous \nprice is going to be paid by our children and grandchildren.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire mentioned the fact that here we are in \nSeptember, and this Congress, under the Democratic control conferred \nupon them in the last election, has yet to pass a single appropriations \nbill. I know that in the blame game--which in Washington, DC, is a \nworld-class sport--our colleagues on the other side of the aisle like \nto point to the President of the United States as the person \nresponsible for the high budget deficit. But the fact is that the \nPresident can't appropriate a penny of money. The President does not \nhave that authority under the Constitution of the United States. Only \nCongress can appropriate money, and Congress is the one that should \nbear the responsibility for this tremendous state of fiscal neglect and \nirresponsibility that brings us here today.\n  We also know that in this election season, Senator Obama, our \ncolleague from Illinois, has already proposed $350 billion in new \nFederal spending. The $400 billion deficit apparently is not enough to \nsatisfy Senator Obama. He wants to spend $350 billion more in new \nspending. And these are not on existing spending programs, this is new \nspending. Over 5 years, his proposals would cost almost $1.7 trillion. \nWell, I have to tell you that in the 5 weeks I was back in Texas \ntraveling the State and listening to my constituents, the last thing \nthat was on their to-do list for us here in Congress was to come up \nwith new ways to spend their money. What they wanted was for Congress \nto accept the responsibility that goes along with the privilege of \nholding the offices we hold and to actually do something about the \nproblems that confront our Nation when it comes to fiscal \nirresponsibility.\n  It is a troubling sign that our deficit has ballooned from $161 \nbillion to more than $400 billion. Yet what do we find out yesterday or \nthe day before but that the Federal Government is now going to have to \ntake over, in essence, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. This move could \npotentially cost taxpayers as much as $200 billion more on top of the \n$400 billion deficit.\n  Since the 2006 election, Democrats have been in control. And this \nyear alone, spending has increased by 8.3 percent. Now, I don't know \nany business, I don't know any family who increased their spending 8.3 \npercent from last year to this year. Only the Federal Government--\nwhich, of course, prints money, which is then added to the deficit and \nthe bill passed on to our children and grandchildren--only the Federal \nGovernment could get away with that.\n  Regarding the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debacle, no one actually \nknows how much this bailout is going to cost the American taxpayer. I \nhave very serious concerns whether the poor investment decisions of the \nCEOs and the shareholders should be guaranteed by the paychecks of \ntaxpayers.\n  As a matter of fact, I think they should not be. While they were \ngranted a backstop against catastrophic losses, certainly the taxpayers \nwere not there to share in the profit during the heyday of those \nGovernment-sponsored enterprises. And the most disturbing to me is that \nthe collapse of Fannie and Freddie was, in all likelihood, contributed \nto by corrupt actions of its corporate officers.\n  As a matter of fact, in May of 2006, a report by Fannie Mae's \noversight authority, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise \nOversight, noted that:\n\n       By deliberately and intentionally manipulating accounting \n     to hit earnings targets, senior management maximized bonuses \n     and the executive compensation they received at the expense \n     of shareholders.\n\n  Now, there was an investigation into these corrupt practices. But, \namazingly enough, there were no criminal charges pursued, only civil \nfines against the top three corporate officers. So while three \ncorporate officers overstated Fannie Mae's earnings by approximately \n$10.6 billion, they have been given a slap on the wrist and no real \nsense of accountability, no accountability in any sense of the word.\n\n       We know they contributed to what ultimately happened by the \n     Treasury Secretary using the power Congress conferred in him \n     to essentially take over and bail out these two enterprises.\n\n  I have written a letter to the Attorney General of the United States \nasking him to conduct a criminal investigation into the activities of \nthe corporate officers and anyone else who may have contributed to the \noverstatement of assets on the books of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and \nto make sure a thorough criminal investigation is undertaken and that \nthose responsible for violating any of the criminal laws of the United \nStates be held accountable.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter to the \nAttorney General be printed in the Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska.) Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. What the American people want in Washington is \naccountability. And what they see is dysfunction and no accountability. \nIf there is one thing I heard from my constituents in Texas as I was \nthere during the month of August is that no one is happy with what is \nhappening in Washington, in Congress in particular, not Democrats, not \nRepublicans, and certainly not me.\n  I think to see, for example, a $400-billion-plus deficit, a bailout \nof Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that is going to cost probably somewhere \non the order of $200 billion, and then to hear Speaker Pelosi in the \nother body talk about a second stimulus bill which is going to, of \ncourse, increase Government spending, spending money we do not have and \npass that debt along to our children and grandchildren, I wonder \nwhether Congress has lost leave of its senses entirely, because there \nseems to be absolutely no recognition of our fiscal responsibility \nhere. I point to the fact that there has actually been an effort to try \nto figure out how to eliminate wasteful spending projects. The Office \nof Management and Budget has done a review of about 1,000 Government \nprograms and actually concluded that about 22 percent of them were \neither ineffective or else they could not tell whether they were \neffective.\n  In other words, out of 1,000 Government programs chosen by the Office \nof Management and Budget, 22 percent were either found ineffective or \nelse it was impossible to say whether they were effective. I do not \nknow which is worse, whether they are ineffective or whether you do not \nhave the information to tell one way or the other.\n  What Congress needs to do as it sets about spending more money is not \ngrow the size of Government and raise taxes or else pass the bills down \nto our children and grandchildren, Congress needs to start cutting \nineffective programs. That is why I have introduced a bill that would \ncreate a sunset commission like the sunset commission in many States, \nincluding mine, which would actually periodically review Federal \nGovernment agencies and programs and cut wasteful or ineffective \nprograms.\n  That is the kind of commonsense, practical, bipartisan solution the \nAmerican people are crying out for, but apparently in vain, because \nCongress persists down this road of fiscal irresponsibility, and there \nis no apparent end in sight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8227-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8227-S8228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. Presient, I know we are going to be moving to the \nDefense authorization bill. I want to speak briefly on an amendment \nwhich I intend to offer called the Military Voter Protection Act. I \nbelieve the right to vote is one of the most precious civil rights we \nhave as American citizens. Yet the scandalous fact is that last \nelection, in 2006, out of all of\n\n[[Page S8228]]\n\nthe eligible military voters and civilians overseas, only 5.5 percent \nof those eligible to vote and who actually tried to cast a vote had \ntheir vote counted--5.5 percent.\n  Now, if this were to happen in any city, in any town, any State here \nin our country, there would be a major public outcry. There would be \nnewspaper headlines, and investigative reporters would be scrounging \nfor information finding out who is denying the most basic civil right \nto American citizens that we have, which is the right to vote.\n  But for some reason nothing is done, either by the Department of \nDefense or the Department of Justice or by the Congress to make sure \nthat those men and women who are deployed in harm's way have the \nopportunity to register to vote, and to make sure that when they do \nvote, their ballot is actually delivered back and counted on a timely \nbasis.\n  This is something that I think all of us would support on a \nbipartisan basis, the Military Voting Protection Act. I intend to bring \nit up this morning with both the bill managers, Senator Levin and \nSenator Warner. I hope I will be permitted an opportunity----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 12 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair. I hope I will be given an opportunity \nto call up this amendment and to have it voted on. I worry a little bit \nbecause of the fact that the majority leader has filled the amendment \ntree, and that there is some question whether amendments will be \nallowed on this bill.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, as is the \noccupant of the chair, I am usually familiar with the fact we are on \nDefense authorization bills for a matter of a week or more, usually 2 \nor 3 weeks, and it is usually a much amended bill because of the public \ninterest in this particular piece of legislation.\n  I am worried that the majority leader is trying to compress all \nactivity into this 1 week and we will not have an opportunity to offer \nimportant amendments such as the Military Voting Protection Act, which \nI have described, which I will come back to the floor and describe more \nthoroughly.\n  After a very bad year here in the Senate, we still have about 2\\1/2\\ \nweeks in order to pull the chestnuts out of the fire and actually \naccomplish some very important things by passing a Defense \nauthorization bill, including protecting the voting rights of our \nmilitary deployed overseas.\n  We have a chance to stand up for fiscal responsibility by actually \npassing some appropriations bills and by considering high energy prices \nand how those are affecting average Texas families and families all \nacross this country, and driving up the cost of food and other \ncommodities as well.\n  We actually have an opportunity, by eliminating the moratorium on \noffshore oil exploration and production, to produce more American \nenergy so we do not have to send $700 billion a year overseas to other \ncountries in order to buy something which we have an abundance of right \nhere at home, as much as 3 million additional barrels a day right here \nin the United States, if Congress would simply become part of the \nsolution rather than becoming part of the problem, which it has been by \nannually passing an appropriations bill rider banning drilling and \nexploration and production in the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  Last year, there was an amendment to an appropriations bill that \nwould actually ban rulemaking and exploration and production of oil \nshale out in Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming, which has enormous capacity \nto produce a lot more American energy at home.\n  And then, of course, there is ANWR, where 2,000 acres, right in the \nmiddle of a desolate part of a 19-million acre refuge in Alaska, harbor \nuntold amounts of oil, American oil, that would obviously, if produced, \nmake it possible for us to buy less from countries that in some cases \nwish us harm and not well.\n  This is a national security problem. It is an economic problem not \nonly for our country but for every hard-working family. I hope Congress \nwill do what it has not done in the preceding months and actually act \nin a bipartisan way to solve some of these problems which I mentioned \nin a way that hopefully would make our constituents proud of us rather \nthan disdainful, which is demonstrated, of course, by the historic low \napproval rating which Congress now--I was going to say enjoys, but \ncertainly we do not enjoy that--now suffers.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2008.\n     Hon. Michael B. Mukasey,\n     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear General Mukasey: The recent government takeover of the \n     Federal National Mortgage Association (``Fannie Mae'') and \n     the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (``Freddie Mac'') \n     raises serious concerns whether a well-documented culture of \n     corporate executive corruption at these organizations \n     contributed to the mortgage giants' collapse. I request that \n     the Department of Justice begin a new, full-scale \n     investigation into accounting fraud and other corrupt \n     practices perpetuated by top executives--and coordinate \n     efforts with the Department of Treasury and other regulatory \n     entities to determine to what extent any illegal activities \n     led to the institutions' failure. The public deserves a full \n     understanding of the events surrounding the failure of Fannie \n     Mae and Freddie Mac and, furthermore, corporate executives \n     must be held accountable to the American people.\n       In May 2006, a report by Fannie Mae's oversight authority, \n     the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), \n     noted that ``[b]y deliberately and intentionally manipulating \n     accounting to hit earnings targets, senior management \n     maximized the bonuses and other executive compensation they \n     received, at the expense of shareholders.'' The investigation \n     into illegal accounting practices resulted in fines levied on \n     Fannie Mae and three of its top corporate officers--but no \n     criminal charges. While the three corporate officers who \n     overstated Fannie Mae's earnings by approximately $10.6 \n     billion may possess some form of prosecutorial immunity, it \n     is imperative that there is accountability for each and every \n     fraud perpetrated upon shareholders and the public. Moreover, \n     the efficacy of prior investigations by OFHEO and Justice are \n     further called into question in light of evidence of \n     disturbing allegations of active interference on the part of \n     Fannie Mae lobbyists. According to the OFHEO report, Fannie \n     Mae ``sought to interfere'' with the OFHEO investigation by \n     petitioning Congress to conduct a separate investigation of \n     OFHEO. Furthermore, they allegedly lobbied Congress to cut \n     OFHEO's funds for failure to fire the top official \n     responsible for investigating Fannie Mae.\n       As the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is debated, it \n     is essential for Congress to shine more light on the culture \n     of corruption that plagued these institutions. But federal \n     prosecutors and regulators also must vigorously investigate \n     these institutions with the utmost urgency. Shareholders--\n     indeed, all taxpayers--are entitled to a critical examination \n     of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in light of the huge costs they \n     are forced to bear as a result of the mortgage companies' \n     demise.\n       Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Cornyn,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield the floor and yield back any remaining time we \nhave, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 3001, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3001) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2009 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities for the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 5290, to change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 5291 (to amendment No. 5290), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on Armed \n     Services with instructions to report back forthwith, with \n     Reid amendment No. 5292 (to the instructions of the motion to \n     recommit), to change the enactment date.\n\n[[Page S8229]]\n\n       Reid amendment No. 5293 (to the instructions of the motion \n     to recommit to the bill), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 5294 (to amendment No. 5293), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Levin (for Leahy/Byrd) amendment No. 5323, to provide for a \n     suspension of certain statutes of limitations when Congress \n     has authorized the use of military force.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5323\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from \nMichigan on the Senate floor, the chairman of the committee, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama, a key member of the committee. I \nwill speak on the Wartime Enforcement of Fraud Act. This was introduced \nlast night. It is one I hope the Senate will wholeheartedly accept.\n  For more than 5 years, America has been fighting wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. In fact, we have been there longer than we were in World \nWar II. But efforts to investigate contracting fraud during these wars \ncontinue to lag. Part of the reason is not because the authorities \ndon't want to find out whether there has been fraud, but it is \ndifficult to uncover fraud when you are in a shooting war and conflicts \ncontinue.\n  The problem is not new--this has happened before--and the solution is \nnot new. Current law extends the statute of limitations for contracting \nfraud offenses during wartime to address this problem. In other words, \nif fraud has occurred, you have a certain statute of limitations. We \nwould simply extend it. This commonsense law was passed by Congress \nduring World War II with the support of President Roosevelt. A similar \nprovision was passed in World War I. Those were wars in which we were \ninvolved for less time than we have been involved in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Current law only applies to declared wars and not to \ncircumstances where Congress only authorizes the use of military force \nrather than officially declaring war. So the extension of the statute \nof limitations doesn't apply to the ongoing wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  The bipartisan Wartime Enforcement of Fraud Act will close that \ntechnical loophole. It will apply the law that we already have on the \nbooks, but it will apply it not only to declared wars but also to the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I was pleased to join with Senator \nGrassley of Iowa earlier this year to introduce this legislative fix, \nand the Judiciary Committee reported this measure before the August \nrecess. With each passing day, we are losing the legal authority to \nprosecute fraud in Iraq and Afghanistan because the existing law that \nextends the statute of limitations does not apply to these wars.\n  We have an obligation, no matter whether one is for or against the \nwar in Iraq, to protect the public interest and certainly to protect \ntaxpayer dollars during times of war. This simple amendment will allow \nus to do so. We have done that in past wars. Iraq and Afghanistan \nshould be no different.\n  We have well-documented reports of fraud and abuse, as we have seen \nin other wars. When we are spending billions of dollars, often in a \nhurry, it is an open invitation for people to put their own interests \nahead of the interests of the country, and those people who then \ndefraud our great Nation at a time of war should be punished for it. \nThey should not be let off the hook. Too many brave men and women are \nputting their lives on the line in Iraq and Afghanistan. Too many \nbrave, patriotic Americans are doing everything they possibly can over \nthere, risking and often losing their lives every day. We should not \nallow those who want to make money out of their sacrifice and defraud \nthe Government to get away with it. The bill being paid by the American \ntaxpayers for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is high enough. As in \npast wars, Congress should do all it can to ensure their money is not \nlost to waste and fraud.\n  I hope Senators will join in this effort. This is not creating a new \ncrime. It is simply saying those who do commit crimes, who do defraud \nAmerica, who do defraud people who are over there serving our country, \nought to be punished. I find it hard to think Members would disagree \nwith that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy for his amendment \nand his interest in dealing with a difficulty that has impacted real \nlife. Contractors should be held to account, and there is difficulty in \ngathering the evidence necessary in a prompt way in a time of conflict \nto effectively carry out prosecutions--I can see as a former Federal \nprosecutor--within the time of the statute of limitations. There is \nonly one concern I have about it, and I will address that in a moment.\n  But, fundamentally, the Senator is correct. We have discussed this a \ngood bit in the Judiciary Committee, where Senator Leahy is chairman. \nWe did the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act that I sponsored \nand led the first one of those. We do have to be careful because it can \nhave unintended consequences.\n  The trial of a marine in California for an act in Iraq that he was \nacquitted for just a few days ago resulted from the bill that we \npassed. I don't think any of us at the time thought that we were \nsubjecting military persons to a civilian trial when we were dealing, \nwe thought at the time, with defense contractors. We need to be careful \nas we deal with the issue. I know Senator Leahy agrees with that. For \nthe most part, I understand and support what he is attempting to do.\n  The statute of limitations is an important principle of law. It is \nsomething as a Federal prosecutor, as attorney general of Alabama, I \nhad to deal with on many occasions. My colleagues probably know that an \nindividual who commits armed bank robbery, if he is not prosecuted \nwithin 5 years, cannot be prosecuted. If a person commits arson, they \ncan't be prosecuted. It is not from the time of discovery of the \noffense, it is from the commission of the offense because we are \ntalking about criminal law. We have a great heritage of understanding \nthe difficulties faced when we put somebody in jail based on old \nevidence that is somewhat difficult to deal with.\n\n  With regard to civil actions, we have a number of statutes of \nlimitations that commence on discovery of the wrong, but for the most \npart, except for murder, certain crimes, I think for almost all crimes \ndealing with death and maybe one with child sexual abuse, there is a \nlimited statute of limitations.\n  The statute of limitations on most crimes in the Federal court, even \nserious ones, is 5 years. I do believe during the debate that we \nextended the statute on S fraud to 8 years. The truth is, these \nsavings and loans would go bankrupt 4 or 5 years after the crime was \ncommitted. Then it takes 2 or 3 years to investigate it. By then the \nstatute had run, and you have, red-handed, defrauding the people, and \nyou couldn't prosecute the case. I understand the difficulties we are \ndealing with here.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We also have the case that most jurisdictions are under a \nstatute of limitations. If you have a crime within a jurisdiction, but \nthen the person flees to escape prosecution, the statute does not run \nin that circumstance. While this is not on all fours, when you have a \nwar situation where people are shooting each other, it is very \ndifficult to go over and just gather the evidence.\n  The Senator is absolutely correct. The bank robbery that occurs, you \nknow it occurred at that moment. Somebody came in, put a gun to the \nteller's face, and stole the money and left. The investigators \nimmediately start investigating the crime. Because of the person's \njurisdiction, you have to investigate the crime and arrest them within \nthe 5 years. Here the difficulty is investigating the crime when many \ntimes it is hidden. The crime is hidden, using the savings and loan \nexample. I am simply trying to do what we did in World War II and World \nWar I--I don't recall whether we did it in Korea or not--in past wars. \nI have a reluctance to give any cover to those who defraud us. We have \nso many contractors over there who are putting their own lives on the \nline, playing by the rules, doing everything right. They should be \ncommended for that. We have others who try to take advantage of this \nsituation when others are putting their lives on the line and sometimes \nlosing their lives. We ought to nail them. I think we ought to nail \nthem very hard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I agree. That is why we have passed the Military \nExtraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, why\n\n[[Page S8230]]\n\nwe have expanded it, under the leadership of the chairman. I supported \nmaking sure that contractors were fully covered from the original act \nbased on a crime that came to my attention where a young person was \nsexually molested and the host country didn't want to prosecute it and \nthey couldn't be tried and court-martialed because the person was a \ncontractor, not a military person. We made that possible.\n  Since we are in a world in which some of these authorizations to use \nmilitary force may be very long indeed, it is determined not by what we \ndo so much as by the actions of the enemy; that is, if they continue to \nattack us, I think our authorization of military force will continue \nmany years perhaps. If the conflict ends, it could be ended sooner. So \nwe could be in a position, just as a matter of law, of limiting the \namount we are exposing a contractor to of criminal prosecutions for \nsomething that happened many years before, when actually in the fog of \nwar, sometimes it is more difficult to handle things correctly. It \nwould be certainly more difficult to gather evidence, and it is more \ndifficult to get witnesses here and that kind of thing.\n  My suggestion would be that we do as we did with the statute of \nlimitations on S fraud but have some sort of definite end to it \nbecause some of these extended wartime efforts could go on for a number \nof years. I don't see as a matter of principle, not specific facts, why \na contractor who commits fraud in the United States gets the protection \nof a 5-year statute, even if it is against the Department of Defense, \nbut one in Iraq, in the chaos of war that even affects them--their \nability to maintain discipline over their workers is sometimes more \ndifficult, frankly--that they would be prosecuted with an unlimited \nstatute of limitations. That is something we could discuss, and I ask \nthe Senator to think about it. I don't take any fundamental objection \nto the work he is doing. It is fundamentally sound and good, and I \nsupport it.\n  I will say this, if I could: In Toussie v. United States, the Supreme \nCourt held:\n\n       The purpose of a statute of limitations--\n\n  Which I want to say is available in all cases, for all kinds of \ncrimes, except very few, such as murder--\n\n       The purpose of a statute of limitations is to limit \n     exposure to criminal prosecution to a certain fixed period of \n     time following the occurrence of those acts the legislature \n     has decided to punish by criminal sanctions. Such a \n     limitation is designed to protect individuals from having to \n     defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may \n     have become obscured by the passage of time and to minimize \n     the danger of official punishment because of acts in the far-\n     distant past. Such a time limit may also have the salutary \n     effect of encouraging law enforcement officials promptly to \n     investigate suspected criminal activity.\n\n  The Court has further held:\n\n       Passage of time, whether before or after arrest, may impair \n     memories, cause evidence to be lost, deprive the defendant of \n     witnesses, and otherwise interfere with his ability to defend \n     himself. . . .Possible prejudice is inherent in any delay, \n     however short; it may also weaken the Government's case. . . \n     .Such a [statute of] limitation is designed to protect \n     individuals from having to defend themselves against charges \n     when the basic facts may have become obscured by the passage \n     of time and to minimize the danger of official punishment \n     because of acts in the far-distant past. Such a time limit \n     may also have the salutary effect of encouraging [cases to be \n     prosecuted promptly].\n\n  But I will say that is the only concern I have. I thank the Senator \nfor raising this issue. It will definitely close a loophole.\n  I would note I had the honor last night to be on an airplane coming \nback from Alabama sitting by a young individual who served 2 years as a \ncontractor in Iraq. He is going back for a third year. We talked about \nsome of these things. I did not know this amendment was coming up. But \nhe talked about that some of the people do not perform very well. Many \nof them are very hard working. Many of them are former military people \nwho served with great distinction.\n  But in this time of war, some people do lose their discipline, and \nfraud is a matter of real risk. We do need to watch every penny, and we \ncertainly do not need to have unscrupulous contractors billing the \nAmerican people for work they do not perform, for making false claims \nto the Government. I think a statute of limitations probably needs to \nbe extended in this case.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is an important amendment that \nappropriately recognizes the United States is now engaged in combat \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan without a formal declaration of war. \nThe amendment takes the appropriate step of modifying the statute of \nlimitations to cases in which the use of force has been authorized \nwithout a formal declaration of war.\n  I very much welcome--and I am sure Senator Leahy does as well--the \nsupport of the Senator from Alabama. I do not know of anybody else who \nwants to speak on this amendment. Unless the Senator from Alabama does, \nI will suggest then that we move on to the next amendment.\n  I understand there is going to be a unanimous consent request that \nmay interrupt that flow, but before we get to that, if the Senator from \nAlabama knows of no other--first of all, let me ask the Senator whether \nhe does know of any other speaker on the amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am not aware of any.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the Senator willing to have this amendment voice voted \nat this time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to discuss that a little more with Senator \nLeahy, and perhaps he will convince me that my suggestion is not wise, \nso I would object at this time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. All right. If we could get the yeas and nays on this \namendment so we could move on.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand, under the current order, we \nwould now be moving to consideration of the Vitter amendment regarding \nmissile defense for 2 hours of debate. Those who are interested in that \namendment are urged to come to the floor so we could begin that debate. \nBut at this time I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Government Spending\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I heard, this morning, the majority leader \ntalk about the objection to the request by Senator Gregg. I do not \nbelieve there is anybody in this body who does not want us to fix the \nhighway trust problem, and it will probably be the fact that there will \nbe no amendments offered at the direction of the majority leader, which \nI think is probably somewhat tragic because we would not be able to \nhave the debate we need to have on this issue.\n  But it should not be lost on the American public that some $16 \nbillion in the last highway bill was not for roads, bridges or \nhighways. One of the amendments that was going to be discussed, had we \nhad the opportunity to amend it--which we are not because the majority \nleader is not going to grant that opportunity--was the idea that of the \n$8.5 billion we are going to put in there, no new projects ought to be \nstarted unless they are for roads, bridges or highways. In other words, \nwe should not be building museums. We should not be building parking \ngarages. We should not be doing ancillary work that does not have \nanything to do with true transportation needs associated with the trust \nfund. That was the only amendment we were going to offer.\n  All the States are going to be at a significant disadvantage if we do \nnot do this. But I found it somewhat curious that before we left we had \nan omnibus bill that had to spend $10 billion. We had to do it. We were \ncontrasted as terrible because we did not agree with it. Now we have $8 \nbillion, and we want to do it, we want to debate it, and we are not \ngoing to be allowed to debate or amend it. I would think that is to the \ndetriment of the body, that, again, we are losing the history of this \nbody, we are losing the deliberative nature of the body, and at the \nwhim of the majority leader, because we have an emergency, we have to \nhave a unanimous\n\n[[Page S8231]]\n\nconsent, we do not even have to have a vote, and that is the only way \nwe can do it. I think it hurts the institution in the long run.\n  As far as what Senator Reid said about the omnibus package he put \nforward, let me correct the Record. First of all, the childhood cancer \nbill was agreed to by unanimous consent. It was not even a part of that \npackage he claimed it was. The irony is, as we heard from the majority \nleader's statement today his disdain for the largest deficit in \nhistory, do you realize the President of the United States cannot spend \none penny unless we let him? If there is a deficit in this country, it \nsays a whole lot more about this body and the House than it says about \nthe President. We are the ones who approve the spending.\n  So far, this year, we are going to spend off-budget about $270 \nbillion. Where is that money going to come from? It is going to come \nfrom the next two generations paying it back. So I find it curious we \nhave to have a bill that spends $10 billion and then we are critical of \nthe deficit and now we have to have a bill that is going to spend $8 \nbillion, but we cannot have any amendments and we cannot debate it in a \nthoughtful way and still get it done this week. We could get it done in \nless than 2 or 3 hours.\n  It shows you the lack of consistency. To be fair, Senator Reid has a \nvery difficult job. This is a hard place to manage, there is no \nquestion about it. But we are getting on the edge of a lack of \nfairness. We are getting very close to an edge where the traditions of \nthe Senate are going to be thrown out the window.\n  As we look at it, as Senator Reid complains about the deficit, I \nwould remind that he sponsored $531.2 billion worth of new spending in \nthe 109th Congress. So far, he has sponsored $56.7 billion in the first \n8 months of 2007. So it is another $150 or $200 billion in this \nCongress. We cannot continue to have more and more new spending without \ngetting rid of some of the spending that is not effective.\n  So when we have the claims that we are disgusted with the deficit, \nand then we can have $500-plus billion sponsorship of new spending and \nroutine votes against an earmark moratorium, against the idea of \nstealing money from Social Security to spend new money, against \namendments that say we have a moral obligation to offset the cost of \nnew spending so we do not charge it to our children, against \nprioritizing the reconstruction of Louisiana bridges instead of \nearmarks in Alaska, these are the votes of Senator Reid.\n  So the disdain for the--and I have three pages of them by the way, \nall similar. So the fact is, our country is in trouble right now. We \nare going to have a trillion-dollar--a trillion; that is with a ``T''--\ndeficit next year. We have $382 billion worth of documented waste and \nfraud every year in this Government. We have not had one amendment to \nget rid of any of it in this body this year that has passed, save the \nhippie museum in New York. That is it. We saved $1 million out of $380 \nbillion of waste, fraud, and duplication.\n  So it rings hollow to come down and complain about the administration \nwhen they cannot spend one penny we do not send to them. We are at \nleast as culpable and liable as the administration in terms of this \ndeficit. To say we cannot debate and clean up the priorities of the \ntransportation fund by saying it is going to be spent on some of the \n240,000 bridges that are in desperate shape in this country and spend \nthe money on highways and roads and bridges and not other things that \nbenefit Members of this body but do not benefit the majority public and \nare outside the transportation goals of every State transportation \ndepartment in this country rings hollow.\n  There are a lot of great things we can do. We can help people with \ndisease. We can solve problems. He mentioned the Emmett Till bill. He \nobjected twice to a compromise that the Emmett Till board had agreed \nto--twice--that Senator Dodd had agreed to, that Senator Biden had \nagreed to. As far as the child pornography, Senator Dodd and Senator \nBiden had agreed to that too. It was offered as a unanimous consent \nrequest twice. Both had agreed to it.\n  Is this about politics or is this about doing things for the country? \nI would tell you the evidence shows it is about politics. We need to \nwake up. Our country is at a crossroads. We had Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac \ntaken over. The first number, of course, is low: $200 billion. It is \ngoing to be $600 or $700 billion that we are going to charge to our \nkids for the mismanagement of those two agencies. That is going to get \nadded next year. We are getting ready to do another emergency \nsupplemental that everybody is piling things on. It is going to be $50 \nor $60 billion. It is going to be another free-for-all. It is going to \nfly through here in spite of my votes against it. We are going to do \nanother stimulus package--none of it we have the money for. We are \ngoing to borrow every bit of it. We are compounding to make the \nproblems worse. Because we will not work on the $350 to $380 billion \nworth of waste, and we would not even put an effort out toward that, we \nare going to continue to see a downward spiral in our economic position \nin this world.\n  So I would think most Americans, as we add $8.5 billion back to the \nhighway trust fund, would want us to see that it goes for highways, \nbridges, and roads, not for earmarks, special pork projects that make \nus look good at home that are outside the boundaries and the priority \nlists of the State departments of transportation. That was the \namendment I was going to offer. I knew I was going to lose, but we \nought to have the debate.\n\n  The fact is the majority leader does not want us to have the debate. \nWe could dispense with the bill in less than 3 hours, be done with it, \nand it could be going to the President, but we have decided we want to \nmake it political. It is not about what is best for the long-term \ninterests of this country, but about what is best for the upcoming \nelection in November. To me that is a disservice to this body and it is \na disservice to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER.

Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues, Democrats as \nwell as Republicans, to come together on this important amendment to \nensure that we have robust, full missile defense capabilities in this \nera of real threat, real uncertainty from terrorists, rogue nations, \nand others.\n  Tomorrow is September 11. It will mark the 7-year anniversary of one \nof the most tragic days in our Nation's history--a day in which 19 \nradical Islamic extremists believed their actions could cripple this \ngreat Nation. The good news is that those 19 extremists were wrong. \nRather than cripple our Nation, they focused our Nation on the threat \nwe face. They brought our Nation together with new resolve and with new \nstrength. They gave our generation a new central and defining challenge \nto work to prevent any future attacks, particularly on our soil, and to \nmake sure that terrorists and rogue nations never acquire weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  As part of facing this clear and present danger, the American public \nunderstands that we need a robust missile defense system. According to \na national poll released today by MDAA, 87 percent of Americans believe \nthe United States should have a robust missile defense system--the \nhighest percentage of support ever recorded. The poll also showed that \n58 percent of Americans believe there is a real threat from missiles \ncarrying weapons of mass destruction, and that missile defense is a \npreferred option over preemptive military action.\n  Rogue nations, regardless of sanctions or disarmament deals, continue \nto pursue ballistic missile technology capable of one day carrying \nnuclear weapons, and this poses an enormous threat. On July 9 of this \nyear, Iran tested nine ballistic missiles as part of their escalation \nin terms of military exercises and political rhetoric, and they are a \nclear example of this threat I am talking about. Currently, the United \nStates has fully operational, deployed missile defense systems that can \nstabilize the region that Iran sits in--the Middle East--but we need to \nmake sure we have the full capability to bring to bear to do this. In \nthis situation, missile defense can stabilize a situation, can provide \nenormously important defense for our country and for our allies, and \ncan avoid much more widespread war. That is the reason 26 countries of \nNATO have fully endorsed this missile defense plan, with a third site \nin Europe. It is the reason the Czech Republic agreement on missile \ndefense is valid and is moving forward. It is the reason why 11 \nCongresses and 4 U.S. Presidents have moved forward on this important \npart of our national defense. The Vitter amendment No. 5280 will move \nthat part of our national defense forward in a significant way.\n  What does it do specifically? Specifically, this amendment provides \n$271 million to the Missile Defense Agency so that it responds to near-\nterm--very near-term--ballistic missile threats to the United States, \nour deployed forces around the world, and our allies. This amendment is \nfully offset within the bill.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee itself noted in its committee \nreport that the Joint Capabilities Mix Study conducted by the Joint \nStaff concluded that the United States needs about twice as many THAAD \nand Standard Missile 3 interceptors as the number currently planned. So \nwe need twice as many as what is currently planned. Yet, at the same \ntime, the committee unfortunately cut $411 million from the budget of \nthe Missile Defense Agency. This Vitter amendment would reinstate $271 \nmillion of that cut. It would do that in four areas in particular:\n  Aegis cruisers. It would authorize $54 million to accelerate upgrade \nwith an additional two Aegis cruisers to equip it with ballistic \nmissile defense systems.\n  It would authorize an additional $100 million for THAAD fire units 3 \nand 4 interceptor and ground component advanced procurement.\n  SM-3 Block 1B risk reduction. It would authorize another $30 million \nto reduce SM-3 Block 1B schedule and technical risks.\n  Targets. It would authorize $87 million to implement a rolling target \nspare and maintain minimal inventory to have full targets for our \ntesting and production capability.\n  This is sorely needed so that we ensure our citizens that we have the \nmissile defense deployed that we need in this very dangerous world.\n  Again, this concept was first developed by President Reagan when the \nCold War was still raging, when the Soviet Union was still our primary \nthreat in the world. Obviously, the world has changed in fundamental \nways since then, but it has only changed in ways that make missile \ndefense even more important than ever before, because the threat from \nrogue nations, from terrorist States, and from terrorist groups has \ngrown enormously and missile defense is even more important in light of \nthat growth.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to come together in light of that on the \neve of September 11, on the eve of the seventh anniversary of that \ntragic attack on our Nation. We must restore this $271 million, at a \nminimum, in this bill to the Missile Defense Agency. As I said, the \ncommittee itself noted that the Joint Chiefs report says the United \nStates needs about twice as many THAAD and Standard Missile 3 \ninterceptors as the number currently planned. Yet the committee cut \n$411 million from that missile defense budget. We must restore at a \nminimum this $271 million to continue to meet this vital need for our \ncitizens' safety.\n  With that, I yield to the distinguished Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to support \nSenator Vitter's amendment to authorize the additional $271 million \nwhich is fully offset--it is fully offset--to the Missile Defense \nAgency.\n  The importance of missile defense is increasingly crucial to the \nsafety of the United States and our allies. The United States must \nmaintain the capability to respond to near-term ballistic missile \nthreats that present grave danger to the United States, our deployed \nforces, and our allies.\n  We know that rogue nations such as Iran and North Korea will have the \ncapability to use nuclear weapons. We cannot escape the fact that this \nwidespread proliferation of ballistic missile technologies makes it \nincreasingly possible for dangerous States and terrorist organizations \nto obtain and use them for harm.\n  We are in a crucial time in our Nation's history and we should \nunderstand the importance of defense of the homeland. I am frustrated \nthat as other nations continue to develop nuclear programs, that as \nRussia has demonstrated a renewed capacity for aggression, that as \nChina and North Korea press forward on missile technology, the Armed \nServices Committee cut more than $411 million from the administration's \nrequest for the Missile Defense Agency's program.\n  The United States has worked hard to reach agreements with the Czech \nRepublic and Poland to establish ballistic missile defense radar sites. \nThis was a monumental and important step\n\n[[Page S8233]]\n\nin our efforts to protect the United States as well as our NATO allies \nfrom the growing threat by the proliferation of ballistic missiles. \nRadar will provide precision tracking of ballistic missiles launched \nout of the Middle East and will be linked to other U.S. missile defense \nfacilities in Europe and the United States. Cuts to our missile defense \nprogram simply undermine this progress and signals to NATO that the \nUnited States is backing away from our commitments to a European \nmissile defense.\n  This amendment will authorized $54 million to accelerate and upgrade \nan additional two Aegis cruisers to equip with ballistic missile \ndefense systems.\n  Admiral Hicks, program director for Aegis BMD, recently stated the \nneed for additional Atlantic fleet ships for defense of the United \nStates, our allies, and our deployed forces.\n  The amendment will authorize an additional $100 million for THAAD \nfire units interceptor and ground component advanced procurement. It \nwill authorize an additional $30 million to reduce SM-3 schedule and \ntechnical risk. This is the premier missile defense cooperation program \nwith our Japanese allies. And it will authorize $87 million for a \ntarget spare and to maintain minimal inventory as contingency for \nadditional short notice test events for the Ground Based Midcourse \nDefense. This is Missile Defense Agency's top unfunded priority. The \nSASC Committee report notes that for some MDA systems the Director of \nOperational Test and Evaluation requires additional tests to prove out \ncapabilities, which necessitates additional target sets.\n  There is no doubt that the United States will continue to face \nmissile threats. Missile defense is needed and should have been made a \npriority of this committee and by this Senate. I thank Senator Vitter \nfor bringing this amendment to the floor, and I urge this Senate to \nvote yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I, too, very strongly support the amendment \noffered by Senator Vitter. This is an amendment that restores only part \nof the funding that was cut from the missile defense programs--only \n$270 million of the $411 million that was cut--and it is targeted to \nvery specific things that have near-term applicability, and that \nenables us to do more testing, which has been the only criticism of \nwhich I am aware of the Missile Defense Program--that we need to do \nadditional testing. Part of this money, as I will discuss in a moment, \ngives us the ability to conduct some of those tests.\n  So the key point is, we are talking about near-term ballistic missile \nthreats to the United States. This isn't some long-term, pie-in-the-sky \nproposition. It would assist both our allies and also U.S. forces \ndeployed abroad as well. It is common sense. I hope it receives wide \nbipartisan support. I believe there is bipartisan support for this \nissue.\n  Let me discuss, first, a little about what some of the near-term \nthreats are. They are both from belligerent nations and, as we will see \nin a moment, one from a country in particular that is not yet capable \nof communicating appropriately with its forces, with the result that \nthere is a threat of accidental or unauthorized launch. We sometimes \nforget that. We are consumed with North Korea and Iran, and therefore \nwe appreciate the fact that we have to have some capability of \nprotecting ourselves and our allies from potential threat from those \ncountries. But one of the reasons President Reagan first thought it \nwould be a good idea to have a missile defense system is, he said it is \nmoral. Not only does it give an alternative to massive retaliation \nagainst an enemy, but it also provides protection in the event there is \nan unauthorized or accidental launch.\n  In the early days of missile development, that was not at all outside \nthe realm of possibility. With what happened to the Soviet Union when \nit broke up, that possibility was raised again. Now, as we note in the \ncase of China, developing sophisticated weapons, but without the \ninfrastructure to control those weapons, there is again the potential \nfor an unauthorized or accidental launch, not to mention the situation \nwith countries such as North Korea or Iran. We are not just talking \nabout a threat of belligerency but also the potential for an accident, \nand missile defense, of course, is the primary way of defense against \nan accidental launch.\n  Just to summarize briefly, there are now 27 nations that have \nballistic missile capability. We tend to think of Russia, China, North \nKorea, Iran, and maybe a few other countries, but 27 nations have \nballistic missile capability, and the knowledge to build and use them \nis proliferating rapidly. Much of this is because countries such as \nNorth Korea are willing to sell missiles, such as the Scud which Iraq \nused, and they then develop their own types of missiles with that \ntechnology. But there are 27 countries. We will not be able to put that \ngenie back in the bottle. Talk about Iran.\n  Some people say, well, the launch of all of these missiles earlier \nthis year they took pictures of and then doctored the pictures might \nhave been clumsy and didn't demonstrate new technology. It did \ndemonstrate that Iran wants to be part of the club of nations with \nballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction capability. They \nhave that capability. There is no question they have it. The only \nquestion is, how far beyond Israel does its capability currently go?\n  As the latest IAEA report informed us, the Iranian missile threat is \nreal and growing. I mentioned North Korea. With the difficulty of \nknowing who is in charge of North Korea today, we need to be concerned. \nWe don't even know if the ``dear leader,'' or however he is referred \nto, is still alive or is functioning as the leader of the country. As a \nresult, that country that has nuclear weapons, other weapons of mass \ndestruction, and the means to deliver them by ballistic missiles that \ncan even reach the United States ought to be a matter of concern for \nus.\n  Fortunately, the United States had made operational our first land-\nbased system just before the big July 4 launch a couple years ago by \nthe North Koreans. We could have defended against that test launch had \nwe had to do so, but with very rudimentary capability. The intelligence \ncommunity ``deems that North Korea is nearly self-sufficient in \ndeveloping and producing ballistic missiles and is willing to provide \nthem to existing and new customers.'' Some of these are capable of \nreaching the United States. So you have a real and growing threat from \na country that is clearly not stable.\n  I mentioned China. It has for a long time had the capability of \ndelivering weapons of mass destruction to the United States with its \nballistic missiles. There is an interesting new twist. The 2008 annual \nreport on the People's Republic of China raises serious questions about \nthe potential for an accidental or unauthorized launch. This is a \nnation which, by the way, is increasing its arsenal of ballistic \nmissiles. In addition to that, it has a very robust program to \nmodernize its nuclear weapon warheads. So it has the combination of the \nwarhead and improved capability. This report says China has problems \ncommunicating with its submarines at sea. This is very dangerous, with \na navy that has no experience in performing strategic protocols of the \nkind Russia and the United States have performed for years. What's \nmore, the land-based strategic missile forces ``face scenarios in which \nmissile batteries use communication links with higher echelons and \nother situations that would require commanders to choose alternative \nlaunch locations.''\n  The bottom line is, whatever you think about a potential threat from \nan enemy, you have to be concerned about protecting against an \naccidental or unauthorized launch. Missile defense is the way to do \nthat. As a result, I hope those folks who say, well, China isn't an \nenemy of the United States today, would at least acknowledge while that \nmay be true, it is also true it has the capability of harming the \nUnited States accidentally or in an unauthorized fashion, and missile \ndefense is our only way to protect against that. I think it would be an \nawful situation if something like that were to occur and the United \nStates Congress would be asked by our constituents: Did you all know \nabout this?\n  Well, yes.\n  Did we have the ability to do something about it?\n  Yes.\n\n[[Page S8234]]\n\n  How much did it cost?\n  Not all that much, as these numbers reflect.\n  And you didn't put into place a program to protect us against that?\n  I think we ought to put this program into effect. I support the \namendment of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Let me describe again what specifically is in the amendment to assure \nour colleagues that this is not some massive expansion or pie-in-the-\nsky proposition. It authorizes funding, first, for the advanced \nprocurement of two THAAD fire units. That is the terminal high altitude \narea defense, the near-term threat--our capability of meeting that \nthreat.\n  Second, risk reduction for the development of an advanced version of \nthe SM-3 missile--that is kind of a standard critical missile in the \nU.S. inventory--additional target sets to respond to additional testing \nrequirements set by the Defense Department's Director of Operational \nTest and Evaluation.\n  Frequently, the concern is expressed: Well, we should not be moving \nforward with missile defense programs because we have not adequately \ntested yet. These are, of course, programs that have been tested a lot. \nThey are the near-term threats. But to the extent that the Department's \nDirector indicated there are additional tests that could be done, this \nprovides the target sets for those tests. You cannot conduct the tests \nwithout it. For those who criticize the program for not having enough \ntests, this is the sine qua non for getting tests done. You have to \nsupport this.\n  The amendment also authorizes funding to accelerate upgrades of two \nadditional Aegis cruisers to equip with the ballistic missile defense \nsystems. This is something that I think virtually everybody in \nCongress, and certainly at the Pentagon, is supportive of--the ability \nof the Aegis cruisers to carry this defense to other parts of the globe \nso that it can more readily respond to a launch. This would be the \nperfect way of responding to that accidental launch I mentioned.\n\n  Admiral Hicks, the program director for the Aegis BMD program, stated \nthe need for additional Atlantic fleet ships to keep a presence there \nas well. That would defend against a threat from a country such as \nIran. The Armed Services Committee, in its report accompanying the \nbill, stated the joint capabilities mixed study, conducted by the joint \nstaff and combatant commanders, concluded that the United States needs \nabout ``twice as many THAAD and standard missile interceptors as the \nnumber currently planned.'' This doesn't by any means fulfill that \nentire requirement, but it lays the foundation for doing so. I think \nthat is another critical reason for this amendment.\n  As I said, the committee cut $411 million from the budget of the \nMissile Defense Agency to procure these systems. I don't understand why \nthe committee would both acknowledge the need for additional missiles \nand then cut the items out. I understand the committee has a lot of \ndifferent constraints, different needs, and it is difficult to satisfy \neverybody. You have to cut somewhere. But I think my colleagues would \nagree that the relatively modest increase that the Vitter amendment \nprovides is for very specific things, recognized by the committee \nitself, recognized by the combatant commanders, as needed. There is \nnothing new here or nothing that is pie in the sky. These are things \nthat are required. We need them now.\n  With regard to the testing, if the criticism is that we need more \ntests, this provides funding for those tests.\n  Mr. President, it is a commonsense amendment. It is limited. It is \nall backed up; all of the requirements are fully supported. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment. There is a lot going on in this \nworld. Unfortunately, when you are doing something as complex as \ndeveloping missile defense systems, there is a long lead time. It takes \na lot of technology and testing and so on. So you cannot wait until the \nlast minute to put this into effect. That is why this should be carried \nforward in the authorization for this year's defense programs.\n  I commend the committee for its work. It basically acknowledged the \nneed for these things. I appreciate that it sometimes has to make cuts. \nI ask my colleagues to recognize this is an area in which we cannot \nafford to try to do it on the cheap. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Vitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to respond to the \nSenator from Arizona, who is my friend. But I want the Senator to \nunderstand that the committee did not cut THAAD nor the Aegis. To the \ncontrary, the committee raised, for the very reasons the Senator from \nArizona said--that we need more THAAD for our area commanders--we \nraised that $115 million, as well as the Aegis ballistic missile \ndefense. We raised that $100 million from what was requested. So let's \nmake sure we know what we are talking about.\n  Mr. President, what this all boils down to is the National Missile \nDefense Program is requested by the administration for $9.3 billion of \nauthorization in this bill. In essence, this whole argument is that the \ncommittee has pared back that $9.3 billion request by $400 million.\n  That is what all this argument is about. It is an attempt to increase \nback that funding of a de minimis cut in a $9.3 billion program. Given \nall the other requirements we have in the U.S. Government and given all \nof the other requirements we have in the Department of Defense, should \nwe have a modest decrease from the President's request of $9.3 billion \nin 1 year?\n  I suggest that there are so many other demands. Think about body \narmor. Think about getting the V-shaped hulls of MRAPs that are so \nresistant to the improvised explosive devices they run over on the road \nand that are saving marines' and soldiers' lives. Ask any commander in \nIraq or Afghanistan what are their high priorities. Ask the commanders \nif THAAD, which is an intercept that can be launched from a mobile \nlauncher, is an important program to them to intercept an incoming \nintermediate-range missile and you will get a quick answer from those \nmilitary-area commanders that is what they want.\n  That is the philosophy we have tried to adapt in this bill and at the \nsame time allow national missile defense research to continue but \nrecognizing there are other priorities besides national missile \ndefense. So we just took a de minimis cut out of a $9.3 billion request \nby the President. That is what all of this flap is about here: Is \nnational missile defense going to have a minor cut so that we can do \nsome of these other priorities for protecting our troops and satisfying \ntheir commanders' requests? That is what all this is about.\n  The Vitter amendment proposes to cut $271 million from the rest of \nthe Defense Department and add it to the Missile Defense Agency. This \nis not funding that the Defense Department has requested. These are \nprograms that are fully funded in our Armed Services Committee bill. \nBut this amendment would give the Secretary of Defense an extraordinary \nand unwarranted power; that is, the power to cut any items in the \ndefense budget that the Congress is putting in here in order to pay for \nthis increase in an already flush national missile defense budget we \nhave provided.\n  As the chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee, I can tell you that we \nhave some of the Nation's most sophisticated weapons systems, many of \nwhich we cannot even speak about here because of their classification. \nThis is not a good allocation of priorities.\n  I don't think we would want to give the Secretary of Defense the \nauthority to ignore the will of Congress.\n  For example, would we want the Secretary of Defense to be able to go \nin and, in order to fund this amendment, cut body armor or would we \nwant him to be able to go in and cut what the commanders in Afghanistan \nnow are begging for--more of these V-hulled vehicles, which replace the \nhumvees, that are saving our boys' and girls' lives called the MRAPs? \nOf course, we don't want that.\n  Would we want the Secretary of Defense to have the authority to go in \nand cut $271 million from the $430 million in the bill for sustaining \nthe Joint Strike Fighter, its alternate engine which the Department \nsupports? Of course, we wouldn't want to give the Secretary power to do \nthat.\n  Would we want to give the Secretary the power to go in and totally \nwipe out the additional $118 million we provided\n\n[[Page S8235]]\n\nin this bill for operating a full B-52? The Department opposed that. \nWould we want to give the Secretary the ability to override the will of \nCongress to do that?\n  How about the F-22, the most sophisticated fighter aircraft? Would we \nwant to give the Secretary of Defense the power to go in and cut half \nof the $500 million we have provided in this bill for advance \nprocurement of the F-22? I don't think we would want to do that, but \nthat is what we would do, is give the Secretary the power to do that if \nthis amendment is adopted.\n  Would we want to give the Secretary the power of reducing the Army \nbudget request of $512 million for the Patriot missile? Talk about \ncountries and allies and force protection for our own troops of \nincoming warheads--the Patriot missile is a quick-reaction missile that \nintercepts those incoming missiles on our troops in a theater. Would we \nwant to cut the increase we provided in this bill? This amendment would \ngive the Secretary the power to do that.\n  Would we want to eliminate the proposed addition of $170 million for \nadvance procurement of another amphibious ship called the LPD-17? I \ndon't think that is what we want to do, but that is what this amendment \nis going to do, all under the ideology that we haven't provided enough \nfor national missile defense. But we have provided almost $9 billion in \nthis bill for it.\n  We have to set priorities and we have to allocate for programs that \nwe want to make sure are there for the protection of our troops and our \nallies, and that is what we tried to do. Didn't we have a unanimous \nvote coming out of the committee for all of these priorities? We did. \nSo why do we want to suddenly change the unanimous, bipartisan support \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee to adjust all of these \npriorities? Why would we want to change that? Because there are some \npeople who say ideologically we want to pour more and more money into \nnational missile defense. Isn't $9 billion enough for 1 year?\n  This Senator respectfully requests that the Senate listen to reason \nand common sense in the allocation of priorities. The committee \nrecommends already--as I stated to Senator Kyl, we have added $215 \nmillion for THAAD, which is the terminal high-altitude aerial defense \nwhich commanders are requesting, and we have also added that total \namount of money, including the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Program, \nwhich is launched from a ship and is very effective for incoming \nwarheads.\n  We certainly agree there are potential threats from North Korea and \nplaces such as Iran, but those threats are generally in the \nneighborhood of where they are. That is why Aegis from a ship is so \neffective, and that is why THAAD from a mobile platform is so \neffective. We have plussed up those programs. They shouldn't be cut. \nBut the Secretary of Defense, under this amendment, would have that \nauthority.\n  The Vitter amendment would not make any choices about where the \nadditional money to provide for this plus-up to an already rich and \nrobust national missile defense budget would come from. This amendment \nwould not make any choices about where that additional money would come \nfrom. So what it says is that this $271 million in additional funding \nfor missile defense, programs that we have either fully funded at the \nlevel requested by the Pentagon or increased in our committee bill by \n$215 million--that program is so important that the Secretary of \nDefense could cut any other funding program in the Pentagon to pay for \nit. I don't think that is a responsible way to go.\n  This Senator, as the chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee, will \noppose the amendment. It is my hope that Members on both sides of the \naisle, members of the Armed Services Committee, will support the \ncommittee product.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me respond to a couple of points that \nwere made, and then Senator Vitter wishes to make some additional \ncomments.\n  The Senator from Florida suggested that I have said that THAAD was \ncut. I don't believe I said that. What I did was quote from the Armed \nServices Committee in its report on this bill in which it is stated \nthat the Joint Capabilities Mix Study, conducted by the Joint Staff and \ncombatant commanders, concluded that the United States needs ``about \ntwice as many THAAD and Standard Missile-3 interceptors as the number \ncurrently planned.''\n  My point was that by what the Senator from Florida calls a de minimis \nand minor cut of $411 million--I guess only in the Senate could someone \nconsider $411 million de minimis money. That is a lot of money, and it \nis taken out of the Ballistic Missile Defense Program. I guess what the \nSenator was saying is that cut doesn't hurt the THAAD Program or the \nAegis Program. The committee referred to the study which said we need \ntwice as many THAAD and Standard Missile-3 interceptors, and part of \nwhat this add-back does is enable the military to acquire some more of \nthose missiles.\n  I didn't suggest they had cut it. What I said was they didn't meet \nthe requirement they themselves identified in the committee report, and \none of the things the amendment does is add money for those two items.\n  The other two points I would like to make are these:\n  No. 1, we provide that the Secretary of Defense does have the ability \nto fund this out of some programs. The Senator from Florida says this \nis extraordinary power. No, it isn't. This is the way it is frequently \ndone. And I am not going to assume the Secretary is going to make \nirresponsible decisions about where he would get the money. Some of the \nitems the Senator from Florida mentioned--MRAPs and body armor--are not \nin the program from which the Secretary could get the money to offset \nthis $271 million. So that is not a response.\n  Finally, those people who support these requirements, those of us who \nhave supported the Vitter amendment, take some exception to the \nreference to this amendment as an ideological amendment. If it is \nideological, then the committee's report is ideological because we are \nquoting from the committee report and saying we would like to fulfill \nthe requirements which the committee report said existed and which the \ncommittee did not fully fund. If that is ideological, so be it. If that \nis intended to be a pejorative term, I take exception to it. If it is \nideological to protect the American people from an accidental or \nunauthorized launch of a ballistic missile, then I guess maybe my \nposition would be ideological.\n  I call it common sense to try to restore some of the $411 million \nthat was cut for programs that the military says it needs, the \ncommander who says he needs the additional Aegis cruisers, for example, \nthe additional SM-3, the additional THAAD missiles that are needed. It \nseems to me that you can argue over whether, in view of all of the \npriorities, this is a priority that should be funded, but you cannot \nsay it is not a priority or that the committee and the military don't \nbelieve it is important or that it somehow is ideological when the \ncommittee and the Pentagon and the Navy, in the one case, for example, \nhave all said these are items that need to be done.\n  Finally, with regard to those people who say: Well, we never have \nenough testing, we are trying to respond to that criticism by saying: \nAll right, in order to have tests, you need the equipment for the test. \nPart of what this amendment does is to restore funding for those items.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I would say to my good friend \nfrom Arizona, first of all, recognize how much we have spent on \nnational missile defense. We have spent over $150 billion on national \nmissile defense. In this 1 year, the request is $9.3 billion, of which \nthe committee felt like there were other priorities for $400 million of \nthat. That is a reduction of only 4.2 percent in a program that has \nspent $150 billion--$150 billion--to date. Now, that is a de minimis \ncut when you have so many other priorities in the budget of the \nPentagon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, if I could also respond briefly, again, I \nsimply disagree with my distinguished colleague from Florida that $411 \nmillion is\n\n[[Page S8236]]\n\npocket change, de minimis, doesn't make a difference. It will make a \ndifference in terms of missile defense, our capability, and the defense \nof the American people.\n  It is important to restore a good part of that, and specifically this \namendment proposes restoring $271 million. That is real money. It makes \na real difference. And in today's world of threats such as North Korea \nand China and Iran, this is a top defense priority.\n  Secondly, I appreciate the Senator's support of very crucial systems. \nHe is exactly right, they are bottom-line crucial systems such as THAAD \nand Aegis. But again, the committee didn't cut those programs. It put \nsome more money into those programs but not enough to meet the need \nthat the committee itself recognized. In fact, even this Vitter \namendment doesn't get us the whole way there. The committee itself \nrecognized, citing reports of the Joint Chiefs, we need about twice as \nmany THAAD and Standard Missile-3 interceptors as the number currently \nplanned. The committee's bill doesn't get us there. In fact, even this \nVitter amendment doesn't get us fully there, but it goes much further \ndown the line in terms of getting us there, in terms of immediate near-\nterm needs, such as THAAD, such as Aegis. I agree with the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida, those are crucial programs with \nreal near-term impact.\n  Third, all the possible offset cuts that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Florida mentioned are not allowed under this amendment. Every \nexample he gave cannot be used as an offset cut under this amendment. \nUnder this amendment, this $271 million can only be offset with cuts to \ndefense-wide accounts, not program-specific accounts, not service-\nspecific accounts. Therefore, every one of those examples was a \nprogram-specific account, was a service-specific account and can't be \ncut, will not be cut. We are talking about broad defense-wide accounts, \nsuch as administrative accounts, O accounts. I appreciate the \nSenator's concern, but those specific examples cannot come to pass. \nThose programs cannot be cut.\n  Fourth and finally, I agree with the distinguished Senator from \nArizona. This isn't an ideological amendment. This is a practical \namendment in defense of the American people. When we look around the \nworld today, in a very dangerous time, with all sorts of new looming \nthreats, this is bottom-line practical. The three examples the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona gave are perfect examples. North \nKorea, with nuclear capability, with ballistic missile capability. It \nis very practical to make sure we have a robust defense against that \nvery unpredictable country in a time of dangerous leadership \ntransition.\n  China, as my colleague from Arizona said, is a power that is coming \ninto its own, but there are real dangers there because, as the Senator \nfrom Arizona said, it doesn't have the communication capabilities it \nneeds to match the enormous force and strength of its military. So \nthere are real threats and real possibilities of accidental or \nunauthorized launch.\n  The best example, the most worrisome example of all, is Iran. We \ndebate, with increasing frequency, the choices we may have to make, \nsooner rather than later, in terms of Iran's march to be a nuclear \npower. Whatever we think about what measures we should consider, \nnonmilitary as well as military, however we come down on that very \ndifficult issue, certainly we should all agree that having a robust \nmissile defense system is something that is useful and important to \nhave in that scenario on the military side. Certainly, that is better \nthan simply being more limited to offensive-only capabilities, only the \ncapability to take preemptive action. Certainly, we can all agree it is \nbetter to have that robust missile defense capability rather than \npurely offensive or preemptive capabilities.\n  So with North Korea and China and Iran, this is very practical. This \nis setting the right priorities in terms of looking around the world \nand understanding a wide array of very worrisome threats. And $411 \nmillion is real money. We don't restore all of that. We restore $271 \nmillion. It goes to specific uses that, again, will help advance \nimportant systems such as THAAD and Aegis toward the full capability \nthe committee itself recognized and that is fully offset and paid for \nwithin the bill.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to respond to the \nSenator from Louisiana, but I would first like to ask unanimous consent \nthat after my response, the majority leader have time as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, is my understanding correct that we will \nthen return to the Vitter amendment? I ask unanimous consent that we \nthen return to the Vitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Well, Mr. President, I wish to respond, but \nall I can do is read the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  On page 4, starting at line 6:\n\n       The amount authorized to be appropriated by this division . \n     . . is hereby reduced by $271 million, with the amount the \n     reduction--\n\n  And it goes on to say--\n\n     to be allocated . . . in the manner specified by the \n     Secretary of Defense.\n\n  What do the words ``this division'' in his own amendment mean? It \nmeans everything in the Pentagon, the Department of Defense spending, \nminus military construction. So when he says the amendment would not \nallow the Secretary of Defense, at his discretion, to cut all these \nthings I have listed, that is incorrect. That is what the amendment \nsays, as it is drafted.\n  I would add this gets down into the weeds, but since a lot of this is \nvery arcane, there are some additional concerns regarding the Vitter \namendment that I will mention for the record. The amendment proposes an \nadditional $87 million for targets, for flight tests. But those funds \nwould, instead, go to the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense Program. That \nis in the wrong place because the targets program is managed in a \ntotally separate office. So any additional funds for targets should go \nto the test and targets funding line, not to the Ground-Based Midcourse \nDefense Program.\n\n  I said this is in the weeds, but we have to get in the weeds to talk \nabout how this amendment is flawed.\n  Another example is the proposed $54 million to convert two Aegis \ncruisers to the missile defense configuration. Well, the Navy doesn't \nplan on doing two such cruiser conversions, and this amendment might be \na problem for the Navy. It is better to simply refer to ``ships'' \nrather than cruisers. In any event, we should get more information \nbefore we authorize something where we don't know what we are doing.\n  Additionally, the amendment would propose $30 million for technology \nrisk reduction to one component of the Standard Missile-3, called the \nThrottling Divert and Attitude Control System, pronounced TDACS. Well, \nrather than put all those funds into this one piece of the Standard \nMissile-3, it would seem like it would be better--and this is according \nto the Missile Defense Agency--it would be better to provide funds for \nthe overall Standard Missile-3 Development Program. That would be doing \na lot more good than the proposal in this amendment.\n  So I think even down in the weeds there are a lot more objections to \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                              Afghanistan\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I deeply appreciate the Senators engaged in \nthe debate on the amendment offered by Senator Vitter allowing me to \nstep forward and give a speech. I have been looking for an opportunity \nto do this. I traveled in August to Afghanistan with a bipartisan \nSenate delegation. I remember a lot of things about that trip, but \nprobably the most stunning was a statement made by Ambassador Wood, the \nAmerican Ambassador to Afghanistan. He said you could take Afghanistan, \npick it up and move it to the poorest country in all of Africa, and the \nAfrican country would say: Now, that is really poor.\n  Afghanistan is very poor. I have had the good fortune, in my many \nyears in Congress, to travel to many places in the world. I have seen \nsome very economically depressed areas, but Afghanistan is the topper.\n  During my trip to Afghanistan, I met with general officers, I met \nwith troops. We traveled to Kyrgyzstan, to\n\n[[Page S8237]]\n\nKazakhstan, allies in our fight against terror, and every place I went, \nI had the opportunity to meet with officers and, of course, the troops. \nThey are fighting on the frontlines every day. During my meetings with \nthe generals and the troops, they reinforced to me their courage and \ndetermination to win the fight against the Taliban and the terrorists.\n  I learned a lot about Afghanistan, but one thing in particular I \nlearned about is the terrain. Oh, is it mountainous. High mountains.\n  I attended a funeral not too long ago in Boulder City, NV, because a \nyoung Navy SEAL by the name of Eric ``Shane'' Patton was killed in \nAfghanistan. When I attended the funeral, I didn't understand the full \nimplications of what this young man and the SEALs who were there with \nhim--who served with him and trained with him--had gone through. But \nthere is a book out, and I would recommend it to everyone. Every \nSenator who is interested at all in what is going on around the world \nand loves history should read this book. It is called ``The Lone \nSurvivor.''\n  Shane Patton is one of those who didn't survive. As I indicated, I \nbetter appreciate now what the SEALs were doing there and why and how \nEric ``Shane'' Patton was killed.\n  I knew his family. I was from a neighboring town. I went to a high \nschool in a town called Henderson, NV, where his great-uncle Charlie \nand I were competitors athletically, football and baseball. I remember \nvery clearly the funeral, after having been to Afghanistan.\n  We didn't spend all of our time with the troops. We traveled to other \nparts of the country. One part of the trip took us to a vocational \nschool where young Afghani women and men were receiving training in \ncomputers, English, car repair, and other skills so they could pull \ntheir families and their country out of poverty toward a brighter day. \nI can remember, I went to the back of the room and there were some \nyoung women there. I don't know how old they were, but they were young. \nThey were teenagers or maybe in their early twenties. I talked to them. \nSome of them spoke fairly good English.\n  One girl wouldn't talk to me. When I asked a question, she would \nwrite things on the palm of her hand. It was not because she couldn't \ntalk. It was just she was not used to being out, I guess, with men, in \npublic places. They are so happy to be able to be out of the clutches \nof the Taliban and learning something.\n  Despite the years of chaos and bloodshed, despite many families being \ntorn apart by this war, the young people I met there were brimming with \nhope, for lack of a better description. Seeing these young men and \nwomen study together I was reminded of the difference the United States \nhad made by aiding their fight against the Taliban.\n  One of my long-time Nevada friends, Harriett Trudell, who worked for \nme when I was in the House of Representatives, asked me if I would meet \nwith Eleanor Smeal, who runs an organization in town called the \nFeminist Majority. She was concerned about how women were being treated \nby the Taliban, as well she should be. It was awful what this group of \npeople did to women. These people, hopefully, see the light and will \nnot have to go back to that day.\n  The courage of our troops and the Afghan people was inspiring to me, \nbut I was reminded of the difference the United States has made by \naiding in the fight against this Taliban. But there is another \nconclusion you cannot avoid if you go to Afghanistan. The progress I \nsaw is being undermined by the security situation that is deteriorating \nday by day.\n  I returned home more convinced than ever that the greatest threat to \nour national security lies in Pakistan and Afghanistan. These places \nmust be our central focus on the war on terror. Today, 1 day from the \nseventh anniversary of the most violent terrorist attack ever to take \nplace on American soil, the mastermind of the attack, Osama bin Laden, \nis still free. For all the tough rhetoric of the Bush administration of \nchasing bin Laden to the gates of hell--he has been joined in that by \nSenator McCain--the Bush administration has failed to put the necessary \nresources and manpower in the hunt for America's No. 1 enemy. We had \nhim trapped in a place called Tora Bora, but our eyes were taken off \nthat. Troops were taken out of Afghanistan and sent to the unnecessary \nwar in Iraq.\n  President Bush has rightly said the war on terror is about more than \njust one man. Yet 7 years after 9/11, the President has allowed that \ngroup called al-Qaida to regroup in its safe haven in Pakistan. And in \nAfghanistan, the sad fact is that the Taliban, the brutally oppressive \nregime that housed bin Laden and al-Qaida, is on the rise, attacking \nour troops and innocent Afghan civilians. So we must be clear-eyed in \nthe realization that the same people who attacked us then continue to \nregain strength and threaten us now.\n  This dire situation could have been avoided. When President Bush took \nus to Afghanistan following 9/11, Democrats, our country, and the world \nstood with him. We knew it was a fight that we must wage and we must \nwin. But after a series of military victories the President lost focus \nand turned, instead, to an ill-conceived war in Iraq. With the job \nunfinished in Afghanistan, the President devoted our troops and \ntreasure to another battlefield.\n  Predictably, with the focus shifted, the Afghan people joining with \nus found no one at their side. The progress in Afghanistan began to go \nbackward, with neighborhoods once reclaimed from the enemy becoming \nbattlegrounds once again. The reason for this failure is no mystery. No \nmatter how hard the Republican spin machine tries to rewrite history \nand obscure the truth, the fact is, the terrorists who attacked us on \n9/11 were in Afghanistan, not in Iraq. As much as we are glad about \nSaddam Hussein, and we all are, during his reign--and that is what it \nwas in Iraq--there were no terrorists there. Afghanistan is a far \nlarger country than Iraq, with a larger population and far, far more \ndifficult terrain. Yet today we have about 34,000 American troops in \nAfghanistan and about 150,000 in Iraq.\n  Afghanistan is much poorer than Iraq. I have explained to the \nPresiding Officer and those listening how important that is, according \nto Ambassador Wood. It may not be the poorest country in the world, but \nit is right up there. Yet the money we have spent in Afghanistan is a \nsmall fraction of what we have spent in Iraq--approaching $1 trillion \nin Iraq. Afghanistan is the home of al-Qaida, home of the Taliban, the \ncentral front of the war on terror. Yet there are 4\\1/2\\ times as many \ntroops in Iraq, and we have spent huge amounts more money in Iraq than \nAfghanistan.\n  The result of this, the Republican failure led by President Bush, is \nclear. After a drop in violence early in the war, the Taliban came back \nwith a vengeance in mid-2006. By that time we didn't have enough troops \non the ground to respond. The troops needed were 1,500 miles away.\n  This is not just Harry Reid giving an anti-Bush speech. The commander \nof American forces in the region, the No. 1 man, ADM William Fallon, \nput it this way in January of this year:\n\n       Back in 2001, early 2002, the Taliban were pretty much \n     vanquished.\n\n  Just what I said. He continued:\n\n       But my sense looking back is we moved focus to Iraq, which \n     was the priority from 2003 on, and the attention and \n     resources focused on a different place.\n\n  That is what Admiral Fallon said, and that is what I have said in my \nremarks prior to this quote. With resources focused on a different \nplace, Admiral Fallon said, here is what we are now seeing. In July, \nnearly twice as many U.S. troops were killed in Afghanistan as in Iraq. \nJune was the second deadliest month in Afghanistan for coalition and \nU.S. troops since the start of the war. In eastern Afghanistan, attacks \non coalition troops increased by more than 40 percent over the first 5 \nmonths of the year. Roadside bombings have increased. Opium production \nis up.\n  Mr. President, 93 percent of all the world's opium is produced in \nAfghanistan--heroin. Coincidentally, right before we had our break, \nbefore I went to Afghanistan, I received a call from a woman. I, of \ncourse, recognized her name. Her former husband was the first criminal \nclient I ever represented. I was appointed by the court to represent \nthis indigent. I walked into that jail and looked through the bars and \nhere was this man. He should have been\n\n[[Page S8238]]\n\nin the movies, not in jail--handsome. His name was Gregory Torres, \nHumbert Gregory Torres. He put his wife through hell. They had a little \nbaby. She was a showgirl in Las Vegas, also as beautiful as he was \nhandsome. She called me to tell me he had died. I represented him in \nthe 1960s. He survived, in and out of prison; off of heroin for short \nperiods of time, but it is an addiction that is very hard to fight.\n  Mr. President, 93 percent of the stuff used to create hell in \npeople's lives comes from Afghanistan--heroin. We have to do better \nthan that; 93 percent of the world's opium is produced in one country.\n\n  President Bush's failures in Iraq and Afghanistan have had \nconsequences beyond the borders of those two countries. This morning, \nthe bipartisan American Security Project issued a report noting that \nattacks by violent terrorist groups around the world are at an all-time \nhigh. This is without the terrorist attacks in Afghanistan and Iraq. \nTheir report also notes that ungoverned spaces continue to provide \nsanctuary for terrorist organizations, including Afghanistan, east and \nnorth Africa, and Somalia. Yesterday President Bush had one last chance \nto meaningfully change the strategy and begin to reverse all these \nbacksliding trends, but he chose not to do so. He chose to stick with \nthe status quo and not make the significant changes that were \nnecessary. Unfortunately, we have seen no reason to believe a John \nMcCain Presidency would offer any break from the failed Bush foreign \npolicy.\n  For all his talk about listening to commanders on the ground, George \nBush--and John McCain--are dangerously deaf to the calls of our \ncommanders in Afghanistan. Listen to what Admiral Mullen said--Admiral \nMullen, not Fallon. Here is what he said in addition to what Fallon \nsaid. Fallon said, back in 2001 early 2002:\n\n       The Taliban were pretty much vanquished. But my sense \n     looking back is that we moved focus to Iraq, which was the \n     priority from 2003 on, and the attention was on a different \n     place.\n\n  Here is what Admiral Mullen said, also one of the leading commanders \nof the American military:\n\n       I have made no secret of my desire to flow more forces, \n     U.S. forces, to Afghanistan just as soon as I can, nor have I \n     been shy about saying that those forces will not be available \n     unless or until the situation in Iraq permits us to do so. . \n     . .\n\n  We know today that no more than a token shift of troop levels will \ntake place until we have a new President, a new President committed to \nwinning the war on terrorism by fighting the actual terrorists, not \ncreating war but winning war. That will require a new approach to Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and Pakistan. We have seen in Pakistan a dangerous \napproach by this administration, placing all of our bets on one man, \nGeneral Musharraf.\n  Senator Daschle and I were the first two American elected officials \nto meet him after the coup. We went there and we met with him. \nObviously, all the talking to him by us and others did not do a lot of \ngood because what President Bush did was place everything on this one \nman. It was a fatal and avoidable--certainly an avoidable--blunder. \nMusharraf did not implement democracy, did not uphold human rights, and \ndid not stop the terrorists operating inside Pakistan's borders. He \nfired all the judges. American dollars meant to fight terrorism were \nwasted, the Pakistani people suffered, and the United States lost \ncredibility with them for supporting a dictator who did not want to \nuphold their basic human rights.\n  Because of President Bush's failed approach to Pakistan, we now have \nseen al-Qaida regroup within its borders. According to the declassified \nkey judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate of July 2007 \nentitled ``The Terrorist Threat to the U.S. Homeland,'' al-Qaida has \n``protected or regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack \ncapability, including a safe haven in the Pakistani Federal \nAdministered Tribal Areas.''\n  The intelligence agencies reiterated this a few weeks ago, saying \nthat al-Qaida ``has maintained or strengthened key elements of its \ncapability to attack the United States in the past year.''\n  During our time in Afghanistan, from our meetings with President \nKarzai to our meetings with American generals, one message was clear: \nWe cannot solve the problem in Afghanistan without solving the problem \nin Pakistan.\n  Those concerned with the writing of our history books will have ample \nopportunity to delve into the Bush failures in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nPakistan in far greater detail than I have done in these brief remarks. \nThe historians will note that on George Bush's watch the Taliban grew \nstronger, running their operations from terrorist bases inside \nPakistan.\n  They will note, the historians, that under George Bush's watch, al-\nQaida regrouped, ready to carry out other attacks against our great \ncountry. They will note on George Bush's watch, our national security \nwas jeopardized, and the threats that led to the attacks in 2001 are as \ngrave if not graver in 2008.\n  So our job in Congress is not to do the job of the historians, but to \nanswer one question: Where do we go from here? President Bush gave his \nanswer to that question yesterday. His answer was: We do not go \nanywhere. We stay exactly where we are.\n  John McCain has made it clear that he stands in place with George \nBush. So with due respect to President Bush and Senator McCain, the \nstatus quo has failed. They are out of touch with the realities and \nramifications of our efforts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.\n  I saw in Afghanistan a people eager, desperate, and ready to lift \ntheir country to democracy, equality, and economic opportunity, but \nheld down by the weight of an enemy we failed to destroy.\n  The military, our military, has expressed to me how impressed they \nare with the Afghan fighters. They do not leave battle. They are ready \nto fight. So I hope in the coming months, our courageous, overworked, \noverstretched, overstressed troops can continue to hold off the enemy. \nI am confident they will. They will do it without the full resources \nand manpower necessary to complete the mission, which is too bad.\n  I hope the American people have the wisdom to choose a leader who \nwill take the war on terror back to the terrorists and look the Afghan \npeople in the eye and say that help is on the way.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I regret that we had hearings all morning \nin the Environment and Public Works Committee on another crisis; that \nis, we are going to have to do something about the trust fund to get it \njarred loose before we can get out of here. There is going to be a \nserious problem in the Nation's infrastructure, and it was necessary \nthat I be there. However, I regret that I missed the discussion of the \nVitter amendment.\n  Many members of the Armed Services Committee are very concerned about \nthe ability of the missile defense system. Some of us have been around \nlong enough to remember back in the Reagan administration when this \nwhole thing started. At that time, there was an attempt to denigrate \nthe threat that was out there, calling it Star Wars and other things. \nBut, in fact, the problem was very real. It took a lot of vision. That \nadministration set about to give us the capability that we would need, \nwhen the need was there. We were pretty much on course.\n  Missiles have become a key component to the militaries of many \ncountries now that were not a problem back at that time. Our enemies \nare advancing their ability to reach out and hit us, our allies, and \nour forward-deployed forces in a devastating way. We have a different \nthreat now than we had at one time. People are now aware of it.\n  I can recall that I disagreed with President Clinton when he took a \nlot of the money out of the national missile defense system. I think it \nwas the 1996 Defense authorization bill he vetoed. The veto message \nsaid that we are spending too much money on a threat that is not out \nthere for the foreseeable period. Now I think we realize this problem \nis there.\n  This is a complicated subject. One of the problems we have--and I \nhave this with a lot of my conservative friends--\n\n[[Page S8239]]\n\nis that people will look at it and say: We don't need to have all this \nredundancy in a missile defense system. Right now, we are talking about \nthe boost phase, the midcourse phase, and the terminal defense segment. \nIn these areas, we need to have at least two capabilities such as the \nairborne laser and the kinetic energy booster in the boost defense \nsegment. So people who say that perhaps we don't have that need and \nthat it is redundant don't think of the consequences.\n  As tragic as 9/11 was, I am sure all of us have thought about what \ncould have happened or what could have been or might have been \nprevented as a result of the increase in some of our collection systems \nto prevent a missile from coming in. We know countries have missiles. \nThey have weapons of mass destruction, and they have delivery systems. \nThe combination is varied. We are talking about potentially hundreds of \nthousands of people or millions of people who could be killed. There \nare a lot of areas where the midcourse defense segment was the only one \nthat would be effective in knocking down an incoming missile. We are \nworking hard now on the terminal defense segment.\n  I applaud the Missile Defense Agency and the work they have been \ndoing because they have been able to analyze this and see where the \nthreat is, why it should be dealt with. When they developed a budget, \nthey put the amount of money in there they thought was necessary to \nkeep on course to get us to the point where we would be able to \nadequately defend America against an incoming missile. I think they \nhave done that.\n  We took some 400, I believe, out of that amount, and the Vitter \namendment is trying to reinstate that. In 1993, the Clinton \nadministration cut $2.5 billion from the Bush missile defense budget \nrequest for fiscal year 1994; terminated the Reagan-Bush Strategic \nDefense Initiative program; downgraded national missile defense to a \nresearch and development program only; cut 5-year missile defense \nfunding by 54 percent from $39 billion to $18 billion; and reaffirmed a \ncommitment to the ABM Treaty, saying any defense must be ``treaty-\ncompliant.''\n  A lot of people honestly in their hearts--and I respect them for \nhaving a different opinion than mine--think that the answer is not in \nmissile defense system but in arms control. This is what we went \nthrough during the middle 1990s. But we have reached a level of \nsophistication now where we have watched our tests become successful. \nPeople used to ridicule those of us who were for this program a long \ntime ago: You will never be able to hit a bullet with a bullet. But we \nhave done it now. So the technology has come along. To not stay on \ntrack is something that would be devastating.\n  Right now, we are looking at countries such as North Korea and Iran \ndeveloping ballistic missile capabilities and delivery systems. There \nshould not be any doubt that these countries would actually use them. \nThe only way to deter that is to have a defense system.\n  I think it is wise for us--and I think all of America agrees that the \nthreats are out there; we need to have the capability of deterring when \nit comes in--that we do what is necessary to meet that test. We have \nrelied upon the experts in the Missile Defense Agency and those of us \nwho have studied this to determine what it should cost. Making a \nmistake here is not like making a mistake in some other area. If we \nmake a mistake here and are incapable of knocking down something that \nis coming into a populated area, that is a disaster that is beyond \ndescription. As tragic as 9/11 was, multiply that by 100 or whatever it \nmight be in the case that we don't stay on course.\n  So what I would encourage us to do is to go ahead and adopt the \nVitter amendment. What he has done is said: Take it from other areas. \nIt will be covered. But this shows that there should be that priority. \nI believe that priority is certainly justified.\n  As we follow through what has happened over the past few years, what \nhappened in 1998 when they opposed and helped kill the legislation that \ncalled for the deployment as soon as technologically possible--we \nremember that well. Those of us on the Armed Services Committee have \nwatched that moving target as time has gone by. But that is really the \nkey, to be sure we have a national missile defense system deployed as \nsoon as technologically possible because we know what other countries \nare doing. We know people are trading technology. We know that China is \ntrading technology, that North Korea is trading technology, and \ncountries such as Iran are rapidly gaining this capability. Our enemies \nout there don't like America. This is the most defensive program we \nshould have in defending my 20 kids and grandkids and all of America.\n  I strongly encourage in this process that we reinstate the amount of \nmoney that the experts say is necessary to stay on course to defend \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the Vitter amendment for a number \nof reasons. Let me begin by saying we have already placed into our bill \nmore money for the areas that the Vitter amendment would add additional \nmoney for than was requested by the administration. In other words, in \nthese areas--terminal high-altitude area defense, the THAAD Program; \nthe Aegis ballistic missile defense, DMD, and its Standard Missile-3 \ninterceptor--we have added money in our committee to the budget \nrequest. So this is not restoring cuts in these programs. If the Vitter \namendment were passed, it would add additional funds to programs that \nwe on the committee unanimously already have added additional funds to \nabove the administration's request.\n  I would like to go through these one by one.\n  For the THAAD system, the administration's budget requested $865 \nmillion. The committee bill, approved by all committee members, added \n$115 million.\n  The Targets Program, which provides targets for flight tests, the \nbudget request was $665 million. The Armed Services Committee fully \nfunded the administration request. The Vitter amendment adds money the \nadministration is not requesting. The administration is not requesting \nthe money that the Vitter amendment adds to the committee bill.\n  Next, the Aegis BMD Program, the budget request was nearly $1.2 \nbillion. The committee bill would authorize an additional $100 million \nfor systems improvement and additional procurement. The Vitter \namendment adds to what the committee already added to the \nadministration request--$74 million on top of the committee increase, \n$54 million to convert two additional ships and $30 million for \ntechnology improvements.\n  So point No. 1, in the areas to which Vitter amendment would add \nfunds, the committee has either fully funded the administration request \nor we have added to the administration request. The administration is \nnot requesting additional funds in the areas to which the Vitter \namendment adds funds. That is point No. 1.\n  Point No. 2, how does the Vitter amendment pay for these add-ons? \nWhat it does is it allows the Secretary of Defense to cut $271 million \nfrom any part of the Defense Department budget except for the specified \naccounts which we are not authorizing the Secretary of Defense to cut. \nBut except for those very precise, specific, enumerated exceptions, the \nSecretary of Defense is given carte blanche to cut any program which \nthe Secretary of Defense wants to cut. That is an abdication of \ncongressional authority. It is a serious abdication. We have not done \nthis. Where we have put weapons systems money in, frequently at the \nrequest of Members of this body, going over this at great length in \ncommittee, we have not given the Secretary of Defense a blank check to \ncut whatever procurement programs he might want to cut in order to pay \nfor other add-ons that are offered on the floor of the Senate.\n  Now, when the Senator from Florida gave examples where these cuts \ncould come from, the Senator from Louisiana denied those cuts could \ncome from these examples. But the Senator from Florida is right. So I \nam going to repeat the examples, and then we can debate later on \nwhether the Senator from Louisiana is correct or the Senator from \nFlorida is correct in terms of the amendment which has been offered.\n  These are some of the examples the Senator from Florida used where if \nthe Secretary of Defense wanted to make\n\n[[Page S8240]]\n\ncuts in programs, in his discretion, he would be given the authority to \ndo it. He could cut funds for the Joint Strike Fighter alternate \nengine. He could wipe out money for operations of the B-52. He could \ncut money for advance procurement funds for the F-22. He could reduce \nthe Patriot missile request. These are areas where the committee has \nadded funds and where if the Vitter amendment is adopted, the Defense \nSecretary could, at his discretion, make cuts in these program or any \nother program in his discretion.\n  It is a serious abdication of congressional budget authority to say \nthe Secretary of Defense may make cuts in programs wherever he wants, \nwith the specific two exceptions that are enumerated in the Vitter \namendment.\n  So we ought to defeat the Vitter amendment, No. 1, because it adds \nfunds not requested, No. 2, it adds funds to accounts we have already \nadded funds to, and, No. 3, because of the broad authority that would \ngive the Secretary of Defense to pay for these add-ons by cutting other \nprograms in the discretion of the Secretary of Defense--a very serious \nabdication of our budget power and something we should not do.\n  So I will oppose the Vitter amendment and support the position, the \nargument of the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, who is the chairman \nof our subcommittee, who earlier today made the presentation in chief, \nas we would say in a court, against the Vitter amendment.\n  I yield the floor now. I would ask unanimous consent--if my friend \nfrom Alabama might hear this--that if we go into a quorum call now the \ntime be charged equally against both sides on the Vitter amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum with the unanimous consent request \nthat any time during this quorum call be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Vitter \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponent has 2 minutes. The opponents \nhave 19 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Vitter \namendment be set aside, and that when we return to the Vitter \namendment, the Senator from Louisiana have 10 minutes on his side, and \nthat the full 19 minutes remain on our side, the opponents, and with \nthat understanding we move to the regular order, which I believe would \nbe the Senator from Florida offering his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4979\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4979.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson], for himself, Mr. \n     Hagel, Mr. Sessions, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4979.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To repeal the requirement for reduction of survivor annuities \n under the Survivor Benefit Plan by veterans' dependency and indemnity \n                             compensation)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 642.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I \nmay have printed in the Record a letter from The Military Coalition.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       The Military Coalition,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, June 19, 2008.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The Military Coalition (TMC), a \n     consortium of nationally prominent military and veterans \n     organizations, representing more than 5.5 million members \n     plus their families and survivors, is writing to ask for your \n     support of Senator Bill Nelson's Defense Authorization Bill \n     amendment (S. amendment 4979) that repeals the law requiring \n     a doIlar-for-dollar deduction of VA benefits for service \n     connected deaths from the survivors' SBP annuities. The \n     elimination of this survivor benefit inequity is a top \n     legislative goal for TMC in 2008.\n       We strongly believe that if military service caused a \n     member's death, the Dependency and Indemnity Compensation \n     (DIC) the VA pays the survivor should be added to the SBP \n     benefits the disabled retiree paid for, not substituted for \n     them. In the case of members who died on active duty, a \n     surviving spouse with children can avoid the dollar-for-\n     dollar offset only by assigning SBP to the children. But that \n     forces the spouse to give up any SBP claim after the children \n     attain their majority--leaving the spouse with only a $1,091 \n     monthly indemnity from the VA. Surely, those who give their \n     lives for their country deserve fairer compensation for their \n     surviving spouses.\n       The Military Coalition urges you to restore equity to this \n     very important survivor program and vote in favor of Senator \n     Nelson's SBP amendment when it comes to the floor for \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           The Military Coalition,\n                                            (signatures enclosed).\n\n\n[[Page S8241]]\n\n\n       Air Force Association; Air Force Women Officers Associated; \n     American Logistics Association; AMVETS (American Veterans); \n     Army Aviation Assn. of America; Assn. of Military Surgeons of \n     the United States; Assn. of the US Army; Commissioned \n     Officers Assn. of the US Public Health Service, Inc.; CWO & \n     WO Assn.

Mr. President, following one of the bloodiest \nwars in America, the time that this Nation was put asunder and split \nright down the middle, in those dark days, President Abraham Lincoln, \nin his second inaugural address, said that one of the greatest \nobligations of war is to take care of those who had borne the fight and \nto take care of his widow and orphan.\n  What he said was:\n\n       As God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to \n     finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to \n     care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his \n     widow and orphan.\n\n  That is the quote of Lincoln in that very memorable second inaugural \naddress.\n  This amendment has to do with widows and orphans. This Senator, for 8 \nyears now, has brought this amendment up, and on most every occasion we \nhave passed it in the Senate. But because it has a fiscal consequence, \nbecause what we are going to do is help widows and orphans, when it \ngets through here on almost a unanimous vote and gets into a conference \ncommittee with the House, it gets whacked. We had a minor victory last \nyear in that some of this offset that I am about to tell you was \nreduced, but it was a very minor achievement.\n  I have offered this amendment, which is cosponsored by Senators \nHagel, Murray, and Sessions. So you can see that this is bipartisan. It \nis going to eliminate the unjust offset on the survivor benefits for \nwidows, widowers, and orphans. The U.S. Government, when it plans for \ncost of war, has to go through--and understand that the cost of war is \nnot just guns, ammunition, tanks, and airplanes.\n  A cost of war is also taking care of the veterans and also taking \ncare of the deceased servicemembers' widows, widowers, and orphans. It \nis both a cost of war and of peace.\n  Now, before August, back in July, the Senate supported sweeping \nchanges to the GI bill, which certainly is providing greater \nopportunities for today's members of the military and their families to \nhave the ability to earn a college education. Well, now, in this \namendment, we have the privilege of honoring the families whose loved \nones have given their lives in service to the country.\n  Today, we can remove one of the last unjust benefit offsets that face \nour veterans and our families. On both sides of the aisle, over the \nlast several years, the Senate has tried to correct these benefit \noffsets that penalize our Nation's heroes. Back in 2004, in the Defense \nauthorization bill, we passed combat-related special compensation that \nallowed veterans who were injured during war, and awarded a Purple \nHeart, to receive both their disability pay and their earned retirement \nincome. Back then, in 2004, we reviewed the veterans concurrent receipt \ndisability pay, otherwise known as concurrent receipt. We agreed that \nmilitary retirees with 20 or more years of service and a 50-percent or \nhigher disability would no longer have their retirement pay reduced by \nthe amount of their VA disability compensation. That was the offset \nthat was known as concurrent receipt. So we eliminated that offset if \nthe veteran had a 50-percent or higher disability.\n  Well, through the National Defense Authorization Act, back then, in \n2004, we authorized concurrent receipt of the retired pay and the \ndisability pay for military retirees but not so with the widows and the \norphans.\n  Last year, in the Defense authorization bill, we reasoned that those \nveterans rated as 100 percent unemployable should receive both their \nretirement pay, which they have earned through years of service, plus \ntheir disability pay, which they earned through injury. Before the law \nwas changed, a veteran suffering from PTSD, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, or TBI, traumatic brain injury, and was unable to work due to \nthe service-connected disability--back before that, that veteran was \npenalized because he or she was not 100 percent physically disabled. \nPrior to our efforts, our veterans could not concurrently receive their \nhard-earned retirement pay and their well-deserved disability pay.\n  That is what brings me now to the widows and orphans. We treated our \nveterans that way in the past. We have acted to get rid of these unjust \noffsets. But there is one offset that remains, and that is the one that \naffects the survivors--the offset between the survivor's benefits under \nthe Department of Defense Survivor's Benefit Plan, or SBP--that is on \none hand--and the Veterans Department Dependency and Indemnity \nCompensation, or DIC, there is an offset there. Here is what happens. \nThe Survivor's Benefit Plan is purchased by the retiree, like an \ninsurance annuity. It is issued automatically in the case of \nservicemembers who die while on active duty, and retired members of the \nmilitary pay for this benefit from their retired pay. Again, it is as \nif they pay premiums for an insurance policy. Upon the death of the \nservicemember, their spouse or dependent children can receive up to 55 \npercent of their retired pay as an annuity--a straight kind of \ninsurance annuity. Understood.\n  But there is another law. The other law is that the Department of \nVeterans Affairs Dependency and Indemnity compensation, or DIC, is \ngiven to a surviving spouse of an active-duty or retired military \nmember who died from a service-connected cause. Here is the catch: \nUnder current law, even if the surviving spouse of such a servicemember \nis eligible for SBP, that purchased insurance annuity is reduced, or \noffset, by the amount they get under the Dependency and Indemnity \nCompensation from the Veterans' Administration. Well, why should that \nbe, because they are entitled to both. In one case, they purchase it; \nin the others, they are a veteran and they are entitled to it. The \nSurvivor Benefit Plan is that purchased insurance annuity plan.\n\n  In my previous life as the elected insurance commissioner of the \nState of Florida, I want you to know I have never heard of any other \npurchased insurance annuity program that can justify refusing to pay \nthe insured the benefits that the insured purchased by saying: Oh, by \nthe way, because you are getting a different benefit somewhere else. So \nfor the past 8 years, this Senator has been trying to fix that \nsituation. This amendment is going to end that injustice and completely \nremove this offset to take care of the widows, the widowers, and the \norphans who have lost a loved one to combat or service-connected \ninjuries.\n  In 2006, the Senate passed a similar amendment 92 to 6. What happens, \nit gets down into the conference committee between the Senate and the \nHouse and they say: Oh, we can't afford it. It got watered down into a \nspecial payment that provides a $50 monthly payment to a deceased \nservicemember's beneficiaries. So at least it is offset $50. But the \nreal offset is about $1,100. Fifty dollars is better than zero, but we \nhave a long way to go to make this right by our veterans and their \nfamilies.\n  I hope the Congress now is going to face the music and come up with \nthe responsible thing and recognize that the cost of war is taking care \nof the families, the widows, and the orphans. Under current law, \nbecause of that offset, all of our military are going to find it \ndifficult for their families to make financial ends meet. These are the \nfamilies of the men and women who do not return home. They have already \nlost so much, they should not have to endure the financial hardships \nbecause of a benefits offset.\n  The Senate has an opportunity to change this injustice as we get into \nthis Defense authorization bill. If we respond to it as we did a couple \nof\n\n[[Page S8242]]\n\nyears ago by passing legislation with overwhelming support and then \nagain with the special offset of only $50, if we can take it to the \nfull offset and remove it, then we will have achieved what we ought to \nbe doing, which is to do right by our families, recognizing that it is \nour obligation as a government to take care of the one who shall have \nborne the burden of war and of his widow and orphan.\n  That ends my remarks. I do not see any other Senator in the Chamber \nwanting to offer any comments. So if other Senators are not ready to \nspeak, I wish to speak on another subject. I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Oil Drilling\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, next week we are going to be on \nthe Energy bill, and we are going to be acting on one of the most \nimportant challenges facing our Nation. In fact, the single greatest \nthreat to our national and economic security may well be our dependence \non oil, not just foreign oil but oil.\n  No one among us would argue that we need to drill in places where it \nmakes sense. But we all know that more drilling will not do anything to \nbring down the price of gasoline. A report from the White House has \nsaid that, and we have stated that on the floor of the Senate. Nor will \nmore drilling take us down the path to making America energy \nindependent in 10 years. But let's acknowledge that we need to drill \nfor oil in places where it makes sense.\n  This Senator has come to the floor and said over and over that 68 \nmillion acres of Federal lands, both on land and submerged lands, \nleased by the oil companies, is a good place to start. We need to drill \nfor oil in places where it makes sense. If there are expanded places \noffshore that do not have a counterbalancing reason not to drill there, \nthen let's use that standard. Let's drill in places where it makes \nsense but understanding all along that is not going to affect the price \nof gasoline now.\n  The White House report said it would not affect the price of gasoline \nuntil the year 2030. But people are hurting now. They want something \ndone about gas prices now.\n  Recognize also there is a fundamental truth that the United States \nhas only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves, but the United States \nconsumes 25 percent of the world's oil production. Common sense tells \nus, if we only have 3 percent but consume 25 percent, drilling is not \ngoing to get us out of the problem. We have people such as Texas oilman \nT. Boone Pickens who are on the TV saying exactly the same thing.\n  If we cannot drill our way out of the problem, what should we do? It \nis clear that we could bring the price of gas down a lot more and right \naway if we would cut some of the waste, if we would conserve. What is \none way to conserve? Higher-miles-per-gallon cars because 50 percent of \nthe oil we use goes into cars and trucks. It does not take a rocket \nscientist to realize this is where we ought to focus. So let's focus on \nraising the mileage standards for our personal vehicles. It took us 30 \nyears to just a few months ago raise the mileage standards to a paltry \n35 miles per gallon, but that is phased in over the next decade and a \nhalf.\n  In the meantime, Europe is driving around on an average of 43 miles a \ngallon. By the way, it is American manufacturers in Detroit that are \nselling their products, American automobiles, that add to that 43-mile-\nper-gallon average in Europe. And in Japan, they are driving around in \nvehicles that get 50 miles per gallon.\n  In other words, we are wasting a lot of oil right here in America \nthat we could be saving, and we could do it with serious conservation \nmeasures. One of those ways is to increase our miles per gallon in our \nvehicles in the fleet average, which we could start doing tomorrow.\n  There is another way, and the other way is to start giving tax \nincentives to Americans to go out and buy fuel-efficient cars. We ought \nto require at least 40 miles per gallon on our vehicles, and we should \nprovide to the American consumer tax incentives to encourage them to \nbuy those higher-miles-per-gallon, fuel-efficient cars.\n  In the long run, we have to rapidly build cars that run on batteries \nand hydrogen, not petroleum, and we need to develop alternative fuels, \nsuch as ethanol, from products that we do not eat. While we are at it, \nwe are going to have to pay attention to how we power our homes and \nindustry. We are going to need to develop solar, wind, thermal energy, \nand safer nuclear power, and we are going to need to increase our oil-\nrefining capacity.\n  Our Government must enact this national energy program to transition \nus from petroleum to alternative and synthetic fuels. President Kennedy \nsaid we were going to release ourselves from the bonds of gravity and \ngo to the Moon and back within 9 years, and we did it. We need to act \non this energy crisis with the same urgency. If we put our minds \ntogether, then we can realize a number of these items that I have \nmentioned--drill in places where it makes sense; raise the miles per \ngallon on our automobiles; give our people tax incentives so that they \nwill be encouraged to buy fuel-efficient cars; develop solar, wind, \nthermal, safer nuclear power; and increase our oil-refining capacity. \nThese are the ways we are going to solve our energy crisis.\n  This is what I hope as the Senate goes into session next week working \non the Energy bill. These are the commonsense ways that we can, with \ndivergent views, come together and build consensus.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5280\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I will return to my pending Vitter \namendment. I ask the majority side, and perhaps the distinguished \nSenator from Florida is the appropriate person on the floor to give \nconsent to a modification of the Vitter amendment, which is in the last \nparagraph, only to clear up any uncertainty and confusion about this \noffset issue which we have discussed.\n  This modification, which I provided to the majority side, would make \ncrystal clear and ensure that the full offset of this amendment would \nhave to come out of research, development, test, and evaluation \naccounts only, and therefore it could not come out of O It could not \ncome out of procurement. It could not come out of any of those broad \ncategories about which the Senator and others were most concerned.\n  I ask unanimous consent for that modification so that there is \ncertainty on that issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, \nout of consideration for Senator Levin, the chairman of the committee, \nwho is off the floor right now and is considering the request of the \nSenator from Louisiana, I suggest the Senator withdraw the request \nuntil Senator Levin returns. I have been instructed to say that he is \nconsidering that request right now. So will the Senator withdraw the \nrequest?\n  Mr. VITTER. Pending that answer, Mr. President, I will withdraw the \nrequest and look forward to that response so that we can modify the \namendment. It is a good-faith attempt to address and clear up any \npossible ambiguity about some of the issues we discussed on the Senate \nfloor. I think this modification would do that by, beyond argument, \nlimiting any offset to research, development, test, and evaluation \naccounts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Mental Health Parity\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I often try to come to this Chamber and \noffer remarks without reading a text, but this text that I have \nprepared is of such a personal nature and so difficult to give that I \nthink I am going to try to read it.\n  I also want to note for the record that in this hyperpolitical \nseason, sometimes we forget that we are just Americans. Senator Kennedy \nsomehow knew I was going to give this speech, and I was just called to \nthe Republican cloakroom to take a call from our colleague who \nstruggles with a terrible illness. He wished me well in this speech \nbecause we share a common bond when it comes to human loss and the \npassion\n\n[[Page S8243]]\n\nfor the issue of mental health. I also want to report, Mr. President, \nthat he sounded great, and I am confident he will be back.\n\n  Mr. President, 5 years ago this week--it was actually 5 years ago on \nMonday--my wife Sharon and I received the worst news that any parent \ncan receive when a police officer showed up at our door to inform us \nthat our 21-year-old son Garrett had taken his life. That day and the \ndays and weeks that followed were the most painful imaginable. But \ninstrumental to Sharon and me being able to persevere through those \nweeks was the love and support we received from my colleagues here in \nthe Senate.\n  To note just a few, Senators Wyden, Reid, Stevens, Bennett, DeWine, \nand Chambliss traveled all the way to Pendleton, OR, a little town in \nnortheastern Oregon, for Garrett's service. When I returned to this \nChamber weeks later, Senators Kennedy and Biden, who had experienced \nthe loss of family members in their lives, were just two of many who \nreached out to me with compassion and wise counsel. Senators Leahy and \nSantorum lit candles for us in their Catholic parishes, Senator \nLieberman remembered us in his synagogue, and many protestant \ncolleagues included us in their prayer circles. Sharon and I were \nreminded again and again that human heartache has no political \naffiliation.\n  Sharon and I were also blessed to receive the support and \nunderstanding of the people of Oregon. We were overwhelmed with cards, \nletters, and kind words, many from individuals who had lost a loved one \nbattling depression or who had lost a loved one to suicide. Indeed, as \na result of the publicity surrounding Garrett's death, Sharon and I had \nbecome the focus of an immense fraternity of sorrow. I had never been \naware of or imagined the size of this silent and shapeless society, but \nthe avalanche of letters confirmed what my studies later taught me: \nThere are 30,000 suicides and as many as 600,000 attempts at suicide in \nAmerica every year. Suicide is the third leading cause of death in the \nUnited States for those ages 15 to 24. It is the second leading cause \nof death among college students, with more than 1,000 taking their \nlives each year.\n  I began to wonder what I, as a Senator, could do about this epidemic \nwhich had claimed the life of my son. Six months after Garrett's death, \nour then-colleague Mike DeWine provided me with an answer. He told me \nthat the epidemic of youth suicides had been weighing on his mind as \nwell and that he had coauthored two pieces of legislation he hoped \nmight make a positive difference. The first bill, authored with Senator \nDodd, increased screening for children to detect those predisposed to \ndepression and suicide. The second, written with Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland, provided funding necessary to improve suicide prevention \nprograms on college campuses.\n  I reviewed the two bills and felt more and more that I had found my \ncause: to bring suicide's brutal toll and mental health subordinate \nstatus out of our society's shadows. I believed that the shame and the \nstigma our society feels about mental health must stop and a national \nconversation needed to begin. I believed that if Government policy and \ninsurance priorities did not change, then more lives would be \ntragically lost, more families would be shattered, more of our citizens \nwould wander our streets and needlessly fill our jails, and higher \ncosts would be borne by taxpayers or be shifted to overburdened private \npolicyholders. In short, our society would be diminished and too many \nof our fellow citizens would continue to suffer needlessly.\n  Senators DeWine, Dodd, and Reed graciously offered to let me take the \nlead in advancing the legislation through Congress. Because of their \nsupport, the support of countless others in the House and Senate, and \nthe support of the President of the United States, George W. Bush, we \nwere able to make a difference and for the first time put the Federal \nGovernment on the front lines in the battle against youth suicide.\n  This week marks another anniversary, Mr. President. It was on \nSeptember 9, 2004, on what would have been Garrett's 23rd birthday, \nthat final passage was achieved on what my colleagues' named the \nGarrett Lee Smith Memorial Act. So I rise today during what is also \nNational Suicide Prevention Week to reflect on what has been \naccomplished these past 4 years thanks to the provisions of the Garrett \nLee Smith Act and to remind my colleagues of the work that still must \nbe done.\n  Since its enactment into law, the Garrett Lee Smith Act has provided \nfunding for youth suicide prevention programs in 31 States, 7 Native \nAmerican tribes or tribal organizations, and 55 colleges and \nuniversities. Incredibly, more than 150,000 people across our Nation \nhave been trained in youth suicide prevention activities under the \nGarrett Lee Smith Memorial Act. This includes more than 40,000 college \nstudents who can now look for the warning signs of depression in peers, \nmore than 11,000 parents and foster parents who can spot the warning \nsigns in their children, 9,000 teachers who can better identify the \nneeds of their students, and 1,300 primary care providers who can \nbetter serve the mental health needs along with the physical needs of \nour children and youth they seek to heal. We also know that 13,000 \nyouth have been screened for mental illness through the Garrett Lee \nSmith Memorial Act grants. Of these youth, more than 2,800 were found \nto be at risk of suicide and 95 percent were referred for mental health \nservices. Amazingly, of these children, 90 percent received care.\n  In my home State of Oregon alone, more than 900 people have been \ntrained in suicide prevention activities. They have been taught these \nnew skills in a way that will allow them to share what they have \nlearned to train others. This ``train the trainer'' type of program has \ncreated a sustainable program which will continue to grow the number of \ncaring people in our communities who have the know-how to spot mental \nillness and suicide risks in our children and youth.\n  Mr. President, much has been accomplished in the battle against youth \nsuicide, but there is still much more that needs to be done, and I \nwould like to provide a roadmap of five actions this Congress can and \nshould take before adjournment.\n  First, Congress needs to reauthorize the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial \nAct. Last May, I joined with Senators Dodd and Reed in introducing just \nsuch a reauthorization proposal. Our bill would provide some important \nupdates to the program, including allowing States and tribes to get \nmore than one grant so that many States can expand on the work they \nstarted with the initial youth suicide prevention grants they received. \nOur bill would also allow for increasing funding levels and allow for \nthe current youth suicide resource centers to serve those of other \nages.\n  Second, mental health parity has passed both the House and the Senate \nand is awaiting final passage. I urge the conference committee to get \nthis to final passage. This final version has been included in the tax \nextenders package drafted by Senator Baucus that is awaiting \nconsideration. I am very hopeful that through this package, mental \nhealth parity will soon be completed. Placing mental health on parity \nwith physical health will send a very important message to our family \nmembers and friends with mental illness. It says to them: We support \nyou, we love you, and we are working to ensure that you get the help \nyou need.\n  Third, mental health parity must also be provided to children under \nSCHIP. Low-income children suffer at higher rates of mental illness. We \nmust ensure that the State Children's Health Insurance Program better \nsupports their needs. We know that the earlier we can identify and help \nchildren with any mental health issues, the better chance they will \nhave in obtaining a long-term recovery and learning the ability to \nmanage their illness.\n  Fourth, along with many colleagues, I have long been concerned with \nthe mental health needs of our older veterans as well as those who are \nreturning from our current conflicts. I held a field hearing in Oregon \nlast year on the issues that our aging veterans face and convened two \nroundtables on the issue with veterans, mental health professionals, \nand local officials. Senator Kohl and I also held an Aging Committee \nhearing in the fall of last year that looked at veterans' mental health \nissues. I was honored that Senator Bob Dole was able to testify at this \nimportant hearing.\n\n[[Page S8244]]\n\n  In response to the findings I gathered from these hearings and \ndiscussions, I introduced in July of this year, along with my colleague \nand friend Senator Wyden, the Healing Our Nation's Heroes Act of 2008. \nThis bill would improve the oversight of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs and the Department of Defense as it relates to the mental \nhealth services they provide to our service men and women and veterans. \nIt would also work to increase the number of their mental health \nprofessionals and train them to better understand the unique issues of \nour men and women who have seen combat.\n  Finally, I have worked to introduce a package of bills with Senator \nReed of Rhode Island that would support and enhance our community \nmental health centers. These centers are the safety net of our local \nmental health systems and work to ensure care to so many low-income \nindividuals. These bills would help to better integrate the physical \nand mental health at these centers. This package would also help to \nprovide funding for infrastructure expansion and improvements that are \nso desperately needed as local centers struggle under low funding and \nincreased community needs. Currently, the reauthorization is pending in \nthe HELP Committee.\n  Mr. President, I know we are in the midst of a partisan season. Two \nof our colleagues are campaigning for the Presidency of the United \nStates, and one is campaigning for the Vice Presidency. In my State of \nOregon, my colleague, Mr. Schumer of New York, is spending millions \nupon millions of dollars running very partisan and negative ads in the \nhopes of defeating me, and that is certainly his right. I know Mr. \nSchumer has put pressure on many of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle these past few months not to continue any bipartisan work \nwith me. But just as passage of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act was \nnot a partisan issue, taking action on the five items I have just \nlisted is also not partisan. Mental illness does not differentiate \nbetween Republican and Democrat. It is an American issue. It is a human \nissue. And as Americans, we have a duty to act.\n  Perhaps the best counsel I received in the days and weeks following \nGarrett's death came from Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie, who served with such \ndistinction as the Chaplain of the Senate. Lloyd had recently lost his \nbeloved wife Mary Jane and called me from Los Angeles to commiserate. \nHis message to me was that ``gratitude'' is a miraculous antidote for \ngrief, and that, whenever I was feeling overwhelmed by bewilderment and \nremorse, I should remember to be grateful that the Lord gave us Garret \nfor 22 years less a day. It sounded simple enough--gratitude as an \nantidote for grief--so I tried it, I tried it again, and I discovered \nthat it works.\n\n  I stand here today, 5 years after losing my son, with profound \ngratitude in my heart: gratitude for the countless Oregonians who \ncontinue to let Sharon and me know that we are in their thoughts and \nprayers; gratitude for my colleagues here in this Chamber, without \nrespect of party, who helped me persevere and recover; gratitude for \npublic servants such as Mike DeWine and Chris Dodd and Jack Reed and \nmany others--and I must mention Orrin Hatch, who has been an incredible \nbrother to me. They allowed me to turn my grief into action through the \nGarrett Lee Smith Memorial Act. I express gratitude for President Bush \nsigning this act. He did it on a misty day, on an October morning in \n2004, just before election day. I express gratitude for those who are \non the front lines of the battle against suicide, and countless mental \nhealth professionals who are implementing the programs authorized by \nthe Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, who are often overwhelmed by the \ndemand and underfunded by resources.\n  And above all, I express gratitude that a remarkable boy graced \nSharon's and my life for so many years, and that his memory lives on \nthrough the good works implemented by legislation that bears his name \non the statutes of the United States of America.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4979\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, right now the pending business, as I \nunderstand it, is the Bill Nelson amendment, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me first compliment Senator Nelson for bringing this \nup. This has been something we have been wrestling with now for more \nthan 8 years and we are finally going to have an opportunity to make it \nhappen. It is a long overdue fix in the Survivor Benefit Plan and I am \nhonored to be a cosponsor of this amendment. It clearly states that a \nsurviving spouse and dependents of our veterans should receive the full \nvalue of the SBP and the Dependency and Indemnity Compensation--DIC--\nwithout an offset.\n  Here is what the problem has been in the past. They would receive one \nor the other, but the other would be offset against it so our surviving \nspouses would not have the full benefit. Let's look at what it is. They \nhave distinct purposes. The DIC, the Dependency and Indemnity \nCompensation, is tax free and it compensates for a service-connected \ndeath and the resulting economic loss. That is what that stands for.\n  The SBP, the Survivor Benefit Plan, is more like a life insurance \npolicy. Survivors are qualified for SBP only because their spouses \nbought it with monthly premiums.\n  It is time we gave back these benefits to families of those who have \nserved bravely in the defense of our Nation. I think it is an insult to \ntheir honor and their memory to do anything else.\n  Many of us have fought for years to ensure the SBP pays survivors as \nit was intended. I, along with 38 colleagues, sponsored the SBP \nBenefits Improvement Act of 2001. We are talking about quite a number \nof years ago. It amended the Federal provisions concerning the Military \nSurvivor Benefit Plan to adjust the basic annuity amount for surviving \nspouses of former military personnel and adjust similarly the \nauthorized percentage amounts of SBP supplemental annuity authorized \nfor such spouses.\n  Again, I cosponsored, with 45 colleagues, the Military Survivor \nBenefits Improvement Act of 2003 to accomplish the same thing.\n  We have worked diligently to change the laws covering the concurrent \nreceipt and have been successful. This legislation is the logical \nexpansion of the same principle, acknowledging that the surviving \nspouses and dependents should not be left behind. Every year for the \nlast 3 years we voted to include this legislation in our version of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act. We have the authorization bill--I \nshould say the reauthorization bill--every year. We put it in. Then, \nsomehow, in conference it comes out.\n  As the Chair knows, we cannot discuss what happens in conference \nother than we know the results. The results were this was something we \nwanted to do, we had it in, it came out. In 2006, 2007, and 2008, we \nagreed to repeal this SBP/DIC offset and every year it has been dropped \nby the conference committee.\n  Again, that is something nobody knows why. I, frankly, do not know \nwhy and I am on the conference. With this amendment we rectify a \nlongstanding injustice to widows and dependents whose spouses or parent \ndied, of a military service-related cause, who are sacrificing a dollar \nof the DOD Survivor Benefit Plan for every dollar of the VA Dependency \nand Indemnity Compensation they receive.\n  Finally, after all these years it is going to become a reality. I \napplaud the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, for bringing it up. I \nencourage everyone to agree to this amendment. I think it will be \nagreed to because it has had favorable treatment from our defense \ncommittee, our Armed Services Committee, for a number of years now.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before I ask for a quorum call, if the \nquorum call is put in motion here, is the time charged against both \nsides on the Vitter amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the Nelson amendment so no time \nwould be charged.\n\n[[Page S8245]]\n\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first I wish to say to our colleague and \nfellow member of the Senate Armed Services Committee from Oklahoma, I \nwas very moved by your remarks on this particular program, as requested \nby our colleague from Florida. This will have my support. But your \nvoice has added a great deal of significance to the fundamental \nnecessity for this body to go ahead with this amendment. I judge you, \ntoo, are a cosponsor on this amendment?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct. I say to the Senator from Virginia, we \nhave been working on this, you and I together, along with several other \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, for 8 years now that I know of. \nThis should be the day that we come to the happy conclusion and make \nsure it does happen.\n  I wonder why things that are so right are so long in coming. He and I \nboth know, after the years we have served, it is not all that easy \nsometimes. I thank the Senator for all of his support for the survivor \nbenefits and all the things we have done since--actually prior to 2001.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. If it is one hallmark \nhe has in the Senate, it is his tenacity, year after year after year. \nSo stick with it--whether it is this program or your beloved highway \nprograms, which you fight for, or your beloved WRDA bill, which you \nfight for. It is a long list.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Would the Senator from Oregon yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized following the presentation from the Senator from Oregon.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. First, I wish to note that my friend and colleague, \nSenator Smith, was just on the floor. I wish to commend him for all the \nwork he has done for the vulnerable families in our country. He and \nSharon, of course, have suffered the loss, a loss almost unbearable to \nall of us who are parents. They have done everything they possibly \ncould to stand up for other families across the country.\n  Since our colleague spoke, and very movingly, on the floor, I wish to \ntake a special note, before I begin my comments on another subject, of \nhis advocacy because I think it has been extremely important for \nmillions of families in our country.\n\n\n                      Minerals Management Service\n\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about a new report \nthat the Interior inspector general has released on the offshore oil \nand gas leasing program.\n  Several years ago, I stood on the floor and spoke for several hours \nin an effort to draw the Senate's attention to the mismanagement of \nthis offshore oil and gas leasing program. Today we have learned, with \nthe inspector general's report, that nothing has changed. What they \nhave shown, the inspector general in this report, is that the Royalty-\nin-Kind program, one of the key royalty programs that they looked at, \nis a horror story of mismanagement and misconduct.\n  The inspector general looked at the Minerals Management Service, and \nsaid, with respect to this royalty program, there is a ``culture of \nethical failure.'' Nearly one-third of the entire staff of the Royalty-\nin-Kind program accepted gifts and gratuities from the oil and gas \ncompanies with which they were conducting official business.\n  There are stories of drug use. There are stories of inappropriate \nsexual relationships. The inspector general confirmed that two Royalty-\nin-Kind employees were running a side consulting business for oil and \ngas companies with which the Royalty-in-Kind program was doing \nbusiness.\n  The inspector general's report detailed how Royalty-in-Kind managers, \ninstead of working for the taxpayers' interests, were working for their \nown self-interest, ingratiating themselves with the very oil companies \nthey were charged to negotiate fair deals with on behalf of American \ntaxpayers.\n  Now, some are probably wondering exactly how much money has been lost \nas a result of this mismanagement and misconduct. The bottom line from \nthe inspector general's investigation is there is no way to determine \nhow extensive the abuses in this program have been. There is no way to \ndetermine exactly how much money the American taxpayer has lost. \nBecause the record keeping has been so shoddy, it is not possible to \nfigure out exactly what these losses are.\n  I am very hopeful, as a result of this extraordinarily important \nreport by the inspector general, that it will be possible to clean \nhouse finally at the Minerals Management Service. I hope it will be \npossible.\n  You say to yourself: How can it be that these things are done at this \nagency today? What would it take to get a serious audit program at the \nMineral Management Service? I hope it will be possible now to make \nchanges in this program, to make it crystal clear that the Federal \nGovernment will no longer employ someone serving an interest other than \nthe public's.\n  Whether you are a secretary or manager or the guy or the gal who is \ncleaning up, if you want to work for the public, then you need to take \nthe public's trust seriously.\n  Now, you say to yourself, this should pretty much go without saying. \nBut particularly this afternoon, as the Congress is on the eve of a \nhistoric debate about the future of energy policy, you ought to say: \nLet's clean up the abuses that are taking place in existing leasing \nprograms that are going to continue and possibly be expanded under the \nlegislation that the Congress will consider shortly.\n  Some of the Minerals Management Services problems also involve a law \nthat was written originally in the mid-1990s, when the price of oil was \nlow. When the price of oil was around $15 a barrel, the Congress said: \nLet's give oil companies a financial incentive to drill on new leases \nin the Gulf of Mexico. The law said that while the oil companies were \ndrilling on public land, they didn't have to pay the Federal Government \nthe required royalties until the price of oil rose high enough for the \ncompanies to make a profit, obviously a little bit different time than \ntoday. Oil prices, of course, have not stayed low. It turns out that \nroyalty relief didn't phase out the way it should have.\n  We learned the Minerals Management Service, the part of the Interior \nDepartment charged with issuing and administering offshore leases, \nbungled things so badly they forgot to include provisions in the leases \nrequiring royalties on those particular leases. The Government \nAccountability Office has estimated that just this dereliction of duty \nwould cost American taxpayers as much as $11.5 billion. The Government \nAccountability Office recently has updated that amount and the impact \nis several billions of dollars higher.\n  The Congress has held hearings on this management failure, but the \nfact is, nothing has been done to fix the problem.\n  To add further insult to the injuries suffered by taxpayers, the oil \ncompanies operating in the gulf, led by Kerr McGee, sued the Federal \nGovernment, claiming they shouldn't pay royalties on any of the oil \nfrom any of the 1995 to 2000 leases, no matter how high the price of \noil went. They got a judge in Louisiana to agree with them. The Federal \nGovernment is appealing the case.\n  Senator Kyl and I have been working on a bipartisan basis to try to \nget this corrected, but in the 2005 Energy bill, the Congress extended \nthe exemptions for new leases in the Gulf of Mexico from royalty \npayments for both oil and natural gas wells, despite the fact that oil \nwas already $50 a barrel. This is a loophole that remains in effect \nuntil June of 2010 and is going to allow current and future leases in \nthe Gulf to continue to avoid even more royalties while additional \nprofit is generated at record prices.\n\n[[Page S8246]]\n\n  The Bush administration has proposed repealing these 2005 royalty \nrelief provisions, but they are still in place.\n  This is the time to get control of this runaway stallion. We are \ntalking about millions, certainly billions, in terms of the cumulative \ncost of the program, and these practices take your breath away.\n  Let me read from one paragraph from the summary the inspector general \nhas issued. One paragraph talking about three employees says: The \nresults of this investigation paint a disturbing picture of three \nsenior executives who were good friends and remained calculatedly \nignorant of the rules governing postemployment restrictions, conflict \nof interest, and Federal acquisition regulations to ensure that two \nlucrative contracts would be awarded to a company created by one of \nthem and then later joined by another.\n  These are such clear examples of abuse that no matter what one says, \nyou have to say this is unacceptable. The inspector general found that \nbetween 2002 and 2006, nearly one-third of the entire Royalty-in-Kind \nstaff socialized with and received a wide array of gifts and gratuities \nfrom oil and gas companies with which the Royalty-in-Kind Program was \nconducting official business. We are talking about 135 occasions \ninvolving gifts and gratuities. They went on to say that the inspector \ngeneral discovered a culture of substance abuse and promiscuity in the \nRoyalty-in-Kind Program, alcohol abuse associated with the program, \nwhere there was socializing by staff with the industry.\n  I have suggested two steps today that strike me as obvious changes \nthat should be put in place. First, there needs to be an effort to \nclean house at the Minerals Management Service so that we get these \npractices behind us. We also have to get back in the serious business \nof auditing these programs where millions and billions of dollars are \ninvolved.\n  I want to commend particularly the inspector general of the \nDepartment of the Interior for his outstanding work in putting together \nthis report. This is one of a series of reports that the inspector \ngeneral has issued in this area. I and the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, Senator Bingaman, have worked closely with colleagues to try \nto get these changes put in place. Senator Bingaman in particular has \noffered a number of promising legislative changes to deal with the \nroyalty issue.\n  I wanted colleagues to know in particular about this Office of \nInspector General inquiry into the Minerals Management Service, given \nthe debate that is about to begin in the Senate.\n  We will be, as far as I can tell, spending much of the remainder of \nthis session talking about these and similar programs. I happen to \nthink it is possible for us to do our work in a bipartisan fashion, get \nin place energy changes that will allow us, in the area of alternative \nenergy supplies and renewables, to make significant progress. I have \nmade it clear that particularly with respect to additional \nopportunities for drilling, be it in the Gulf of Mexico, and maybe \nother areas, I am open. What I am not open to is the continued abuse of \ntaxpayers in these essential programs involving public resources. We \nare talking about public lands. We are talking about public resources. \nIt is one thing when private companies drill on private lands. It is \nquite another when they are developing energy on public lands and, in \nmy view, taking advantage of programs that were set up years ago when \nthe price of oil was $15 a barrel.\n  It is time to clean house at the Minerals Management Service. It is \ntime to get back in the business of accountability and rigorous \noversight of these leasing programs that involve such extensive amounts \nof taxpayer funds.\n  I hope all colleagues will look at the report issued by the inspector \ngeneral of the Department of the Interior. It provides a clear roadmap \nfor how the Congress ought to proceed in terms of correcting these \nprograms, ending the pattern of abuse and mismanagement, and changing \nthe channel from the current horror show of mismanagement and \nmisconduct at the Minerals Management Service.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could we have a time set for the Senator's presentation? \nCan he give us an idea about how long he would be?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would expect to be about 15 minutes. Is there some \nintervening business the Senator wishes to conduct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is helpful. I wonder if Senator Dorgan could be \nrecognized for 15 minutes. I will ask unanimous consent to extend it, \nif necessary, but it will give us an idea how we can proceed, and then \nI ask unanimous consent that following Senator Dorgan, the Chair \nrecognize the managers.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Senator Dorgan is recognized for 15 minutes, and then the managers \nwill be recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank Senators Levin and Warner for their leadership on \nthe Defense authorization bill and the Armed Services Committee which \nbrings to us the Defense authorization bill. They held a hearing on the \nsubject of Iraq contracting at one point in their committee, and I went \nto testify before that hearing. It is interesting that at that hearing \nmy testimony about a range of issues with respect to subcontractors \ndoing contracting in Iraq was contradicted by an Army general. That \nArmy general is now under investigation because it is anticipated that \nArmy general did not provide truthful testimony to the committee. One \nof the things I wanted to talk about today was about the issue of \nprofound waste of money with respect to Iraq contracting. But then I \nwant to talk about how much money we have committed and how much we \nhave appropriated and, for that matter, authorized to Iraq at a time \nwhen the special inspector general for Iraq tells us that that country \nis pumping out about 2 million barrels of oil a day, selling it on the \nopen market, amassing substantial cash for their own country, and the \nIraqi treasury is now expected to have a surplus of around $50 billion. \nThe Government of Iraq is accumulating a surplus of about $50 billion \ncurrently, and it is estimated to be $79, perhaps $79 billion by the \nend of the year.\n  Contrast that with this country. Iraq is pumping oil, 2 million \nbarrels a day, selling oil. We go up to the gas pump and put gas in our \ncars and pay money that ends up in Iraqi banks. In fact, that Iraqi \nmoney is in the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States. Meanwhile, \nAmericans are paying high prices for oil, part of which ends up in \nIraqi coffers, and Iraq has about $50 billion, while we are up to our \nneck in debt. It is unbelievable. We have a fiscal policy that is \nwildly out of control. We are going to borrow $600 to $700 billion this \nyear. We are spending money for reconstruction in Iraq.\n  Let me show a picture of something called the Whale. The Whale is a \nfacility that has been built in Iraq, and it is a facility called the \nKahn Bani Sa'ad prison. If we take a look at this picture, we see \nbricks falling all over, an unbelievable mess. This doesn't look like a \nbuilding. It looks like a construction site that is under substantial \ndisrepair.\n  Let me tell the story about the Kahn Bani Sa'ad prison. Our \nGovernment told them that they had to build this prison. We are going \nto build this with American money. The Iraqi said: We don't need this \nprison. We won't use this prison. If you are going to build it, it is \nbuilt in the wrong location, but we don't want this built.\n  The American Government said: We are going to build this prison. They \ncontracted with Parsons Corporation for $30 million. My understanding \nis that after spending $30 million, they actually got rid of that \ncontractor and brought another contractor in and spent another $10 \nmillion. Here it sits. They call it the Whale. It sits on the sands of \nIraq, paid for with American taxpayer money, never used, will never be \nused. It is shoddy construction,\n\n[[Page S8247]]\n\nbricks are falling apart. It is unbelievable. It is a hood ornament on \nincompetence in my judgment, the Whale.\n  How much more of this should we do? I have spent a career on the \nSenate floor talking about how miserable the oversight has been with \nrespect to these contractors. Here is one small but illustrative \nexample. A contractor was supposed to be buying towels for the troops, \nlittle hand towels, Kellogg, Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, \nbuying hand towels for the troops. Henry Bunting, a purchasing \nemployee, is told: Buy hand towels for the Army. So he orders some \nwhite hand towels.\n  His supervisor said: You cannot do that. You have to buy hand towels \nwith ``KBR'' embroidered on them, the name of the company.\n  He said: That will triple or quadruple the price of these towels.\n  His supervisor said: That doesn't matter. This is a cost-plus \ncontract. The taxpayers will pay for that.\n  So the towels ordered for American troops were towels with ``KBR'' \nembroidered on them--Kellogg Brown & Root--at triple or quadruple the \ncost to the American taxpayer.\n  There were $85,000 trucks left behind to be torched--brandnew $85,000 \ntrucks left beside the road in Iraq to be torched--because they had a \nflat tire, they did not have a wrench to fix it, or had a plugged fuel \npump and they did not have the tools to fix it. These weren't dangerous \nareas where there was a concern about being attacked. These were \npacified areas where a repair could have been made. But the decision \nwas to just have the truck torched, because taxpayers could just buy \nnew ones.\n  You think these are stories that are wild? No. That is just the \nbeginning. I have held 17 hearings on it.\n  I say to Senator Warner, he will recall the day I came to the \ncommittee and testified about this issue. He will recall a General \nJohnson who testified just after me and said: Senator Dorgan is wrong \nabout this. Then he told you what he thought the truth was. It turns \nout he deceived the committee.\n  That General Johnson is now under investigation by the Secretary of \nDefense. I asked the Inspector General to look into the testimony--my \ntestimony and his. Several weeks before General Johnson came before the \nArmed Services Committee, the Inspector General had furnished a report, \nan interim report, to the military saying exactly the opposite of what \nGeneral Johnson told the Armed Services Committee.\n  I appreciate the fact that Senator Warner held that hearing, and I \nalso appreciate the fact that Secretary Gates is now investigating \nbecause, if anything, we desperately need people who come to this \nCongress to testify to tell the truth and not deceive the Congress. \nThat particular issue was a water issue that was providing water--this \nwas Halliburton and Kellogg Brown & Root providing water--to the \nmilitary bases in Iraq. The allegation has been since sustained, by the \nway, by the inspector general's report.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do recall very vividly the Senator \ncoming before the Senate Armed Services Committee--I believe I was \nchairman at that time----\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator, you were the chair of the hearing\n  Mr. WARNER. For the purpose of bringing to the attention of the \ncommittee this very important issue.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, that particular issue was the provision of \nwater to the military bases in Iraq. We discovered the nonpotable water \nthat was sent to the bases for showering, shaving, brushing their teeth \nwas twice as contaminated as raw water from the Euphrates River because \nthe contractor was not doing its job and not testing the water.\n  Well, I will not go on. I could go on at great length talking about \nthe unbelievable waste. But what I do want to say is this: In recent \nmonths, what we have discovered is that in the county of Iraq they are \namassing a very substantial amount of money. At the moment, we believe \nit is $50 billion and expected to grow to $79 billion in budget surplus \nin their bank accounts by the end of this year.\n  It seems to me from an infrastructure standpoint it is time--long \npast the time, in fact--for Iraqis, who have money in the bank--and a \nlot of it--to begin providing their own needs and infrastructure and \ninvestment. It is interesting to me and somewhat depressing, I would \nsay, that in this year we are building somewhere close to 950 water \nprojects in the country of Iraq. Let me say that again: about 950 water \nprojects in the country of Iraq--with American taxpayers' money at the \nsame time the President has recommended that we cut $1 billion out of \nwater project investment in this country. It does not make much sense \nto me.\n  Now, here is what I propose. There are three accounts for which we \nhave appropriated American taxpayers' dollars in which a substantial \namount of that is as yet unspent and, in fact, a substantial amount \nunobligated. I believe when we have some billions of dollars that have \npreviously been appropriated but are unobligated, that at this point--\ngiven the fact that Iraq has substantial surpluses and we have \nsubstantial deficits, given the fact that we have spent somewhere now \nover two-thirds of a trillion dollars in the pursuit of the war in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, and so much of it has been infrastructure investment \nin addition to replenishment of the military accounts--I believe it is \ntime for us to take at least a baby step and say: Do you know what. \nWith respect to that which has been appropriated but is yet \nunobligated, it is time to ask the Iraqis to pay for the cost of this \nwith their surplus that sits in a Federal Reserve bank.\n  Now, let me provide some evidence of all of this.\n  The New York Times of August 6, that is last month:\n\n       Soaring oil prices will leave the Iraqi government with a \n     cumulative budget surplus of as much as $79 billion by year's \n     end, according to an American federal oversight agency. But \n     Iraq has spent only a minute fraction of that on \n     reconstruction costs, which are now largely borne by the \n     United States.\n\n  Does this make sense? Does anybody think this makes sense? We are \ndeep in debt. They have massive cash reserves they are building every \nsingle day by pulling up 2 million barrels of oil and selling it on the \nmarket, and we are told we should keep paying for these costs? It does \nnot make much sense to me.\n  A Government Accountability Office report to Congress from last \nmonth:\n\n       [From 2005 to 2007], the Iraqi government was unable to \n     spend all the funds it budgeted, especially for investment \n     activities.\n\n  I am not talking about the surplus now. The surplus is that which is \nover the amount of money the Iraqi Government was going to spend. They \ncould not spend the amount of money they decided to spend, and yet they \nhave accumulated large surpluses beyond that.\n\n       Significant amounts of unspent money from the 2006 and 2007 \n     Iraqi budgets remain available for further infrastructure \n     investment by the Government of Iraq.\n\n  That is from the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction \nReport to us dated July 30.\n  Iraq Deputy Prime Minister Salih said, as noted in the special \ninspector general's report to Congress on July 30:\n\n       Iraq does not need financial assistance.\n\n  ``Iraq does not need financial assistance.''\n  This is just another example of that which I have held 17 hearings \non. This is an April 30, 2006, article:\n\n       A $243 million program led by the United States Army Corps \n     of Engineers to build 150 health care clinics in Iraq has in \n     some cases produced little more than empty shells of \n     crumbling concrete and shattered bricks cemented together \n     into uneven walls. . . .\n\n  This is a picture of a man named Judge Al Radhi. Judge Al Radhi was \nselected by us, by the Coalition Provisional Authority, by Mr. Bremer, \nto be the Commissioner of Public Integrity in Iraq. He found $18 \nbillion of graft and corruption. He found examples where we \nappropriated money for Iraq to buy airplanes, warships, and tanks, and \nthere are no airplanes, warships, and tanks purchased with that money. \nThe money is gone, but the equipment does not exist. By the way, one of \nthe Ministers from the Government is now living in a plush place \noverseas, and the money apparently is in a Swiss bank. This man, by the \nway, was not even supported by our own State Department. Eventually, \nthe Iraqi Government wanted to get rid of him, and they did. A \nsubstantial number of the people who worked for him were assassinated. \nThey tried to kill him a couple of times. He came. He had the courage \nto come and testify before a committee\n\n[[Page S8248]]\n\nhearing that I requested before the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\n  He said $18 billion was taken--most of it American money. He talked \nabout the Ministers who took it and where they are now and the tanks \nand ships and planes that were supposed to have been purchased with our \nmoney that did not exist. The money is gone. The equipment does not \nexist.\n  Well, Mr. President, that is a long way of saying that, obviously, I \nam impatient about all of these issues, having held a lot of hearings \non all this. My colleague, Senator Levin, has spoken of this issue \noften, recently, and going back some long while on the subject of who \nshould bear these costs.\n  If the Iraqi Government has substantial amounts of money in bank \naccounts in surplus--$50 billion now and $75, $79 billion by the end of \nthe year--should they not bear the cost of some of their own \nreconstruction rather than continue to ask--after 5 long years--the \nUnited States, which is deep in debt, to have to bear this cost and \nbear the burden? The answer clearly is yes. We ought to ask Iraq to do \nmore.\n  Now, I am going to offer an amendment. I am not asking us to take a \ngiant step. But let's at least take a baby step in the right direction, \na reasonable step toward common sense, to say: Do you know what. We are \noff-track in fiscal policy. We have an unbelievable mess, and it is \ntime to start taking a look at some of this spending and using a deep \nreservoir of common sense on this issue. At this point in time it is \nreasonable for us to say if the county of Iraq is selling 2 million \nbarrels of oil a day, amassing very large amounts of surplus in their \ntreasury, we ought to be relieved of the burden of using American money \nto build infrastructure in Iraq that could easily, and should be, built \nwith Iraqi money.\n  It is not the case of us abandoning the Iraqi Government. But it is \nthe case of saying we ought to expect them to do for their own, which \nthey can. Again, I just refer to the comment that was made by the \nDeputy Prime Minister of Iraq, who said:\n\n       Iraq does not need financial assistance.\n\n  That ought to be an invitation, finally, at long last, for us to use \nsome common sense in the way we begin to address these issues.\n  There are appropriated funds that are as yet unspent and unobligated. \nIt seems to me appropriate for us at this point to begin to look at \nfinding ways to decide that those funds, rather than being spent and \nburdening the American taxpayer, should be covered by the surpluses \nthat exist in bank accounts with the name of the county of Iraq on the \naccount.\n  Mr. President, I intend to work with my colleagues on the amendment I \nwill offer. But I did want to describe the reason for it today. I \nappreciate very much the time offered to me by the chairman and ranking \nmember.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from North Dakota. \nThis subject, which he has described, is a subject which every \nAmerican--at least those I have spoken to--understands. Regardless of \ntheir position on the Iraq war, regardless of whether they believe we \ndid the right thing going in, regardless of whether they are critics of \nthe Bush administration's policies, this cuts across every single \nline. I have not talked to anybody, at least in my State of Michigan, \nwho believes that when Iraq has $80 billion in surplus funds sitting in \nbanks, some of which are our banks drawing interest from our \ntaxpayers--we have paid billions of dollars in interest on Iraqi \nsurplus accounts coming from sales of oil, much of which comes to \nAmerica, much of which ends up in our tanks at $4 a gallon, enriching \nthemselves at the expense of the American taxpayers. Why in heaven's \nname they are not paying for the kinds of items which Senator Dorgan \nhas described beats me and I think it absolutely stuns at least every \nAmerican I have spoken to when they hear about it. This cuts across all \nthe positions on the war and the success of the surge or the lack of \nsuccess because it hasn't accomplished its purposes.\n\n  This issue is a critically important issue. It is shocking. It is \nunsustainable, it is untenable, it is unconscionable that Iraq is not \npaying for the kinds of reconstruction efforts the Senator has \ndescribed.\n  Senator Warner and I wrote a letter some months ago, and we received \na response on this subject which provides a lot of the information to \nwhich Senator Dorgan has referred. I commend Senator Warner because he \nhas been active in trying to probe this area: How many surplus funds \nare there and how much is being added every day and what are they being \nspent for? So we have been able to accumulate a lot of information \nwhich I believe will be very supportive of an amendment which Senator \nDorgan may offer and hopefully will put in a form which can command \nbipartisan support of the Senate.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might just make an observation, let \nme also thank Senator Warner from Virginia for his work on this, and \nthe Senator from Michigan, and say that this publication--and I know \nthe two of you have been very supportive of it--by the special \ninspector general for Iraq--this is dated July 30, so it is 2 months \nago, a month and a half old. This publication has some unbelievable \ninformation in it about what is necessary, what kinds of expenditures \nexist in the major reconstruction accounts. There is at the moment $7 \nbillion in the three reconstruction accounts that is unspent and \nunobligated.\n  As I move this amendment, I wish to work with both of you to see if \nwe can construct the amendment in a manner that meets your needs and my \nneeds because I believe this will make real progress.\n  Again, I thank both the chairman and the ranking member for their \nwork on these issues. I am well aware of the letter they wrote some \nmonths ago.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might add, I appreciate the \nsentiments of both of my colleagues. It has been a joint effort by \nSenator Levin and me.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter we prepared \nprinted in the Record after this colloquy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to also bring to the Senator's attention--he \nalready knows, but those following the debate should have been advised \nthat this letter prompted a GAO study, and that study, which was \nreleased recently, received widespread attention, not only here in the \nSenate and in the House of Representatives but throughout the \nGovernment and other circles. So I would say we are well along in \nachieving some--what I would call better accounting for these dollars, \nbetter control over the expenditures.\n  We have heard that the report is prepared by Stuart Bowen, whom I see \nregularly, three or four times a year, and I know my colleague and \nothers feel likewise. I have a high regard for the work he and his \nstaff have done through the years with that report. There was a time \nwhen there were elements of the Government--I won't get into \nspecifics--which wanted to abolish that department. I think the Senator \nfrom Michigan remembers that. We stepped in and said in very simple \nlanguage: No way; they are going to continue.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question \nor comment, I think the special inspector general, Stuart Bowen, has \ndone a terrific job. I would commend all of my colleagues to take a \nlook at the reports the special inspector general has issued. They are \nunbelievably valuable to us.\n  The Senator is correct. There were some who were pushing very hard to \neliminate the special inspector general, and it was the fight waged by \nSenator Levin and Senator Warner to say that would not make sense at \nall. So I appreciate the work of Inspector General Bowen, and I \nappreciate the work of my colleagues.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2008.\n     Hon. David M. Walker,\n     Comptroller General of the United States,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Walker: Nearly five years ago, on March 27, 2003, \n     then Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, in testimony \n     before the Defense Subcommittee of the House Appropriations \n     Committee, was asked whom he expected would pay for the \n     rebuilding of Iraq. He answered that ``there's a lot of money \n     to pay for this. It doesn't have to be U.S. taxpayer money. \n     And it starts with the\n\n[[Page S8249]]\n\n     assets of the Iraqi people . . . the oil revenues of that \n     country could bring between 50 and 100 billion dollars over \n     the course of the next two or three years. . . . We are \n     dealing with a country that can really finance its own \n     reconstruction and relatively soon.''\n       In fact, we believe that it has been overwhelmingly U.S. \n     taxpayer money that has funded Iraq reconstruction over the \n     last five years, despite Iraq earning billions of dollars in \n     oil revenue over that time period that have ended up in non-\n     Iraqi banks. At the same time, our conversations with both \n     Iraqis and Americans during our frequent visits to Iraq, as \n     well as official government and unofficial media reports, \n     have convinced us that the Iraqi Government is not doing \n     nearly enough to provide essential services and improve the \n     quality of life of its citizens.\n       According to the U.S. Department of State's Iraq Weekly \n     Status Report for February 27, 2008, the Iraq Oil Ministry \n     goal for 2008 is to produce 2.2 million barrels per day \n     (MBPD). To date through the 24th of February, the 2008 weekly \n     averages have ranged from a low of 2.1 MBPD to a high of 2.51 \n     MBPD, missing that goal for one week only. Exports are over \n     1.9 MBPD, with revenues estimated at $41.0 billion in 2007 \n     and $9.4 billion in 2008 year to date.\n       Extrapolating the $9.4 billion of oil revenues for the \n     first two months of 2008 yields an estimate of $56.4 billion \n     for all of 2008. And that figure will probably be low given \n     the predictions for oil prices to continue to rise over the \n     coming year. In essence, we believe that Iraq will accrue at \n     least $100.0 billion in oil revenues in 2007 and 2008.\n       We request you look into this matter and provide answers to \n     the following questions:\n       What are the estimated Iraqi oil revenues each year from \n     2003-2007?\n       How much has Iraq and the United States, respectively, \n     spent annually during that time period on training, equipping \n     and supporting Iraqi security forces, and on Iraq \n     reconstruction, governance, and economic development?\n       What are the projections for oil revenue and spending for \n     2008?\n       What is the estimate of the total Iraqi oil revenue that \n     has accumulated unspent from 2003-2007, and the expected \n     estimate at the end of 2008?\n       How much money does the Iraqi Government have deposited, in \n     which banks, and in what countries?\n       Why has the Iraqi Government not spent more of its oil \n     revenue on reconstruction, economic development and providing \n     essential services for the Iraqi people?\n       Your assistance in this matter would be appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Warner,\n       Member.\n     Carl Levin,\n       Chairman.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to \nSenator Levin and Senator Warner and the staff and other members of the \nArmed Services Committee who have worked hard to produce a bill that I \nthink does the job pretty well to meet the challenges we have and at \nthe same time has bipartisan support, which is important for passage as \nit is one of the realities of this Senate. So I think we have done \nfairly well.\n  I wish to share some thoughts about some issues in general.\n  I think it was Fareed Zakaria who wrote a book not too long ago \nnoting that perhaps we had reached the end of history or beyond \nhistory. I understand he has since indicated that is not a viable \nphilosophy anymore. I saw the cover, I believe, in the Weekly Standard \nrecently which said: ``The Return of History.'' History teaches us that \nthis is a dangerous world. We wish it were not so. We wish we did not \nhave to have a Defense Department. We wish there were no such thing as \nwar. I respect people who are prepared to be total pacifists in their \nlives, but for most of us who lack that kind of faith, we believe we \nhave to be prepared to defend our legitimate national interests around \nthe globe and do those things with courage and fidelity and to think \nahead, to be prepared, and that peace is most often accomplished \nthrough strength. I believe we have a pretty good recognition of that \nin this bill, and that is why I support it out of committee.\n  I wish to note the unease we have seen in some of the nations of the \nworld. We know about the rogue nations. But it has been very troubling, \nI have to say, what Russia is doing today. It seems in their \nstatements, in their comments, in their actions, and in their military \naggression that they are not seeking to align themselves with nations \nof good will that seek to work in ways that avoid military conflict, \nthat act in ways that are just and fair to their neighbors. So that is \na big problem, some of the things they have been saying to the Czech \nRepublic and Poland about missile defense; some of the threats they \nhave raised toward the Baltics; the military attack they launched in \nGeorgia, their rhetoric in Georgia; their rhetoric toward the United \nStates represents almost bizarre activity. That is something I had \nhoped wouldn't happen. I think President Bush has done everything he \ncould, saying that he divined in examining Mr. Putin that he had a good \nheart, but it looks as if that heart is--if it was good then, it is \ngetting darker and darker today. I just wish it weren't so, but I am \nafraid it is so.\n  We are looking at what is happening in China, whose economy continues \nto grow. There is a very nationalistic impulse in China. Their military \nis growing at a rapid pace. It is technologically advanced. We spend \nbillions and billions of dollars on developing weapons systems and \nresearch and development. Too often, China steals that information and \nthen produces a system that may well be comparable in some aspects for \na far less investment than we put into it.\n  So those are things we face in the world today. I think a wise \nnation, a mature nation understands that you have to be prepared, that \nyou have to be ready to defend your values, and that allowing nations \nthat do not share our values to achieve military parity or advantage is \nnot a good thing.\n  I wish to share, along those lines, a resolution I will be offering. \nIt will be to call on this Senate to exercise its prerogative to make a \nstatement through a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that we affirm the \naction taken by the Czech Republic and Poland to accept and participate \nin our goal of establishing a third site for missile defense in Europe. \nMissiles launched by Iran would pass over Europe before they reached \nthe United States. Truly, Iran does not have that capability today, but \nour intelligence experts tell us they are moving forward with progress \ntoward that goal. They also seem totally unrepentant with regard to \ntheir determination to build nuclear weapons, which is even more \nproblematic as we think about the possibility that they could launch a \nnuclear weapon attack against our allies or even against the United \nStates. Central Europe represents a good location to place another \nmissile defense system.\n  I heard someone suggest: Well, the Russians have a right to be \nconcerned. We were concerned when the Russians put missiles in Cuba. \nBut, of course, those were offensive nuclear weapons designed to kill \npeople. What we are talking about is operating with independent, \nsovereign nations to put a system up that would have limited capability \nto protect us from missile attack. It has no offensive capability. It \nis a defensive, peacekeeping weapons system.\n  For reasons that go beyond my comprehension, the Russians have \napparently felt that they have a right to decide what the people of \nPoland do or what the people of the Czech Republic do. They are going \nto tell them that they can't have such a system. They at one time were \nunder the Soviet boot, so now the Russians have a right to tell them \nthat they can't--as an independent, sovereign, democratic Nation--make \na decision that is in their interests and in the world's interests and \nin Europe's interests and in NATO's interests to place a limited \nmissile defense system there. What kind of mentality is that? I say \nthat because that ought to give us concern in this body. We ought to be \nconcerned about that kind of mentality. It spilled out in a military \nattack in Georgia. It was not coincidental that while the Russian \ntroops were still attacking in Georgia, high Government officials from \nPoland and the Ukraine and, I believe, Estonia came to Georgia and \nstood with them because they have a real sense that they might be next. \nThey have not forgotten what Mr.\n\n[[Page S8250]]\n\nPutin said last year or the year before--less than 2 years ago. He said \nthe greatest disaster of the 20th century was the collapse of the \nSoviet Union.\n\n  What does that have to say about Russia's mentality and approach to \nlife today? We were at a NATO conference not too long ago, and one \nnation that had been under the Soviet Communist boot, in response to \nthat, and after our discussion, said they thought that may have not \nbeen the worst thing in the 20th century. They said they thought it was \nthe best thing that happened in the 20th century. That is the kind of \nreality we are dealing with in the world. It tells us we are not beyond \nhistory. History is here. It has not gone away.\n  We need to be very smart about how we utilize our limited financial \nresources to prepare ourselves for the future. These are problems we \nhave to think about. Of course, we have the immediate threat of \nterrorism. We know the history of the attacks on the United States, on \nour warship, the USS Cole, in a neutral harbor; marines have been \nattacked; the Khobar Towers--by a group of people whose stated \nobjective was to destroy us. Bin Laden declared war on the United \nStates. That is what he said on his Web site--that he was at war with \nus. He killed so many of our people on 9/11, and destroyed the trade \ntowers and attacked our own Pentagon, our own military headquarters \nright here in the United States. Is that not an act of war? Is that not \nconsistent with a desire to destroy the United States? They had the \nCapitol or the White House in their sights, had it not been for the \nAmerican heroes who took that plane down in Pennsylvania. So I guess we \nhave to prepare for that. I wish it weren't so. I wish we could sit \ndown with these terrorists and have a few hours of discussion and reach \nsome accord that would result in us not having to prepare to spend \nbillions of dollars to defend our interests around the world, and they \nwould stop attacking us. But that is not likely to happen. That is not \ngoing to happen in the short term.\n  President Bush was right, fundamentally, in his decision that we \nwould not sit on defense and wait to be attacked again. He made a \nfundamental decision that the best way to preserve, protect, and defend \nthe United States of America is for our military to quit being on the \ndefensive and allowing terrorists to be treated as a law enforcement \nproblem and, after they attack you, you see if you cannot investigate \nand figure out who it is and perhaps prosecute somebody. We needed to \ndefend America and stop the attacks before they came. That is what I \nbelieve history will give him high marks for. It has been going on 6 or \n7 years and we have not had another attack on this country. It has been \na challenge for us. We have called on our military to perform to the \nhighest level. We have sent them time and again into dangerous places. \nWe have extended their deployment. We hated to do that, but we have \ndone it. They have met the challenge and they have answered the call. \nThey have been successful in protecting us. We don't know how things \nwill come out, but I believe we will be able to see the government \nreach maturity in Iraq--a decent and good government that is a positive \nforce in the world, and likewise in Afghanistan.\n  I think we should be prepared as a Senate to affirm the action of \nPoland in recent weeks to approve the deployment of 10 missile \ninterceptors in Poland. That could be effective against an Iranian \nattack or maybe a mistake. It would not be enough to stop the hundreds \nof missiles the Russians have, for Heaven's sake. It would not be able \nto do that, but it would be able to protect Europe, and even the United \nStates, from the long-range missiles that Iran is striving to build \nright now. It is also a good way to bind our countries in mutual \nsecurity and mutual interests, and it affirms the Czechs' and the \nPoles' commitment to democracy and freedom, to the Western way of life, \nto the values we share, and a rejection on their part of terrorism and \nbullying. We will be offering that resolution, and I will talk more \nabout it.\n  We also need to be sure that we follow through on the authorization \nto send this bill and actually see that the money gets appropriated in \nthe next aspect of Defense spending. For example, I will note that our \ncommittee, I am most proud to say, has fully funded and given the \nauthorization to fund the site for the Czechs and the Poles, who have \nsupported the President's request in that regard. I think it was a very \nimportant decision on our committee. Other committees of the Congress \nthat have relevant jurisdiction to put out the money have not been as \nsupportive. I am proud that our committee has been. It is important for \nthese other committees--it is important in the geopolitical world we \nare in that our friends, our allies, free sovereign nations, Poland and \nthe Czech Republic, have stood up to pressure from Russia and they have \nstood up to leftist complaints, and they have agreed to deploy this \nsystem.\n  We ought to affirm it with a strong vote on this resolution and, \nultimately, in passing an appropriation that is adequately funded. It \nis not going to be difficult to put this system in place. It would \nrequire some little differences in the missile system. We need a two-\nstage instead of a three-stage rocket. That is not hard to adjust to. \nBut the main guidance systems, the high technology, would be the same. \nWe are on track to do this.\n  Our bill that Senators Levin and Warner have moved forward to the \nfloor does the right thing. I hope this Congress will explicitly \nexpress our appreciation to the Poles and Czechs and reaffirm our \ncommitment to financially complete that project.\n  I see other colleagues here. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I yield the floor to the assistant \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5414\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk for myself \nand Senators Vitter, Inhofe, Martinez, Warner, and Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself, Mr. \n     Vitter, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Levin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5414.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To make available from Research, Development, Test, and \nEvaluation, Defense-wide activities, $89,000,000 for the activation and \n         deployment of the AN/TPY-2 forward-based X-band radar)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 237. ACTIVATION AND DEPLOYMENT OF AN/TPY-2 FORWARD-BASED \n                   X-BAND RADAR.\n\n       (a) Availability of Funds.--Subject to subsection (b), of \n     the amount authorized to be appropriated by section 201(4) \n     for research, development, test, and evaluation, Defense-wide \n     activities, up to $89,000,000 may be available for Ballistic \n     Missile Defense Sensors for the activation and deployment of \n     the AN/TPY-2 forward-based X-band radar to a classified \n     location.\n       (b) Limitation.--\n       (1) In general.--Funds may not be available under \n     subsection (a) for the purpose specified in that subsection \n     until the Secretary of Defense submits to the Committees on \n     Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives \n     a report on the deployment of the AN/TPY-2 forward-based X-\n     band radar as described in that subsection, including:\n       (A) The location of deployment of the radar.\n       (B) A description of the operational parameters of the \n     deployment of the radar, including planning for force \n     protection.\n       (C) A description of any recurring and non-recurring \n     expenses associated with the deployment of the radar.\n       (D) A description of the cost-sharing arrangements between \n     the United States and the country in which the radar will be \n     deployed regarding the expenses described in subparagraph \n     (C).\n       (E) A description of the other terms and conditions of the \n     agreement between the United States and such country \n     regarding the deployment of the radar.\n       (2) Form.--The report under paragraph (1) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I express my strong support for the \namendment I offered on deploying an advanced early warning radar to an \nallied country from near term ballistic missile threats.\n\n[[Page S8251]]\n\n  This is a commonsense amendment and I hope it receives wide, \nbipartisan support from my colleagues.\n  We all know what other countries are developing: We are now living in \na world in which at least 27 nations have ballistic missile capability, \nand the knowledge to build and use them is rapidly proliferating.\n  Most recently, Iran's clumsy missile test earlier this summer may not \nhave demonstrated new technology, but it certainly demonstrated the \ndesire to be in the club of the nations with ballistic missile and \nweapons of mass destruction capability. As the latest IAEA report \ninformed us, the Iranian missile threat is real and growing.\n  General Obering, director of the Missile Defense Agency, offered \ncompelling illustrations of this growing threat in his testimony \nearlier this year to the Senate Armed Services Committee: ``Iran \ncontinues to pursue newer and longer-range missile systems and advanced \nwarhead designs.''\n  ``Iran is developing an extended-range version of the Shahab-3 that \ncould strike our allies and friends in the Middle East and Europe as \nwell as our deployed forces. It is developing a new Ashura medium-range \nballistic missile capable of reaching Israel and U.S. bases in Eastern \nEurope.''\n  ``Iranian public statements also indicate that its solid-propellant \ntechnology is maturing; with its significantly faster launch sequence, \nthis new missile is an improvement over the liquid-fuel Shahab-3.''\n  The amendment offered provides funding for the Missile Defense Agency \nto deploy an early-warning X-band missile defense radar to an allied \nnation, which press reports have noted was agreed to in meetings with \nsenior DOD leaders and the allied nation's defense leaders. Due to the \nsensitive nature of preparations for this deployment, details \nconcerning the specific location and operational concept have not been \npublicly revealed.\n  However, spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency said the new system \ncould double or even triple a threat missiles' range of identification, \nwhich would be particularly useful should countries such as Syria or \nIran launch an attack against a critical allied nation.\n  The new capability will improve the allied nation's missile defense. \ncapability, allowing it to engage threats such as the Iranian Shahab-3 \nballistic missile. A defense security expert said the significance of \nthe deal is that it will add ``precious minutes'' to its early warning \nability.\n  The newly deployed early warning radar will also provide an important \nelement of the U.S. missile defense network, providing ascent and mid-\ncourse coverage of missiles, launched from Iran, as well as the eastern \nMediterranean.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is common sense and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it. Rogue nations such as Iran are dangerous and \nrepresent a vital threat to our own security and the security of our \nallies.\n  Iran possesses ballistic missiles and is rapidly developing more \nadvanced, long-range missiles.\n  The U.S. must act responsibly, take this threat seriously, and take \nthe necessary steps to protect our deployed forces and our allies.\n  Madam President, I thank Senator Levin and Senator Warner for their \ncooperation in considering this amendment. This is a rather last-minute \nrequest. The committee would not have been able to put it in the bill \nbecause the request came up very recently from the Department of \nDefense. There is still an aspect of it that is classified. It has to \ndo with the deployment of an X-band missile defense radar to an allied \ncountry. This amendment will allow the administration to go forward \nwith that plan. I understand there is no opposition. I don't need to \ndiscuss it further.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I commend our distinguished colleague \nfor this amendment. It is one that was specifically requested by the \nadministration. I think in a most cooperative way, our distinguished \nchairman has joined in. It relates to the missile defense system which \nis so essential to our Nation and indeed much of the free world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank Senator Kyl for not just the \namendment but his willingness to work to craft the language in a way \nthat I think has improved it, narrowed it in a number of ways, but also \nmeets the needs of the Defense Department and our allies.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I urge consideration of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5414) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask that Senator Leahy's amendment No. \n5323 be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is once again \npending.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, on this side, I saw that the amendment \nwas sent to the Judiciary Committee. The distinguished Senator from \nAlabama, Mr. Sessions, reviewed it. I know of no request for a recorded \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays be vitiated on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5323\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, is the pending amendment now the Leahy \namendment No. 5323?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I don't know of any further debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 5323.\n  The amendment (No. 5323) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KYL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5280\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nresume consideration of the Vitter amendment No. 5280 and that all \ndebate time be yielded back, except for 2 minutes equally divided; and \nthat at 6 p.m., the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Vitter \namendment; that upon disposition of the Vitter amendment, the Senate \nresume consideration of the Nelson amendment and proceed to vote with \nrespect to that amendment, provided that the 2 minutes of debate be \nmade available prior to the vote; and that the other provisions of the \nprevious order governing prohibition on intervening amendments prior to \na vote and any other appropriate restrictions remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, I think we should either order the rollcall votes now \nor inform colleagues there will be rollcall votes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe when we say the Senate proceed to vote at 6 \no'clock--the unanimous consent request does intend to provide for \nrollcall votes on both amendments described. I thank my friend from \nVirginia for that clarification.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want my colleagues fully informed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I also ask unanimous consent that it be in order to \nrequest the yeas and nays at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. With respect to both amendments?\n  Mr. LEVIN. With respect to both amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S8252]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays on both amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we had a very brief discussion whether \nthe second vote will be a 10-minute vote. It is part of the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank all our colleagues. I thank the Senator from North \nDakota for his patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the bill on the floor of the Senate is \nthe Defense authorization bill. It has much to do about the security of \nthis country, talking about ``defense.'' Tomorrow will be the seventh \nanniversary of the attacks on September 11, 2001.\n  I was sitting here thinking that on that morning at 9 o'clock, I was \npart a regular Tuesday morning meeting of the Democratic leadership \nhere in the Capitol Building. We saw on television what happened to the \ntrade towers in New York. We heard the television reports, and then we \nsaw the plume of smoke come from the Pentagon. Then someone from \nsecurity rushed into the room and indicated they felt there was an \nincoming plane to strike the Capitol Building, and we were very quickly \nevacuated. That was 7 years ago tomorrow.\n  Standing in the beautiful morning sun that day looking up into the \nsky and seeing F-16 fighter planes flying air cover over the Capitol of \nthe United States was a pretty remarkable sight, knowing our country \nhad been attacked. Then in very short order we discovered who attacked \nour country that day, who attacked the World Trade Towers, who attacked \nthe Pentagon, who brought down the plane in Pennsylvania. We discovered \nit was a group called al-Qaida and a leader named Osama bin Laden who \nnot only plotted the attack but boasted and took credit for the attack. \nThat was 7 years ago tomorrow.\n  Because we are talking about national security in the Defense \nauthorization bill, I wanted to call my colleagues' attention to the \nfact that on August 12, 2008, a speech was given here in Washington, \nDC, by the National Intelligence Officer for Transnational Threats. He \naddressed the Washington Institute Special Policy Forum. What he said \nin many ways tracks with what we heard last summer from the National \nIntelligence Estimate.\n  Let me put up a chart with some words from the National Intelligence \nEstimate because it is relevant to what we are talking about here on \nthe Defense authorization bill, that is, defending our country, keeping \nAmerica free. Here is what last year's July 2007 National Intelligence \nEstimate says. This is the declassified version of what had previously \nbeen and what was a classified intelligence estimate:\n\n       Al-Qaida is and will remain the most serious terrorist \n     threat to the homeland . . . we assess the group has \n     protected or regenerated key elements of its homeland attack \n     capability, including: A safe haven in the Pakistan Federally \n     Administered Tribal Areas, operational lieutenants, and its \n     top leadership.\n\n  Think of that. In July 2007, 6 years after America was attacked by \nOsama bin Laden, and our National Intelligence Estimate was telling us \nthat organization has regenerated its leadership, has developed new \ntraining camps, has, in fact, a secure hideaway. This says ``safe \nhaven.'' Can you imagine? Now it is 7 years after the attack, and our \nintelligence community still says those who boasted of murdering \nthousands of innocent Americans have a ``safe haven.'' There ought not \nbe an acre of ground on this planet that is safe for those who murdered \nthose innocent Americans 7 years ago tomorrow.\n\n  Let me read what was said by Mr. Ted Gistaro, who is the National \nIntelligence Officer for Transnational Threats. Here is what he said in \nAugust:\n\n       Al-Qaida remains the most serious terrorist threat to the \n     United States. We assess that al-Qaida's intent to attack the \n     U.S. homeland remains undiminished. Attack planning \n     continues. In spite of successful U.S.-allied operations \n     against al-Qaida, the group has maintained or strengthened \n     key elements of its capability to attack the United States in \n     the past year.\n\n  This from our intelligence community.\n  Finally:\n\n       Al-Qaida has replenished its bench of skilled midlevel \n     lieutenants capable of directing global operations. It now \n     has many of the operational and organizational advantages it \n     once enjoyed across the border in Afghanistan. Al-Qaida is \n     identifying, training, and positioning operatives for attacks \n     in the west, likely including in the United States.\n\n  All of this from top intelligence officials in our country. Seven \nyears after we were attacked by those who boasted about engineering and \nplanning the attack to murder innocent Americans, those who have \npromised to do it again, we are told by our national intelligence folks \nthat they have regenerated their capability, they have resurrected \ntheir training camps, they are recruiting new recruits to al-Qaida, and \nthat the most significant threat to the United States is al-Qaida, the \nmost serious terrorist threat to our homeland.\n  Now, I don't understand. We are, of course, bogged down in a lengthy \nwar in the country of Iraq. Iraq did not attack our country on 9/11/\n2001; al-Qaida did. We are bogged down in a war in Iraq. We see \nAfghanistan slipping through our fingers with the resurrection of the \nTaliban. And even more important, we are told that the most serious \nthreat to our country--we are told by intelligence estimates--is al-\nQaida, which is growing in strength. So here we go again.\n  In August of 2001, the Presidential daily brief said that Osama bin \nLaden wanted to:\n\n       Bring the fight to America; wanted to conduct terrorist \n     attacks in the U.S.; wanted to retaliate in Washington; \n     wanted to hijack a U.S. aircraft.\n\n  The August 2001 intelligence briefing to President Bush talked of \n``Patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with \npreparations for hijackings or other types of attack.'' It said that \n``The FBI is conducting approximately 70 full field investigations \nthroughout the United States that it considers bin Laden related.''\n  That was August of 2001. Seven years later, the greatest threat to \nour country is al-Qaida and its leadership. That is unbelievable to me. \nAnd we see, beginning last year--and I have shown my colleagues this \nbefore--beginning last year, September 11:\n\n       Al-Qaida's Return. The Terrorists Have a Sanctuary Once \n     Again.\n\n  October 3 last year:\n\n       Pakistan seen losing the fight against the Taliban and al-\n     Qaida. Military officials say the insurgents have enhanced \n     their ability to threaten not only Pakistan, but the United \n     States and Europe as well.\n\n  The same article says:\n\n       Pakistan's government is losing its war against emboldened \n     and insurgent forces, giving al-Qaida and the Taliban more \n     territory in which to operate and allowing the groups to plot \n     increasingly ambitious attacks.\n\n  CIA Director Hayden, on ``Meet the Press'' this year, just months \nago, said this:\n\n       It is very clear to us that al-Qaida has been able, over \n     the past 18 months or so, to establish a safe haven along the \n     Afghanistan-Pakistan border area that they have not enjoyed \n     before; that they are bringing operatives into that region \n     for training.\n\n  I have flown over that area in an airplane. You can't see a border. I \nunderstand you can't distinguish between Afghanistan and Pakistan. You \nlook down and see mountains and you see rugged terrain. You don't see \nany kind of border. I understand how difficult it might be to deal with \nal-Qaida in that region. What I don't understand is why it has not been \nthe singular priority of our country to bring to justice those who \nplanned the attacks against our country on 9/11/2001. And if someone \nsays it has been a priority, show me the evidence. Seven years later \nand we have ``safe havens'' or ``secure areas,'' both terms used by our \nintelligence to describe areas of the ground on this planet where it is \nsafe and secure for al-Qaida to recruit new soldiers, to train new \nsoldiers, to plan new attacks against our country. That is \nunbelievable.\n  In my judgment, it must be a priority for us to deal with the most \nserious threat to our homeland. That is\n\n[[Page S8253]]\n\nnot my assessment, that is the assessment of the CIA Director and it is \nthe assessment of the National Intelligence Estimate. That simply must \nbe a priority.\n  In August 2001 the intelligence community said ``Bin Laden is \ndetermined to strike U.S.'' That is what we knew. That is what U.S. \nleaders we were told in the intelligence briefings. In July 2007 the \nintelligence community told us: ``Al-Qaida better positioned to strike \nthe west.'' One would have hoped, with the hundreds and hundreds of \nbillions of dollars we have spent in defense of this country and in \nthis country's national security interests, that one of the major \npriorities would have been to bring to justice those who plotted the \nattack of 9/11/2001. Regrettably, that has not been the case.\n  I hope very much, as we pass this legislation, that things will \nchange. We have very big challenges. A terrorist threat exists. It is \nserious. It is relentless. It seems to me we will best be served not by \nmoving--as we have now for 5 years--our money, our effort, our \ntreasury, and the lives of our soldiers to continue the war in Iraq \nbut, rather, by addressing the worsening condition in Afghanistan and \naddressing the question of why we have not brought to justice Osama bin \nLaden and the al-Qaida leadership that is in a safe or secure sanctuary \nin the Pakistan border area.\n  Now, Madam President, this country has a lot at stake, and the fight \nagainst terrorism is a real fight. We have made a lot of very serious \nmistakes in the last years. Mistakes aren't Republican or Democratic, \nthey are just mistakes our country has made. We are bogged down in a \nlong, difficult war in Iraq. We have spent $20 billion training Iraqi \nsoldiers and police forces. We have trained half a million people in \nthe country of Iraq. We have spent $20 billion doing it. We have spent \ntwo-thirds of a trillion dollars in that war, and yet we are told we \nmust remain in Iraq because the Iraqi people aren't capable of \nproviding for their own security. We have trained half a million of \nthem. If able-bodied Iraqis don't have the will to provide for security \nin Iraq, this country can't do that forever. It is their country, not \nours. It is their responsibility, not ours.\n  This country was diverted to Iraq when, in fact, this country should \nhave been in a position where, 7 years after the 9/11 attack of 2001, \nwe wouldn't be describing Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida as the greatest \nthreat to the homeland. But that is what has happened. We can't change \nwhat has happened, but it seems to me what we can change is what we are \ndetermined to do about it in the future.\n  It is my hope, as we discuss in some detail our national security and \ndefense, the authorization of Defense expenditures, that we will decide \nthis is not Osama bin Forgotten; this is Osama bin Laden, who threatens \nthis country, who is the most significant threat to our homeland, and \nwho is resurrecting training camps and recruiting new soldiers for al-\nQaida. It is our responsibility as a country to address that and to \naddress it now.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                    Department of Interior IG Report\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, yesterday, I warned publicly \nthat we could not trust the oil companies that want to drill in the \nwaters off our most protected coastlines nor the Federal watchdogs \ncharged with keeping a watchful eye over them. Now we have proof \nbecause just this afternoon the inspector general at the Department of \nthe Interior has released this scathing report about the Mineral \nManagement Service in the U.S. Department of the Interior and \nspecifically an office that manages revenue from offshore oil drilling, \nand it concludes:\n\n       We also discovered a culture of substance abuse and \n     promiscuity in the Royalty-in-Kind Program, both within the \n     program--including the supervisor, Greg Smith, who engaged in \n     illegal drug use and had sexual relations with subordinates--\n     and in concert with the industry. Internally, several staff \n     admitted to illegal drug use as well as illicit sexual \n     encounters. Alcohol abuse appears to have been a problem when \n     program staff socialized with the industry. For example, two \n     program staff accepted lodging from industry after industry \n     events because they were too intoxicated to drive home or to \n     their hotel. These same program staff also engaged in brief \n     sexual relationships with industry contacts. Sexual \n     relationships with prohibited sources cannot, by definition, \n     be arm's-length.\n\n  The inspector general's report goes on to say:\n\n       More specifically, we discovered that between 2002 and \n     2006, nearly one-third of the entire program staff socialized \n     with and received a wide array of gifts and gratuities from \n     oil and gas companies with whom the Royalty-in-Kind Program \n     was conducting official business. While the dollar amounts of \n     the gifts and gratuities was not enormous, these employees \n     accepted gifts with prodigious frequency. In particular, two \n     Royalty-in-Kind Program marketeers received combined gifts \n     and gratuities on at least 135 occasions from four major oil \n     and gas companies with whom they were doing business.\n\n  This is in the offshore leasing program, Madam President.\n  I continue the quote:\n\n     . . . A textbook example of improperly receiving gifts from \n     prohibited sources. When confronted by our investigators, \n     none of the employees involved displayed remorse.\n\n  It is bad enough that the Government employees who oversee offshore \noil drilling are literally, as well as figuratively, in bed with big \noil. The rest of the U.S. Government doesn't need to jump in bed with \nthem.\n  Offshore drilling will not solve our energy crisis nor will it bring \ndown prices at the pump. Instead, it will enrich the oil companies and \nreward the culture of corruption that has been fostered, funded, and \nnow exposed by the inspector general of the Department of the Interior.\n  This comes out at a time that we are being told: Drill here, drill \nnow, drill, baby, drill--as if that were the solution. We should simply \nnot allow ourselves to become a part of the agenda of the oil \ncompanies. Here we have an example from the inspector general of what \nis supposed to be the Government watchdogs overseeing a part of this \noffshore leasing program that uses sex and drugs and illegal gifts to \nfoster their program.\n  I commend to my colleagues the three parts of the inspector general's \ndetailed report along with the memorandum which is the cover memorandum \nfrom the inspector general, Earl Devaney, on the subject of the office \nof the inspector general investigation of the MMS, the Minerals \nManagement Service, employees.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord what is moving across the wire right now, the Associated Press \nstory by Dina Cappiello, about this expose.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Gov't Officials Probed About Illicit Sex, Gifts\n\n                          (By Dina Cappiello)\n\n       Washington (AP).--Government officials handling billions of \n     dollars in oil royalties engaged in illicit sex with \n     employees of energy companies they were dealing with and \n     received numerous gifts from them, federal investigators said \n     Wednesday.\n       The alleged transgressions involve 13 Interior Department \n     employees in Denver and Washington. Their alleged \n     improprieties include rigging contracts, working part-time as \n     private oil consultants, and having sexual relationships \n     with--and accepting golf and ski trips and dinners from--oil \n     company employees, according to three reports released \n     Wednesday by the Interior Department's inspector general.\n       The investigations reveal a ``culture of substance abuse \n     and promiscuity'' by a small group of individuals ``wholly \n     lacking in acceptance of or adherence to government ethical \n     standards,'' wrote Inspector General Earl E. Devaney.\n       The reports describe a fraternity house atmosphere inside \n     the Denver Minerals Management Service office responsible for \n     marketing the oil and gas that energy companies barter to the \n     government instead of making cash royalty payments for \n     drilling on federal lands. The government received $4.3 \n     billion in such Royalty-in-Kind payments last year. The oil \n     is then resold to energy companies or put in the nation's \n     emergency stockpile.\n       Between 2002 and 2006, nearly a third of the 55-person \n     staff in the Denver office received gifts and gratuities from \n     oil and gas companies, the investigators found.\n       Devaney said the former head of the Denver Royalty-in-Kind \n     office, Gregory W. Smith, used illegal drugs and had sex with \n     subordinates. The report said Smith also steered government \n     contracts to a consulting business that was employing him \n     part-time.\n       Smith, contacted by e-mail by The Associated Press, said he \n     had not seen the report and could not respond. He and nine \n     other employees in the Denver office are mentioned in the \n     reports.\n       The findings are the latest sign of trouble at the Minerals \n     Management Service, which has already been accused of \n     mismanaging the collection of fees from oil companies and \n     writing faulty contracts for drilling on government land and \n     offshore. The charges also\n\n[[Page S8254]]\n\n     come as lawmakers and both presidential candidates weigh \n     giving oil companies more access to federal lands, which \n     would bring in more money to the federal government.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, all of this is happening \nwhile we are considering what to do about energy. I hope we will \nremember that what we ought to do, what we need to do, is drill where \nit makes sense. But if you want to lower gas prices, we need higher \nmiles per gallon on our cars. We need to increase our tax incentives to \nour consumers so they can buy more efficient automobiles and tax \nincentives to the industry so they can retool, as well as we need to \nincrease our oil refining capacity. That is the way we solve the \nproblem of being dependent on oil in this energy crisis we are facing.\n  Madam President, I see my colleague from New Jersey, who has been a \nkindred spirit on this question of drilling offshore, off of our two \nrespective States. I do not know if the Senator heard what I just \ntalked about, about the inspector general's report, about what has been \ngoing on, the hanky-panky that has been going on over at the Minerals \nManagement Service at the Department of the Interior.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, while I did not come to the floor for \npurposes of talking about something both Senator Nelson and I are \npassionate about, which is making sure the Nation's energy challenge is \nmet but making sure it is met in a responsible way, I must say I \nappreciate him coming to the floor with a revelation that just came out \nand is being reported. It calls into question the nature of the \ndecisions, the information and the substance of looking at drilling \npolicy, as has been suggested, when there are clearly influences here \nthat are geared toward supporting big oil versus what is the ultimate \ninterest of the American people in achieving energy security and \nindependence. I will be speaking about that and joining Senator Nelson \nin the near future.\n  I am concerned at what the inspector general's report says. It should \nbe alarming to every Member of the Senate. I appreciate the Senator \nfrom Florida bringing it to the attention of the Senate.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I might ask the Senator, about how long would the \nSenator wish to speak?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. About 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, what I came to the floor to talk about \nis Osama bin Laden. None of us will ever forget--no one in this country \nwill ever forget--the shock and the horror we felt, 7 years ago \ntomorrow, when we realized that a group of terrorist murderers had \ntaken 3,000 American lives, taken down two of our monumental \nskyscrapers, and taken a chunk of our military headquarters at the same \ntime, as well as downed a plane in the fields of Pennsylvania.\n  I know this is true for every American. It is seared into our hearts \nas well as in our mind. I know it specifically by virtue of the \nhundreds of New Jersyans who were lost on that fateful day.\n  Before long we learned the name of the organization that plotted and \nexecuted this plot. They are called al-Qaida. Although he had already \nbeen a deadly force before that fateful day, each and every American \nwould soon learn the name of the evil mastermind behind this carnage, \nOsama bin Laden.\n  As a country, we were unified in our grief and unified in our resolve \nto find bin Laden dead or alive, as our President said. There was no \nreason to think we would not succeed. We live in the greatest country \non the Earth, with the greatest military in the world and the greatest \nresolve of any people. We are the country that taught man to fly, that \nhas helped save the world from marauding dictators, and put a human \nbeing on the Moon. If we set our mind to capturing or killing the \npeople responsible for this mass murder, then we were going to get the \njob done.\n  Here is the thing. As we speak here today, 7 years have passed since \nthose terrorist attacks, and where is Osama bin Laden? Where is the man \nwho killed 3,000 of our fellow Americans? Where is our Nation's No. 1 \nenemy? He was allowed to get off the hook. He was allowed to rebuild \nhis terrorist organization to pre-9/11 strength, as has been noted by \ntestimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am \na member. It has been noted in various official reports. He was allowed \nto establish his own safe zone along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.\n  I do not think any American would disagree that the words ``Osama bin \nLaden'' and ``safe'' should never be uttered in the same sentence. Why \nis he living in a safe zone? Why was he allowed to rebuild his \nterrorist organization? Why has he not suffered for the consequences of \nhis mass murder?\n  I would say the answer to that question is because President Bush--\nwho was so steadfast in his call to go after bin Laden and smoke him \nout of his hole, with the backing of a unified country in the days \nafter September 11, when I was squarely with the President in that \nregard--decided not to commit the military force necessary to finish \nthe job when bin Laden and al-Qaida were cornered in the mountains of \nAfghanistan. He decided to outsource the fighting to warlords in \nAfghanistan who took our money, put it in their pockets, and let bin \nLaden get away. He decided that the war against those who actually \nattacked us was not worth the absolute commitment of the most powerful, \nsophisticated, technologically advanced military in the world.\n  Instead, he committed the full force of the United States military to \ninvade and police another country, Iraq, which had no part in the \nmurder of 3,000 Americans.\n  As bad as that sounds, the reality is even worse than that. It was \nnot just about the White House losing its focus. They misled the \nAmerican people so they could start a new war. They assumed Afghanistan \nwould stabilize itself and maybe bin Laden would turn up one day. So \nlet's add up the running tally of these ill-fated decisions of \nPresident Bush: a forgotten war against the real terrorist threat in \nAfghanistan along the Afghan-Pakistan border, plus misleading the \nAmerican people into a war of choice--not a war of necessity, where no \none from al-Qaida or bin Laden was engaged; a stunning disaster of a \nwar that had no connection to September 11--increased anger in the \nMiddle East; squandered international goodwill; becoming entrenched as \nIraq's military police force; a military stretched thin, less able to \nrespond to the real challenges of this country where Afghanistan and \nPakistan's border are.\n  I was there earlier in August with the distinguished majority leader. \nI heard what our generals said. They said they needed 10,000 troops \nminimally--now; not next year, now--to face the challenges they are \nhaving in the resurgence of the Taliban and the new tactics they have \nacquired from al-Qaida, an al-Qaida that is rushing over that border, \nplus $600 billion in U.S. taxpayers' money, easily going well over $1 \ntrillion, to secure and rebuild another country that we were told--I \nsat at those hearings--we were told, when we asked how much is this \nengagement going to cost: Oh, we were told, not more than $50 billion \nmax.\n  Madam President, $600 billion later, $12 billion a month and rising--\nby the way, not only were we told it is not $50 billion, we were told \nIraq's oil would pay for all of it. What we have seen is $600 billion \nof the taxpayers' money, later, rising clearly in excess of $1 trillion \nand Iraq having a surplus in its budget. We are running deficits, Iraq \nhas a surplus in its budget of anywhere between $50 and $70 billion, \nand yet we still continue to pay for their reconstruction. I was there \nthis past January.\n  Of course, beyond all of this, beyond all of this, the most \nimportant, incalculable loss--over 4,100 American service men and women \nwho have been lost in Iraq.\n  What does this all add up to? It adds up, in my view, to less \nsecurity here at home, one terrorist mastermind responsible for the \ndeaths of 3,000 dead Americans, plotting and planning yet again in his \nvery own safe zone to pre-September 11 strength.\n  That is a huge challenge. I recently returned from a trip to \nAfghanistan with the distinguished majority leader and several of our \ncolleagues. Our troops and their commanders are doing\n\n[[Page S8255]]\n\na terrific job with what they have been given, as they always do.\n  But the message from everything I saw when I was there and heard from \nthe people we always say let's listen to--the commanders in the field--\nwell, I listened to General McKiernan, who is the commanding general \nnot only of our troops but also the NATO forces there. I listened to \nGeneral Schlosser, who is in the midst of that part of Afghanistan that \nis in the fight. They said clearly they needed extra troops.\n  I heard the President's decision: They will not get those troops, \neven though they need them until sometime next year. In the interim, \nthe fight intensifies, the risks grow greater, and our challenges grow \nmore difficult.\n  Afghanistan and Pakistan are the epicenter, the epicenter of the \nthreat to our Nation. Things are not going to get better in that region \nor with our security here at home until we commit our focus to doing \naway with a resurgent Taliban and a resurgent al-Qaida once and for \nall.\n  Our focus must be on what are called the Federally Administered \nTribal Areas, or FATA, those lawless areas along the Afghanistan-\nPakistan border, our major challenges.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said it himself in June, so \nlet me quote him because this is the ultimate authority advising the \nPresident. He said:\n\n       I believe fundamentally if the United States is going to \n     get hit, it's going to come out of the planning that \n     leadership in the FATA is generating, their planning and \n     direction.\n\n  It could not be said more powerfully by the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff and more clearly: That is where the threat is coming \nfrom. That is where we need to focus if we are to secure our Nation.\n  Our colleague, Senator McCain, who is now the standard bearer for his \nparty, has expressed his desire to keep our troops entrenched in Iraq \neven beyond what the Iraqis want and even beyond what President Bush \nhas been calling for.\n  This does not help us with Afghanistan, this does not help us with \nOsama bin Laden, this does not help us target the threat of the Nation \nthat is most vital. So I hope that after the solemn memorials and \nheartfelt remembrances we have tomorrow, on the seventh anniversary of \nSeptember 11, after we continue to mourn and after we pray for those we \nhave lost, when our thoughts turn again to preventing a repeat of \nSeptember 11, making sure that ``never again'' means never again, I \nhope we can rededicate ourselves, as we did in the weeks following the \nattacks, to going after those responsible for this mass murder and \nridding ourselves of that threat once and for all.\n  Let us not only follow bin Laden to the gates of hell, let us follow \nbin Laden to the cave in which he is in, in that region along the \nAfghan-Pakistan border.\n  It is never too late. It is never too late to bring the masterminds \nof September 11 to justice, to diminish the real challenge to our \nsecurity, and to ultimately achieve what I truly believe is in the \nnational security interest of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, with the concurrence of the \ndistinguished chairman, I wonder if our colleague from Texas could be \nrecognized. He is a very valued member of our committee. He wants to \ndiscuss, for 8 minutes, our bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, if I might inquire, I talked to the \ndistinguished chairman. I know the Rules Committee is reviewing the \namendment. I am a little confused, and maybe he can help. I understand \nthere could be an objection to my calling up the amendment. But I know \nthe chairman is trying to work with me in trying to work this out.\n  But if I only have 8 minutes to speak, and I do not know yet whether \nthere is going to be an objection to calling it up, I guess all I can \ndo is go ahead and call it up and see what happens. But I do not wish \nto dishonor the commitment I made to him to try to work with him. But I \nam in a little bit of a box.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator would yield, the Rules Committee has \njurisdiction over the amendment, over the subject matter of the \namendment. That is why we are asking the Rules Committee to give us \ntheir reaction. Before I can give unanimous consent to make it a \npending amendment, I want to hear from the Rules Committee, which is \npart of the regular process of the Senate, since it is within their \njurisdiction.\n  So if the Senator will bear with me, I do not know what I will do if \nthe Senator asks unanimous consent until the Rules Committee replies. \nIf I do not hear from them by the moment the Senator asks unanimous \nconsent, if the Senator decides to do so, I will have to make up my \nmind without the benefit of their advice.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I hope that after hearing the subject \nmatter of this amendment, the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee will agree with me that the subject matter is of \noverwhelming importance.\n  This has to do with the fact that in 2006--2006--it is estimated that \nonly 5.5 percent of qualified military voters deployed overseas, as \nwell as civilians eligible to vote in the 2006 election, only 5.5 \npercent actually had their votes counted.\n  Of the troops that attempted to vote by asking for their ballots in \n2006, less than half, only 47.6 percent of their completed ballots \nactually arrived back at the local election office and were counted. \nThat is according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.\n  I know all our colleagues would agree that if there is anyone who \ndeserves to have their vote counted, and certainly this is a \nfundamental civil right for all American citizens, but if anyone is \nentitled to the best efforts that this body could possibly supply to \nmake sure their vote is actually counted, that it would be our men and \nwomen in harm's way, fighting to protect our very freedoms.\n  To me, this is an outrage of such proportion that I cannot believe \nthe Department of Defense, knowing these statistics, is simply \ncomplacent about preserving and protecting the right of our deployed \nmilitary and civilians overseas to vote in elections.\n  To me, this is an appalling feature of our absentee voting system, \nand we need to take action right now. Of course, the appropriate \nvehicle as we are talking about protecting the right of military voters \nis on the Defense authorization bill. We know time is running out, only \n54 days, I believe, until the next general election. We need to do \neverything in our power to make sure their right to vote is protected.\n  That is why I decided to introduce a bill last May called the \nMilitary Voting Protection Act of 2008. Currently, I believe I have, to \nthe stand-alone bill, 30 cosponsors.\n\n  I believe the Department of Defense, if it is unwilling to take the \nnecessary steps to protect the rights to vote for our deployed troops, \nthen it is up to us to direct them to do so, to mandate that \nrequirement in law and to make it a priority, not something they get \naround to perhaps after they have done everything else.\n  Certainly, the Department of Defense can better use modern technology \nto protect the ability of our troops to participate in elections. We \nknow it is also important to recognize the right of privacy and the \nintegrity of the voting system by calling upon the Department of \nDefense to focus its efforts on secure, efficient systems that would \nachieve these important goals.\n  I have more extended remarks, but I do not feel they are necessary at \nthis time. I have seen a letter from the Department of Defense about \nsome of their responses to the bill I have introduced. I would say in \neach case it is classified more as bureaucratic gobbledygook and not a \nserious effort to try to solve this problem.\n  I am actually very disappointed that the Department of Defense would \ntake the position that preserving the votes of our deployed military is \nso unimportant that they would not welcome the participation of the \nSenate in finding ways to make sure every fighting man and woman's vote \nis counted.\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment 5329 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I am constrained and will \nobject at this time because of the reasons\n\n[[Page S8256]]\n\nI gave before. So I do object. I hope this objection can be dealt with \novernight. I hope I can hear from the Rules Committee and understand \nwhat their position is. But at least at this time I will object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I am sorry to hear the chairman has \nobjected. Of course, there is no requirement that the committee pass on \nthese matters. I understand his interest in getting their input, but I \ncannot imagine what sort of input the Rules Committee might give now or \nlater that we could not work on this either as this bill proceeds to \ncompletion, I hope to completion this week or next or during the \nconference committee process.\n  But to object to my ability to actually get it pending before the \nSenate is regrettable. At this point, I have no other recourse.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the distinguished chairman and I are aware the \nSenate would now turn to the highway bill. I believe the distinguished \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee will be \narriving, and the distinguished ranking member is present on the floor \nat this time. Perhaps they could advise us with regard to the amount of \ntime that would be required to have to act on this.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first of all, let me thank the \ndistinguished ranking member for the fine work he is doing on the \nDefense authorization bill. We have to get this done at a later time \nbecause there will not be time.\n  Right now I would like to address some of the comments that were made \nin the last few minutes about what some people misinterpret as not a \nsuccessful operation in Iraq. I think it is amazing that you can be \nsuccessful, all of our troops over there bathe in the success we have \nhad in Iraq and still refer to it as an invasion instead of a \nliberation. Later on I will address those remarks.\n  Right now it is my understanding--I would ask if it is accurate--that \nthe chairman and myself, the ranking member of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, will be involved in about either 1 hour or 90 \nminutes equally divided, I would ask the Chair. This is on the highway \ntrust fund fix.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8256-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8256-S8264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RESTORING HIGHWAY TRUST FUND BALANCE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 6532, and \nthat the Senate then proceed to its consideration; that the only \namendment in order be the Baucus amendment which is at the desk; that \nthe amendment be considered as agreed to and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table; and that there then be 90 minutes of debate \nwith respect to the bill, as amended, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between the leaders or their designees; and that upon the \nuse or yielding back, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the \nbill, as amended, without further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, it is my \nunderstanding that under the current unanimous consent agreement, we \nwill begin voting on two amendments on the Defense authorization bill \nat 6 o'clock; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the unanimous consent request of the Senator from \nCalifornia modify the existing unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote that is scheduled to occur at 6 p.m. \nwill occur unless an agreement specifies differently.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is my understanding that this agreement does not \nspecify differently, and on that basis I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6532) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to restore the Highway Trust Fund balance.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, this is an important moment for us, not \njust for us as legislators acting responsibly but for our States and \nfor the working people of this country. We were perilously close to \nhaving a shortfall in the highway trust fund which would have resulted \nin slowing down contracts on repairing bridges, building highways, et \ncetera. Six times the Senate has brought up legislation to restore \nmoney to the highway trust fund and protect those jobs, but until now \nmy Republican friends on the other side of the aisle have put up \nroadblocks and filibustered us.\n  Today, at a hearing we held on the status of our bridges, the \ncondition of our bridges, the Bush administration itself urged us to \nact. I was very grateful to Senator Inhofe for his work. Because we \nhave been facing objections from Senators DeMint, Gregg, and others, we \nwere unable to move forward. We are very grateful we have reached this \nmoment so we may vote on this important legislation and solve the \nimmediate crisis.\n  We all know what has been happening with the trust fund. First, $8 \nbillion was borrowed from the trust fund in 1998. We need to restore \nthose funds. That is what we are doing today. Beyond that, we have to \nfigure out a way to finance highways and transit systems and repair \nbridges and the rest with a more secure source of funding. Senator \nInhofe and I are working together on that, along with Senators Isakson, \nBaucus, and the rest of the members of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. We know our colleagues in the House are doing it as well. We \nare going to have to look at how we keep pace with the many billions of \ndollars needed for repair. We have to make sure we pay attention to our \nNation's infrastructure if we care about a thriving economy, moving \ngoods, moving people, all the rest. If we ignore this, it is to our \ndetriment. We saw a bridge collapse in Minnesota. We were reminded of \nthat today at the hearing. All of us were appalled to see what that \nlooks like. I know bridges in California, in Oklahoma, bridges all over \nthe country are in need of repair. We can't play politics. That is why \nwe have been on the Senate floor. We have sent letters, asked our \nfriends to back off. If they want to make a statement about how to fund \ntransit and highways, that is very appropriate as we write the new \nhighway bill.\n  What is happening out there is, obviously, because of the horrible \nprice of gas, which, thank goodness, has come down a little bit, people \nare turning away from driving or they are doubling up. They are \nswitching to hybrid cars. Hopefully, soon we will see more \nopportunities for electric cars. As a result, however, the trust fund, \nwhich gets its funding from the gas tax, has been going down. That, \ncoupled with the borrowing that we did in 1998 from the trust fund, has \nled us to this day.\n  I don't have much more of a statement except I want to thank certain \npeople who weighed in to push us and my friends on the other side. I \nhope they were pushed by this to back off and say: Let's have a clean \nbill. Let's fix the problem. Then we will debate how we get a highway \ntrust fund that is necessary for the needs of the country.\n  AAA was very helpful, as was the American Association of State \nHighway and Transportation Officials; the American Society of Civil \nEngineers; the American Road and Transportation Builders Association; \nthe American Highway Users Alliance; the American Trucking Association; \nthe Associated General Contractors of America; the National Association \nof Counties; the National Association of Manufacturers; the National \nGovernors Association; the National Conference of State Legislatures; \nMidwestern Governors' Association; the Coalition of Northeastern \nGovernors; the Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO; the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce.\n  Again, what we are doing is simply restoring the revenue that was \nshifted out of the trust fund 10 years ago when the balances were high. \nWhat we are doing is saying to many working people that we are not \ngoing to let them run the risk of being laid off, fired, having to come \nhome and tell their family they can't work. We know that is a fact \nbecause each billion dollars of\n\n[[Page S8257]]\n\nFederal funding is estimated to support 34,000 jobs. If we didn't act \non this and that $8 billion was not restored, we would have lost \n379,000 jobs all across America; in my own State, 32,000 jobs. This is \nnot the time to play games. In August, we lost 84,000 jobs in America. \nImagine if we had added another 379,000 lost jobs.\n  Today, through the wonders of communication I can say to State and \nlocal officials watching us have confidence that the flow of funds to \nbuild and operate transportation systems, to build highways and \nbridges, to make sure communities are insured, those funds are going to \nbe there. Again, as we move behind this crisis, I do look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Senator Inhofe \nand I, Senators Baucus and Isakson, we call ourselves the big four of \nthe committee. We have met. Our staffs are meeting every day. We are \nmeeting. We are coming up with principles, what is the fair way to fund \ninfrastructure needs. These meetings have been very important. They are \nnot ideological. They are only business. How do we take care of \nbusiness? That means moving goods, people, keeping the country going. I \ncan't tell my colleagues how pleased I am that we can have the \nopportunity today to vote on a clean bill, simply restoring the $8 \nbillion that was borrowed from this fund and sending a signal to the \n300,000-plus people who would have lost their jobs, at least this is \nsome bit of good news for them in what has been a very bleak economy.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time through the \nleader's office on our side.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5427\n\n       (Purpose: To change the date of restoration.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the previous order, amendment No. \n5427 is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5427) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 2, strike ``September 30, 2008'' and insert \n     ``the date of the enactment of this Act''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time on the \nRepublican side be allocated as follows: 15 minutes for Senator DeMint, \n10 minutes for Senator Gregg, 10 minutes for Senator Coburn, 10 minutes \nfor Senator Inhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I don't object, Mr. President, but I would also like to \nbe included in that particular order just given.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to address the issue of this \nhighway bill and the charge that it has been held by me and a few \nothers. The fact is, this $8 billion highway trust fund bailout has not \nbeen held up. The only request was that it come to the floor with some \ndebate and the opportunity for amendment, which is the normal Senate \nprocess. The request was that this $8 billion be passed in secret \nessentially with no vote and no debate. Our only request as Senators \nwas that we have a chance to bring to light why this happened.\n  A few years from now--maybe even a few months--many of my colleagues \nare going to wake up and look at our Nation's finances and wonder how \nwe got in this mess. We are running this country into the ground, and \nwe are actually on the verge of an economic crisis because of \nincredible overspending and a huge growing debt. One bill after another \ncomes up, and we pass it almost without thinking and spend more and \nmore borrowed money.\n  Today's votes are creating tomorrow's fiscal disaster. This $8 \nbillion highway trust fund bailout is only one example among many I \nwould like to mention over the next few minutes.\n  During the previous year, the Democratic-controlled Congress has \nproduced a parade of fiscally irresponsible bills that have mortgaged \nour Nation's future and could ultimately bankrupt the Nation and harm \nthe future for our children and grandchildren. If we look at the 2008 \nappropriations bills, at the end of 2007 Congress passed a bloated \nbudget bill. Supposedly, they were going to get things under control, \nbut this exploded with over 10,000 earmarks. On top of that, there were \na number of budget tricks and gimmicks that hid at least $14 billion of \nextra spending.\n  Not too long after, we brought up the farm bill. This was \nreauthorizing an antiquated farm program that cost taxpayers billions \nand increased costs to consumers all across the country. This was a \n$600 billion bill over 10 years. It was all borrowed money. We don't \nhave this money to spend. Yet we continue to spend it. It included \nnumerous wasteful, unnecessary earmarks that had nothing to do with a \nsolid farm bill. Just a few examples would be $257 million in tax \nearmarks for Plum Creek Timber Company. This is the Nation's largest \nprivate landowner, a multibillion-dollar company with over $7 billion \nin capitalization. Yet we believed we needed to give them $257 million.\n  The language in the farm bill also requires the Forest Service to \nsell portions of a certain mountain to a ski resort and over $1 million \nto the national sheep and goat industry--all worthy causes, I am sure, \nbut not worthy of more borrowed money and more debt on the future of \nAmericans.\n  The so-called stimulus package, over $100 billion was supposed to \nhelp solve our problems. Certainly, it didn't. We sent checks to all \nAmericans but did little to fix the problem. Over $100 billion more in \nborrowed money that we didn't have, just sending checks to people to \nbuild up our political clout rather than do something for the country.\n  We need to have a predictable Tax Code, lower our corporate tax rate, \nmake the current tax rates permanent so businesses and investors know \nwhat their tax rate will be in the future. But we don't debate that. We \njust send out checks with borrowed money.\n  Everyone knows more and more about the housing bill. The housing bill \nbailed out mortgage companies that had made bad loans and ultimately \nincluded a section that allowed the U.S. Government to essentially \nnationalize the mortgage industry. As part of that bill, we created a \n$4 billion deficit spending slush fund for community development block \ngrants and millions that went to a very suspect group, the ACORN group. \nThat seems to be more of a political group to get out the vote for some \nof our colleagues.\n  Now, we know we have taken over these two large companies of Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac. Now the taxpayers are on the hook for what could \nbe hundreds of billions of dollars because of the lack of congressional \noversight over the last several years. As part of that bill, I had \nasked for one amendment that would stop the lobbying and the \ncontributions to Congress by these two corporations that we are now \nbailing out. But instead of giving me that amendment, the majority \nleader kept the Senate here until Saturday to avoid that one vote that \nwould have done what all of us know needs to be done and stopped the \npolitical influence from these companies for which we are supposed to \nbe providing oversight.\n  Today we are talking about $8 billion that we are going to borrow and \nput in the highway trust fund. Supposedly back in the late 1990s, $8 \nbillion was taken as part of an agreement to set up a separate trust \nfund. I will take them at their word for that. But we have had numerous \nopportunities this year to save more than that amount of money, if we \nknew we needed it. Frankly, the Department of Transportation says we \nprobably only need about half of that right now. Yet we are going to \ntake $8 billion from the general fund, borrow it, and put it in the \ntrust fund.\n  Highway infrastructure is one of the most important things we can do \nas a Nation.\n  But much of this bill is not about roads and bridges. It is numerous, \nwasteful earmarks that I am afraid could end up as part of this $8 \nbillion. The current bill includes $45 million for a magnetic \nlevitation train project in Las Vegas; $2.5 million for landscaping \nenhancements along a freeway; $3.3 million for a bike trail in Laredo, \nTX. This list could go on page after page. These are not priority \nprojects. They do not deserve us going into more debt as a nation to \nborrow this money.\n  We have had numerous opportunities to cut these projects so that the \nhighway trust fund would not go broke. Only a few months ago, we had a \ntransportation technical corrections bill. We had almost a billion \ndollars of projects\n\n[[Page S8258]]\n\nthat were no longer needed or wanted by the States. Yet, instead of \nsaving that $1 billion, we added back essentially the same amount of \nnew projects.\n  Now we are here at the trough again, and we have a crisis, and we \nwill put a lot of people out of work if we do not produce this bill. \nThat is why we have agreed to forgo the opportunity to offer \namendments, even though we should not pass an $8 billion bill without \nthe opportunity to debate it in more detail.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues, we do not have this $8 billion. It is \nborrowed money, and we are going to move it from one account to \nanother, and borrow it from who knows where--China or somewhere else--\nbecause we do not have that money. But there are numerous problems with \nthis, and we need to recognize that the earmarks, the wasteful \nearmarks, are taking priority national projects and putting them places \nthey do not need to be. Our lack of an energy policy in this Nation \nthat has run up the cost of gasoline has restricted the ability of \nAmericans to travel, and that in itself has reduced the revenues to the \ntrust fund. So we have caused this problem ourselves by congressional \nmismanagement, and now we want the taxpayers to bail us out again.\n  Again, this is a bill I think we need as far as funding projects. But \nthe way it is done, and the fact that it is done with no more \naccountability on earmarks and the things that have caused the \nproblems, makes it very difficult to support the bill, even though I \nsee long-term highway funding being one of the most important things we \ncan do.\n  I hope the chairman and ranking member of the committee will consider \nnext year, as we go into reauthorizing a highway program, the fact that \nthe Federal Government should no longer be involved in non-Federal \nprojects around the country. We have an opportunity to devolve this \nprogram to the States, where the money would stay at home and be used \nfor real priorities, not for things I decide or another colleague \ndecides they want for somebody back home where the State does not \nnecessarily want it to go.\n  Obviously, we have talked a lot about the ``bridge to nowhere'' and \nother projects such as that across the country. But I hope I will get \nthe support of my colleagues to move this back to the States, give them \nthe ability to manage their own programs over the years, and stop this \nwasteful spending at the Federal level.\n  Again, there are a number of amendments we would have liked to have \nhad the opportunity to offer, and I wish to warn my colleagues, the \npattern that is developing here is that we are passing bills by \nunanimous consent, with no debate, no amendments. This goes on bill \nafter bill. We are passing very bad legislation with very little \naccountability to the American people.\n  But I appreciate the passion of Senator Inhofe and others who know we \nneed to push this through, and it is not fair to the States or to the \nworkers to blindside them with shortfalls as we have. But the \nshortfalls are of our own doing, and it is because of our own waste and \nincompetence here in Congress that we have ended up with this problem \nand more debt on the American people. I hope next year we will go about \ndoing it in a much better way than we have done in the past.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to talk \nabout the emergency we are facing in the highway trust fund. The \nhighway trust fund is the primary means of funding all of our highway \nconstruction and repair projects in every State in this Nation.\n  Last Friday, President Bush's Transportation Secretary, Mary Peters, \nacknowledged finally what we on this side have been warning about for \nmonths: that the highway account of our highway trust fund is broke.\n  We have been hearing denials of this crisis for some time, but the \nBush administration has now finally taken a closer look at the real \nreceipts that are coming in from the Federal gas tax and discovered \ntheir estimates have been off by some $3 billion just since May. Now \nthey tell us they are preparing to default on their bills to our \nStates.\n  Let me make it very clear to everyone how serious the impact could \nbe. If we do not pass the bill that is before the Senate this evening, \nmy Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee is going to be forced to \nslash money for Federal highway investments in every State across the \ncountry, and it is going to cost each of our States tens of millions of \ndollars in the next month alone.\n  Not only does this threaten the safety of our Nation's roads and \nbridges, it could also very easily mean tens of thousands of jobs lost, \nas the Federal Government defaults on the contracts in every State of \nour Union.\n  Now, this nightmare is going to become a reality just as the \nunemployment rate has reached the highest it has been in nearly 5 \nyears. Our country lost 84,000 jobs in August alone--84,000 jobs--which \ncame on top of job losses in July and June and, in fact, every month of \nthis year.\n  We know people across this country are hurting. Many are wondering \nhow they are going to be able to pay their bills as the weather now \nstarts to get colder and they have to begin turning on their heat.\n  If we do not shore up this trust fund, we are going to be forced to \nhalt ongoing highway projects dead in their tracks. That means \nthousands upon thousands of people who go to work every day in the \nconstruction industry in our Nation to build our highways and bridges \nare going to be told to go home and do not come back to work the next \nmorning.\n  The urgency of this bill is very critical. We cannot delay it. I hope \nwe can put aside the ideology and partisanship for the evening and \neveryone can work together for the good of the Nation on this critical \nissue because we literally cannot afford to wait any longer.\n  I want to explain the situation so my colleagues understand where we \nstand this evening. This coming Thursday--that is tomorrow--may be the \nlast time the Federal Government will be able to reimburse 100 percent \nof their expenses. The Department of Transportation has told my \nTransportation and Housing Appropriations Subcommittee that on \nThursday, September 18--that is a week from tomorrow--reimbursements \ncould drop to as little as 64 percent of the funds that States are due. \nThey simply have to offer the States an IOU for the rest.\n  In my home State of Washington, 21 percent of the transportation \nbudget is supported by the Federal gas tax. Local agencies spend \nbetween $15 million and $30 million per month in Federal dollars. If \nthe Federal Government has to cut back or cut off funds, Washington \nState will lose between $33 million and $54 million a month over the \nnext 5 months.\n\n  That is only one State, one example in this country. In other States, \nthe Federal Government's share is a lot bigger than in Washington \nState. In fact, at a hearing this morning, the Oklahoma Transportation \nDirector, Gary Ridley, testified to the Senate about the impact it will \nhave in his State. In answer to questions, he said, in Oklahoma, 85 \npercent of the State's construction program--85 percent--is paid for \nwith Federal funds. He said the kind of crisis we are talking about \nwill have a ``dramatic effect'' on his State's ability to move forward \non road construction.\n  He told us that in Oklahoma they just opened bids on $80 million in \nhighway work, including a $40 million project to replace a bridge in \nOklahoma City that has been identified as having numerous safety \nvulnerabilities. But Mr. Ridley testified this morning he has had to \nask his State highway commission to hold off on those contracts. In \nfact, he said he might even have to stop all right-of-way acquisition \nand construction projects until we here in Congress find a solution to \nthis trust fund crisis.\n  So this is a desperate situation in every State across the country. \nWhat is most disturbing to me is it is not as though we did not know \nthis was coming. I have been sounding the alarm about the highway trust \nfund for almost 2 years. My Democratic colleagues and I have warned \nrepeatedly that we face a looming disaster. We have proposed a solution \nthat would enable these funds to stay solvent, so our States are whole, \nso our construction industry can continue during this construction \nseason to move forward on these critical safety transportation \nprojects. We have made it clear that\n\n[[Page S8259]]\n\nwithout action this year, we would face a financial disaster, and that \nit was coming upon us very fast.\n  Well, the situation is so serious that after months of blocking our \nlegislative solution, this administration, the Bush administration, did \na 180 and is now asking us--in fact, telling us--we have to get a bill \non the President's desk by the end of this week. So I am very hopeful \nthis evening we can finally move this bill and provide a solution to \nour States.\n  What this bill does is replace $8 billion that was taken out of the \nhighway trust fund back at the end of 1998. This is not a bailout from \nthe general fund of the Treasury. That $8 billion was collected from \nour gas taxes for the purposes of being deposited into the highway \ntrust fund.\n  Now, at the time, the trust fund was flush with money and people did \nnot think we needed it. Well, clearly, we need it now. We are proposing \nto restore that $8 billion that was paid in gas tax receipts to the \ntrust fund, and we are not asking for a penny more.\n  This is not new to anyone in this body. We have debated this proposal \nbefore. I and my ranking member on the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Bond, included this proposed transfer in our \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill. So \nit has been a bipartisan effort in our Senate Transportation \nSubcommittee.\n  In fact, Democrats also tried to pass this proposal back in June on \nthe FAA bill. We included it in the tax extender package. We tried to \npass it as part of the stimulus bill.\n  Well, we are back this evening. We have another chance. We are \nworking on a bipartisan basis to move this critical bill forward, and I \nurge my colleagues again to get this done this evening because, as I \nsaid, we are going to start seeing severe consequences to this crisis \nif we do not act and work together on this now.\n  As I said, this Thursday--tomorrow--could be the last day that our \nStates are fully reimbursed for construction work. So by this time next \nweek, States may have to start doing without. The stakes could not be \nhigher. Mr. President, 84,000 jobs were lost last month. We cannot \nafford to put another job at risk. But, importantly, these construction \ncontracts are out there and we are in the middle of construction \nseason. Our States need to know we stand by our word and this money is \ngoing to go out to them in a timely fashion.\n  I thank my Democratic colleagues, as well as our Republican \ncolleagues, who have been working with us this evening in a bipartisan \nway to finally move this bill forward and solve this crisis that is in \nfront of us.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we do not have a UC on the majority side, \nbut we do on the minority side. So our next speakers will be in the \norder of 10 minutes for Senator Gregg, 10 minutes for Senator Coburn, \nand then I will wind up the final 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, there is no question there is a serious \nproblem out there relative to the financing of already let contracts in \nroad construction and that it is unfair to those people who have had \nthose contracts and those people who are working on those projects that \nthey should be blindsided by the fiscal irresponsibility of the \nCongress. But it is also inappropriate to the taxpayers of the United \nStates that we should correct this problem in a way which does even \nmore egregious harm to the future of this country by significantly \nexpanding the deficit.\n  Just yesterday, we learned that the deficit of the United States has \ndoubled under this Congress. It has gone from $163 billion to $407 \nbillion. This is a huge increase in the deficit. What does the deficit \nmean? We are passing debt on to our children which they all have to pay \nfor. Now we are going to, with this bill, add another $8 billion to \nthat deficit--$8 billion. That is big money. Eight billion dollars \nwould run the State of New Hampshire for at least 2 years, probably for \n2\\1/2\\ years, so it is a lot of dollars. So this decision, the way it \nis being executed, the way we are approaching solving the problem of \nthe highway trust fund running short of funds, although it needs to be \ndone--we need to address the issue of let contracts. The way we are \ntrying to correct the problem is the wrong way. We shouldn't be adding \nto the deficit to do this.\n  This is pretty much a self-inflicted wound, and it is really an \nintentionally self-inflicted wound. When the SAFETEA bill was passed, \nit was passed with the knowledge--the open knowledge, which was pointed \nout on this floor by a number of us--that the revenues in the highway \ntrust fund, which would come from gas tax and which had always paid for \nhighway construction, were not going to be enough to meet the largess \nof that bill. The avarice of our colleagues to spend money far \noutweighed the money that was coming into the trust fund.\n  We knew that in the term of SAFETEA that this was going to happen, \nthat the lines were going to cross and that the trust fund would be \ndepleted. That depletion was accelerated, obviously, by the fact that \nenergy prices went up and people, rightly and appropriately, started to \naggressively conserve their use of gasoline, and that was good for the \ncountry and good for ourselves in dealing with this issue of gas \nprices. However, it had the effect of reducing the revenues into the \ntrust fund. So the day of reckoning, which was inevitable under the \noriginal SAFETEA bill, was accelerated and, according to the \nadministration, occurred sort of out of the blue because 2 weeks ago \nthey were saying they would have vetoed a bill such as this that added \nto the deficit, and now they are saying they support it. So they \nreversed their position on the basis of information they received in \nthe last 2 weeks about the status of the trust fund.\n  Why was the original SAFETEA bill so out of whack? Well, it was out \nof whack because it included 6,000 earmarked special projects--some of \nwhich were listed by my colleague from South Carolina, Senator DeMint--\nwhich totaled $24 billion of spending, which we didn't have money to \npay for, yet we put them on the books anyway. Then, a year ago or so, \nwhen we could have contracted those projects, we went by lapsing those \nprojects which nobody wanted to pursue--$1 billion worth--we decided \nnot to. We decided instead to expand projects and add even more \nprojects.\n  There has been a representation that this $8 billion raid on the \ngeneral fund by the highway fund is just a repayment for a loan that \noccurred in the late 1990s, as it is represented--1998, I believe it \nwas--when the highway trust fund allegedly transferred $8 billion to \nthe general fund. Well, that is truly a straw dog argument because \nthose monies never had any practical effect on Federal spending or the \nFederal deficit--that transfer, that event--but this event does. This \nis real dollars. This event is a real $8 billion increase in the \ndeficit. Somebody is going to have to pay for it, and the people who \nare going to have to pay for it basically are these young men and women \nright here who are serving us as pages. When they get out--they are \njuniors in high school, and when they get out of high school and go to \ncollege, which I am sure they all will, when they graduate they are \ngoing to start a job, and when they start that job they will find there \nis a big tax bill, and a large chunk of that tax bill is going to be \nfor debt we are running up here today. So 8, 10, 12, 15 years from now, \nwhen they are starting to make their living and trying to raise their \nchildren, trying to send their kids to college, trying to buy their \nfirst home, they are going to be limited in what they can do. Why? \nBecause they are going to have to pay a huge amount of taxes for costs \nwhich are being incurred right here today by adding to our deficit, and \nthis is $8 billion of our costs that we are putting onto the next \ngeneration.\n  This is not the correct way to do it. There are ways to pay for this. \nThere are ways to do this that do not involve that. The cleanest would \nbe to simply borrow the money--not from the general fund but from the \nmass-transit accounts which have the money--and that was what the \nadministration suggested. It was rejected by the House because the \nHouse didn't want to be responsible. Now we are in this tight \ntimeframe, and it is claimed that we can't have any amendments here in \nthe Senate. We simply have to take care of this. Actually, there is \nsome legitimacy to the tight time argument, but\n\n[[Page S8260]]\n\nit doesn't mean we shouldn't have any amendments to discuss this.\n  I proposed an amendment, Senator DeMint proposed an amendment, and \nSenator Coburn.\n  My amendment was to try to avoid this in the future by reinstituting \nrules around here which used to discipline our spending but which were, \nin the dark of night, eviscerated by those who wanted to spend a lot of \nmoney we don't have out of the highway trust fund. Two rules--one, that \nthis should have a scoring event and should be subject to pay-go. How \ncan a group of folks around here who carry a pay-go flag around as if \nit is the banner of fiscal responsibility say that pay-go shouldn't \napply to a transfer which is going to create an $8 billion deficit--an \n$8 billion add-on to the deficit? Inexcusable. That was part of my \namendment, to make pay-go applicable here.\n  The second part was to reinstitute what is known as the Byrd Rule. \nByrd developed language which said that as the trust fund--as it became \napparent that the trust fund monies were not going to meet trust fund \nobligations, you reduce the obligations, and that was called the Byrd \nRule. It was the responsible way to govern. You pay as you go. As money \ncomes in, you spend the money. If you have a trust fund that funds a \nproject, as that trust fund has money to pay for that project, you \nspend the money to pay for that project. But when SAFETEA was passed, \neverybody knew that a lot more money was being promised than was going \nto come in, so a little game was played in the middle of the night: \nLet's put a knife into the Byrd Rule. Let's cut it in half. Let's \neviscerate it. That is exactly what happened. So I am just suggesting \nthat we reinstitute the Byrd Rule. It won't apply to this event, but at \nleast prospectively it will. Fiscal responsibility--that is all I am \nasking for.\n  Unfortunately, it has been represented that we can't take up any \namendments because we have to do this in a matter of hours or else \nthese contracts can't go forward. Well, we could obviously have taken \nup the amendments. Clearly, we are going to spend 2 hours debating \nthis. I only wanted 15 minutes to debate my amendment. It clearly could \nhave been done in this 2-hour period. No, the issue was that we didn't \nwant to take up any amendments that might make people have to take a \nhard vote. That was the issue: a hard vote on fiscal responsibility, on \nthe issue of putting pay-go back in place and putting the Byrd Rule \nback in. So, using the leverage of people being put out of work and \ncontracts which had been let not being paid for, the other side has \nbeen able to successfully get around making those hard votes. I \nrecognize the eccentricity of the situation, but it still doesn't look \nwell, and it is not correct.\n  At some point, we are going to have to face up to this, you know. One \ngeneration should not do this to another generation. One generation \nshould not constantly run up the debt on the next generation and take \ncredit for the spending today which they are not willing to pay for. It \nis just not right. As a politician running for reelection, I shouldn't \nsay: Oh, I got this project for my State, we are going to build this \nprogram right here, and then not be willing to say I was willing to pay \nfor it also; instead, say: Oh, well, as to paying for it, I am going to \nlet my children and my grandchildren, my neighbors' children and my \nneighbors' grandchildren worry about that problem. I am just going to \ndo the project and take credit for it.\n  So what we are doing here is totally inappropriate from a fiscal \nstandpoint, but obviously the timing of this is such that we are not \ngoing to get these votes. I intend to return to this amendment. I will \nfind someplace to stick it on, and then everybody will have to vote on \nthis, hopefully, at some point in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, seeing no one on the other side of the \naisle, I yield to the junior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have listened to the debate today and \nthe majority leader's remarks this morning, and I do appreciate the job \nmy senior Senator has done in trying to secure funds for infrastructure \nthrough the trust fund. I intend to support passing this. Begrudgingly \nI will support it because I think it is the wrong way to do it. It is \nnot wrong to put the additional money in there; it is wrong to not pay \nfor it.\n  I can't help but note that the Senator from Washington stated that \nthis is an emergency. Well, you haven't seen anything when you start \ntalking about the emergencies we are getting ready to face. What about \nthe emergency when, by law, Social Security benefits get cut, when we \ncan't make Medicare trust fund payments? What emergency are we going to \nhave? How is this going to compare to that? We are not allowed to do \nanything on this bill except debate.\n  I wonder what the American people would think, that we are going to \nspend an additional $8 billion that we don't have--whether it is owed \nto the trust fund or not, we don't have it--that we are going to \ncollect that money but we are not going to pay for it out of some of \nthe $300 billion-plus waste we now know exists every year in the \nFederal Government? Imagine if you applied that to your own situation. \nYou have a family. You have an emergency, as the Senator from \nWashington said, but you know that about 12 percent of everything you \nspend in your household is wasted. Are you going to go out and make a \nnote at the bank and have your kids be responsible for paying for it or \nare you as a family going to get rid of some of the 11 percent or 12 \npercent of pure waste, pure fraud that you have going on in your family \nbudget? None of us in America are going to do that. We wouldn't do that \nto our kids. We wouldn't do that in our family budget. But that is \nexactly what we are doing here today. This is a small one. This is a \nsmall one we are facing.\n  We didn't have an amendment on the floor to say we will pay for this \n$8 billion by reducing the fraud in Medicare from $80 billion to $72 \nbillion. There is $80 billion a year in fraud in Medicare. We weren't \noffered the opportunity to offer that amendment to get rid of the fraud \nin Medicare so we could afford to do this. It was just released 2 weeks \nago that 31 percent of the payments Medicare makes are improper \npayments, with 80 percent of them overpayments. That is not included in \nthe $80 billion worth of fraud. There is not any opportunity for us to \noffer an amendment to offset that incompetence and clean that up so we \ncan pay for this.\n  There are similar projects in Medicaid. The Social Security \ndisability trust fund--the GAO tells us there is $2.5 billion a year in \nfraud in the Social Security disability trust fund. We didn't have an \nopportunity to offer an amendment to get rid of that fraud to help pay \nfor some of this $8 billion shortfall.\n  The American people are going to be scratching their heads. We are \ngoing to borrow more, and we are not going to eliminate any of the \nother problems, any of the other excess, or any of the other waste or \nfraud, which came to over $382 billion this past year of American \ntaxpayers' money that was unwisely spent.\n  We weren't given an opportunity to get rid of the performance bonuses \nat the Pentagon that are $8 billion that they pay every year to \nPentagon contractors who do not meet the performance requirements of \ntheir contracts but they pay them anyway. There was no opportunity for \nus to offer that amendment, to be able to pay for this rather than \ncharge it to our children.\n  There is $15 billion worth of excess costs associated with no-bid \ncontracts at the Department of Homeland Security. There is no \nopportunity to offer an amendment to change the discipline in the \ncontracting at Homeland Security, which we could have easily done and \nmandated to pay for this. There is no opportunity to do that.\n  There is $4 billion in wasted excess payments for crop insurance \nevery year. We, in fact, passed a farm bill, but we didn't fix that.\n  That is $4 billion a year of hard-earned taxpayer money that goes out \nthe window, which doesn't benefit anybody. Yet we are not given an \nopportunity to try to grab that to pay for this, and $10 billion is \nwasted a year, at a minimum, on IT contracts in the\n\n[[Page S8261]]\n\nFederal Government. There is no opportunity to offer to save that money \nto pay for the highways.\n  The American people have to be scratching their heads and saying: \nWhat are we doing? Why aren't we addressing the real issues? We need to \nbuild infrastructure, take care of our highways and bridges and our \nroads. That is what the trust fund is for. Why would we not pay for it \nwhen we have such a large amount of fraud, waste, and duplication in \nthe Federal budget?\n  I could go on and on. There is mismanagement of U.N. contributions. \nWe know at least $2 billion out of the $6 billion we send to U.N. is \npure waste every year. There is no opportunity to offer that amendment \nagainst this. There is no opportunity whatsoever to say we are not \ngoing to send another penny to the U.N. until they show us how they are \nspending American taxpayers' money. The only government that is less \nefficient than ours is the U.N. The only one that obfuscates more of \nthe numbers than ours is the U.N. The only one with less transparency \nthan ours is the U.N. There is no opportunity to do that.\n  We wanted to offer an amendment because part of the problem with the \nhighway trust fund is that too much of the money doesn't go for \nbridges, roads, and highways. My senior Senator is committed to making \nsure we get back on that with the next Transportation bill. We have \n242,000 bridges in disrepair in this country--242,000. This body \nrejected fixing that. Instead, we went on to build bike trails. Which \ndo you think is more of a safety concern, building bike trails or \nbuilding bridges?\n  I hope the American people are paying attention to what we are doing \nand that they become very dissatisfied with what we are doing. We have \nearned our 11-percent approval rating. How we are handling this bill \ntoday exactly fits the expectations of the American people--that \nCongress doesn't get it, that we are different, that we don't have to \nmeet the expectations that every small business and every family does. \nWe don't have to eliminate waste because it may be hard to do or we may \nhave to take a hard vote. We just fit the mold of their expectations. \nIt is time for us to change that, not just for us but for the \ngenerations that follow.\n  I will state to you today that the estimates for next year's budget \ndeficit are far under what it will actually be. We will be much closer \nto $1 trillion than we will be to $500 billion. Think about $1 \ntrillion. That is $3,300 for every man, woman, and child we are going \nto spend next year that we don't have. We are not going to add it to \nthe seniors because they are never going to pay it back. If you are \nborn today, instead of owing $410,000, which you will ultimately be \nresponsible for in terms of unfunded liabilities, we are going to move \nyou to about $500,000. None of our kids can afford that. We are \nstealing America away from our children. The process--not the goal; the \ngoal is a worthy one--under which we are doing this is something that \ncannot continue if our Republic is to survive.\n  Of every republic in the history of the world that has failed, none \nof them failed because they were conquered from without. Every one of \nthem failed on fiscal issues. We should wake up. We should start \naddressing the waste, fraud, abuse, and duplication in the Federal \nbudget before we ask the next child or grandchild to take on debt for \nour benefit.\n  Like I said, I support that we are putting the $8 billion in there. \nWhat I don't support is the process under which we cannot eliminate \nother waste, fraud, and other duplication to be able to pay for it. We \ndo a disservice to our country and to ourselves, and we do a disservice \nto the body of the Senate.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 28\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am here to talk about the need to replenish the \nfunds in the highway trust fund. I have to tell you, I have visited our \nState, and you know that about a year ago a bridge just fell down in \nthe middle of the Mississippi River. I was thinking as I listened to \nthe Senator from Oklahoma talk about the promises that we make to our \nchildren, that we make to future generations. I think the people of \nthis country think we made a promise to them that we are going to have \nsafe roads and safe bridges. We didn't keep up that promise to the 13 \npeople who died that day when they plummeted into the Mississippi \nRiver. We didn't keep the promise to the hundreds of people who were \ninjured in all the cars that went crashing down on an eight-lane \nhighway in the middle of the Mississippi River six blocks from my \nhouse. We need to keep that promise.\n  When you look at the history of the highway trust fund, it was raided \nonce before, many years before I came to Congress, by the exact amount \nof money. I believe it was something like $8 billion. It was raided of \nthat money, and it was taken out of the fund and put into the general \nfund.\n  What we are doing today, at the request of the Bush administration, \nis taking that money from the general fund and putting it back into the \nhighway trust fund because we have a promise for public safety to the \npeople of this country.\n  My colleagues have been talking about priorities. I think there has \nbeen an issue of priorities. I would like to pay for some of the things \nthat are going on in this country when we see that deficit. I can tell \nyou how I would do it, how I would pay for that deficit. I would start \nbringing our troops home from Iraq. That is $10 billion a month.\n  It is ironic--that figure--because Senator Inhofe was at the hearing \nwe had in the Environment and Public Works Committee about bridges and \nabout the expenditures on bridges and trying to keep bridges safe, with \nCongressman Oberstar and others. One of the witnesses told us that it \nwould be about $10 billion a year to start bringing up our bridges to \nsafety over the next few years. I thought that is exactly the amount of \nmoney we are spending per month in Iraq. So that is one way we can get \nthe money if we really wanted to and if some of my friends on the other \nside would have the will to want to pay for this important \ninfrastructure investment.\n  Another is to close the loopholes that have allowed people to store \nmoney in the Cayman Islands and hide their money. Another is to change \nthe capital gains rate. Another is to roll back tax cuts on the \nwealthiest people, couples making over $250,000 a year and individuals \nmaking over $200,000 a year. That would bring in between $50 billion \nand $60 billion a year.\n  I don't have trouble trying too find money to pay for this. We have \nbeen unable to get our friends on the other side--whether it is the AMT \nfix or any other tax fixes for the middle class, we have been unable to \nget them to pay for this. We are left where we are now with a request \nfrom the administration to pay for this from the general fund so we \ndon't have contractors or people out of work who are supposedly working \non construction projects. This means something to me because I see it \nevery day. That bridge is going up and it is going to be opening on \nMonday. It is kind of ironic to me that we are debating whether we are \ngoing to replenish our Nation's highways--when everybody is giving \nglorious speeches about the need to invest for infrastructure--on the \nanniversary of that bridge going up again. Some people are actually \nsaying we should let this highway trust fund die on the vine and let \nthese jobs die on the vine.\n  I am going to use some examples for bridges. We learned today that \nfully one-quarter of America's 600,000 bridges have aged so much that \ntheir physical condition, or ability to withstand current traffic \nlevels, is simply inadequate. One of the things we have seen on our \nroads and bridges in the last few years is that we are seeing something \nof a boon in our world economy, with the new energy economy. We are \nseeing wind turbines being transported on our roads and rails. We are \nseeing biofuels and more wear and tear on our roads and rails.\n  As we move to the next century, economics with the next century \nenergy, looking at more of our energy being produced from the workers \nand farmers of this country, we cannot be stuck in last century's \ntransportation system. I am not going to pretend that replenishing the \nmoney into the highway trust fund is going to bring us to where we need \nto be with public transportation and where we truly need to go \n\n[[Page S8262]]\n\nwith infrastructure in this country to compete on the world stage. At \nleast it will stop the bleed so we are going to be able to keep up with \nthe ongoing projects we have right now.\n\n  I am glad the administration is finally supporting doing something \nabout this. It has been sad that we have gone to the other side three \ntimes to try to fund this important transit fund. As President Kennedy \nonce said, building a road or highway isn't pretty, but it is something \nthat our economy needs to have. We see that with that bridge in \nMinnesota, but we see it over and over again in the rural areas with \nthe development of the wind farms and development of solar and ethanol.\n  Just to give you a sense of what we are seeing in our State, for the \nfirst 6 months in 2007 ethanol production in the United States totaled \nnearly 3 billion gallons or 32 percent higher than the same period last \nyear. Of course, we are going to move to cellulosic, but that will \nstill meet transportation needs in rural areas. Currently, there are \n128 ethanol plants nationwide, with total annual production capacity \nnearing 7 billion gallons, and an additional 85 plants are under \nconstruction. Total ethanol production is expected to exceed 13 billion \ngallons per year by early 2009.\n  In terms of transportation, this means that an average square mile of \nland in southern Minnesota, which generates now the equivalent of 80 \nloaded semitrucks per year, could soon produce double that or 160 loads \nof grain per year. So we are seeing more wear and tear on our roads. It \nis a good thing. We want to produce wind and solar and biofuel and \nhomegrown energy in this country. That will mean having a \ntransportation system that can keep up with our growing economy.\n  Mr. President, I will end with what I began with. We are going to be \nopening a new bridge in Minnesota. Every time I go by that bridge, \nwhich is six blocks from my house, I always think about that schoolbus \nwith kids in it that was perched precariously and by some miracle it \ndidn't go over the side. Every kid was saved. They called it the \nmiracle bus. We have a promise to those kids that were on that bus that \nthis isn't going to happen again. We will keep our roads and highways \nas a No. 1 goal of our Government--public safety. That means not just \nsafety on our streets but safety in our streets. That means better \nroads, bridges, and a better transportation system. So that is why we \nwould have liked to have done this in another way, but we are in a \ncrisis situation with our transit funds, and we should support it and \nreplenish the funds.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me conclude on our side and then, \nhopefully, we are going to go to Senator Murray after that and then to \na voice vote. Where we are right now is, last Friday I was notified by \nthe Department of Transportation that the highway trust fund would run \nout of money sometime in the next 2 weeks. As recently as this summer, \nDOT said it was going to be all right for another year. We understand. \nA lot of people don't understand this.\n  The Federal gas tax is not a percentage, it is a centage. That means \nfor every increase that we have in the price of gas, the revenues go \ndown. Consequently, they have gone down in such a way that could not \nhave been anticipated at the time. That, combined with the busy \nconstruction season, caused the trust fund's balance to go from $4.2 \nbillion at the end of July to less than $1.4 billion in the beginning \nof September.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, our director is Gary Ridley, who I believe \nis the best director in the United States of America. He was forced to \ntake dramatic action--and I think prudent action--when he said we would \nhave to cut by $80 million the projects in August that were postponed.\n  Here is what we are up against. These are projects that have already \nbeen bid, people have been hired, the shovels are in their hands ready \nto do something, and all of a sudden they have to stop doing it which \ncreates all kinds of problems.\n  Furthermore, at the point the trust fund officially runs out of \nmoney--which will be within the next 8 days unless we do what we are \ndoing today, which I am confident we will--work on countless projects \ncurrently under construction will be halted. In other words, projects \nalready under construction will be stopped.\n  The uncertainty over the Federal Government's ability to make good on \nfinancial promises made in law is forcing States to substantially \ndisrupt their highway programs. It is a lot more serious than just \nstopping programs because if you stop programs, you are breaching \ncontracts. You will have lawsuits and penalties that will come in and \nend up costing a lot more money. This is why we say what we are facing \nis, indeed, a crisis.\n  Once a project is canceled or delayed and jobs are lost, it is not as \nsimple to restart the project, as there will be penalties to the States \nand, in many cases, a new contracting process.\n  Despite the arguments to the contrary, in my opinion, H.R. 6532 is \nnot a raid on the general fund. In fact, the opposite is true. Let me \ngo over this point to be sure we all understand.\n  I do not find disagreement with anything my three Republican \ncolleagues said here. They are talking about a lot of things that had \nvery little to do with this bill. I certainly agree with my junior \nSenator in his discussion about the United Nations, about the Social \nSecurity trust fund problems, and spending in general. What happened \nhere--and I was mistaken not too long ago. I said it was the 1998 \nBalanced Budget Act. It was not that. It was actually in TEA-21. \nNonetheless, back in 1998, they took $8 billion out of the trust fund \nand put it into the general fund. That is critical, we understand, \nbecause this is a moral issue. Probably the most popular tax in America \ntoday is the tax we have on our highways because people know when they \nbuy a gallon of gas, that money is going to go to repairing highways, \nbridges and overpasses and make them safer for everyone in America. \nThat is fine, but when they find out we have raided that trust fund and \nhave taken $8 billion out and put it into the general fund, that is \nmorally wrong.\n  I argued since that time--I can remember being on the floor 10 years \nago, in 1998, saying this is wrong, we shouldn't be doing it. I have \nbeen trying to rectify that problem since 1998.\n  We are in a position where we can look at it this way: that we are \nrectifying something that should not have happened 10 years ago. We are \ngiving back the $8 billion to the trust fund. That is not fiscally \nirresponsible. I think it is the right thing to do.\n  While I agree with my colleagues the highway program has grown to \ninclude things that are not in the Federal interest and doing nothing \nto save lives or reduce congestion or relieve the problems of \ntransportation, which is a crisis in America, these issues are more \nappropriately dealt with in the national highway reauthorization bill \nfor 2009.\n  I plan to play a very important, significant role. I will continue to \nbe one of the big four, as Senator Boxer referred to it, during that \ntime. I have felt for a long time--and I agree with my junior Senator--\nthat there are a lot of items that should not be in a Transportation \nreauthorization bill. Over the years, more and more projects have crept \nin.\n  It is interesting that Senator Boxer, who is considered one of the \nmost liberal Members of this body, and myself, who has been ranked \nrecently as the most conservative Member of this body, agree in this \narea. While I am conservative, I have said I am a big spender in two \nareas. One is national defense and the other is infrastructure. That is \nwhat Government is supposed to be doing.\n  Talk to anyone, and they will tell you it is a crisis out there with \nour bridges. Oklahoma is dead last in the condition of our bridges. \nThey don't realize it, but we are No. 3 from the top in terms of number \nof bridges, only exceeded by Texas and California. Yet we are a \nrelatively small State. So we have this problem. We have to deal with \nit, and Government has to do it.\n  When the Federal highway system was chartered back in 1953 during the \nEisenhower administration, I believe, we have been doing highways and \nfunding them the same way since that time. Up until about 7 or 8 years \nago, we always enjoyed a surplus in the highway trust fund. That is why \npeople\n\n[[Page S8263]]\n\nare always targeting it, saying there is a surplus there, let's throw \nin the bike trails, let's throw in all these other projects about which \nSenator Coburn was talking. I agree with him they should not have been \nthere.\n  One of the ways we are going to meet this crisis--and I am going to \ntry to do it--is to make sure everything we do is directly related to \nsafety on the highways and safety in transportation. Intermodal, sure, \nwe have to consider we have channels, we have barge traffic, we have \ntrains, we have all these things that are important. But we do have a \nserious problem, and anyone who doesn't think we have a serious problem \nin transportation in America has not been out driving around.\n  I don't argue with those who feel this process is not right. I don't \nlike this process. I was hoping we would be all right when we passed \nthe 2005 Transportation reauthorization bill. I was elated. I knew we \nwere going to be in good shape on that bill. All these things happen, \nbut when they happen, we have to correct it. You can't say this is the \nwrong way to do it. I have to do it and whatever way is right. That is \nmy opinion. Maybe I am in the minority, but when we are defending \nAmerica and working on infrastructure, Government has to perform.\n  I would only say I do not disagree with my colleagues who do not like \nthe way this happened. I don't like the way it happened either. I wish \nit did not happen that way. I can tell you we are going to have to do \nsomething. I don't agree this is a bailout. I don't call it a bailout. \nI think it is one of the two prime responsibilities of Government, and \nwe are going to have to do it. What we are doing now is not enough.\n  Let me speak to my colleagues who have complaints about what is in a \nhighway reauthorization bill. When the 2009 reauthorization bill takes \nover from the 2005 bill, I will expend as much energy as I can to keep \non the track of safety and moving America and not all these other \nthings special interest people want. I think those things are fine, but \nthey should stand on their own two feet. I believe we have the \nopportunity now to get this done.\n  While I don't like the way it happened, I can tell you it had to \nhappen. We cannot stop construction in America at a time that is \nalready a crisis. In the absence of passing this bill today, that is \nexactly what will happen.\n  I encourage everyone to vote for it. I hope we are going to be able \nto do it on a voice vote. I understand other speakers wish to be heard. \nI will go ahead and set an example and yield back the remainder of our \ntime on this side, hoping we can get to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. On this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss legislation vital to \nthis Nation's transportation infrastructure. The highway trust fund, \nthe means by which we fund our Nation's roads, highways, and bridges, \nis in trouble. Tomorrow, the U.S. Department of Transportation will \nslow down payments to States for infrastructure investments. That is \nhighway projects. This is happening because forecasts now suggest that \na shortfall of billions of dollars to the highway trust fund will occur \nin the near future.\n  The shortfall stems from the agreement of the 2005 highway bill \nnegotiations, when the Bush administration and the Republican-led \nCongress agreed to spend down the balance of the fund.\n  Last year, we learned the trust fund would run out of money faster \nthan anticipated. Accordingly, the Finance Committee reported out a \nbill at that time to address the problem. We tried to move a $5 billion \nhighway fix earlier this year as part of a larger FAA reauthorization \nbill, and that proposal was blocked. So we had to find other ways to \npass this critical highway fix. In the meantime, the highway trust fund \nproblem worsened. As gas prices rose dramatically, fuel tax receipts, \nwhich finance the lion's share of the highway trust fund, dropped \nsharply. In short, as Americans drive less and purchase less fuel, the \ntrust fund shortfall has worsened, even more so than we previously \nexpected.\n  So we tried to pass the highway trust fund as a stand-alone bill. \nRecognizing the dramatically worsening state of the fund, we proposed \nan $8 billion fix--not $5 billion but up to $8 billion. In fact, the $8 \nbillion fix matched the amount that was taken from the highway trust \nfund when its balance was deemed to be too large back in 1998.\n  We worked with the House in developing that measure, and the House \nsent it over to the Senate with a resounding vote of 387 to 87. We \nattempted to clear that bill through the Senate by unanimous consent on \nJune 26, but the bill was blocked again.\n  Then before Congress recessed in August, I again attempted to move \nthis $8 billion highway trust fund fix as part of the Jobs, Energy, \nFamilies, and Disaster Relief Act. But that measure also failed to \npass.\n  Ensuring the highway trust fund remains solvent means my State of \nMontana will not have to suffer more than $98 million in funding cuts, \nas well as approximately 3,500 job losses in the next year.\n  Nationwide, the industry experts tell us the funding cuts to States \nwould be at least $14 billion, with job losses approaching 400,000 if \nwe fail to address this trust fund need. This will occur at a time when \nnationwide unemployment is at its highest level in 5 years.\n  In transferring $8 billion from the general fund into the highway \ntrust fund, we will ensure delivery of the full $41.2 billion in \nguaranteed highway funding for fiscal year 2009.\n  It is important to remember the States have been relying on the 2005 \nagreement between the Bush administration and Congress when developing \nState budgets over the last several years. They relied on us.\n  Fixing the highway trust fund will preserve Federal funding for \nroads, highways, and bridges, and it will preserve good-paying jobs \nthat rely on construction and maintenance projects.\n  An important point here, too, is no offset is required to fix the \nhighway trust fund and that is because the $8 billion transferred is \nintergovernmental. The Congressional Budget Office indicates this fix \ndoes not constitute a spending outlay and, thus, would not violate the \npay-go rules. Likewise, the Joint Committee on Taxation confirms this \ntransfer will have no revenue effect.\n  I am pleased the Bush administration has finally come to its senses \nand realized the need to address this problem. I am pleased my \ncolleagues in the Senate across the aisle have removed their \nobjections, and I am pleased we are now finally going to do what needed \nto be done for over a year.\n  I wish to note that the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation, the senior Senator from Washington, has joined me in \ndoing everything she could do to get this problem fixed. She talked \nwith me innumerable times and many Senators. She was very concerned \nabout this situation and worked so hard. She deserves the lion's share \nof the credit for all the work she has done. I congratulate her for her \nstaying efforts in that regard.\n  We should not delay any further. We should remember the old adage: \nThere are no Democratic roads, there are no Republican roads, only \nAmerican roads. We need to fix this trust fund now. Our States and \nconstituents are relying on it.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendment and third reading \nof the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the bill having been \nread the third time, the question is on passage of the bill, as \namended.\n  The bill (H.R. 6532), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 6532\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 6532) entitled ``An Act to amend the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 to restore the Highway Trust Fund balance.'', do \n     pass with the following amendment:\n       On page 3, line 2, strike [September 30, 2008] and insert \n     the date of the enactment of this Act\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

The pending question is the Vitter amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And is there a time agreement on debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was to be 2 minutes equally divided at 6 \np.m.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator from Louisiana wish to go first or \nsecond?\n  Mr. VITTER. I would like to go first, and I may reserve some time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment pending before us and would ask all my colleagues to look \nfavorably upon this amendment.\n  The committee had decided to cut $411 million from the Missile \nDefense Agency budget. That is a significant amount of money. This \namendment would not restore all of that; it would restore $271 million \nof that amount. I think that is very justified considering the \nsignificance of missile defense, particularly in a post-Cold War world, \nwith threats such as North Korea and Iran and even the technological \nuncertainty of the Chinese military.\n  In addition, the committee itself noted that the Joint Chiefs staff \nreport said that we need about twice as many THAAD and Standard \nMissile-3 interceptors as the number currently planned. This amendment \nwould help get us to that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 1 minute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will take 30 seconds and yield 30 \nseconds to my friend from Florida.\n  On the four items that the Vitter amendment adds money to, the \ncommittee either already added more than the administration requested \nor fully funded. On THAAD, we added $115 billion; on targets, we fully \nfunded; and on the Aegis and the SM-3 missile, we added $100 million. \nSo on the items he adds money to, we either added money or fully \nfunded. We did not cut those items.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, his cuts would allow the \nSecretary of Defense to make cuts across the board to the budget in \norder to fund his add-back, and that could be the Joint Strike Fighter, \nthe B-52, the F-22, the Patriot Missile, and the LPD amphibious ship. \nThis is not good policy. Our committee came out, on $9.3 billion, and \ncut only 4 percent on national missile defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays were previously ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Senators, I can make this very quick. This is \nfor the widows and orphans. This is removing the offset from the \nsurvivor's benefit that a military retiree pays, like an insurance \npremium, and gets a survivor's benefit. But, oh, by the way, under \ncurrent law that survivor's benefit is offset--what they get out of the \nVeterans Affairs Department--in dependency and indemnity compensation.\n  We passed this overwhelmingly last year.

Madam President, this is a very laudatory effort on \nbehalf of our colleague. It is one I will personally support.

The \namendments include one on behalf of myself and Senator McCain, which is \na technical correction to the underlying bill; an amendment on behalf \nof Senators Akaka and Voinovich requiring a report on the security \nclearance review process; an amendment on behalf of Senators Bingaman \nand Domenici requiring a report on the test and evaluation activities \nof the Department of Defense; an amendment on behalf of Senators \nCollins, Lieberman, and others to ensure oversight and accountability \nin Federal contracting; an amendment on behalf of Senators Collins and \nLieberman to establish a governmentwide contingency contracting corps; \nan amendment on behalf of Senators Lugar, Biden, and others to build \noperational readiness and civilian agencies; an amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senators McCain and Akaka, to establish the position of \nDirector of Independent Cost Assessment; an amendment on behalf of \nSenators McCaskill and McCain relating to a database for contracting \nofficials; an amendment on behalf of Senators Smith, Bayh, and Nelson \nof Florida relating to travel of family members of the Armed Forces \nwith serious mental disorders; an amendment on behalf of Senators \nLieberman and Collins relating to ethics safeguards for employees; an \namendment on behalf of Senators Lieberman, Collins, and McCaskill \nregarding whistleblower rights; an amendment on behalf of myself and \nSenator Warner codifying recurring authority on contributions to NATO; \nan amendment on behalf of Senator McConnell on traumatic brain \ninjuries; and on behalf of Senator Menendez, an amendment regarding the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.

Madam President, at the moment, speaking for myself as \none of the managers of the bill, I strongly support the package. We \nhave worked on it together, as we have all the times we have managed \nthese bills.

Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa wishes to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes. I have no objection, providing \nhe would agree that at any time during that 10 minutes we could \ninterrupt him, if we get unanimous consent agreement on the series of \namendments I outlined. I hate to interrupt his remarks, but the timing \nis critical.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have no problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  I have been informed by our staff that there are objections to the \nprocedure to have this package of amendments cleared at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this week is National Suicide Prevention \nWeek. In honor of the families who have lost a military family member \nto suicide, I wish to speak now about an amendment I have to this bill \nto address one of the most critical issues facing our troops right now, \nthe issue of suicide. The Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention bill \nwas signed into law this past November. But that has to do with \nveterans. However, the Department of Defense has reported an increase \nin suicides among Active-Duty soldiers. With extended combat tours to \n15 months from 12 months, with many servicemembers on their third or \neven fourth rotation to Afghanistan or Iraq, the psychological strains \nare enormous. The Department of Defense Task Force on Mental Health has \nstated that both the VA and the Department of Defense are not prepared \nto deal with this increase in mental health needs of Active-Duty \nservice men and women.\n  Nearly each year of the 5-year-old war in Iraq and the 7 years of war \nin Afghanistan, the suicide rate has increased. Last year suicides \namong Active-Duty soldiers reached their highest level since the Army \nbegan keeping records 28 years ago. Suicide was the leading cause of \nnoncombat deaths in Iraq in 2007. This trend has begun to repeat itself \nin 2008. So far there have been 62 confirmed suicides as well as 31 \ndeaths under investigation that are suspected to be suicides, which \nmeans this year's gruesome numbers could surpass the record of 115 \nsuicides set last year. The number of attempted suicides or self-\ninflicted injuries in the Army, approximately 2,100 last year, has \nrisen sixfold since the Iraq war began. These startling statistics \nshould serve as a wake-up call that suicide among soldiers and veterans \nis more than a small problem. It is rapidly becoming a very big \nproblem. To address this critical concern, I worked with a number of my \ncolleagues to introduce the Armed Forces Suicide Prevention Act, S. \n2585, with 20 bipartisan cosponsors. The amendment I am offering to \nthis bill merely adds the preventative measures from this carefully \ncrafted bill, S. 2585, to the excellent underlying language that is in \nthe Defense authorization bill before us.\n  The Defense authorization bill before us does increase mental health \npersonnel and post-suicide investigations in the military. That is in \nthe underlying bill. The amendment I am offering requires the \nDepartment of Defense to implement comprehensive suicide prevention \nprograms within all branches of the military, including the National \nGuard and Reserves. Among other things, the amendment directs the \nPentagon to conduct a servicewide campaign to reduce the stigma \nassociated with mental health issues and to encourage servicemembers \nwho are experiencing difficulties to seek help. It also engages \nmilitary leadership by incorporating suicide prevention training for \nall servicemembers.\n\n  So this amendment takes the preventative measures from the bill we \nintroduced with 20 bipartisan cosponsors and adds it to the underlying \nDefense authorization bill.\n  The language I am talking about was coordinated carefully with each \nbranch of the Armed Forces, and their recommended revisions were \nincorporated. The bill complements other recent defense legislation \nsuch as the Wounded Warriors Act, addressing the well-being and welfare \nof our servicemembers and their families. This Armed Forces Suicide \nPrevention Act has the endorsement of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans \nof America, the Suicide Prevention Action Network, the National \nMilitary Families Association, and the National Alliance on Mental \nIllness.\n  We know these kinds of programs can make a big difference. In the \nearly 1990s, one in every four deaths among Active-Duty Air Force \npersonnel was from suicide. The Air Force implemented the kind of \ncomprehensive suicide prevention program required by the bill we have \nintroduced and by this amendment, and by 2002 the suicide rate had been \nreduced by over a third. Violent crime and family violence also were \nreduced after the preventative program was implemented.\n  We cannot just sit idly by and watch as these young brave Americans, \nwho\n\n[[Page S8266]]\n\nare making great sacrifices, are left alone to fend for themselves, as \nthey suffer the pain and anguish of post-traumatic stress disorder, the \ndespair of losing friends to roadside bombs, or the depression and \nhelplessness felt after multiple deployments that are stressing their \nfamilies to the breaking point. This is not just about the armed \nservicemembers who commit suicide; it is about the deep and painful \ndespair that drives them to do it. I know the Army says they have \neffective programs in place. But if that is true, where are the \noutcomes? Why do we have an ever-increasing suicide rate in the \nmilitary?\n  The GAO just reported last week that the DOD--Department of Defense--\ndoes not even know if the post-deployment health reassessment surveys \nare being completed. Now, for those who may not have heard about this \ntool, the PDHRA, as it is called, surveys health and mental health \nconcerns within 90 and 120 days of deployment. Well, how can DOD say \nthey are good stewards of mental health when they cannot show us they \nare even doing these screenings?\n  The DOD's position on this amendment I am offering is that it ``would \nestablish a legislative mandate for programs already ongoing or within \nthe Secretary's authority to establish. However, the administration \nsupports the goals of this legislation and we look forward to working \nwith Congress to address these concerns.''\n  Well, they may have the current authority, but the numbers do not \nbear out they are actually doing it. Frankly, my staff has met--and I \nhave also--with veterans in Iowa who say that while programs like this \nare in place and working well in some units, it is not a universal \nexperience for Armed Services members. Too many brave young men and \nwomen are falling through the cracks, and the DOD is simply not doing a \nthorough job here. One ignored soldier who has had mental health \nproblems--who is stressed out, who has seen his buddies' arms and legs \ndisappear from bombings or had their lives taken away, who is on \nmultiple deployments, and he has kids back home--one soldier with those \nkinds of stresses who is ignored is one soldier too many.\n  That is why Congress has to act to make this a priority. Yes, this is \ngoing to be a legislative mandate, and I intend it to be that. When GAO \ntells us that DOD cannot even tell us what they are doing, then I think \nit is time for a legislative mandate.\n  The military does an extraordinarily good job of treating our \nwarriors' physical wounds and preventing death and disability. It is \ntime to place an equal priority to treating their psychological wounds, \ntheir emotional wounds, and preventing suicides. That is exactly what \nthis amendment will accomplish.\n  As I have said, there is already excellent language in the underlying \nDefense authorization bill to expand mental health services for Active-\nDuty servicemembers. This amendment would add suicide prevention \ntraining for armed servicemembers and their families. It would add \nadditional postdeployment assistance and a stigma reduction outreach \ncampaign to aid in those efforts--a campaign to reduce the stigma of a \nsoldier who is having mental health problems from seeking help.\n  We all know--those of us who have been in the military--what it is \nlike. You do not want to admit you are having psychological problems, \nthat this, somehow, is something you are not supposed to have happen to \nyou. So you have to reduce the stigma of this so these young men and \nwomen who are having these problems will seek help and by getting that \nhelp will heal their psychological wounds.\n  It is a simple, commonsense approach to a pervasive, disturbing \ntrend, as I said, a very growing problem in the military. So I hope all \nmy colleagues can join with us to support the dedicated men and women \nserving our country and support this needed amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just want to let my colleagues know \nwhere I am coming from, along with Senator Lieberman, that amendment \nNo. 5368, I believe it is, is an amendment offered by Senator Lieberman \nand myself that speaks of the surge, the success of the surge, how \nvital it was that we turn Iraq around, and the fact that the surge has \nworked.\n  General Petraeus said today in the Washington Post, I believe, that \nIraq is still the central battlefront in the war on terror. Senator \nObama has disagreed with that on numerous occasions, saying it is \nAfghanistan and Pakistan.\n  The truth is, the battle regarding the war on terror is an idea, not \na place, and the fight now is in Iraq. Bin Laden said: Go to the land \nof the two rivers. Make sure we win that battle. Bin Laden has always \nseen Iraq as an outcome-determinative event. So does General Petraeus. \nSo does Senator McCain, Senator Graham, and Senator Lieberman.\n  So the good news is that battle has taken place in Iraq between al-\nQaida, the Iraqi people, and the coalition forces, and we have greatly \ndiminished al-Qaida. They suffered a mighty blow at the hands of fellow \nMuslims who turned on al-Qaida after tasting their agenda. I cannot \nthink of a more appropriate topic for the Senate to take up than to \ncomment on what I think is the most historic, successful \ncounterinsurgency operation in military history, to memorialize that it \nhas worked, to acknowledge those who sacrificed to make it work, those \nwho led our men and women in battle. This, to me, is very appropriate \nand important. It was a year ago today that General Petraeus testified \nabout his plan in Iraq, and a year later we see stunning success \nmilitarily, economically, and politically. So I believe with all the \npassion I can muster about this topic that the Senate needs to take \nthis up, discuss it, debate it, and vote on it.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman for his steadfast leadership over the last \nyear. I say to the Senator, you, my friend, will go down in history as \nbeing one of the Senators who stood up at a time when the country \nneeded people to speak out. We turned this war around because of people \nlike yourself and Senator McCain but mainly because of\n\n[[Page S8267]]\n\nthe leadership of General Petraeus and the men and women in uniform, \nAmbassador Crocker and his team, and the Iraqi people themselves.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the legislation we are dealing with today \nauthorizes more than $500 billion, and even in Washington that is a \nheck of a lot of money. That expenditure comes at a time when we have \nmassive amounts of unmet needs in our country, when there is a \ncrumbling infrastructure, a need to invest in sustainable energy, a \nneed to address education, and many other needs. On top of all of that, \nwe are looking at a $9.5 trillion national debt and a record-breaking \ndeficit.\n\n  I hear many of my colleagues come to the floor and speak about waste \nand fraud in all kinds of agencies and, frankly, that is appropriate. \nOur job as Members of Congress is to make sure we do our best to see \nthat not one nickel--not one nickel--is spent in waste or in fraud or \nunwisely. But just as we should do that with the Department of \nAgriculture or with Human Services, we should also do it with the \nDefense Department; in fact, even more so with the Defense Department, \nbecause their budget is so huge--$500 billion at a time of massive \namounts of unmet needs in this country. It appears that not a week goes \nby when one doesn't open a newspaper or see a television program which \ndeals with another example of horrendous waste, fraud, or abuse which \ntakes place within the Department of Defense.\n  I know my colleagues on the Defense Committee, Senator Levin and \nSenator Warner, are aware of these things and they are trying, but this \nis tough stuff. I think we have to raise our profile in addressing this \nwaste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Just some examples: In March of this year, we learned that a 22-year-\nold Defense contractor peddled as much as $300 million in old \nammunition, much of it defective, to the Afghan Army and to their \npolice forces. That is right. AEY, a fly-by-night company, landed the \nhuge contract, despite its record of botched dealings with the State \nDepartment and Defense Department. In fact, the State Department had \nplaced this company on a watch list of companies suspected of illegal \narms transactions.\n  Further, the Pentagon inspector general revealed that $321 million \nwas paid out to cover salaries of 1,000 anonymous employees in the \nIraqi Ministry of Finance. That amounts to $320,000 per employee--not \nbad in Iraq where people do very well if they make $50 or $60 a week, \nbut we are not even sure that the employees saw any of this money.\n  We also learned not terribly long ago that the Army ousted the \ncontracting officer overseeing Kellogg, Brown & Root's huge Iraq \nsupport contract when this distinguished public servant refused to \napprove paying the company more than $1 billion in questionable \ncharges. In other words, he did his job. He took a hard look at where \nthis money was going. There were red flags popping up all over the \nplace. He said: Wait a minute. We are not going to pay this money. His \nreward was not a commendation but his firing.\n  And on and on it goes. The Air Force paid a private U.S. contractor \n$32 million to construct a Ramadi, Iraq airbase. That is OK, except the \nonly problem is the contractor cashed a check and the facility was \nnever built--$32 million for a project never undertaken.\n  Another contractor was paid $142 million to construct Iraqi prisons, \nfire stations, and police facilities that were either never started or \nnever completed--$142 million.\n  It is absolutely essential for us to provide the Pentagon with the \nbudgetary means they need within that huge budget to root out waste, \nfraud, and abuse by contractors in war zones overseas. We also must \ntake a close look at how money is misspent here at home--not just in \nIraq or Afghanistan. The Air Force--the Air Force, needless to say--has \na few airplanes, but apparently cannot ship a package directly from a \ndepot in Corpus Christi, TX, to a National Guard unit in Oklahoma. \nBecause of outdated freight forwarding rules, investigators discovered \nthat one package took a 2,243-mile detour through Houston, TX, to Fort \nWayne, IN, and then on to Dallas before it arrived at its destination \nin Oklahoma. The GAO is investigating the ridiculous shipping \nregulations that cost taxpayers millions of dollars.\n  Now, are all of these examples simply so-called bad apples or do they \nmore likely represent a broken system with inadequate oversight? In my \nview, unfortunately, it is the latter. I think we have a broken system. \nI think we have billions and billions of taxpayers' dollars being \nwasted and not going where they need to go, which is to defend our \ncountry. The Pentagon's leaders have not done enough to ensure that a \ndollar spent means a dollar gained in national security.\n  Frankly, this is not a new problem. In 1940, Senator Harry Truman \ninvestigated waste and fraud by the U.S. military. During World War II \nhe proposed the creation of a Senate special committee to investigate \nthe national defense program. The Truman committee identified way back \nthen in the 1940s more than $15 billion in unnecessary and fraudulent \ndefense spending. That is a huge amount of money. As Senator Truman put \nit at the time:\n\n       We intend to see that no man or corporate group of men \n     shall profit inordinately on the blood of the boys in the fox \n     holes.\n\n  I think what Truman said in the 1940s is absolutely true today.\n  Was Harry Truman unpatriotic for demanding increased congressional \noversight on the War Department and defense contractors at a moment of \nnational crisis during World War II? The answer is, of course, no, he \nwas not. He simply demanded that, in his words:\n\n       Each dollar expended for war purposes would produce a \n     dollar's worth of the necessary war supplies.\n\n  I think that is certainly a reasonable request supported by every \ntaxpayer in this country.\n  That is why last year I and the Presiding Officer joined with other \nfreshmen colleagues to introduce legislation calling for the creation \nof a commission on war contracting modeled on the Truman committee. We \nneed such a bipartisan effort more now than ever. Today, government \nauditors have compiled lists of countless examples of risky and \ninadequate practices by the Defense Department in overseeing contracts.\n  The problem is not just private contractors. The Department needs to \nadopt better practices to stop blatant examples of wasteful and \noverpriced purchases.\n  Some examples:\n  The GAO--the Government Accountability Office--recently assessed 72 \nmajor weapons acquisition programs and reported a colossal $295 billion \nin cost overruns on a $1.6 trillion contract portfolio--$295 billion in \ncost overruns. That is not a bad apple, that is not an aberration, that \nspeaks to a system that is significantly broken. What is more, on \naverage, these systems are delivered 21 months late. So these \ncontractors end up getting far more than they were originally supposed \nto get and, to boot, they are almost 2 years late on delivering the \nproduct.\n  It gets even worse than that. The Defense Department has shelled out \nbillions of dollars in bonuses to contractors who don't deserve them. \nAccording to one study, award and incentive fees totaling $8 billion \nwere granted even when the contractors did not deserve the bonuses \nunder the Pentagon's own rules. What a bonus is supposed to be about is \nyou get a reward when you do your job well, when you come in perhaps \nunder contract, when you come in earlier than you had agreed to. That \nis what a bonus is. But unfortunately, these guys are getting these \nbonuses even when they perform poorly, and that is clearly \nunacceptable.\n  I wish to commend my colleagues, Senator Levin and Senator Warner, \nfor their initiative to establish a director of independent cost \nassessment. It is time for this Congress to impose effective \nacquisition controls and require the Pentagon to put its financial \nhouse in order. Even the Pentagon's own inspector general has admitted \nthat:\n\n       The rapid growth of the DOD budget since fiscal year 2000 \n     leaves the department increasingly more vulnerable to the \n     fraud,\n\n[[Page S8268]]\n\n     waste, and abuse that undermines the department's mission.\n\n  That is the Pentagon's own inspector general.\n  So it is time to engage in a serious debate over this Bush defense \nbudget that elevates gold-plated technologies and huge contractor \npayouts over cogent and sensible strategy.\n  A little historical perspective is instructive. President Dwight \nDavid Eisenhower, a five-star general and the military commander of \nEurope during World War II, deplored excessive military spending and \nits diversion of resources away from pressing public needs--Dwight D. \nEisenhower. A few days before he left office in 1961, President \nEisenhower gave one of the most prophetic speeches ever given in the \nWhite House. Here is what Eisenhower--a Republican, I should add--what \nEisenhower said:\n\n       In the councils of government, we must guard against the \n     acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or \n     unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential \n     for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will \n     persist.--Dwight David Eisenhower.\n\n  Fast forward 48 years to the last months of George W. Bush's \nPresidency. It is remarkable how prescient Eisenhower's concerns were.\n  Today the budget of President Bush calls for a $515 billion Pentagon \nbudget. This is in addition--this is in addition--to the $200 billion a \nyear being spent on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it also does \nnot include $16 billion spent on nuclear weapons. That is why I \nproposed an amendment--a very modest amendment, I might say--to address \none of the more egregious examples of wasteful spending in the Federal \nGovernment. The incredible amount of unneeded spare parts--what we are \ntalking about is unneeded spare parts and other items--in the Army, \nNavy, Air Force, and other Department of Defense agency warehouses is \nmeasured in the billions of dollars. What we are talking about is \nunneeded spare parts. They don't need it, billions of dollars of \nunneeded spare parts.\n  Fixing the military inventory systems is the reason behind the \namendment I have authored, along with Senator Feingold and Senator \nWhitehouse.\n  The Government Accountability Office--the GAO--has placed the \nDepartment of Defense inventory system on ``high risk'' lists year in \nand year out. In other words, there is a red flag attached to this line \nitem.\n  The unneeded spare parts inventory and the inefficient inventory \nmanagement systems are literally costing the taxpayers millions and \nmillions of dollars each year. Worse, these unnecessary spare parts are \nclogging up the supply system, costing millions for storage, and are \nnot providing the support needed for our service men and women for \ndefending our country. More than half of the Air Force's secondary \ninventory--an average of $31.4 billion--was not needed to support \nservice requirements. That is right. More than $18 billion of its on-\nhand spare parts are beyond the needs of the Air Force. Imagine that: \n$18 billion in unneeded spare parts. We have Air Force warehouses full \nof parts that are simply not needed.\n  It gets even worse than that. The Air Force has on order $235 million \nin inventory already identified as ready for disposal. In case you \ndidn't catch that: $235 million in inventory already identified as \nready for disposal. So $235 million worth of parts not even delivered \nto the Air Force's warehouses will be ready for disposal by the time \nthey arrive. Now, that may make sense to somebody--maybe the people who \nmake money producing the stuff. It certainly does not make sense to me \nor, I expect, anybody else in this country. By the way, this is almost \n20 percent of its total on-order inventory. It is a huge amount of \ninventory.\n  The Air Force has redefined terms and created new categories such as \n``Additional Applications Anticipated,'' ``Uneconomical to Terminate,'' \n``Management Decision,'' and ``Data Error.'' What they mean by data \nerror is a series of computer entry mistakes amounting to $96.5 million \nduring one recent 3-month period alone. To my way of thinking, this is \nfurther evidence of the Air Force's inability to manage its inventory \nprogram. If data errors are rampant in the system, fix them. If the \ninventory problems can't be corrected without costing even more money, \nthen something is wrong with the system.\n  This is not just an Air Force problem; it is Pentagon-wide. The \nnumbers for the Navy and Army are also extremely troubling. The Army's \nnumbers are incomplete because the Army could not provide data from two \nmajor agencies, including the communications and electronics commands, \nbecause their inventory computer systems were not compatible with other \nArmy computer systems. This is with a budget of $500 billion and we \ncan't get computers to talk to each other. Ironically, the \ncommunications and electronics command is one of the commands \nresponsible for Army hardware and software acquisition.\n  This underscores the serious problem of the inability of the Defense \nDepartment computer systems to interface with each other. My staff was \nactually told by an Air Force material command manager that Air Force \ninventory officers are still actually relying on computer systems that \nare based on decades-old designs.\n  Year after year, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress has \nexhorted the Pentagon to, 1, provide incentives to reduce purchases of \nunneeded on-order inventory; 2, conduct a comprehensive assessment of \nunneeded inventory items on hand; and, 3, take measures to address \nfluctuations in demand that produce these huge inventories.\n  Clearly, something must be done to set things right. It is time to \nget the Pentagon inventory system up to modern practices.\n  What does our amendment do? It does a few things. First, the \namendment, offered by Senators Feingold, Whitehouse, and myself, will \nrequire the Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive plan for \nimproving the inventory system, including each service's plan to \nimprove audit systems for reducing the gap between projected \nrequirements and actual requirements, improvements to information \ntechnology systems, personnel and training needs, contract reviews, and \nother relevant policy changes.\n  Second, this amendment will require a certification to Congress that \nthe Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense Logistics Agency have reduced \ntheir secondary inventory.\n  Third, this amendment strengthens the certification process by \nfencing off $100 million in inventory purchases until the Secretary of \nDefense makes the required certifications.\n  This is a small but critical step toward fixing the DOD's inventory \nsystem. It is time for this Congress to impose long-needed improvement \nand require the Pentagon to put its house in order.\n  Frankly, this is just a small step forward. We have a lot more to do. \nThis country faces enormous problems. We need money spent in many \nareas. We don't need to be wasting tens of billions of dollars. I look \nforward to working with my fellow Senators to see that this amendment \nbecomes law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8268-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8268-S8270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

For years and years the Senate and the Congress have \n     closed their eyes to passing bills that would have protected \n     we Americans from the horrific gas prices we now face. This \n     situation should never have happened! There is nothing that \n     justifies this crisis!!! As the greatest nation on earth, we \n     should not be dependent upon foreign oil We should never be \n     dependent upon countries that despise America. We have enough \n     oil in this nation to care for our own people!\n       How shameful what you Senators and Congressmen have done to \n     us, the American people!!! Everyone is financially hurting. \n     In our opinions, it is treason on your part! This situation \n     is not going to get better until we drill here, drill now and \n     pay less\n       We are disappointed and ashamed of our Senators and \n     Congressmen who sat by, and continue to sit by and allow this \n     nation to suffer financially.

They \n     have a carpet/disaster and restoration company. They are \n     always busy but because of the high price of everything \n     especially gas it really makes it hard on them. They cannot \n     raise their prices for fear of losing business but then again \n     they have to pay the high price of gas to keep customers and \n     keep them happy. It's a no win for them.\n     Pam.\n                                  ____\n\n       As a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Idaho, \n     I appreciate your call for suggestions. I have two children, \n     8 and 12 yrs of age--a boy and a girl. Some of the things \n     that are affected are medical checkups that now go without \n     being done, even with the ridiculous insurance coverage, and \n     then entertainment. So with one big swoop, our lives have \n     just changed in two dramatic ways, one essential at times, \n     the other stress relief. Sad thing is I work in the oil and \n     gas fields. I know that animal rights activists are full of \n     crap for the most part. I see life in the fields far better \n     off than whatever they seem to see. (Or do not see). It is \n     safer for wild animals than it ever has been, and I just do \n     not see why we do not drill more. I am not a huge fan of oil \n     products being wasted, burned, and otherwise used, but let us \n     be real. We have been addicted to this, and now rely on it. \n     Drill, it is renewable. It regenerates, albeit at a slower \n     rate than grass and weeds. Let us look at affordable solar \n     harvest as well.\n     Richard, Firth.\n                                  ____\n\n       As a small business owner (insurance agency), I have come \n     to realize that this dependence on the present energy sources \n     is not just an incapacitation to private concerns, but will \n     ultimately translate into higher ins. premiums due to \n     increased repair costs arising from parts manufacture costs, \n     repair shop employee costs etc.. This crisis will reach into \n     every avenue of our lives. At 56, I am trying to plan for \n     retirement. I am a licensed securities advisor, and as such \n     probably have better information than most to help to arrive \n     at a reasonable retirement income. However, my present plan, \n     due to energy prices has become doubtful. If my situation is \n     such, what of the common laborer? Will the gov't find \n     themselves caring for the aged in an even bigger way than at \n     present? Where will they get the funds with the increase of \n     baby boomers and reduction of upcoming generations? The \n     energy crisis will be a tremendous cost to our American way \n     of life. I personally believe that all americans should be \n     appraised of those in their voting district that do not \n     support a more aggressive move into the future of energy \n     independance. Perhaps those in elected offices will find \n     themselves more interested in acting upon the will of the \n     masses and less interested in the special interest groups, \n     their money, and in particular the environmentalists. While \n     the invironment must be preserved, it also must be utilized \n     and not be allowed to go unmanaged. I appreciate your \n     concerns, and would like to see someone provide the voting \n     public, the ``real time'' voting records of those in office. \n     It is always after the fact that the information is recieved, \n     if at all. Only when one's livelyhood is at risk, will a \n     person act decisively. Perhaps that would apply to those in \n     office as a result of instant notification of a negative \n     vote.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jerry.\n                                  ____\n\n       Sixteen years ago we moved 12 miles west of Blackfoot on a \n     small acreage to raise our two daughters along with our dogs, \n     cats, horses, and birds. Our oldest daughter has some \n     learning disabilities and is now an active Special Olympics \n     athlete. It was a long road to where she is today and that \n     was an amazing journey. Not long after moving, through our \n     church's children's ministry, we became aware of a great need \n     for safe and nurturing homes for damaged children. We \n     eventually adopted two boys and it was a good thing we lived \n     in the country because they liked to make noise. Some years \n     later we started to take in foster children and have now had \n     about 30 needy kids in our home (at different times I assure \n     you). Early in that venture we developed a relationship with \n     the Shoshone-Bannock people at Fort Hall and they have great \n     needs for homes to take care of their damaged children. Many \n     of our foster kids have been native children and we now have \n     three for which the tribe has allowed us guardianship. These \n     children are very needy and spend time daily with various \n     therapists and the oldest went to a developmental preschool \n     this year. Because of their needs, and our oldest daughter's \n     job at Wal-Mart, our vehicles do not even cool off most days. \n     My wife makes several trips to Blackfoot and to various \n     therapists every day. We travel 500 miles a week or more and \n     the gas prices are painful. However, we just do what it \n     takes. Relief from gas prices would be a wonderful blessing \n     but it does cause a dilemma for us because we are very \n     conservative and do not believe the government should solve \n     all of our problems. However, there are appropriate issues \n     for the government to take responsibility for and this may be \n     one.\n       We have entrusted you with representing our interests to \n     the federal government so please evaluate this issue very \n     carefully and\n\n[[Page S8270]]\n\n     if you can find a sound moral and ethical way to help us \n     continue our contribution to our community and our neighbors \n     please strive for that.\n       Thanks for your service.\n     Dennis, Blackfoot.\n                                  ____\n\n       First it is nice to hear that the Senate is at least \n     thinking about it but I have to say that if the Senate needs \n     families to write a few paragraphs to explain what impact \n     these conditions are placing on the American family then I am \n     not sure the Senate is in touch with reality as they should \n     be.\n       I have worked hard all my life and have provided well for \n     my family. I am very thankful for the opportunities given me. \n     I know that with hard work, kindness for our fellow man we \n     will continue to do well. However, these impacts will be \n     negative in the long run. They are putting undue stress on my \n     family, on my life and every discussion everyday is about \n     these prices and the affects it has on every aspect of the \n     economy. There will be less productivity, less education, \n     more broken families due to the financial stress and probably \n     most important less faith in our system.\n       The American public has a government in place that has \n     become so out of touch with who it represents that I am not \n     sure anything will or can be done. There is too much greed \n     and dishonesty in our government system and those that lead \n     this country are in it for their own prosperity and not the \n     prosperity and best interests of the people. I feel the \n     liberals only want power and control. And I am not sure what \n     the Republicans represent anymore.\n       These energy prices impact every aspect of our lives, \n     security and well being. If our government will not do the \n     right thing immediately then there will be ramifications \n     beyond belief and for generations to come. I am sure you know \n     this but I hope you do . . . Our forefathers would have never \n     have let this happen. We would be totally independent of all \n     foreign control. They would have known the liberty and safety \n     of this country would be at jeopardy.\n           Best Regards,\n     David.\n                                  ____\n\n       Today, I was in a grocery store where the fellow in line in \n     front of me bought a small bag of tomatoes for $7.00. \n     Tomatoes are not in season here, and have to be shipped from \n     California. The clerk said we will no longer be able to buy \n     Cyrus O'Leary pies, as the company is located in Spokane, \n     almost 100 miles away, and they are no longer willing to \n     deliver further than 30 miles. We are going to have to change \n     our ways of living, buying more locally produced goods. There \n     is great opportunity here for new local businesses. People \n     are going to have to once again learn how to eat the food \n     that is in season. Maybe local butcher shops will once again \n     thrive, and be able to compete with the giant slaughter \n     houses. None of this local economic development will happen \n     if we once again are able to buy cheap gas.\n       I do not favor anything that will bring the price of gas \n     down. Our own natural reserves of oil in the ground should be \n     saved for future generations to be used in manufacturing and \n     other basic industries, instead of being burned up in \n     internal combustion machines. I agree with you wholeheartedly \n     that we need to turn to nuclear (providing there is adequate \n     resources of uranium) and other non oil energy sources, and \n     end our dependence on oil. Without the pain involved in high \n     oil prices, there will not be the will to make this difficult \n     transition. Please stop trying to extract the last drop of \n     oil from the ground so we can have cheap gas, and start \n     thinking about the future.\n     Janet.\n                                  ____\n\n       This hits the nail on the head, Senator. Until we cut down \n     on the long-range use of fuels in this country for private \n     transportation, the costs will--most likely--continue to \n     accumulate and even accelerate.\n       We see it on the highway as semi after semi tools along \n     burning more fuel that an equivalent freight train to handle \n     the same load. Somehow we have to come to grips with this or \n     we are going to find ourselves either walking, or starving, \n     or both.\n       We see it on the highways and bi-ways of this country as 4-\n     wheelers burn up fuel for recreation that could be put to \n     better use. And, if you so much as suggest this might be a \n     waste of precious resources, your political career would be \n     in jeopardy!\n       I appreciate the positive steps that you have taken in \n     regard to legislation. The solutions are going to be hard--\n     drill for oil, conserve what we have, eliminate unnecessary \n     trips and combine errands to save gas. And quit using \n     gasoline for recreational uses. These are some of the first \n     steps.\n       But, ultimately, we are going to have to look deeply at the \n     problem of public transportation in this country. People are \n     too selfish and too intent on achieving their own ends to \n     cooperate until the situation becomes dire.\n       But I am sure you will agree that this attitude of ``you \n     will have to pry my dead hands off the steering wheel (or \n     handlebars) to get me to stop my wasteful practices'' will \n     actually only cease when we run out of oil or can no longer \n     afford it. And that will be too late to do anyone any good.\n       Limited public transportation options mean that many of us \n     do not have any choice but to keep driving and paying those \n     ever-increasing prices for fuel\n     Ray.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8270-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL ERIC J.

On February 1, 2009, Colonel Wilbur will \nretire after a distinguished 20-year military career in which he has \nhonorably and faithfully served his country. Among many other awards, \nColonel Wilbur has been decorated with the Legion of Merit, the Bronze \nStar, and the Defense Meritorious Service Award.\n  I have always considered it a privilege to highlight the \ndistinguished service of those men and women serving in the military, \nespecially when they have Iowa ties. As an Iowa native and graduate of \nIowa State University, I am confident that Colonel Wilbur retires not \nonly with the esteem and admiration of his peers, subordinates, and \ncountry but also his hometown of West Union, IA, and all Iowans.\n  Through his distinguished career, Colonel Wilbur has been a \nnoteworthy example of the definition of loyalty, dedication, and \nsacrifice. Today I would like to extend my personal thanks to Colonel \nWilbur for faithfully serving his country with excellence, as well as \nmy congratulations on his much deserved retirement. Men and women such \nas Colonel Wilbur deserve to be recognized for their service and \npatriotism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8270-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      CONGRATULATING LAURA SANDERS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

By offering \nregional and district workshops, roundtables for teachers and \nprincipals, and digital learning, the Teacher-to-Teacher Initiative \nallows some of our nation's best teachers to share strategies to raise \nstudent achievement and inform teachers of successful research-based \npractices. Each year, over one million, students are taught by a \nteacher who participated in the Teacher-to-Teacher Initiative.\n  Ms. Sanders, a kindergarten teacher at Cumberland Trace Elementary \nSchool in Bowling Green, KY, has been recognized as one of Kentucky's \ntop teachers. She developed teaching practices in her classroom along \nwith research-based materials that have helped her students to \nconsistently make clear improvements. Over the past 2 years, her \nstudents' reading scores have gone from the 50th percentile in the fall \nto over the 85th and 91st percentile the following spring. Ms. Sanders' \nability to assess the individual needs of each student has enabled her \nto ensure that every child is working at an appropriate pace and level. \nHaving already been a recipient of numerous awards for her contribution \nto education, her work is widely recognized.\n  I am proud to recognize Ms. Sanders for her ability to effectively \nchallenge students at Cumberland Trace Elementary School, while at the \nsame time sharing her techniques with other teachers--making a \ndifference in the lives of students. Her work is an inspiration to the \ncitizens of Kentucky and to teachers everywhere. I look forward to \nseeing all that she will accomplish in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8270-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8270-S8271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HONORING THE HEALTH OCCUPATION STUDENTS OF AMERICA\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nHealth Occupation Students of America, HOSA, for their accomplishments \nover the past 32 years. Composed of 100,000 students in nearly 3,000 \nchapters across the Nation, HOSA is providing the knowledge, skills and \nopportunity for secondary and postsecondary students to enter the \nhealth care workforce. Through health science curricula, personal \ndevelopment exercises, practical work in the health care field and \nmedical competitions at the local and national levels, HOSA Advisors \nand students prepare a healthcare workforce not only to serve but also \nto lead our country.\n  Now more than ever, we need organizations like HOSA to address \ncritical\n\n[[Page S8271]]\n\nshortages in the health care industry. Occupational programs in our \nhigh schools offer training for young students and often help them find \na rewarding career path. Programs like HOSA direct students to \nworthwhile vocations while also leading the effort to stimulate \nindustry and job growth.\n  The American healthcare system faces myriad, complex challenges: \nrising prescription drug costs, a lack of stable insurance coverage, \nand a medical bureaucracy that is increasingly difficult to navigate. \nQualified healthcare professionals should not be one of them. HOSA has \nfound a way to combine two very important needs in our economy: an \neducated workforce and competent health care professionals.\n  I am proud that Texas is home to HOSA National Headquarters and to \n491 chapters, the most of any State in the Nation. HOSA is helping \nbuild a pipeline of skilled health care workers to ensure that health \ncare in the United States remains a model of professionalism, \ncompassion, and innovation to the world. I commend these talented and \nambitious young men and women for their dedication both to the health \ncare profession and to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8271-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING DON HASKINS\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Don \nHaskins, a great Texan, legendary basketball coach, and remarkable man \nwho passed away earlier this week at his home in El Paso.\n  Haskins, who started his career coaching small-town high school \nbasketball teams, served as the head coach at Texas Western College, \nnow the University of Texas at El Paso, UTEP, from 1961 to 1999. His \ndecision to ``put my five best guys on the court'' in the 1966 NCAA \nnational championship game against the Kentucky Wildcats is now widely \nregarded as a catalyst for racial integration in college sports. The \nTexas Western Miners, with an all-Black starting lineup, beat the \nWildcats 72-65. Their inspiring story is told in the film, ``Glory \nRoad,'' and the book of the same name.\n  Over his long career, Coach Haskins compiled a 719-353 record and \nearned a place in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1997 \nand the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1987. Over the years, he turned \ndown lucrative job offers in order to stay at UTEP. He retired in 1999 \nwith the fourth best record in history that included winning seven \nWestern Athletic Conference, WAC, championships and four WAC tournament \ntitles.\n  While Coach Haskins was known for his tough and competitive spirit, \nhe is also remembered for his selfless acts of kindness.\n  According to an Associated Press report, ``USC coach Tim Floyd, a \nformer Haskins assistant, said he once got a call from the mayor of Van \nHorn, a small town about 120 miles east of El Paso, to thank Haskins \nfor giving a ride to a family of five stranded along the highway.\n  `` `He'd been coyote hunting and saw a station wagon broken down,' \nFloyd recalled this week. `He put them (the family) in his truck, drove \nthem to El Paso, put them up in a hotel for two nights, and gave them \n$1,000.'\n  ``The family drove to Los Angeles after Haskins also helped get their \ncar repaired. The coach never told anyone about it, not even his wife, \naccording to Floyd.\n  ``Floyd said he never told the story before, mostly because Haskins \nwouldn't have wanted anyone to know.\n  `` `I'm only telling it now because he's gone,' Floyd said. `I want \npeople to know.' ''\n  In deciding to devote the best years of his life and career to the \npeople of Texas, Coach Haskins built a legacy that will continue to \ninspire generations. I join with all Texans as we mourn his passing and \nextend our deepest condolences to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8271-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMENDING THE IDAHO ARMY NATIONAL GUARD UNIT\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in early August, I was informed that \nan Idaho Army National Guard Unit from eastern Idaho was awarded one of \nthe U.S. Army's highest commendations, the Meritorious Unit \nCommendation. The First Battalion, 148th Field Artillery Unit based in \nPocatello served as part of the Idaho Army National Guard's 116th \nCavalry Brigade combat team in 2004 and 2005 in Iraq. Although part of \na combat brigade, these citizen soldiers are doctors, dentists, \nelectricians, lawyers, and other occupations as Idaho civilians. BG \nAlay Gayhart, Assistant Adjutant Army General for the Idaho Army \nNational Guard, has rightly noted that these men and women utilized \ntheir civilian occupational skills in Iraq to help restore civic and \ngovernmental services to the country. I am honored to call myself a \nfellow Idahoan of these brave men and women, some of whom I had the \npleasure of meeting prior to their deployment when they were at Fort \nBliss, TX, at the end of the summer in 2004. I congratulate them on \ntheir professionalism, commitment to our mission, and am happy for \ntheir safe return to family and friends. I also keep the families and \nfriends of those who made the ultimate sacrifice in prayer as they \ncontinue on without their loved ones.\n  Idaho has a proud history of military service. Her sons and daughters \nhave been serving our Nation in uniform far from home since the days of \nthe Spanish American War in the early 20th century. The deployment of \nthe 116th Cavalry Brigade combat team from 2004 to 2005 was the largest \ndeployment of the Idaho Army National Guard in history.\n  The Meritorious Unit Commendation is awarded to military commands \nthat display exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of \noutstanding service, heroic deed, or valorous actions. The unit was \nrecommended for the award by the U.S. Army's higher headquarters and \nwas selected by the Pentagon for the commendations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8271-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8271-S8272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DENISON COMMUNITY EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in Iowa and across the United \nStates, a new school year has begun. As you know, Iowa public schools \nhave an excellent reputation nationwide, and Iowa students' test scores \nare among the highest in the Nation.\n  I would like to take just a few minutes, today, to salute the \ndedicated teachers, administrators, and school board members in the \nDenison Community School District, and to report on their participation \nin a unique Federal partnership to repair and modernize school \nfacilities.\n  This fall marks the 10th year of the Iowa Demonstration Construction \nGrant Program. That is its formal name, but it is better known among \neducators in Iowa as the program of Harkin grants for Iowa public \nschools. Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 \nmillion for the State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school \ndistricts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools or renovating existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal \nfunding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it \noften has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.\n  The Denison Community School District received a 2002 Harkin grant \ntotaling $904,200 which it used to help with renovations at the \nelementary school including the installation of air conditioning. The \ndistrict also received a 2005 construction grant to help build a new \nmiddle school and make renovations at the former middle school.

AL LORENZO\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the importance of providing access \nto a quality education is one of our most important goals as a nation, \nas our children and grandchildren compete in an ever increasingly \ncomplex workplace. Those who dedicate their lives to this mission have \nchosen one of the most rewarding and satisfying life paths. For 29 \nyears, Dr. Albert Lorenzo served as president of Macomb Community \nCollege, skillfully charting a course that has greatly benefitted not \nonly those who have been directly affiliated with the college, but also \nthe surrounding community. His commitment to educating students has \ntransformed countless lives.\n  July 1, 2008, marked the end of an era for one of Michigan's premier \neducational institutions, Macomb Community College, and the end of a \nrichly rewarding journey for Dr. Lorenzo. I, along with my Michigan \ncolleague, Senator Stabenow, would like to sincerely thank him for a \njob well done and for making such a significant contribution to the \nlives of the people of Macomb County and the State of Michigan.\n  Dr. Lorenzo was installed as the fourth president of Macomb Community \nCollege in July 1979 and navigated the college through significant \ntransition and growth. Upon his retirement, he was the longest-serving \ncommunity college president in Michigan. Under his leadership, Macomb \nCommunity College began offering classes leading to various bachelor \ndegrees in 1991, filling an important void in the community. Dr. \nLorenzo is also credited with creating the first ever university center \nmodel, which is now used in community colleges throughout the country. \nMacomb's University Center facilitates partnerships with eight \nuniversities and institutions, working to bring higher educational \nopportunities to this underserved community in Michigan. The college is \nflourishing, with an enrollment of approximately 27,000 students and \nwith three out of every four Macomb County college students beginning \ntheir college careers at MCC.\n  In addition to his commitment and success at MCC, Dr. Lorenzo has \nbeen a leading member of the Macomb community. Over the years, he has \nbeen active on several corporate boards and policy commissions, has \nworked with several national advisory groups and has been appointed by \nboth Governor Engler and Governor Granholm to economic advisory boards.\n  Al Lorenzo has also been recognized nationally for his many \npublications and has been awarded 12 major leadership awards, as well \nas 2 honorary doctoral degrees. He has received numerous other \ncommendations, including the Tom Peters Leadership Award, and the March \nof Dimes Citizen of the Year Award. Additionally, he was named \nPresident of the Year by three national associations.\n  Al will be devoting the next chapter of his life to solving the \neconomic and educational challenges that face Macomb County and \nMichigan by working with Oakland University as they expand their \nservices in Macomb County. We know our colleagues in the Senate join us \nin recognizing Dr. Al Lorenzo, his wife Katherine, and their family on \nhis retirement. He has left an enduring mark on the educational \nlandscape in Michigan, and we wish him many more years of service and \nsuccess as he begins this new endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8273-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8273-S8274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ANNIVERSARY OF MARIAN HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to offer my warmest \ncongratulations to the students, faculty and staff of Marian High \nSchool on the 50th anniversary of the school's founding. This is indeed \nan important milestone, and the many contributions they have made are \nevident throughout the Detroit community.\n  For a half century, the faculty and staff of Marian High School have \nworked tirelessly to educate young women and prepare them for college \nand the workforce. The school's emphasis in service instills the values \nof leadership and responsibility in Marian High students, and the \nstrong academic curriculum, vast array of sports and activities, and \nqualified staff has contributed mightily to the success of many women \nover the years.\n  Education is an investment in the future of our Nation, and students \nand schools must aspire to high standards. Throughout the last 50 \nyears, the faculty and staff of Marian High School have met this \nchallenge by fostering a nurturing and safe environment for its \nstudents to grow and develop. The most recent example of this is the \nclass of 2007, which produced five National Merit Scholars, 37 Phi Beta \nKappa Honorees, and numerous other scholarship\n\n[[Page S8274]]\n\nwinners. Students at Marian continued to consistently score above State \nand national averages on the SAT and ACT tests, a testament to the high \nstandard of excellence cultivated at Marian High School.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in extending my congratulations \nto the faculty, staff, alumni, and students of Marian High School on \nthe school's 50th anniversary. I wish them the best as they continue \nthis important work for another half century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8274-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WEST VIRGINIA ANGELS IN ADOPTION\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I honor the love and \ncommitment exhibited by two of my fellow West Virginians, Jeff and Amy \nDunford of Spanishburg, my 2008 nominees as West Virginia's Angels in \nAdoption. I have participated in this program by the Congressional \nCaucus on Adoption since its inception, and I am proud to talk about \nthis year's West Virginia family.\n  In 2003, Jeff and Amy made the wonderful decision to become foster \nparents. They, like many caring West Virginia families, opened up their \nhome and created a loving environment for children in need of such a \nplace.\n  The Dunfords started with a sibling group, and by the spring of 2005, \nthe Dunfords have successfully adopted three children, all the while \ncontinuing to provide both a short-term and long-term home for \nadditional foster children. In fact, it was not long after the adoption \nprocess was completed that another sibling group was placed in the \nDunford home. These three boys, all under the age of 3, would also be \nadopted by the Dunfords.\n  Being a foster and adoptive family always has its challenges, as well \nas its unique rewards. Taking care of young children often means \nsleepless nights, unexpected emergency room visits, and countless \nparent-teacher conferences. They were also faced with situations unique \nto foster families, including biological parent visits and counseling \nsessions. Through it all, the Dunfords faced these challenges with love \nand determination and now six children have a permanent and loving \nhome.\n  Today, the Dunford family consists of Jeff and Amy, Jeremy, Walter, \nHolly, Richard, Greg, and Christopher. Jeff and Amy continue to be \nactive in the foster care system, providing assistance with recruitment \nand training.\n  Jeff and Amy are a testament to the wonderful men and women involved \nin foster care and adoption services. Throughout my Senate career and \nas a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I have worked \nhard in a bipartisan manner to expand and support adoptive and foster \nparents. Over the years, progress has been made, and since the 1997 \nAdoption and Safe Family Act which I fought for, adoptions for foster \ncare have doubled--a true sign of success. But with over 100,000 \nchildren still in foster care and waiting to be adopted, there is more \nto do.\n  This year, I am working with a bipartisan coalition to expand the \nadoption incentives program, improve adoption assistance and on \nprograms enhancing foster care. As important as policy can be, the true \nheroes are the parents like the Dunfords, who have selflessly opened up \ntheir home to vulnerable children. I hope their story, and the stories \nof all this year's Angels in Adoption, will inspire my colleagues and \nfamilies nationwide to promote adoption and other supports for \nvulnerable children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8274-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:45 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R.6l68.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 3461. A bill to evaluate certain certification programs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce a simple bill that is \nthe first step toward helping American workers and businesses. The \nSkills Standards Certification Evaluation Act of 2008 will require the \nSecretaries of Labor and Commerce to evaluate skills standards \ncertification programs that have been developed with Federal funding.\n  Skills Standards Certifications have emerged in the past 2 decades in \nresponse to job growth in high-technology and varied industries. The \ntraining or classes usually take weeks or months, rather than years. \nOften, they are developed in response to the needs of one industry or \neven one company, though the skills may be applicable more widely.\n  The Federal government has taken conflicting approaches to skills \nstandards certifications over the past two decades. That is why, as \npart of the Skills Standards Certification Evaluation Act, I require a \nrecommendation from the Secretaries of Labor and Commerce on how \nCongress ought to move forward with funding for these certification \nprograms. Both the national, top-down, and a local, bottom-up approach \nhave been tried, and a thorough evaluation will make clear how we can \nmove forward to get the most out of the funding the Federal Government \nprovides.\n  These certifications have a tremendous benefit for workers. First, \nbecause the training is often condensed into a few weeks with a \nflexible schedule, it allows people to complete certifications without \nleaving a current job and without the financial cost of attending a \nfull-time program that lasts a year or more. In addition, these \nprograms allow workers to clearly demonstrate a certain set of skills, \nand may open more doors for higher-paying employment. Because these \nprograms can be completed without leaving work, they also allow workers \nto advance within a career or company to\n\n[[Page S8278]]\n\nmore skilled positions and better wages and benefits.\n  For employers, Skills Standards Certifications can simplify the \nsearch for employees. I have heard from numerous Wisconsin employers, \nespecially small businesses with limited resources, that it is hard to \nfind employees with the skills they need, or who will be dedicated and \nloyal. Skills Standards Certifications clearly show the qualification \nof an individual, of course, but also tell the employer that he or she \nis dedicated enough to invest in the course to earn the certificate. \nVery few people will spend the time and money to enroll in such a \nprogram if they don't intend to use the certificate.\n  Lastly, these programs can help State and local governments quantify \ntheir skilled workforce, which can be invaluable when marketing the \narea to businesses and investment.\n  This bill is a small first step in what I hope can be a continuing \neffort to help hard working Americans obtain and use high-demand work \nskills.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 3464. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to improve the \ninternational protection and enforcement of intellectual property \nrights, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nInternational Intellectual Property Protection and Enforcement Act of \n2008 S. 3464, introduced by my friend from Montana, Senate Finance \nCommittee Chairman Max Baucus and myself. This piece of legislation \nrepresents months of hard work and collaboration, and I am pleased that \nwe have finally arrived at a consensus on this very important global \nissue.\n  The protection of intellectual property has always been one of my top \nlegislative priorities in the Senate. Now more than ever, America's \ningenuity continues to fuel our economy, and it is imperative that we \nprotect new ideas and investments in innovation and creativity. Make no \nmistake about it: piracy and counterfeiting are the new face of \neconomic crime around the world, far exceeding traditional property \ncrimes.\n  It is estimated that U.S. intellectual property alone is worth $5 to \n$5.5 trillion, that is equivalent to about 45 percent of our GDP. In \nother words, this is greater than the entire GDP of any other nation in \nthe world. Additionally, millions and millions of jobs are created \nevery year by U.S. IP industries. And, I might add, these jobs earn an \naverage of 40 percent more than the average pay of other U.S. jobs. \nWithout doubt, America's Intellectual property drives our economy and \nis the envy of the world and we must do everything to protect our prime \nstatus as a world leader on this front.\n  Counterfeiting and piracy aren't just about downloaded music, pirated \nsoftware, or fake designer hand bags. It's about the health and safety \nof the American people. Indeed, counterfeiting and piracy affect all \nsectors of our economy, including pharmaceuticals, auto parts, and the \nquality and safety of our food.\n  S. 3464 will serve as an important bridge in the battle to protect \nU.S. intellectual property rights overseas. With the rising tide of \npiracy and counterfeiting abroad, it is vital that we provide those \nworking on the front lines with the tools they need to ensure that our \nnation's IP rights are lawfully respected by foreign countries.\n  To that end, S. 3464 will require the U.S. Trade Representative, \nUSTR, to press countries that violate U.S. intellectual property rights \nto take specific steps to stop violations by developing an action plan \nfor each foreign country that has remained on USTR's ``Priority Watch \nList'' of intellectual property deficient countries for at least one \nyear. The action plan must list the legislative, enforcement, or other \nactions that the foreign country must take in order to achieve adequate \nand effective protection of intellectual property rights.\n  The legislation also provides funds to increase USTR's ability to \npartner with developing countries to improve IP protection and \nenforcement, including capacity building, activities designed to \nincrease awareness of intellectual property rights, and training for \nofficials responsible for enforcing the laws. Additionally, the bill \ngive the President enforcement tools to deal with countries that refuse \nto fight widespread theft of our Nation's IP.\n  I am committed to moving this legislation forward and hope that we \nwill do so in an expeditious manner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 3466. A bill to improve the job access and reverse commute \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce another piece of my E4 \ninitiative, so named because it is a collection of proposals that \naddress issues important to the economy, education, employment and \nenergy. The piece of legislation I am introducing now focuses on the \nimportant supporting role that transportation can play in economic \ndevelopment by creating an environment where employers and those \nseeking employment or better employment are connected together. Having \nsuch a system to overcome transportation hurdles can benefit both \nemployers and employees, as well as the local economy.\n  In more general terms, investing in our infrastructure like roads, \nbridges and transit systems can have direct job creation impacts. This \nis one reason I have fought hard with the rest of the delegation for a \nfair rate of return for Wisconsin from the highway bill. I was glad the \nmost recent 2005 bill continued a recent streak of getting at least a \n1:1 rate of return after decades of being a donor state and not getting \na fair share.\n  In addition to supporting transportation-related jobs, linking \nworkers and businesses that need them can also be an important part of \na more comprehensive job creation strategy. This can mean supporting a \nrobust public transportation system or more specific programs designed \nto link low-income individuals with jobs. I have consistently done the \nformer by supporting public transportation during consideration of the \nhighway bill and Amtrak reauthorizations. But my specific proposal \ntoday focuses on the latter and improving the Job Access and Reverse \nCommute, JARC, program that links low-income workers with employers.\n  I have heard good things about the JARC program and was glad that it \nwas shifted away from earmarks and was made available as a combination \nformula and competitively awarded program in the last highway bill. The \nprimary program goal is to locally assess the transportation needs of \nlow-income workers and then plan and fund programs to help alleviate \ntransportation-related barriers to employment or better employment. \nWhile the traditional vision for these projects may have begun as \nreverse commute projects whereby transit routes were established to \nallow city center residents to access jobs in the suburbs, the program \nactually does much more than just this and provides reliable \ntransportation to low-income urban, rural and suburban workers.\n  In Wisconsin, the Federal JARC program is jointly administered by the \nState departments of transportation and workforce development as the \nWisconsin Employment Transportation Assistance Program, WETAP. \nAccording to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, transportation \nbarriers can include a lack of a dependable vehicle or bus service in \nthe area, an absence of local jobs, or child care transportation \nproblems.\n  The State agencies in Wisconsin have found several different types of \nprojects to be effective, depending on the local circumstances. These \nprojects have included the traditional public transit projects such as \nextending bus lines or supporting van-pooling, along with other \nprograms such as providing cars or car repairs to low-income \nindividuals. Wisconsin has even found that assisting with indirect \nbarriers such as transportation of children to and from child care \nfacilities is critical in allowing some individuals to improve their \njob prospects.\n  A recent University of Illinois Chicago study found that the societal \nbenefits from this program are $1.65 per dollar spent and estimated \nlifetime benefits to low-income participants of $15 per dollar spent \ndue to their ability to find and retain better paying jobs. While the \ngoals of the Job Access and Reverse Commute program are important and \nthe program has been found to\n\n[[Page S8279]]\n\nbe fairly effective, there are some details that have prevented the \nprogram from reaching its full potential. Working closely with \ntransportation officials in Wisconsin and partially based on \nrecommendations from the UIC study, I've come up with some specific \nideas to improve the program.\n  With a proven effective program and continuing unmet needs by \nemployers and low-income individuals seeking employment, it seems clear \nto me that JARC could use a boost in funding. So that is why my \nproposal ramps up funding by $100 million over 5 years from the current \nfunding of $165 million to $265 million in fiscal year 2014.\n  My proposal would also allow the Federal share of projects to \nincrease to 80 percent from the current 50 percent level for operating \nexpenses. The 50 percent local and State match wasn't feasible for far \ntoo many local governments in Wisconsin and as a result Wisconsin has \nnot been able to spend all its Federal funds. The higher Federal cost \nshare will better balance the need to leverage Federal funds, while \nensuring that these critical funds are fully utilized--millions of \ndollars in an account does nothing to link people to jobs.\n  Besides the challenge in coming up with a 50 percent local cost \nshare, the other main issue that has kept JARC from being as effective \nas it could be is the paperwork and reporting burden required by the \nprogram, especially for the small nonprofit groups that often have \nnever dealt with Federal grant requirements before. My proposal directs \nthe Federal Transit Agency, FTA, to examine the current reporting \nrequirements to see if there are ways to streamline the amount of \npaperwork required while still ensuring that the program goals are met.\n  My bill also includes a pilot program funded at $10 million a year \nfor 5 years in order to test a few areas that seem very promising, but \nshould be evaluated more before broader implementation. The first \nportion of the pilot program builds off the regulatory streamlining \nevaluation and allows the FTA to test streamlined reporting \nrequirements to help get the balance between oversight and \nadministrative burden in proper balance.\n  The second part of the pilot program focuses on improving education \nand employment-related transportation for teens and young adults. \nEnabling students and young people to reliably get between their high \nschools or neighborhoods and technical colleges, job training centers \nor apprenticeships can have a life-long positive impact.\n  The third section of the pilot program would allow experimentation \nwith combining different transit programs and integrating JARC projects \nacross local political boundaries to provide a more comprehensive local \ntransportation system. Instead of having one transit program to assist \nthe disabled, one targeted toward the elderly and another focused on \njobs, this pilot program would encourage funding combined applications \nto meet these needs together with one comprehensive project. There is \neven the potential for the Department of Transportation to further \ncoordinate with other departments such as Health and Human Services for \nhealth care-related transportation. Similarly, the needs of employers \nfor employees does not recognize local political boundaries, so \nencouraging greater collaboration between local entities to make a more \nrobust interconnected system should ultimately provide more efficient \nand effective service.\n  While the FTA already provides some technical assistance for the JARC \nprogram, my proposal provides a small boost in funding and some \nadditional areas of emphasis. For example, after hearing about the \nstruggles that some small nonprofits have with the reporting \nrequirements, in addition to looking for ways to streamline the \nrequirements, my proposal would direct the FTA to also provide some \ntechnical assistance especially targeted to this need.\n  The final element of my proposal is the offset. The new spending \nauthorized in the proposal is fully offset by rescinding highway and \nbridge earmarks that have not had funds spent from them despite being \nauthorized over a decade ago as part of the TEA-21 highway bill. \nHelping connect workers and employers is a much better use of these \nfunds than letting them sit unused in some obscure DOT account.\n  Providing reliable transportation to low-income individuals only goes \nso far--it is the companies and innovators creating the jobs and the \nindividuals seeking to better their lot through education or more \nchallenging employment, that are doing the heavy lifting. That being \nsaid, transportation can clearly be a challenge for companies and \nworkers and in the case of the JARC program can play an important \nsupporting role.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8279-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 653--CELEBRATING THE OUTSTANDING ATHLETIC \n    ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL TEAM FOR \n                  ACHIEVING ITS 800TH ALL-TIME VICTORY\n\n  Mr. BROWN (for himself and Mr. Voinovich) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 97\n\n       Whereas, since 2002, 59,690 female veterans have reported \n     being raped or sexually assaulted or experiencing another \n     form of sexual trauma while in the military;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     female veterans reporting rape, sexual assault, or other \n     sexual trauma constitute almost 20 percent of the women seen \n     at facilities of the Department nationwide;\n       Whereas 41 percent of female veterans treated at the West \n     Los Angeles Medical Center of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs reported being sexually assaulted while in the \n     military and 29 percent of such veterans reported being raped \n     while in the military;\n       Whereas the number of reported sexual assaults and rapes in \n     the military increased by 73 percent from 2004 to 2006, \n     according to the Department of Defense;\n       Whereas 2,688 sexual assaults were reported in the military \n     in fiscal year 2007, including 1,259 reports of rape, \n     according to the Department of Defense;\n       Whereas the military chain of command took no action in \n     almost half of the cases of sexual assault in the military \n     investigated by military authorities, claiming insufficient \n     evidence, and the majority of the cases in which some action \n     was taken were resolved through nonjudicial punishment or \n     administrative action, which in most cases amounts to little \n     more than a slap on the wrist;\n       Whereas only 181 of the 2,212 subjects, or 8 percent, \n     investigated by the military for sexual assault during fiscal \n     year 2007 were referred to courts martial;\n       Whereas civilian law enforcement authorities prosecute \n     approximately 40 percent of individuals arrested for rape, \n     according to statistics of the Department of Justice and the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation;\n       Whereas the absence of aggressive prosecutions by the \n     military perpetuates a hostile environment and hinders a \n     victim's willingness to report a sexual assault or rape;\n       Whereas, in 2005, the Department of Defense created the \n     Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, which serves \n     as the single point of accountability and oversight for the \n     policies of the Department relating to sexual assault;\n       Whereas the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office \n     has improved reporting of sexual assault and rape, but still \n     does not track investigations or prosecutions of reported \n     cases; and\n       Whereas sexual assault and rape in the military are a \n     threat to the national security of the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the \n     Secretary of Defense should develop a comprehensive strategy \n     to increase and encourage investigation and prosecution of \n     sexual assault and rape cases in the military that includes--\n       (1) requiring commanders to be held accountable for sexual \n     assaults and rapes that occur in the units under their \n     command and to provide justification for disposing of cases \n     through nonjudicial punishment and other administrative \n     actions;\n       (2) developing and enhancing existing prevention and \n     response programs by using proven best-practice methods to \n     create a culture that prevents sexual assault and rape in the \n     military and encourages more reporting of sexual assaults and \n     rapes by victims;\n       (3) conducting more aggressive oversight of existing \n     prevention and response programs, establishing performance \n     metrics to ensure that such programs are effective, and \n     analyzing trends in the prevention and reporting of sexual \n     assaults and rapes;\n       (4) reviewing current training methods for all personnel \n     involved in military investigations of sexual assault and \n     rape cases, and for judge advocate staff, and implementing \n     any improvements that are necessary;\n       (5) encouraging communication and data sharing between the \n     Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office and other \n     components of the Armed Forces and the Department of Defense \n     to enhance coordination and oversight of sexual assault and \n     rape cases as those cases move through the legal process;\n       (6) reviewing the capacity of the legal infrastructure of \n     the Armed Forces to investigate and prosecute effectively \n     sexual assault cases in the military;\n       (7) examining any additional barriers, such as the \n     availability of staff and the adequacy of resources, on \n     military installations and facilities in the United States \n     and abroad, and in theaters of operations, to conduct \n     effective investigations of sexual assault and rape cases;\n       (8) reviewing command disposition of cases and identifying \n     whether additional oversight is required to ensure that the \n     resolution of cases through nonjudicial means is justified;\n       (9) classifying a military protection order as a standing \n     military order to ensure that an investigation has occurred \n     and appropriate command authorities have completely \n     adjudicated allegations before the order can be overturned;\n       (10) establishing a policy that mandates the notification \n     of any military protective order issued at a military \n     installation to local civilian law enforcement agencies to \n     provide the continuity of protection to victims; and\n       (11) ensuring that once a member of the Armed Forces has \n     notified the member's command that the member has been \n     sexually assaulted or raped, the command affords the member \n     an opportunity for transfer if a military protection order is \n     issued.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8280-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8280-S8282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5339.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE STRATEGIC SUCCESS OF \n                   THE TROOP SURGE IN IRAQ AND THE MEMBERS OF THE \n                   UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES WHO MADE THAT \n                   SUCCESS POSSIBLE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) By the end of 2006, it had become clear that, despite \n     exceptional efforts and sacrifices on the part of the United \n     States Armed Forces in Iraq, the United States was pursuing a \n     failed strategy in Iraq.\n       (2) By the end of 2006, large-scale sectarian violence was \n     accelerating throughout Iraq, al Qaeda had established \n     significant safe havens there, militias sponsored by the \n     Government of Iran had seized effective control of large \n     swaths of Iraq, and the Government of Iraq was suffering from \n     political paralysis.\n       (3) By the end of 2006, insurgents and death squads were \n     killing more than 3,000 civilians in Iraq each month and \n     coalition forces were sustaining more than 1,200 attacks each \n     week.\n       (4) In December 2006, the Iraq Study Group warned that \n     ``the United States is facing one of its most difficult and \n     significant international challenges in decades'' in Iraq and \n     that ``Iraq is vital to regional and even global stability, \n     and is critical to U.S. interests''.\n       (5) In December 2004, Osama bin Laden said the following of \n     the war in Iraq: ``The most important and serious issue today \n     for the whole world is this Third World War. . . . The \n     world's millstone and pillar is Baghdad, the capital of the \n     caliphate.''.\n       (6) On January 10, 2007, in an address to the Nation, \n     President George W. Bush acknowledged that the situation in \n     Iraq was ``unacceptable'' and announced his intention to put \n     in place a new strategy, subsequently known as ``the surge''.\n       (7) President Bush nominated and the Senate confirmed \n     General David H. Petraeus as the Commander of Multi-National \n     Forces--Iraq, a position he assumed on February 10, 2007.\n       (8) General Petraeus, upon assuming command, and in \n     partnership with Lieutenant General Raymond Odierno, the \n     Commander of Multi-National Corps--Iraq, and United States \n     Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker, developed a comprehensive \n     civil-military counterinsurgency campaign plan to reverse \n     Iraq's slide into chaos, defeat the enemies of the United \n     States in Iraq, and, in partnership with the Iraqi Security \n     Forces and the Government of Iraq, reestablish security \n     across the country.\n       (9) Under the previous strategy, the overwhelming majority \n     of United States combat forces were concentrated on a small \n     number of large forward operating bases and were not assigned \n     the mission of providing security for the people of Iraq \n     against insurgents, terrorists, and militia fighters, in part \n     because there were insufficient members of the United States \n     Armed Forces in Iraq to do so.\n       (10) As an integral component of the surge, approximately 5 \n     additional United States Army brigades and 2 United States \n     Marine Corps battalions were deployed to Iraq.\n       (11) As an integral component of the surge, members of the \n     United States Armed Forces were deployed out of large forward \n     operating bases onto small bases throughout Baghdad and other \n     key population centers, partnering with the Iraqi Security \n     Forces to provide security for the local population against \n     insurgents, terrorists, and militia fighters.\n       (12) Additional members of the United States Armed Forces \n     began moving into Iraq in January 2007 and reached full \n     strength in June 2007.\n       (13) As a consequence of the additional forces needed in \n     Iraq, in April 2007 the United States Army added 3 months to \n     the standard year-long tour for all active duty soldiers in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan, and the United States Marine Corps \n     added 3 months to the standard 6-month tour for all active \n     duty Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       (14) As an integral component of the surge, members of the \n     United States Armed Forces began simultaneous and successive \n     offensive operations, in partnership with the Iraqi Security \n     Forces, of unprecedented breadth,\n\n[[Page S8295]]\n\n     continuity, and sophistication, striking multiple enemy safe \n     havens and lines of communication at the same time.\n       (15) As an integral component of the surge, additional \n     members of the United States Armed Forces were deployed to \n     Anbar province to provide essential support to the nascent \n     tribal revolt against al Qaeda in that province.\n       (16) Those additional members of the United States Armed \n     Forces played a critical role in the success and spread of \n     anti-Qaeda Sunni tribal groups in Anbar province and \n     subsequently in other regions of Iraq.\n       (17) Since the start of the surge in January 2007, there \n     have been marked and hopeful improvements in almost every \n     political, security, and economic indicator in Iraq.\n       (18) In 2007, General Petraeus described Iraq as ``the \n     central front of al Qaeda's global campaign''.\n       (19) In 2008, as a consequence of the success of the surge, \n     al Qaeda has been dealt what Director of Central Intelligence \n     Michael Hayden assesses as a ``near strategic defeat'' in \n     Iraq.\n       (20) As a consequence of the success of the surge, militias \n     backed by the Government of Iran have been routed from major \n     population centers in Iraq and no longer control significant \n     swaths of territory.\n       (21) As a consequence of the success of the surge, \n     sectarian violence in Iraq has fallen dramatically and has \n     been almost entirely eliminated.\n       (22) As a consequence of the success of the surge, overall \n     insurgent attacks have fallen by approximately 80 percent \n     since June 2007 and are at their lowest level since March \n     2004.\n       (23) As a consequence of the success of the surge, United \n     States casualties in Iraq have dropped dramatically and \n     United States combat deaths in Iraq in July 2008 were lower \n     than in any other month since the beginning of the war.\n       (24) As a consequence of the success of the surge, the \n     Government of Iraq has made significant strides in advancing \n     sectarian reconciliation and achieving political progress, \n     including the passage of key benchmark legislation.\n       (25) As a consequence of the success of the surge, the \n     Iraqi Security Forces have improved markedly and \n     approximately 70 percent of Iraqi combat battalions are now \n     leading operations in their areas.\n       (26) As a consequence of the success of the surge, General \n     Petraeus concluded in 2008 that conditions on the ground in \n     Iraq could permit the additional brigades and battalions \n     dispatched to Iraq in 2007 as part of the surge to be safely \n     redeployed without replacement, and all such brigades and \n     battalions have been successfully withdrawn without \n     replacement.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate to--\n       (1) commend and express its gratitude to the men and women \n     of the United States Armed Forces for the service, \n     sacrifices, and heroism that made the success of the troop \n     surge in Iraq possible;\n       (2) commend and express its gratitude to General David H. \n     Petraeus, General Raymond Odierno, and Ambassador Ryan \n     Crocker for the distinguished wartime leadership that made \n     the success of the troop surge in Iraq possible;\n       (3) recognize the success of the troop surge in Iraq and \n     its strategic significance in advancing the vital national \n     interests of the United States in Iraq, the Middle East, and \n     the world, in particular as a strategic victory in a central \n     front of the war on terrorism; and\n       (4) recognize that the hard-won gains achieved as a result \n     of the troop surge in Iraq are significant but not yet \n     permanent and that it is imperative that no action be taken \n     that jeopardizes those gains or dishonors the service and \n     sacrifice of the men and women of the United States Armed \n     Forces who made those gains possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5369.

Among its major exhibits, the \n     Freedom Pavilion will contain an interactive exhibition \n     honoring all of the World War II veterans who have also \n     served the Nation as President or as a member of the Senate \n     or House of Representatives.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Of the amount \n     appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations \n     under section 301(1), $50,000,000 may be made available for a \n     grant to the National World War II Museum Foundation for the \n     museum in New Orleans, Louisiana, designated as America's \n     National World War II Museum by section 8134 of the \n     Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2005 (Public Law \n     108-87; 117 Stat. 1103).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5372.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The people of Pakistan and the United States have a \n     long history of friendship and comity, and the vital \n     interests of both nations are well-served by strengthening \n     and deepening this friendship.\n       (2) In February 2008, the people of Pakistan elected a \n     civilian government, reversing months of political tension \n     and intrigue, as well as mounting popular concern over \n     governance and their own democratic reform and political \n     development.\n       (3) A democratic, moderate, modernizing Pakistan would \n     represent the wishes of that country's populace, and serve as \n     a model to other countries around the world.\n       (4) Pakistan is a major non-NATO ally of the United States, \n     and has been a valuable partner in the battle against al \n     Qaeda and the Taliban.\n       (5) The struggle against al Qaeda, the Taliban, and \n     affiliated terrorist groups has led to the deaths of several \n     thousand Pakistani civilians and members of the security \n     forces of Pakistan over the past 6 years.\n       (6) Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, more \n     al Qaeda terrorist suspects have been apprehended in Pakistan \n     than in any other country, including Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, \n     Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and Abu Faraj al-Libi.\n       (7) Despite the sacrifices and cooperation of the security \n     forces of Pakistan, the top leadership of al Qaeda, as well \n     as the leadership and rank-and-file of affiliated terrorist \n     groups, are believed to use Pakistan's Federally Administered \n     Tribal Areas (FATA) as a haven and a base from which to \n     organize terrorist actions in Pakistan and with global reach.\n       (8) According to a Government Accountability Office Report, \n     (GAO-08-622), ``since 2003, the administration's national \n     security strategies and Congress have recognized that a \n     comprehensive plan that includes all elements of national \n     power-- diplomatic, military, intelligence, development \n     assistance, economic, and law enforcement support-- was \n     needed to address the terrorist threat emanating from the \n     FATA'' and that such a strategy was also mandated by section \n     7102(b)(3) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-458; 22 U.S.C. 2656f \n     note) and section 2042(b)(2) of the Implementing the \n     Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (Public \n     Law 110-53; 22 U.S.C. 2375 note).\n       (9) According to United States military sources and \n     unclassified intelligence reports, including the July 2007 \n     National Intelligence Estimate entitled, ``The Terrorist \n     Threat to the U.S. Homeland'', the Taliban, al Qaeda, and \n     their Pakistani affiliates continue to use territory in \n     Pakistan as a haven, recruiting location, and rear base for \n     violent actions in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as \n     attacks globally, and pose a threat to the United States \n     homeland.\n       (10) The toll of terrorist attacks, including suicide \n     bombs, on the people of Pakistan include thousands of \n     citizens killed and wounded across the country, over 1,400 \n     military and police forces killed (including 700 since July \n     2007), and dozens of tribal, provincial, and national \n     officials targeted and killed, as well as the brazen \n     assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto while \n     campaigning in Rawalpindi on December 27, 2007, and several \n     attempts on the life of President Pervaiz Musharraf, and the \n     rate of such attacks have grown considerably over the past 2 \n     years.\n       (11) The people of Pakistan and the United States share \n     many compatible goals, including--\n       (A) combating terrorism and violent radicalism, both inside \n     Pakistan and elsewhere;\n       (B) solidifying democracy and the rule of law in Pakistan;\n       (C) promoting the economic development of Pakistan, both \n     through the building of infrastructure and the facilitation \n     of increased trade;\n       (D) promoting the social and material well-being of \n     Pakistani citizens, particularly through development of such \n     basic services as public education, access to potable water, \n     and medical treatment; and\n       (E) safeguarding the peace and security of South Asia, \n     including by facilitating peaceful relations between Pakistan \n     and its neighbors.\n       (12) According to consistent opinion research, including \n     that of the Pew Global Attitudes Survey (December 28, 2007) \n     and the International Republican Institute (January 29, \n     2008), many people in Pakistan have historically viewed the \n     relationship between the United States and Pakistan as a \n     transactional one, characterized by a heavy emphasis on \n     security issues with little attention to other matters of \n     great interest to citizens of Pakistan.\n       (13) The election of a civilian government in Pakistan in \n     February 2008 provides an opportunity, after nearly a decade \n     of military-dominated rule, to place relations between \n     Pakistan and the United States on a new and more stable \n     foundation.\n       (14) Both the Government of Pakistan and the United States \n     Government should seek to enhance the bilateral relationship \n     through additional multi-faceted engagement in order to \n     strengthen the foundation for a consistent and reliable long-\n     term partnership between the two countries.\n\n     SEC. 1243.

LIMITATIONS ON ADJUSTMENTS TO BENEFICIARY FEES FOR \n                   MILITARY HEALTH CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Career members of the uniformed services and their \n     families endure unique and extraordinary demands, and make \n     extraordinary sacrifices, over the course of 20-year to 30-\n     year careers in protecting freedom for all Americans.\n       (2) The nature and extent of these demands and sacrifices \n     are never so evident as in wartime, not only during the \n     current Global War on Terrorism, but also during the wars of \n     the last 60 years when current retired members of the Armed \n     Forces were on continuous call to go in harm's way when and \n     as needed.\n       (3) The demands and sacrifices are such that few Americans \n     are willing to bear or accept them for a multi-decade career.\n       (4) A primary benefit of enduring the extraordinary \n     sacrifices inherent in a military career is a range of \n     extraordinary retirement benefits that a grateful Nation \n     provides for those who choose to subordinate much of their \n     personal life to the national interest for so many years.\n       (5) Many private sector firms are curtailing health \n     benefits and shifting significantly higher costs to their \n     employees, and one effect of such curtailment is that retired \n     members of the uniformed services are turning for health care \n     services to the Department of Defense, and its TRICARE \n     program, for the health care benefits in retirement that they \n     earned by their service in uniform.\n       (6) While the Department of Defense has made some efforts \n     to contain increases in the cost of the TRICARE program, a \n     large part of those efforts has been devoted to shifting a \n     larger share of the costs of benefits under that program to \n     retired members of the uniformed services.\n\n[[Page S8302]]\n\n       (7) The cumulative increase in enrollment fees, \n     deductibles, and copayments being proposed by the Department \n     of Defense for health care benefits under the TRICARE program \n     far exceeds the percentage increase in military retired pay \n     since such fees, deductibles, and copayments were first \n     required on the part of retired members of the uniformed \n     services.\n       (8) Proposals of the Department of Defense for increases in \n     the enrollment fees, deductibles, and copayments of retired \n     members of the uniformed services who are participants in the \n     TRICARE program fail to recognize adequately that such \n     members paid the equivalent of enormous in-kind premiums for \n     health care in retirement through their extended sacrifices \n     by service in uniform.\n       (9) Some of the Nation's health care providers refuse to \n     accept participants in the TRICARE program as patients \n     because that program pays them significantly less than \n     commercial insurance programs, and imposes unique \n     administrative requirements, for health care services.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Department of Defense and the Nation have a \n     committed obligation to provide health care benefits to \n     retired members of the uniformed services that exceeds the \n     obligation of corporate employers to provide health care \n     benefits to their employees;\n       (2) the Department of Defense has many additional options \n     to constrain the growth of health care spending in ways that \n     do not disadvantage retired members of the uniformed services \n     who participate or seek to participate in the TRICARE \n     program, and should pursue any and all such options rather \n     than seeking large increases for enrollment fees, \n     deductibles, and copayments for such retirees, and their \n     families or survivors, who do participate in that program;\n       (3) any percentage increase in fees, deductibles, and \n     copayments that may be considered under the TRICARE program \n     for retired members of the uniformed services and their \n     families or survivors should not in any case exceed the \n     percentage increase in military retired pay; and\n       (4) any percentage increase in fees, deductibles, and \n     copayments under the TRICARE program that may be considered \n     for members of the uniformed services who are currently \n     serving on active duty or in the Selected Reserve, and for \n     the families of such members, should not exceed the \n     percentage increase in basic pay for such members.\n       (c) Limitations on Certain Increases in Health Care \n     Costs.--\n       (1) Pharmacy benefits program.--\n       (A) One-year extension of temporary prohibition on increase \n     in copayments.--Section 702 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181; \n     122 Stat. 188) is amended by striking ``September 30, 2008'' \n     and inserting ``September 30, 2009''.\n       (B) Limitation on increases after fiscal year 2009.--\n     Section 1074g(a)(6) of title 10, United Stated Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) Effective as of October 1, 2009, the amount of any \n     cost sharing requirements under this paragraph may not be \n     increased in any year by a percentage that exceeds the \n     percentage increase of the most recent increase in retired \n     pay for members and former members of the armed forces under \n     section 1401a(b)(2) of this title. To the extent that such \n     increase for any year is less than one dollar, the \n     accumulated increase may be carried over from year to year, \n     rounded to the nearest dollar.''.\n       (2) Premiums for tricare standard for reserve component \n     members who commit to service in the selected reserve.--\n       (A) One-year extension of temporary prohibition on increase \n     in premiums.--Section 1076d(d)(3) of such title is amended by \n     striking ``September 30, 2008'' and inserting ``September 30, \n     2009''.\n       (B) Limitation on increases after fiscal year 2009.--Such \n     section is further amended--\n       (i) by striking ``The monthly amount'' and inserting ``(A) \n     Subject to subparagraph (B), the monthly amount''; and\n       (ii) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(B) Effective as of October 1, 2009, the percentage \n     increase in the amount of the premium in effect for a month \n     for TRICARE Standard coverage under this section may not \n     exceed a percentage equal to the percentage of the most \n     recent increase in the rate of basic pay authorized for \n     members of the uniformed services for a year.''.\n       (3) Copayments under champus.--\n       (A) One-year extension of temporary prohibition on increase \n     in charges for inpatient care.--Paragraph (3) of section \n     1086(b) of such title is amended in the first sentence by \n     striking ``September 30, 2008'' and inserting ``September 30, \n     2009''.\n       (B) Limitation on increases after fiscal year 2009.--Such \n     paragraph is further amended by inserting after the first \n     sentence the following new sentence: ``Effective as of \n     October 1, 2009, the percentage increase charges for \n     inpatient care under this paragraph may not exceed a \n     percentage equal to the percentage of the most recent \n     increase in the rate of basic pay authorized for members of \n     the uniformed services for a year.''\n       (4) Prohibition on enrollment fees for certain persons \n     under champus.--Section 1086(b) of such title is further \n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(5) A person covered by subsection (c) may not be charged \n     an enrollment fee for coverage under this section.''.\n       (5) Automatic enrollment for certain persons under \n     champus.--Section 1086(b) of such title is further amended by \n     adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(6) A person covered by subsection (c) shall not be \n     subject to denial of claims for coverage under this section \n     for failure to enroll for such coverage. To the extent \n     enrollment may be required, enrollment shall be automatic for \n     any such person filing a claim under this section.''.\n       (6) Premiums and other charges under tricare.--\n       (A) One-year extension of temporary prohibition on increase \n     in charges under contracts for medical care.--Section 1097(e) \n     of such title is amended by striking ``September 30, 2008'' \n     and inserting ``September 30, 2009''.\n       (B) Limitation on increases after fiscal year 2009.--Such \n     section is further amended--\n       (i) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``The Secretary of \n     Defense''; and\n       (ii) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) Effective as of October 1, 2009, the percentage \n     increase in the amount of any premium, deductible, copayment, \n     or other charge prescribed by the Secretary under this \n     subsection may not exceed the percentage increase of the most \n     recent increase in retired pay for members and former members \n     of the armed forces under section 1041a(b)(2) of this \n     title.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5385.

rooted value of the United States \n     military.\n       (3) United States civilian leaders value the expertise, \n     advice, and judgment of military professionals in defense and \n     national security policy deliberations.\n       (4) In his commencement address at the United States Naval \n     Academy on May 23, 2008, Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that ``few things are more vital \n     to an organization than someone who has the moral courage to \n     question the direction in which an organization is headed and \n     then the strength of character to support whatever final \n     decisions are made''.\n       (5) In the same address, Admiral Mullen added that ``the \n     military as an institution must remain a neutral instrument \n     of the state''.\n       (6) Admiral Mullen also said ``that few things are more \n     damaging to our democracy than a military officer who doesn't \n     have the moral courage to stand up for what's right or the \n     moral fiber to step aside when circumstances dictate''.\n       (7) The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense \n     Reorganization Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-433) codified, in \n     sections 151 and 164 of title 10, United States Code, the \n     roles of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, other \n     members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the combatant \n     commanders.\n       (8) Section 151(b) of title 10, United States Code, \n     designates the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the \n     principal military advisor to the President, the National \n     Security Council, the Homeland Security Council, and the \n     Secretary of Defense.\n       (9) Section 151(b) of title 10, United States Code, also \n     designates the other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (as \n     designated in section 151(a) of title 10, United States Code) \n     as the military advisors to the President, the National \n     Security Council, the Homeland Security Council, and the \n     Secretary of Defense as specified in subsections (d) and (e) \n     of section 151 of title 10, United States Code.\n       (10) Section 151(c) of title 10, United States Code directs \n     that ``the Chairman shall, as he considers appropriate, \n     consult with and seek the advice of the other members of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff and the commanders of the unified and \n     specified combatant commands''.\n       (11) Section 151(d) of title 10, United States Code, \n     establishes mechanisms for members of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff, other than the Chairman, to submit ``to the Chairman \n     advice or an opinion in disagreement with, or advice or an \n     opinion in addition to the advice presented by the Chairman \n     to the President, the National Security Council, the Homeland \n     Security Council, and the Secretary of Defense''.\n       (12) Section 151(e) of title 10, United States Code, \n     directs members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, individually or \n     collectively, in their capacity as military advisors to \n     provide advice on a particular matter to the President, the \n     National Security Council, the Homeland Security Council, and \n     the Secretary of Defense when requested.\n       (13) Section 151(f) of title 10, United States Code, \n     permits a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to make \n     recommendations to Congress relating to the Department of \n     Defense as he considers appropriate after first informing the \n     Secretary of Defense.\n       (14) Section 164 of title 10, United States Code, \n     establishes the powers, responsibilities, and duties of the \n     commanders of the combatant commands.\n       (15) The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense \n     Reorganization Act of 1986 was enacted 22 years ago and the \n     provisions of title 10, United States Code, referred to in \n     paragraphs (8) through (14) of this subsection, as enacted by \n     that have not been amended since except to include the \n     Homeland Security Council as the authorized recipient of \n     military advice from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the \n     commanders of the combatant commands.\n       (16) The employment of the Armed Forces in the 22 years \n     since the enactment of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of \n     Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 has produced a body of \n     experience and lessons learned by the Joint Chiefs of Staff \n     and the commanders of the combatant commands.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that it \n     is an appropriate time in the national interests of the \n     United States for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the \n     commanders of the combatant commands to review the \n     authorities of and procedures for members of the Joint Chiefs \n     of Staff and the commanders of the combatant commands to \n     provide military advice to the President, the Secretary of \n     Defense, the National Security Council, and the Homeland \n     Security Council.\n       (c) Review of Authorities and Procedures.--The Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall, in consultation with the \n     other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the commanders \n     of the combatant commands, conduct a review of sections 151 \n     and 164 of title 10, United States Code, for the purposes as \n     follows:\n       (1) To determine whether the authorities in such sections \n     are adequate and sufficient such that those senior military \n     officers are afforded the opportunity to present military \n     advice or opinion to the President, the National Security \n     Council, the Homeland Security Council, and the Secretary of \n     Defense.\n       (2) To identify recommendations, if any are determined \n     appropriate, for modifications to the authorities in such \n     sections to ensure or enhance the provision of military \n     advice to the President, the National Security Council, the \n     Homeland Security Council, and the Secretary of Defense by \n     those senior military officers.\n       (d) Report.--\n       (1) Report to secretary of defense.--Not later than June \n     15, 2009, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall \n     submit to the Secretary of Defense a report on the review \n     conducted under subsection (c), including a comprehensive \n     description of the determinations made under subsection \n     (c)(1) and of any recommendations identified under subsection \n     (c)(2).\n       (2) Report to congress.--Not later than July 30, 2009, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall transmit to the congressional \n     defense committees the report submitted under paragraph (1). \n     In transmitting the report, the Secretary may include such \n     comments on and recommendations regarding the report as the \n     Secretary considers appropriate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5432.

That fundraising was an accomplishment unparalleled by \n     any other city in the United States irrespective of \n     population and reflected the passion of public opinion about \n     World War I, which had so recently ended.\n       (3) Following the drive, a national architectural \n     competition was held by the American Institute of Architects \n     for designs for a memorial to the service of Americans in \n     World War I, and the competition yielded a design by \n     architect H. Van Buren Magonigle.\n       (4) On November 1, 1921, more than 100,000 people witnessed \n     the dedication of the site for the Liberty Memorial in Kansas \n     City, Missouri. That dedication marked the only time in \n     history that the five allied military leaders present, \n     Lieutenant General Baron Jacques of Belgium, General Armando \n     Diaz of Italy, Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France, General John \n     J. Pershing of the United States, and Admiral Lord Earl \n     Beatty of Great Britain, were together at one place.\n       (5) General Pershing, a native of Missouri and the \n     commander of the American Expeditionary Forces in World War \n     I, noted at the November 1, 1921 dedication that ``[t]he \n     people of Kansas City, MO are deeply proud of the beautiful \n     memorial, erected in tribute to the patriotism, the gallant \n     achievements, and the heroic sacrifices of their sons and \n     daughters who served in our country's armed forces during the \n     World War. It symbolized their grateful appreciation of duty \n     well done, and appreciation which I share, because I know so \n     well how richly it is merited''.\n       (6) During an Armistice Day ceremony in 1924, President \n     Calvin Coolidge marked the beginning of a three-year \n     construction project for the Liberty Memorial by the laying \n     of the cornerstone of the memorial.\n       (7) The 217-foot Liberty Memorial Tower has an inscription \n     that reads ``In Honor of Those Who Served in the World War in \n     Defense of Liberty and Our Country'' as well as four stone \n     ``Guardian Spirits'' representing courage, honor, patriotism, \n     and sacrifice, which rise above the observation deck, making \n     the Liberty Memorial a noble tribute to all who served in \n     World War I.\n       (8) During a rededication for the Liberty Memorial in 1961, \n     World War I veterans and former Presidents Harry S. Truman \n     and Dwight D. Eisenhower recognized the memorial as a \n     constant reminder of the sacrifices during World War I and \n     the progress that followed.\n       (9) The 106th Congress recognized the Liberty Memorial as a \n     national symbol of World War I.\n       (10) The 108th Congress designated the museum at the base \n     of the Liberty Memorial as ``America's National World War I \n     Museum''.\n       (11) The National World War I Museum is the only public \n     museum in the United States specifically dedicated to the \n     history of World War I.\n       (12) The National World War I Museum is known throughout \n     the world as a major center of World War I remembrance.\n       (b) Designation.--The Liberty Memorial at the National \n     World War I Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, is hereby \n     designated as the ``National World War I Memorial''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5440.

That section also requires the \n     Department of Defense to work with Department of Veterans \n     Affairs, to the maximum extent practicable, as well as with \n     public and private entities and institutions of higher \n     learning, to develop a comprehensive plan and strategy for a \n     Military Eye Injury Registry, which would track the \n     diagnosis, surgical intervention, and follow up for each \n     significant case of eye injury incurred by a member of the \n     Armed Forces while serving on active duty.\n       (6) Section 1623 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2008 also requires the Department of Defense \n     and the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide a \n     cooperative program for members of the Armed Forces and \n     veterans with traumatic eye injury by conducting research on \n     prevention of visual dysfunctions, which is a frequent \n     complication from Traumatic Brain Injury.\n       (7) On June 9, 2008, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for \n     Health Affairs decided that the Vision Center of Excellence \n     will be established in the National Capital Region and will \n     be comprised of multiple clinical centers throughout the \n     Nation at Department of Defense and Department of Veterans \n     Affairs medical centers.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Vision Center of Excellence will be a world class \n     vision center supporting both members of the Armed Forces and \n     veterans;\n       (2) research on visual impairments related to Traumatic \n     Brain Injury needs to be expanded, and the Vision Center of \n     Excellence should play a key role in identifying current and \n     future research needs;\n       (3) the goal of the Vision Center of Excellence is to \n     provide all members of the Armed Forces who suffer ocular \n     trauma or disease the most comprehensive, coordinated, \n     progressive, and highest quality eye care possible;\n       (4) the Vision Center of Excellence should maximize \n     Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, and \n     civilian resources to ensure the most compassionate, \n     synchronized, and professional eye care; and\n       (5) the Department of Defense should examine the potential \n     benefit of screening for eye injuries when service members \n     are screened for Traumatic Brain Injury.\n       (c) Reports to Congress.--\n       (1) Report on implementation of vision center of \n     excellence.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall, in \n     coordination with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, submit \n     to the Committees on Armed Services and Veterans' Affairs of \n     the Senate and the Committees on Armed Services and Veterans' \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives a report on the \n     status of implementation of the Vision Center of Excellence. \n     The report shall include, at a minimum, a description of the \n     mission of the Vision Center of Excellence, the resources or \n     funds available to fund the Vision Center of Excellence from \n     fiscal years 2009 through 2013, and the planned programs and \n     priorities of the Vision Center of Excellence.\n       (2) Report on visual screenings in connection with tbi.--\n     Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the feasability and advisability of performing \n     visual screenings on all members of the Armed Forces who \n     experience Traumatic Brain Injury.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5445.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of amendment \nNo. 5368, which Senator Graham of South Carolina and I have filed. It \nis an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, which we \nhope to be able to call up in the next day or two.\n  This amendment expresses the sense of the Senate recognizing the \nstrategic success of the troop surge in Iraq and expressing gratitude \nto the members of the U.S. Armed Forces who have made that success \npossible.\n  It was exactly 1 year ago today, September 10, 2007, that GEN David \nPetraeus came to Capitol Hill to testify about the situation in Iraq. \nAt that time, General Petraeus laid out the facts. He gave us an \naccurate and honest assessment of the situation on the ground. He \npresented the growing evidence that the surge was working and that \nsecurity there was improving.\n  Many, I fear, did not want to listen to General Petraeus, because \nmany had already made up their minds about the surge. They were wedded \nto the idea that the surge was a mistake because they were wedded to \nthe idea that the war was a mistake and that, in fact, we had already \nlost it. They didn't want to hear evidence that General Petraeus \npresented that day that America could still win this critical fight. As \na result, even before GEN David Petraeus set foot on Capitol Hill, this \nhonorable American soldier was met by a hail of preemptive attacks by \nopponents of the surge and the war.\n  One group, moveon.org, made the absolutely irresponsible and \noffensive accusation that General Petraeus would try to cook the books \nto justify the surge. But 1 year later, we know the truth. It was, in \nfact, moveon.org that was cooking the books, not General Petraeus. The \ngeneral was right that the surge was working, and his critics were \nwrong. Had we heeded their advice to abandon the surge and retreat from \nIraq in 2007, the United States would have suffered by its own decision \na catastrophic defeat in Iraq that would have had terrible consequences \nfar beyond Iraq for years to come. Fortunately, we did not abandon \nGeneral Petraeus and his brave troops, and as a result, the situation \nin Iraq has now completely reversed.\n  In the 12 months since General Petraeus came before Congress to \ntestify on this very day a year ago, almost every imaginable indicator \nof progress in Iraq, particularly political, economic, military, and \nsecurity, has changed for the better. The surge is not just a tactical \nsuccess, as some of its opponents have suggested. It is a strategic \nsuccess for the United States and for the cause of freedom. Because of \nthe surge, our two most threatening enemies in the world today--al-\nQaida and Iran--are weaker and America is safer.\n  I don't believe this is a matter of opinion by this Senator. I \nbelieve it is now a matter of fact that should be acknowledged. I know \nsome opponents of the surge have recently tried to write off this \nremarkable success by claiming it doesn't matter. They say the success \nof the surge is irrelevant because Iraq itself is irrelevant, a \ndistraction from the real central front of the war on terror which they \nsay is Afghanistan.\n  This is a profoundly mistaken and misguided argument. Both Iraq and \nAfghanistan are important, but I ask my colleagues: Does anyone here \nbelieve it is irrelevant if al-Qaida wins or loses in Iraq, a nation \nthat historically has been at the heart of the Arab world? Does anyone \nhere really believe it is irrelevant if Iran succeeds or fails in its \nefforts to seize control of Iraq? Does anyone really want to tell our \nbrave men and women in uniform in Iraq that the hard-won gains they \nhave achieved over the past year, the lives that have been lost in that \neffort through their struggle and sacrifice are irrelevant? The answer, \nto me, is clearly no.\n  So let there be no doubt, the outcome of the war in Iraq is anything \nbut irrelevant. On the contrary, in my opinion, there are few matters \nmore important to the safety and security of the United States today \nthan whether we win or lose in Iraq.\n  If there is anyone in this Chamber who doubts the strategic stakes in \nIraq, I urge them to listen to General Petraeus. Listen to General \nPetraeus who warned us in an interview published today in the \nWashington Post that ``Iraq is still viewed as the central front for \nal-Qaida.'' Let me repeat that: ``Iraq is still viewed as the central \nfront for al-Qaida,'' which is to say by al-Qaida. Not Afghanistan, \nIraq; not Pakistan, Iraq.\n  This is not the opinion of a Member of Congress. It is not the \nopinion of a politician running for office. It is the judgment of \nAmerica's most successful battlefield commander in the war on terror \nwhich began 7 years ago tomorrow when America was brutally attacked on \n9/11/2001. This is the judgment of a general whom this Senate confirmed \nas the Supreme Commander for U.S. Forces in the Middle East and South \nAsia, who is soon to become the Commander in Chief at CENTCOM. What \nthis general tells us is that it is Iraq, not Afghanistan, that is the \ncentral front of al-Qaida's war on us as defined by them, by the enemy.\n  One year ago, many in Congress did not want to listen to General \nPetraeus. In the 12 months since then, however, we have been presented \nwith ample evidence why that was a mistake. I hope we will not repeat \nthat mistake again.\n  So today on the 1-year anniversary of General Petraeus's testimony \nbefore Congress, let's resolve to come together across party lines. It \nis time to recognize reality. It is time to acknowledge that the surge \nhas been a strategic success in the central front of the war on the \nterrorists who attacked us 7 years ago tomorrow morning. It is time to \nexpress thanks to our courageous men and women in uniform who made the \nsurge possible, rather than undercutting their struggle and sacrifices \nas irrelevant. And it is time to pledge that the hard-won gains secured \nby the surge will be honored and preserved, not squandered by attempts \nto impose arbitrary timetables for withdrawal, regardless of what is \nhappening on the ground in Iraq.\n  The good news is that all of the troops who were sent to Iraq as part \nof the surge, approximately 30,000, have now returned home because of \nthe success of the surge, and they are not being replaced. President \nBush announced just yesterday that an additional 8,000 troops will be \nwithdrawn by next February. Again, because the surge has worked, \nbecause the Iraq Security Forces are more capable of protecting their \nown country, because the political leadership of the country has come \ntogether to govern--giant steps along the path to what we have been \nhoping for throughout this conflict.\n  That is why Senator Graham and I have offered this bipartisan \namendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. We hope the Senate \ncan unite to take up and adopt this amendment. It is not going to \nhappen today on the 1-year anniversary of the Petraeus testimony, but I \nhope it will happen soon.\n  Let's stop for a moment, is what we are asking, and acknowledge the \nhistoric significance of what has been achieved at great sacrifice by \nthe men and women who have worn the uniform of the United States, by \nthe coalition forces who have been there, and, indeed, by the Iraq \nSecurity Forces themselves.\n  Eighteen months ago, Iraq was in chaos. Very few thought we could \nachieve success there. Yet now in the space of less than 2 years an \nextraordinary turnaround, one of the most remarkable in the history of \nthe American military, the proud history of the American military, has \nbeen brought about. I truly believe the men and women who have served \nthere under General Petraeus, now soon under General Odierno, a \nwonderfully prepared and able and strong leader, will be viewed by \nhistory as America's next or newest ``greatest generation.''\n  Obviously, there is still much we need to do to secure ultimate \nvictory in Iraq. Of course, we still face other great challenges from \nterrorists throughout the world and from others, such as autocratic \npowers rising again.\n  But at this moment, particularly on this day, I wanted to give thanks \nfor the truly historic achievement that belongs to GEN David Petraeus \nand the men and women of the American military who have served under \nhim. I hope this amendment can be brought up, and\n\n[[Page S8328]]\n\nwhen it is, we will come together as Americans who are grateful to our \ntroops for a job well done.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank everyone here who stayed until I finished.\n  I yield the floor and wish everyone a good night.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/10/senate-section/article/S8328-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M.
