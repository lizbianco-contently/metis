Mr. President, following leader remarks, the Senate will \nconsider H.R. 7081, the United States-India nuclear agreement. This is \nan issue that has been worked on long and hard for months and months. \nFinally, we are having the opportunity to get to it. Senators Dorgan \nand Bingaman have amendments to the bill that will be debated this \nmorning. Under an agreement reached yesterday, there will be up to 60 \nminutes for debate on the bill and 60 minutes on each amendment.\n  Following the debate on the United States-India nuclear legislation, \nthe Senate will proceed to consider H.R. 1424, the legislative vehicle \nused for the economic rescue legislation. The only amendments in order \nare a Sanders amendment regarding high-income individuals and a Dodd \namendment regarding economic stabilization.

The \nSanders amendment will be determined by voice vote. Votes will be in \nrelation to the following items: motion to concur with respect to H.R. \n2095, Amtrak; the Dorgan amendment regarding clarifying the policy in \nthe event of an Indian nuclear test; the Bingaman amendment reporting \nrequirement in the event of an Indian nuclear test; passage of H.R. \n7081, the India-United States nuclear agreement, which has a 60-vote \nthreshold--as do the two amendments, the Sanders amendment\n\n[[Page S10190]]\n\nregarding tax on high-income individuals and the Dodd amendment \nregarding economic stabilization, which is a 60-vote threshold--and \npassage of H.R. 1424, and there is a 60-vote threshold there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10190-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FINANCIAL RESCUE PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday Senator McConnell and I came to \nthe floor to discuss the way forward on the financial rescue package. \nWe agreed that now is not the time for politics or partisanship. Every \nMember of this Senate could probably write a better bill than we have \nhere, but this was a jointly agreed upon bill. When I say jointly, I \nmean the House and Senate working with people from the administration. \nWe agreed that now--I repeat--now is not the time for partisanship. \nLiterally, the security and well-being of the American people are at \nrisk, and we have to work together to solve this crisis. So last night, \nDemocrats and Republicans gave consent to move to a vote later today on \na package of bills that will stabilize our economy, restore confidence \namong consumers and businesses, and create new jobs and economic \ngrowth.\n  This package of bills will include the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act, which will increase Federal coverage of bank \ndeposits to $250,000. It will have the Senate-passed tax extenders, \nalong with other things in it, including long-overdue legislation to \nhonor Senator Wellstone and Senator Domenici, who worked for more than \na decade--Senator Wellstone, of course, was killed in that unfortunate \nairplane crash, but this has been going on for years while Senator \nWellstone served here in the Senate working with Senator Domenici. As \nSenator Domenici leaves this body, he will now finally be able to claim \nthe ownership he deserves on this legislation to provide parity in \nhealth care coverage for Americans who suffer from mental health \nillness.\n  The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act is vastly improved over the \nversion we received initially from Secretary Paulson. We have worked \ntogether, Democrats and Republicans, by adding significant oversight in \nhow public funds are spent, we have stopped golden parachutes for \nexecutives at taxpayer expense, we have provided taxpayers with a \ngreater likelihood of a return on the funds spent and help for \nhomeowners facing foreclosure.\n  To this bedrock plan we added an increase in FDIC insurance for bank \naccount deposits from $100,000 to $250,000, which will give consumers \nrenewed confidence that the safety of their savings is ironclad. This \nis especially important for community-owned banks, for small banks, and \nrural America.\n  We include tax extenders to lower taxes for middle-class families, \nbusinesses, and for private sector entrepreneurs and producing clean, \nrenewable, alternative energy sources. These tax cuts will create \nhundreds of thousands of jobs here in America, spark investment in the \neconomy by small businesses and large businesses, and help chart our \ncourse away from imported oil toward the homegrown fuels of tomorrow.\n  There are a few people in the House who would rather we did this some \nother way, and we have tried other ways. I say to my friends in the \nHouse of Representatives, we have to get this done. We cannot leave \nWashington without doing the financial rescue package and this tax \nextenders bill. People are waiting. People have been laid off.\n\n  Senator Durbin and I had a man come to us--an immigrant from the \nUkraine--who has been extremely successful in America. He is an \nAmerican citizen, of course. He came to us and said: If you don't pass \nthe tax extenders, I am going to lose my business; people will be laid \noff. Hundreds of people will be laid off. He had loans for developing \nthese businesses, and if the tax extenders did not come forward, they \nwouldn't loan him the money. They would call back the loans, is what he \ntold us.\n  So legislation is never perfect, but we have done our best, and these \ntax extenders are so important for the American people. It would not be \ngood for us to leave here--it would be a blight on this Congress--and \nnot pass these tax extenders. These aren't for the wealthy, they are \nfor people who are working for a living and trying to keep a job. And \njobs will be created. I repeat, tens of thousands of jobs will be \ncreated.\n  I believe every part of this bill enjoys bipartisan support. Every \npart is aimed directly at the heart of our financial crisis. No one is \nhappy about paying for this dramatic and expensive step with the \nbailout. No one is glad we have reached this critical point. Senator \nObama said yesterday that there will be plenty of time to assign blame. \nNow is our time to work--not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as \nguardians of the public trust--to forge a better way ahead.\n  So I am hopeful that tonight we will see a strong vote in support of \nthis plan and that the bipartisanship shown here in the Senate today \nwill spark the House of Representatives to do the same.\n  Mr. President, the Founding Fathers were very visionary in setting up \nthis unique system we have here--the legislative system. We have three \nseparate but equal branches of Government. But the legislative branch \nwas set up by our Founding Fathers so that there would be internal \nstrife. That is the way they set it up. Members of the House of \nRepresentatives are elected for 2-year terms, we have 6-year terms, and \na lot of the time there is envy and jealousy as to how we do what in \neach body. But in the end, we need to work together. We get a lot of \nstuff from the House that we don't like in the way they have written \nit, but that is who they are. They do not like what we send them, and \nthey probably think they could do a better job than we have--and maybe \nthey could have--but this is what we are going to send them.\n  I hope, as soon as the House can move, they will move quickly--maybe \ntomorrow--so that by this weekend rolling around we will have done what \nwe need to do for the American people. I repeat, this isn't for Lower \nManhattan, this is for people in Elkhorn, NV, in Reno, NV, and in Las \nVegas, NV. This is so people can keep their jobs and be able to buy \ncars and get a loan to take care of that car. It is so a car dealer \nwill be able to do as they have done for decades and borrow money to \nbuy cars so they have cars to sell. Right now, they can't do that. I \ngot a call yesterday from a car dealer in Las Vegas saying that he \ncan't buy any cars and that he needs to have inventory. He said if \nsomebody tries to buy a car, most people can't get a loan. And it is \ngoing to get worse, not better, unless we do something.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10190-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, after Monday's vote in the House, the \nquestion is not how we got here but how we get out and how to get our \neconomy back on its feet. So after extensive consultation between the \nmajority leader and myself and the leaders in both parties here in the \nSenate, we believe we have crafted a way to go forward and to get us \nback on track. This is the only way to get the right kind of solution \nfor the American people. Both Senator Obama and Senator McCain are \ncoming back tonight to embrace this effort and to help us reassure the \nAmerican people that we are going to fix this problem.\n  No one is happy with the situation we are in, but it is a situation \nthat we have. And the American people didn't send us here just to do \neasy things; they expect us to rise to big challenges and to put aside \ndifferences and to work on their behalf. So tonight the Senate will \nvote on an economic rescue plan designed to shield millions of \nAmericans from shockwaves of a problem they didn't create.\n  We have two problems. We have the equity markets and we have the \ncredit markets, and a way of thinking of it is like this: You could \nthink of our whole economy as the human body, but the credit markets \nare the circulatory system. Right now, as the distinguished majority \nleader pointed out, the credit markets are frozen, so the circulatory \nsystem is not working as it should. If the circulatory system doesn't \nwork, it begins to choke off the body--the economy. With the step we \ntake tonight, we\n\n[[Page S10191]]\n\nare confident we will be able to restore the circulatory system, if you \nwill, and regain health for the economy--the body, if you will--and get \nthe problem fixed for the American people.\n  I said yesterday that we are going to fix this problem this week. The \nSenate will speak tonight. We will send to the House a package that, if \npassed, will address the issue.\n  We will have demonstrated to the American people that we can deal \nwith the crisis in the most difficult of times--right before an \nelection, when the tendency to be the most partisan is the greatest. \nBut we are in the process of setting that aside, rising to the \nchallenge--both Democrats and Republicans--and doing what is right for \nthe American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10191-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to the consideration of H.R. 7081, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 7081) to approve the United States-India \n     Agreement for Cooperation on Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am standing in today, my colleagues should \nbe aware, for Senator Biden, who is the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. As most of the world is aware, he is otherwise \noccupied.\n  As the ranking Democrat next to him, I have been asked to assume the \nresponsibility of bringing this matter before the Senate. Senator Biden \nhas spent a great deal of time on this issue, along with his friend and \ncolleague, the former chairman, Senator Lugar, as have other Members as \nwell.\n  Today we will talk about this issue, the importance of it, the action \ntaken by the House of Representatives under the leadership of Howard \nBerman, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of that body.\n  I have a letter from the Secretary of State, as well as other \nsupporting information, that leads us to the conclusion that this bill \nought to be passed, and passed, I hope, overwhelmingly by this body \nbecause of the message it would send not only to the people and the \nGovernment of India but others as well about the direction we intend to \ntake in the 21st century about this matter.\n  I will share some opening comments, and I will turn to my colleague, \nSenator Lugar, for any comments he has, and then Senator Dorgan and \nSenator Bingaman--at least two people I know who have amendments they \nwish to have offered. I know they have comments and thoughts they have \nto share on this subject matter as well.\n  In addition to Senator Lugar and Senator Biden on the committee, \nthere are other Members as well who expressed a strong interest in the \nsubject matter--not necessarily an agreement with this proposal but \nnonetheless should be recognized for their diligence in paying \nattention to the issue. Senator Feingold of Wisconsin and Senator \nBarbara Boxer of California have demonstrated a real interest and \nconcern about this issue.\n  I want to speak for a few minutes about Representative Henry Hyde. I \nwas elected with him in 1974 to the House of Representatives. He is no \nlonger with us, but nonetheless he made a remarkable contribution as a \nRepublican Member of the House of Representatives, not the least of \nwhich was this one, on the Hyde amendment, which will be discussed, I \npresume, at some length today as we talk about this bill, H.R. 7081, \nthe United States-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and \nNonproliferation Enhancement Agreement.\n  I rise to urge passage of this bill, approving the United States-\nIndia peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement. On this past Saturday, \nthe House of Representatives passed this bill by a margin of 298 to \n116, a resounding vote in support for this agreement.\n  This agreement with India is as important as it is historic. This \nbill enables the United States and India to chart a new course in \nrelations between our two great democracies.\n  There are compelling geopolitical reasons to move forward with this \nrelationship. India has become a major actor in the world.\n  Why don't we put up this map. One of the things I thought I would do \nis put up a map. I know everyone knows exactly where these countries \nare located, but I think sometimes it can be helpful to remind people \nof the tremendous importance of India's location in Asia, sharing \nborders with many countries--certainly China and Pakistan and in close \nproximity with Afghanistan, a very fragile part of the world.\n  If you look at this map--I will leave it up for a good part of the \nday--you will appreciate, aside from the agreement itself, the \nstrategic importance of this relation for the United States.\n  India has become a major actor in the world, and it increasingly sees \nitself in concert with other global powers, rather than in opposition \nto them.\n  Indian Prime Minister Singh, who visited Washington just last week, \nhas devoted energy and political courage in forging this agreement, and \nin seeking approval for it in India. Put simply, he has placed himself \nand his political party on the line.\n  In India, the political symbolism of the agreement is extremely \nimportant. It addresses the most divisive and long-standing issue \nbetween our two countries dating back to 1974. Most important, the \nagreement addresses India as an equal--a point that looms large in \nIndia, where there are strong memories of a colonial past and of \ntensions with the United States during the Cold War.\n  Some of the debate in India focused on whether the agreement with the \nUnited States would hamper India's nuclear weapons program. But much of \nthe give-and-take was really about a more basic question--whether it \nwas really time for India to work cooperatively with Western countries. \nReaching an accord on nuclear status has been wrenching for India, \ndespite the favorable terms that some say India obtained.\n  This agreement is indicative of a new era in Indian foreign policy--\nan era in which India will see all the world's powers as potential \npartners in efforts to address its own needs and the needs of others. I \nbelieve that this new era will bring increased stability and progress \nto South Asia. I see the bill before us as approving far more than just \na nuclear agreement. Among other things, it will set the stage for a \nstronger U.S.-India relationship, which will be of critical importance \nto our country in the 21st century.\n  The Committee on Foreign Relations held an in-depth hearing on the \nU.S.-India agreement last month. The committee, along with the House \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs, worked closely with the administration to \naddress technical concerns expressed about the agreement. This \nextraordinary consultation resulted in a bill that will improve U.S. \nimplementation of the accord and assure that nuclear non-proliferation \nremains at the core of U.S. foreign policy. Our committee approved a \nbill identical to the House-passed bill by a vote of 19-to-2. I commend \nchairman Howard Berman in the House and Senator Lugar for his \nleadership as well.\n  This agreement is not a partisan issue. President Clinton launched \nthe initiative, and President Bush pushed it to fruition. It had strong \nsupport on both sides of the aisle in 2006, when we voted on the Henry \nJ. Hyde Act, establishing the underlying principles and requirements of \nthis accord. Indeed, 85\n\n[[Page S10192]]\n\nmembers of the Senate supported the Hyde Act, and only 12 voted against \nit. I believe the resulting agreement has strong support today.\n  I mentioned Henry Hyde arrived in Congress in 1975, along with some \n74 of us elected in that fall of 1974. I had a wonderful relationship \nwith Henry Hyde. We served together in the House and then during our \nrespective tenure in that body, and then in this body. As I mentioned \nearlier, Henry Hyde was a remarkable Member of Congress and \naccomplished many things. He was controversial in some ways but a \nperson of deep conviction, deep personal convictions, and he brought \nthat conviction to everything he engaged in as a matter of public \npolicy.\n  We probably would not be in as strong a position today to talk about \nthis agreement had it not been for the Hyde Act. So I would be remiss \nthis morning in discussing this if we didn't pay tribute to Henry Hyde \nand his contribution to this very issue. I want the record to reflect \nmy appreciation for the work this man did on behalf of all of us by \ndrafting and supporting and insisting upon the adopting of the Hyde \nAct.\n  Mr. President, throughout our work on this agreement we have sought \nto address concerns expressed in the United States as well as in India. \nSome nuclear nonproliferation experts have voiced a fear that it would \nlead India--and then India's neighbors--to increase the production of \nnuclear weapons. Some experts have warned that giving India the right \nof peaceful nuclear commerce, despite its refusal to sign the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty, could undermine the world's willingness to \nabide by that vital treaty and to enforce compliance with it. We have \nbeen consistently vigilant to such risks, and the Hyde Act and this \nbill give us the tools to remain so in the future.\n  The process that led to the U.S.-India agreement was undertaken with \nan eye to achieving progress on nonproliferation issues. Pursuant to a \ndeclaration issued in July 2005 by President Bush and Prime Minister \nSingh, it is important to note the following:\n  India has improved its export control law and regulations;\n  India has moved to adhere to the guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers \nGroup and the Missile Technology Control Regime;\n  India has affirmed that it will not transfer equipment or technology \nfor uranium enrichment or spent fuel reprocessing to any country that \ndoes not already have a full-scale, functioning capability;\n  India has reaffirmed, both to the United States and to the Nuclear \nSuppliers Group, its unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing;\n  India has initialed, and intends to sign, a safeguards agreement with \nthe IAEA;\n  India has begun to negotiate an Additional Protocol to that \nsafeguards agreement; and\n  India will bring under IAEA safeguards over a dozen existing or \nplanned nuclear facilities that were not previously subject to \nsafeguards.\n  The bill before the Senate provides additional measures that guide \nthe implementation of the agreement, and they are worthy of note.\n  This agreement reaffirms that our approval of the agreement is based \non U.S. interpretations of its terms. In other words, it reaffirms that \nPresident Bush's assurances about fuel supplies are a political \ncommitment--and are not legally binding.\n  It requires the President to certify that approving this agreement is \nconsistent with our obligation under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty not to assist or encourage India to produce nuclear weapons.\n  Before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission can issue any licenses under \nthis agreement, India's safeguards agreement with the IAEA must first \nenter into force. In addition, India must file a declaration of \ncivilian nuclear facilities under the safeguards agreement that is not \n``materially inconsistent'' with the separation plan that India issued \nin 2006. We know that there will be some changes, because the 2006 plan \nenvisioned safeguards beginning that year--rather than 2 years later. \nBut this guards against a declaration that flatly contradicts India's \npromises.\n  The bill also requires prompt notification of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee if India should diverge from its separation plan in \nimplementing its safeguards agreement.\n  The bill establishes a procedure for congressional review--and \npossible rejection--of any ``subsequent arrangement'' under the \nagreement that would allow India to reprocess spent nuclear fuel that \nwas derived from U.S.-supplied reactor fuel or produced with U.S.-\nsupplied equipment. Article 6 of the India agreement anticipates such a \nsubsequent arrangement if India builds a new reprocessing facility \ndedicated to its civilian nuclear power sector. Congress should have a \nspecial role in this, because spent fuel reprocessing can produce \nweapons-grade plutonium. This is an improvement over current law, which \nallows such arrangements to take effect 15 days after public notice is \ngiven in the Federal Register.\n  The bill requires the President to certify that it is U.S. policy to \nwork in the Nuclear Suppliers Group to achieve further restrictions on \ntransfers of enrichment and reprocessing equipment or technology.\n  The bill also directs the President to seek international agreement \non procedures to guard against the diversion of heavy water from \ncivilian to military programs. The India agreement has protections for \nheavy water that the United States may supply, or that is produced with \nU.S.-supplied equipment. We need to get supplier countries to adopt \nsimilar standards. This was the subject of some lengthy conversation at \nthe committee hearing on this very matter, talking about the heavy \nwater issue and what can be produced by that. I left the hearing \nconfident that the administration intends to pursue these matters very \naggressively.\n  The bill requires regular reporting on the executive branch progress \nin its efforts on enrichment and reprocessing limits and protecting \nagainst heavy water diversion.\n  That is a lot to consume. I will be happy to make this available to \nmy colleagues to review--staff have worked on this very diligently over \nthe last number of years--to respond to any Member or staff member \nabout any of this. It is somewhat complicated when you get into the \nissue of heavy water and physics. Nonetheless, there are matters I want \nthe Members to be confident about when they consider their vote on this \nvery important bill.\n  So, again, I wish to thank the administration, and I will ask \nunanimous consent, if I may--this is a letter which we received from \nthe State Department, from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, \nexpressing the strong support of the administration for this agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DODD. As I mentioned earlier, of course, I'd like to express my \ngratitude to Senator Biden for his remarkable work on this effort, \nalong with Senator Lugar. Obviously, this team who has worked so \nclosely together on so many issues, but this one is of extreme \nimportance. Again, I urge my colleagues to be supportive of it. We have \na chance to get this done.\n  There are those who will argue for delaying and waiting later, but I \nthink the moment is here. Again, this is an important message to send. \nAs I mentioned earlier, I am not sure my colleagues are aware of this, \nbut Prime Minister Singh showed remarkable courage as the Prime \nMinister of that country in forging this agreement. I think our \nresponse to it is important--not that we ought to sign on to it for \nthat reason--but it is important, how important this relationship is.\n  Again, I draw the attention of my colleagues to this map behind me \nand the central role, geographically, this great and mature democracy \nholds in this part of the world, where in many cases there is something \nfar less than a strong and mature democracy. To have a good, strong \nrelationship with this great country in this century will be of \ncritical importance, I believe, to our safety as a nation and the \nsafety of mankind.\n  So this agreement transcends a bilateral relationship. It goes far \ndeeper than that, reaches far broader than the boundaries of two \ncountries separated by the great distance but allows us, for\n\n[[Page S10193]]\n\nthe first time in some 35 years, to once again grow closer together as \ntwo greet democracies.\n  The tension between our countries has been there for these past 35 \nyears. Tonight we will have an opportunity to put that behind us and to \nbuild a new relationship.\n  For that reason, this agreement also has great significance and \nimport.\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                      Washington, October 1, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Reid: I am writing to express support for the \n     ``United States-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and \n     Nonproliferation Enhancement Act'' (H.R. 7081). I very much \n     appreciate your consideration of this important bill within \n     such an extraordinary timeframe. We would not be asking for \n     such exceptional action if we did not believe it was \n     necessary to complete an initiative on which both the \n     Administration and Congress have worked very hard, and on a \n     thoroughly bipartisan basis, since 2005.\n       The U.S.-India nuclear agreement marks the culmination of a \n     decade-long process. Two successive Administrations have \n     sought to improve U.S.-India relations and adapt American \n     policy to India's emergence on the international stage. For \n     the United States, passage of this legislation will clear the \n     way to deepen our strategic relationship with India, open \n     significant opportunities for American firms, help meet \n     India's surging energy requirements in an environmentally \n     friendly manner, and bring India into the global nuclear \n     nonproliferation mainstream.\n       I encourage you to pass H.R. 7081 without amendment. The \n     current bill advances the U.S.-India relationship while \n     enhancing nonproliferation efforts worldwide. Amendments \n     would unnecessarily jeopardize the careful progress we have \n     achieved with India at a time when I believe it is important \n     for us to seize the significant momentum we have created in \n     the U.S.-India relationship.\n       I understand that some Senators have questions about the \n     impact of an India nuclear test on this initiative. We \n     believe the Indian government intends to uphold the \n     continuation of the nuclear testing moratorium it affirmed to \n     the United States in 2005 and reiterated to the broader \n     international community as recently as September 5, 2008. Let \n     me reassure you that an Indian test, as I have testified \n     publicly, would result in most serious consequences.\n       Existing in U.S. law would require an automatic cut-off of \n     cooperation, as well as a number of other sanctions, if India \n     were to test. After 60 continuous session days, the President \n     could waive the termination of cooperation if he determined \n     that the cut-off would be ``seriously prejudicial'' to \n     nonproliferation objectives or ``otherwise jeopardize the \n     common defense and security.'' We believe existing law \n     strikes the proper balance in responding to a nuclear test, \n     and it is consistent with the approach adopted by the Nuclear \n     Suppliers Group when it adopted the exception for India in \n     early September.\n       Please allow me also to reiterate what I told Congress on \n     April 5, 2006, when this same question arose: ``We've been \n     very clear with the Indians . . . should India test, as it \n     has agreed not to do, or should India in any way violate the \n     IAEA safeguard[s] agreements to which it would be adhering, \n     the deal, from our point of view, would at that point be \n     off.''\n       Encouraging India's sustained commitment to its moratorium \n     on nuclear testing will be important to the strategic \n     partnership the United States now seeks to build with India. \n     Congress and the Administration have carefully addressed \n     testing concerns in the Hyde Act, the U.S.-India 123 \n     Agreement, and the testimony of Administration officials.\n       We have an unprecedented and historic opportunity before us \n     to help shape the 21st century for the better. With this \n     legislation in its current form, the Senate can help ensure \n     that the United States and India complete the journey we \n     began together three years ago. You can also help ensure that \n     U.S. industry--just like its international counterparts--is \n     able to engage with India in civil nuclear trade.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Condoleezza Rice.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Senator Dodd for his \nleadership in the Foreign Relations Committee as we took up this \nhistoric agreement. He and I both congratulate Prime Minister Singh, \nour President, President Bush, and Secretary Rice for their advocacy.\n  This is, indeed, a historic day and a historic moment in the \nrelationship between the United States and India, a very important \npartnership for world peace.\n  Today we consider the United States-India Peaceful Nuclear \nCooperation Agreement. This is one of the most important strategic \ndiplomatic initiatives undertaken in the last decade. By concluding \nthis pact, the United States has embraced a long-term outlook that will \ngive us new diplomatic options and improved global stability.\n  The legislation we are considering approves the 123 Agreement that \nwill allow the United States to engage in peaceful nuclear cooperation \nwith India, while protecting U.S. national security and \nnonproliferation efforts, as well as congressional prerogatives.\n  It is an opportunity to build a strategic partnership with a nation, \nIndia, that shares our democratic values and will exert increasing \ninfluence on the world stage.\n  Last Saturday, September 27, the House of Representatives voted 297 \nto 117 to approve this agreement. Senate approval would be the capstone \nto more than 3 years of efforts in the United States and India and \naround the world.\n  By embracing this agreement, India's leaders are seeking to open a \nnew chapter in the United States-India relations and reverse decades of \nfundamental disagreement over the nonproliferation regime. India has \ncreated a new national export control system; promised to maintain its \nunilateral nuclear testing moratorium; pledged to work with us to stop \nthe spread of enrichment and reprocessing technologies; proposed to \nseparate its civilian and military facilities and committed to place \nits civilian facilities under IAEA safeguards.\n  If approved, an agreement will allow India to receive nuclear fuel \ntechnology and reactors from the United States, benefits that were \npreviously denied to India because of its status outside the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty.\n  The benefits of this pact are designed to be a lasting incentive for \nIndia to abstain from further nuclear weapons tests and to cooperate \nclosely with the United States in stopping proliferation.\n  The 123 Agreement was submitted by President Bush on September 10, \n2008. Last week, the Foreign Relations Committee voted 19 to 2 to \nreport this bill, approving the agreement to the full Senate. The bill \nthe House voted on Saturday was almost identical to the bill approved \nby the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Now, 2 years ago, the Senate voted 85 to 12 to approve legislation \nthat set the parameters for the 123 Agreement we are considering today. \nThe House voted 359 to 68 to approve companion legislation. At the \ntime, the Foreign Relations Committee undertook an extensive review of \nthe agreement and its context. We held three public hearings with \ntestimony from 17 witnesses, including our Secretary of State, \nCondoleezza Rice.\n  We received a classified briefing from Under Secretaries of State \nNick Burns and Bob Joseph. Numerous briefings were held for staff with \nexperts from the Congressional Research Service, the State Department, \nthe intelligence community, and the National Security Council.\n  I submitted 174 written questions for the record to the Department of \nState on details of the agreement, and I posted those answers on my Web \nsite. The 2006 legislation set the rules for today's consideration of \nthe 123 Agreement between the United States and India.\n  Unlike the administration's original proposal, the Hyde Act neither \nrestricted nor predetermined congressional action on the 123 Agreement.\n  We expect India to move quickly to negotiate a new safeguards \nagreement with the IAEA and then to seek consensus from the Nuclear \nSuppliers Group in accordance with the Hyde Act. Unfortunately, \ndomestic political divisions in India led to a delay of almost 2 years.\n  Final action on these two tasks was not completed until earlier this \nmonth. India engaged and obtained the approval of a new safeguards \nagreement with the IAEA on August 1. Nuclear Suppliers Group consensus \nwas received on September 6. Since that time, the administration and \nboth Houses of Congress have worked diligently to evaluate the \nagreements, answer questions from Members of Congress, and move the \nprocess forward.\n  The Hyde Act required the President to report to Congress on whether \nIndia had met seven determinations which are as follows: India has \nprovided the United States and the IAEA with a separation plan for its \ncivilian and military facilities and filed a declaration regarding \ncivilian facilities with the IAEA; India has concluded all legal steps \nprior to signature for its safeguards agreement in perpetuity with the \nIAEA; India and the IAEA are making substantial progress in completing\n\n[[Page S10194]]\n\nan additional protocol; India is working actively with the United \nStates to conclude a fissile material cutoff treaty; India is working \nwith and supporting the United States to prevent the spread of \nenrichment and reprocessing technology; and, India is taking the \nnecessary steps to secure nuclear materials and technology; and, the \nNuclear Suppliers Group has decided by consensus to permit supply to \nIndia of nuclear items under an exception to their guidelines.\n  Now, 2 weeks ago at a Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Under \nSecretary of State for Political Affairs Bill Burns, Acting Under \nSecretary Joan Rood, and the lead U.S. Negotiator, Richard Stratford, \nprovided detailed analysis of the agreement. Members were able to \nexamine the documents accompanying the 123 Agreement and ask questions \nof witnesses about the Hyde Act, the 123 Agreement's text, the new \nsafeguards agreement, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group decision.\n  I am convinced the President has met all the required determinations \nunder the Hyde Act. However, the congressional review of the agreement \ndemonstrated that two issues required provisions in the legislation \nbefore us.\n  First, India has not identified in the text of its IAEA safeguards \nagreement those facilities it will place under safeguards. India has \nprovided a plan for the separation of facilities from its nuclear \nweapons program to the IAEA, but the plan is nonbinding and appears \noutdated.\n  This is not what Congress understood would happen when we approved \nthe Hyde Act. Indeed, in 2006, the administration requested bill \nlanguage calling on India to file ``a declaration regarding its civil \nfacilities with the IAEA.''\n  The safeguards agreement containing that declaration was to enter \ninto force before submission of the 123 Agreement to Congress.\n  Under the Hyde Act, India and the IAEA must conclude:\n\n       All legal steps required prior to signature by the parties \n     of an agreement requiring the application of IAEA safeguards \n     in perpetuity in accordance with IAEA standards, principles, \n     and practices . . . to India's civil nuclear facilities, \n     materials, and programs. . . . including materials used in or \n     produced through the use of India's civil nuclear facilities.\n\n  The purpose of this complex provision was to secure the most complete \nversion possible of the safeguards agreement for congressional review. \nWe intended that it be submitted as part of the Presidential \ndetermination and waiver report required by the Hyde Act. \nUnfortunately, by not naming the facilities in the safeguards \nagreement, there is an open question as to when India will act. This \nhas legal implications because the United States is prohibited by law \nand our NPT obligations from having nuclear trade with any facility not \nnamed in India's safeguards agreement.\n  In response to this issue, Section 104 of the bill before us requires \nthat licenses may not be issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nfor transfer of nuclear fuel, equipment and technology until after the \nPresident determines and certifies to Congress that, one, the \nsafeguards agreement approved by the IAEA Board of Governors on August \n1, 2008, has entered into force; and, two, India has filed a \ndeclaration of facilities that is not materially inconsistent with the \nfacilities and schedules described in its separation plan.\n  The second issue that required a new provision in this legislation is \nIndia's desire to reprocess spent nuclear fuel burned in its reactors, \nincluding fuel from the United States. Reprocessing can result in the \nseparation of plutonium, which can be used in a nuclear weapon.\n  The United States permits some NPT members with long histories of \nstrong compliance with the IAEA agreement to reprocess U.S.-origin \nspent nuclear fuel through a process called programmatic consent.\n  During negotiations on the 123 Agreement, India requested \nprogrammatic consent and the United States agreed. However, the United \nStates made programmatic consent contingent on India establishing a \ndedicated facility to carry out the reprocessing and an agreement on \nreprocessing procedures in this new facility.\n  During the formulations hearings, I asked Acting Under Secretary John \nRood if the arrangement that would be negotiated with India to permit \nreprocessing would be submitted to Congress for review.\n  Mr. Rood stated: `` . . . yes, that's required under the Atomic \nEnergy Act.''\n  Permitting spent nuclear fuel from the United States to be \nreprocessed in India is a complex matter that requires careful \nimplementation. The bill before us today does not block negotiations on \nsuch arrangements with India. However, the bill does require a future \nadministration to submit such a ``subsequent arrangement'' to Congress \nwhich would have the power to pass a resolution of disapproval.\n  By addressing these two important matters, I believe this legislation \nimproves congressional oversight for future nuclear cooperation with \nIndia and corrects a problem related to the new safeguards agreement \nIndia has with the IAEA.\n  In conclusion, I strongly urge my colleagues to approve the United \nStates-India agreement. The national security and economic future of \nthe United States will be enhanced by a strong and enduring bipartisan \nwith India.\n  With a well-educated middle class that is larger than the entire U.S. \npopulation, India can be an anchor of stability in Asia and an engine \nof global economic growth.\n  Moreover, the United States has a strong interest in expanding energy \ncooperation with India to develop new technologies, cut greenhouse gas \nemissions, and prepare for declining global fossil fuel reserves.\n  The United States' own energy problems will be exacerbated if we do \nnot forge energy partnerships with India, China, and other nations \nexperiencing rapid economic growth. This legislation will promote much \ncloser United States-Indian relations while preserving the priority of \nour nonproliferation efforts. We should surely move forward now.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the tragedy of 9/11 is indelibly imprinted \non the minds of all of us. What is not so well understood or remembered \nwas that one month later, October 2001, something else happened. Graham \nAllison, someone who has worked on nonproliferation in the Clinton \nadministration, has written a book about it. Time magazine wrote about \nit in March of 2002.\n  Here is what they said: A month after 9/11, for a few harrowing \nweeks, a group of U.S. officials believed the worst nightmare of their \nlives--something even more horrific than 9/11--was about to come true. \nIn October of 2001, an intelligence report went out to a small number \nof government agencies, including the Energy Department's top secret \nnuclear emergency search team based in Nevada.\n  This is a Time report, but I have it also in a book written by Graham \nAllison.\n  The report said that terrorists were thought to have obtained a 10-\nkiloton nuclear weapon from the Russian arsenal and that they planned \nto smuggle it into New York City. The source of the report was a CIA \nagent named Dragonfire. Dragonfire's report actually was something that \nwas claimed to be undetermined in terms of reliability. But it was \nsomething the CIA agent named Dragonfire had picked up. Dragonfire's \nclaim tracked with a report from a Russian general who believed his \nforces were missing a 10-kiloton device. Since the mid-1990s, \nproliferation experts have wondered whether several portable nuclear \ndevices might be missing from the Russian stockpile. That made the \nDragonfire report all that more alarming. Detonation of a 10-kiloton \nnuclear weapon in downtown New York would kill about 100,000 civilians, \nirradiate 700,000 more, and flatten everything for a half a mile.\n  So the counterterrorist investigators went on the highest alert, we \nare told. The search team went to New York City. It was kept secret so \nas not to panic the people of New York. Mayor Giuliani was not \ninformed. If terrorists had managed to smuggle a nuclear weapon into \nNew York City, the question was, could they detonate it. About\n\n[[Page S10195]]\n\na month later, after this report from a CIA agent named Dragonfire of a \nnuclear weapon having been stolen by terrorists, smuggled into New York \nCity, about to be detonated, about to kill massive numbers of people, \nit was determined that perhaps this was not a credible intelligence \nreport. But in the postmortem evaluation, they determined it is \nplausible to have believed a Russian nuclear weapon could have been \nstolen. It is plausible to believe, having stolen it, terrorists could \nhave smuggled it into New York City, and plausible to believe they \ncould have detonated it; one low-yield nuclear weapon. There are 25,000 \nof them on this planet. Think of the apoplectic seizure that occurred \nin October of 2001 over a report by a CIA agent that he picked up some \ninformation about one low-yield nuclear weapon being smuggled into New \nYork City. There are 25,000 nuclear weapons on this Earth.\n  Our job is to provide the leadership to begin to reduce the number of \nnuclear weapons. The bill before us will almost certainly expand the \nproduction of nuclear weapons by India.\n  Here is what it says to India: Even as we take apart the basic \narchitecture of nonproliferation efforts, the nuclear nonproliferation \ntreaty, which India is one of three countries that has never signed, \neven as we take that nonproliferation architecture apart with this \nbill, we have said to India, with this agreement, you can misuse \nAmerican nuclear technology and secretly develop nuclear weapons. That \nis what they did. You can test those weapons. That is what they did. \nYou can build a nuclear arsenal in defiance of United Nations \nresolutions and international sanctions. After testing, 10 years later, \nall will be forgiven, and you will be welcome into the club of nuclear \npowers without ever having signed the nonproliferation treaty.\n  Let's understand what this does. First, let me say that never has \nsomething of such moment and such significance and so much importance \nbeen debated in such a short period and given such short shrift: one \nvery brief committee hearing in the Senate and a total of a couple of \nhours here on the Senate floor today; pretty disappointing.\n  What this agreement says is, India needs various kinds of equipment \nand technology to produce and build nuclear powerplants. They need more \npower, and they want to get it from nuclear powerplants. They have been \nprevented from accessing the kind of material and equipment to produce \nthose plants because they have not signed the nonproliferation treaty, \nand they developed nuclear weapons outside of the purview of all of us, \nmisusing American nuclear technology to secretly develop these weapons. \nNow we have said in an agreement with them, yes, we will allow big \ncompanies now to sell you this technology--this is all about big \ncompanies being able to access a new marketplace for technology, to \nsell the technology and the capability to develop nuclear powerplants--\nwe will allow you to do that, and we will have the opportunity in this \nagreement for you to put eight of your plants behind a curtain that \nwill have no international inspections, which is a green light to say, \nyou may produce additional nuclear weapons.\n  That is not just a supposition. Almost everybody understands that is \ngoing to happen. This agreement does not prohibit them from nuclear \ntests in a way that would nullify the agreement, if they do test. The \nAdministration's interpretation of this agreement is very ambiguous \nabout that.\n  I want to go through a couple of points. India would have unlimited \nability to import fuel for 14 civilian powerplants under this \nagreement. That is what they want. They want to produce additional \npower with nuclear plants. Then it says India could have eight other \npower reactors behind a curtain that we will not be able to inspect. \nIndia can then divert its entire domestic fuel supply to eight military \nreactors to produce additional nuclear weapons.\n  What does that mean? It is our agreeing that India, that has never \nsigned the nonproliferation treaty and has tested nuclear weapons and \ndeveloped nuclear weapons in secret using our technology, is now given \nan agreement that allows them to build more nuclear weapons. Their \nneighbor is Pakistan, also possessing nuclear weapons. Pakistan warned \nthe international community yesterday that a deal allowing India to \nimport United States atomic fuel and technology could accelerate the \nnuclear arms race between India and Pakistan. India and Pakistan have \nfought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947 and, through \na peace process, have stabilized relations since 2004, but they remain \ndeeply distrustful of each other. We have now reached an agreement that \nsays one of them may begin to produce additional nuclear weapons.\n  UPI--Islamabad, Pakistan: Without naming sources, the Press Trust \nreported Wednesday that the Pakistani Prime Minister has reported \nconstruction of two nuclear powerplants with Chinese assistance. The \nmove appears aimed at counterbalancing a nuclear fuel deal negotiated \nwith India. The decision was made on September 19 in Islamabad. The \npoint is, we will allow you to put eight reactors behind a curtain. We \nwill allow you to produce additional nuclear weapons that we won't know \nabout. Is there a reaction to that? Pakistan has a reaction, to engage \nwith the Chinese.\n  The United States had agreed that the purpose of the agreement was \nnot to contain India's strategic program but to enable resumption of \nfull civil nuclear energy cooperation. So that is the India separation \nplan. That is what they say. They say the United States and India \nagreed the purpose of the agreement is not to constrain India's \nstrategic program. That means they say the agreement is to not \nconstrain India's ability to produce nuclear weapons. That is what that \nmeans.\n\n  I am going to offer an amendment today that the managers will oppose. \nThe conferees believe there should be no ambiguity regarding the legal \nand policy consequences of any future Indian test of a nuclear \nexplosive device. That is from a joint statement of the conference of \nthe Hyde Act which passed the Congress. There should be no ambiguity. \nHere is what the Administration says it thinks the agreement provides: \nShould India detonate a nuclear explosive device, the United States has \nthe right to cease all nuclear cooperation. Well, we know we have the \nright. Are we going to do it? No. That is deliberate ambiguity to say \nif India were to test a nuclear weapon, there is nothing that will \nrequire us to decide to nullify this agreement.\n  Let me say again, the India Prime Minister says the agreement does \nnot in any way affect India's right to undertake future nuclear tests, \nif necessary.\n  This is a planet with 25,000 nuclear weapons, tactical and strategic. \nThe suspected loss or stealing of one caused an apoplectic seizure in \nOctober of 2001. We have 25,000 of them. Our job as an international \nleader, a world leader, our job is to begin marching back from the \nabyss; that is, to reduce the number of nuclear weapons. Instead we are \ntaking apart the basic architecture of nuclear nonproliferation that \nhas served us for many decades. We are saying to India, who has never \nsigned the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, it is OK if you produce \nadditional nuclear weapons we can't see and we don't know about. We are \ngoing to sign an agreement that allows you to do that. That is almost \nunbelievable.\n  India is a very important trading partner. India is a very important \nally for our country. I believe that. I accept that. But this \nadministration and those in the Congress who have agreed to the measure \nbefore us today are making a grievous mistake. We will not have second \nchances with respect to this issue of nuclear weapons. If we don't \nprovide the world leadership to begin marching back from the prospect \nof terrorists using nuclear weapons, the prospect of nuclear weapons \nbeing stolen and developed by terrorist organizations, we will one day \nwake up and tragically read that a nuclear weapon was exploded in a \nmajor city on this planet. This agreement marches in exactly the wrong \ndirection. Do you think this agreement allowing India to produce \nadditional nuclear weapons has no impact on Pakistan, has no impact on \nChina, has no message to the rest of the world? The message is: You can \nmisuse American nuclear technology and secretly develop nuclear \nweapons. You can test those weapons. You can build a nuclear arsenal in \ndefiance of United Nations resolutions, and\n\n[[Page S10196]]\n\nyou will be welcomed as someone exhibiting good behavior with an \nagreement with the United States. What kind of message is that? What \nmessage does that send to others who want to join the nuclear club who \nsay: You have nuclear weapons, we want some.\n  If we don't find a way to begin systematically reducing the number of \nnuclear weapons and stop the spread of nuclear weapons and try to find \nevery way to prevent a nuclear weapon from ever again being exploded in \nanger on this planet, one day we will ruefully regret what we have done \nhere.\n  Again, let me close by saying that never in my life has such a large \nissue been given such short shrift. This issue has great consequences \nfor this country, the world, and their respective futures for that \nmatter, and this administration is, in my judgment, making a very \nserious mistake.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I inquire of my colleague from North Dakota, \nis it the intent of the Senator to offer an amendment at this time or \nis it later this morning, or what is my colleague and friend's plan?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Connecticut, I \nam waiting for the Senator from New Mexico to come to the floor. What \nwe are going to do is we are going to combine our two amendments.\n  Mr. DODD. OK.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We will still wish to take the 30 minutes each, but we \nwill combine the two amendments and have a vote on one amendment, \nprovided, of course, that meets unanimous consent. But I will, in a few \nmoments, be ready to consume my half hour on this subject if that is \nyour desire. I want to wait for Senator Bingaman to come in order to \nconsult. He should be here momentarily.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in his absence, why don't we wait. My plan \nwould be to have you do that and make your statements, and I will \nrespond to them at the appropriate time.\n  So I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Bingaman and I will be combining \nour amendments into a Dorgan-Bingaman amendment, with other cosponsors, \nand that is now being put together by legislative counsel. So we will \nhave that here briefly. But why don't I proceed with my 30 minutes. I \nthink Senator Bingaman will have 30 minutes. Then apparently there is \ngoing to be a response following that, and we will conclude a portion \nof this debate.\n  So, Mr. President, on the 30 minutes I now have available, let me \nread to my colleagues something written by Graham Allison. Graham \nAllison is someone who has been involved in nuclear nonproliferation \nwith the Clinton administration. He wrote this in a book, and this, by \nthe way, is published in an article. I want to read it. I will quote \nit:\n\n       One month after the terrorist assault on the World Trade \n     Center and the Pentagon, on October 11, 2001, President \n     George W. Bush faced a more terrifying prospect. At that \n     morning's presidential daily intelligence briefing, George \n     Tenet, the director of central intelligence, informed the \n     president that a CIA agent codenamed ``Dragonfire'' had \n     reported that Al Qaeda terrorists possessed a 10-kiloton \n     nuclear bomb, evidently stolen from the Russian arsenal. \n     According to Dragonfire, this nuclear weapon was in New York \n     City.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       The government dispatched a top-secret nuclear emergency \n     support team to the city. Under a cloak of secrecy that \n     excluded even Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, these nuclear ninjas \n     searched for the bomb. On a normal workday, half a million \n     people crowd the area within a half-mile radius of Times \n     Square. A noon detonation in Midtown Manhattan would kill \n     them all instantly. Hundreds of thousands of others would die \n     from collapsing buildings, fire and fallout in the hours \n     thereafter.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       In the hours that followed, Condoleezza Rice, then national \n     security adviser, analyzed what strategists call the \n     ``problem from hell.'' Unlike the Cold War, when the US and \n     the Soviet Union knew that an attack against the other would \n     elicit a retaliatory strike of greater measure, Al Qaeda--\n     with no return address--had no such fear of reprisal. Even if \n     the president were prepared to negotiate, Al Qaeda has no \n     phone number to call.\n\n  Again, continuing to quote:\n\n       Concerned that Al Qaeda could have smuggled a nuclear \n     weapon into Washington as well, the president ordered Vice \n     President Dick Cheney to leave the capital for an \n     ``undisclosed location,'' where he would remain for weeks to \n     follow--standard procedure to ensure ``continuity of \n     government''. . . .\n       Six months earlier the CIA's Counterterrorism Center had \n     picked up chatter in Al Qaeda channels about an ``American \n     Hiroshima.'' The CIA knew that Osama bin Laden's fascination \n     with nuclear weapons went back at least to 1992, when he \n     attempted to buy highly enriched uranium from South Africa. . \n     . .\n       As CIA analysts examined Dragonfire's report and compared \n     it with other bits of information, they noted that the \n     September attack on the World Trade Center had set the bar \n     higher for future terrorist attacks. . . .\n       As it turned out, Dragonfire's report proved to be a false \n     alarm. But the central takeaway from the case is this: The US \n     government had no grounds in science or logic to dismiss this \n     possibility, nor could it do so today.\n\n  Now, think of that. That is a discussion about one low-yield 10 \nkiloton nuclear weapon allegedly stolen from the Russian stockpile, \nsmuggled into New York to be detonated by terrorists--one nuclear \nweapon. There are 25,000 on this Earth. One small weapon caused an \napoplectic seizure about the prospect of hundreds of thousands of \npeople being killed.\n  What does that have to do with this? Well, what it has to do with \nthis is we have struggled since the end of the Second World War to try \nto put a cap on the bottle here and make sure a nuclear weapon is never \nagain exploded in anger--not by a military power, not by a terrorist \ngroup. We have tried to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. We have \ntried to see if we could find a way to reduce the number of nuclear \nweapons. We have created something called the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty, the NPT. We have created something called the Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty, which I regret to say our country has not ratified. But we have \ntried to find ways to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, stop the \nbuilding of additional nuclear weapons.\n  One of three countries that did not sign the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty \nwas India. They refused to sign it. In these intervening years, what we \nhave discovered about India--a respected ally of ours, a trading \npartner of ours, a country we hold in high esteem--we have discovered \nthat they misused American nuclear technology to secretly develop their \nown nuclear weapons. We have discovered that they tested those nuclear \nweapons. They have defied the United Nations resolutions and \ninternational sanctions.\n  Now we have discovered that an agreement has been reached with the \nGovernment of India that all will be forgiven. We will sign a new \nagreement with you--that I believe unwinds and undoes the entire \narchitecture of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. All will be \nforgiven. In fact, what we will do is we will say to you that you can \ncreate nuclear powerplants because you need nuclear power, and our \ncorporations and international corporations can sell--this is about \nbusiness, a lot of business--can sell to you the technology and the \nconstruction materials to produce nuclear powerplants. And, oh, by the \nway, the agreement also says you can have eight nuclear powerplants \nthat are behind a curtain that will never be inspected by international \ninspectors. That is where you can produce additional nuclear weapons, \nwhich the Indian Government wishes to do.\n\n  This agreement is an unbelievable mistake. At exactly the moment when \nthis country should exhibit its leadership, its world leadership that \nis required of this country to not only stop the spread of nuclear \nweapons but to begin marching back to reduce the number of nuclear \nweapons, at this exact time, this Government, this administration and \nthis Congress, is saying to an ally: We will give you the green light \nto produce more nuclear weapons even though you have never signed the \nnonproliferation treaty. That is almost unbelievable to me.\n\n[[Page S10197]]\n\n  The nonproliferation treaty prohibits peaceful nuclear assistance to \nso-called nonnuclear states unless they agree to put all their \nfacilities under international safeguards and give up the option of \nproducing nuclear weapons. With this agreement, we say that does not \nmatter anymore. It does not matter. You do not have to subject these \neight plants to international safeguards. You do not have to give up \nthe option of producing nuclear weapons.\n  The five traditional nuclear powers in the post-Second World War \nperiod--Russia, the United States, Britain, France, and China--all have \nsigned the nonproliferation treaty. All other countries are considered \nto be nonnuclear states according to the nonproliferation treaty.\n  Article I of the NPT obligates the recognized nuclear weapon states, \nincluding the United States, ``not in any way to assist, encourage, or \ninduce any non-nuclear weapons State to manufacture or otherwise \nacquire nuclear weapons. . . .'' With this agreement, we have decided \nthat does not matter. We have no intention to pay attention to Article \nI any longer.\n  Section 128 of the Atomic Energy Act requires all states other than \nthe five I mentioned to have full-scope safeguards as a prerequisite \nfor receiving U.S. civil nuclear exports. That does not matter anymore.\n  Section 129 of the Atomic Energy Act requires the termination of \nnuclear exports if a nonnuclear weapon state has, among other things, \ntested nuclear weapons after 1978. We have said that does not matter \nanymore.\n  Section 102 of the Arms Export Control Act requires sanctions on any \nnonnuclear weapon state that has detonated a nuclear device. That \ndoesn't matter anymore. The United Nations Security Council resolution \n1172 condemned India and Pakistan's 1998 nuclear tests. The United \nStates-India agreement says that none of these provisions will be \napplicable to India anymore, even though it secretly used our \ntechnology to develop nuclear weapons and then tested them.\n\n  Now, a working nuclear bomb can be produced with as little as 35 \npounds of uranium 235 or 9 pounds of plutonium 239. I think nuclear \nterrorism and the threat of nuclear terrorists gaining access to \nnuclear weapons represent the gravest security threats to our Nation, \nbar none.\n  Retired GEN Gene Habiger, who commanded America's nuclear forces, has \nsaid that nuclear terrorism ``is not a matter of if; it is a matter of \nwhen.''\n  In 2006, Henry Kissinger wrote in the Washington Post:\n\n       The world is faced with the nightmarish prospect that \n     nuclear weapons will become a standard part of national \n     armament and wind up in terrorist hands.\n\n  It will become a standard part of armament for countries, because \nthey want to possess it, and it will inevitably end up in terrorist \nhands.\n  Former Senator Sam Nunn wrote in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       We know that terrorists are seeking nuclear materials--\n     enriched uranium or plutonium--to build a nuclear weapon. We \n     know that if they get that material they can build a nuclear \n     weapon. We believe that if they build such a weapon, they \n     will use it. We know terrorists are not likely to be \n     deterred, and that the more this nuclear material is \n     available, the higher the risks.\n\n  We know Osama bin Laden has been seeking the opportunity and the \nmaterials to build nuclear weapons since the early 1990s. In 1998, \nOsama bin Laden issued a statement titled ``The Nuclear Bomb of \nIslam,'' declaring:\n\n       It is the duty of Muslims to prepare as much force as \n     possible to terrorize the enemies of God.\n\n  I described the book entitled ``Nuclear Terrorism'' written by Graham \nAllison, an official in the Clinton administration who worked on these \nissues: The potential stealing of one low-yield weapon terrorizing the \ncountry and a city.\n  Nowhere is the threat of nuclear terrorism more imminent than in \nSouth Asia. It is home to al-Qaida, which is seeking nuclear weapons. \nIt is an area where Pakistan and China and India have always had tense \nrelations. All three possess nuclear weapons. India and China fought a \nborder war in 1962. India and Pakistan have fought three major wars and \nhad two smaller scale contests. Both detonated nuclear explosions in \n1998 and declared themselves a nuclear power. After that, the world \nheld its breath while India and Pakistan fought a limited war in \nKashmir. India is thought to have a modest cache of nuclear weapons at \nthis point. You can go to the journals and get estimates of 25 to 50 or \n60 nuclear weapons, but India wants more.\n  It seems to me that to do this in the absence of an understanding of \nwhat it means in the region, and in the absence of what it means to \nunravel the regime by which we have tried to move toward \nnonproliferation of nuclear weapons is a dangerous step.\n  I wish to describe something The New York Times wrote yesterday, and \nI fully agree: President Bush and his aides were so eager for a foreign \npolicy success they didn't even try to get India to limit its weapons \nprogram in the future. They got no promise from India to stop producing \nbomb-making material, no promise not to expand its arsenal, and no \npromise not to resume nuclear testing. The Senate should postpone \naction until the next Congress can figure out how to limit the damage \nfrom this deal.\n  I fully agree with that. I don't have any understanding why we are \nrushing--with one short hearing before one committee in this Congress--\nto a short, truncated version on the floor of the Senate, and then \nagreement.\n  Here is the agreement: India would have unlimited ability to import \nfuel for 14 civilian nuclear powerplants, and it could then divert all \nof its current domestic fuel supply to 8 military reactors which are \nused for nuclear weapons production, with no international inspection \nat all.\n  If anyone thinks this makes sense for our country, I think there is \nsomething wrong with that thinking.\n  Will it have a consequence with respect to Pakistan? I expect so. \nPakistan warned the international community in July that a deal \nallowing India to import United States atomic fuel and technology could \naccelerate a nuclear arms race between Delhi and Islamabad. They have \nfought substantial wars before, as I said.\n  So what does Pakistan do? They go off and they will seek nuclear fuel \nassistance from China to build 10 nuclear powerplants. Will they be \ninspected? The move appears aimed at counterbalancing a nuclear fuel \ndeal negotiated this year between India and Western suppliers.\n  Paragraph 5 of the India separation plan says: The United States and \nIndia--this is India's portion of the agreement--had agreed that the \npurpose of the agreement was not to constrain India's strategic \nprogram.\n  That is a fancy way of saying their understanding is we are not \nconstraining their ability to produce additional nuclear weapons.\n  Now, the Hyde Act passed the Congress and allowed this negotiation to \ntake place. I didn't vote for it. I was one of a minority who didn't \nvote for it because it had some huge holes in it, but here is what the \nconferees said:\n\n       The conferees believe there should be no ambiguity \n     regarding the legal and policy consequences of any future \n     testing of a nuclear explosive device by India.\n\n  That is what they said. Here is how the Administration interprets the \nagreement that is on the floor of the Senate:\n\n       Should India detonate a nuclear explosive device, the \n     United States has the right to cease all nuclear cooperation \n     with India.\n\n  We already have that right. But is that ambiguous? It surely is. The \nAdministration doesn't say we are going to shut down or nullify this \nagreement; it says we have the right to.\n  The proposition of the Hyde amendment that passed the Congress said \nit should be unambiguous. No ambiguity. Yet the Administration is \ndeliberately being ambiguous so that if India tests a nuclear weapon, \nthat country may still not be subject to sanctions.\n  The BJP, which may be India's next ruling party, says:\n\n       The BJP would like to clearly reiterate that any compromise \n     on India's right to nuclear test is wholly unacceptable. \n     Finally, the agreement does not in any way affect India's \n     right to undertake future nuclear tests, if necessary.\n\n  This last statement was from the Prime Minister of India. Do we need \nto say more about what might or might not be here?\n  Senator Bingaman and I are offering an amendment, the Dorgan-Bingaman \namendment, with a good number of cosponsors, that makes clear two \nthings. No. 1: If India would test, it would nullify this agreement \nwith respect to United States cooperation. No. 2: Senator Bingaman has \nadded--and we are\n\n[[Page S10198]]\n\nputting them together--if India were to test a nuclear weapon, the \nexport controls we can enact to deal with other suppliers around the \nworld and their dealings with India should be fully utilized.\n  Let me go back to where I started for a bit. Probably all of my \ncolleagues have been in the same discussions. I hear people say nuclear \nweapons are like any other weapon. I hear people say nuclear weapons \nare usable. I hear people say we need to build new nuclear weapons here \nin our country. We need to build bunker-buster weapons, nuclear weapons \nthat can go under and bust some caves; Earth-penetrating bunker-buster \nweapons. Designer nuclear weapons. We have all heard it. This \nadministration has wanted to build new designer nuclear weapons.\n\n  Some believe a nuclear weapon is like any other weapon. It is not. It \ncan never be used. To the extent and when it is used, if it is used by \na terrorist group or country, nothing on this Earth will be the same.\n  It was different in the 1940s. The last time a nuclear weapon was \nused in anger, outside of tests, was to end the Second World War. Then \nvirtually no one else had nuclear weapons. Now we have nuclear weapons \nspread around this globe. This country has assumed the responsibility \nfor many years--the mental responsibility to try to stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons. It is a desperate attempt to say: You know what. The \nonly way this planet is going to continue is if we stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons. Does anybody think if people start lobbing nuclear \nweapons back and forth, killing millions of people, that this planet \nsurvives? I don't. We have 25,000 of them on this planet, and we are \ngoing to sign up to an agreement today that says let's produce more? \nNot us, although we have people here who want to produce more in this \ncountry. This says let India produce more in secret. What does that \nmean to Pakistan? What does that mean to China? What does that mean to \nthat South Asian region? What does it mean to the world?\n  This is such a truncated debate and such a shame. There are a lot of \nvery interesting, qualified, serious people who ought to be weighing in \non this to describe what we are doing here today in terms of the \nconsequences to this planet. What are the consequences to the regime \nthat has existed for many years--five or six decades now--to try to \nstop the spread of nuclear weapons?\n  I had a hearing one day in my appropriations subcommittee, because we \nfund the nuclear weapons portion of the appropriations process in the \nDepartment of Energy. In that hearing, someone described the fact that \nthe last time a nuclear weapon was used in a conflict was in 1945, and \nit has been all of these decades--all of these decades--that we have \nconstrained the use of nuclear weapons. The Soviets and the U.S. built \nmassive stockpiles of nuclear weapons under a doctrine called Mutually \nAssured Destruction, believing that if either attacked the other, the \nretaliation would essentially destroy both. The original attack would \ninflict massive damage on the country that was attacked, but the \ncountry that was attacked would also retaliate in a manner that \nvirtually obliterated the attacking country. So that mutually assured \ndestruction represented a standoff during the Cold War with the Soviet \nUnion.\n  In the meantime, other countries aspired to become nuclear weapons \npowers, to obtain nuclear weapons, and to this day not only do many \ncountries still desire these things, but now terrorists do as well. So \nthe question is, Who is going to step us back from this cliff? We have \na former Secretary of Defense who believes there is about a 50-percent \nchance that a nuclear weapon--I believe he said a 50-percent chance--\nwill be exploded in a major city within 10 years. I don't doubt that \ncould be the prospect if we don't use all of our energy and all of our \nleadership capability as a leading nuclear power in this world--a \nnuclear weapons power in this world--to try to march back from 25,000 \nnuclear weapons to far fewer nuclear weapons; to try to put up walls by \nwhich we will not allow people or countries to proliferate nuclear \nweapons.\n  We have a man in Pakistan who is under house arrest, and has been for \na long while, Mr. A. Q. Khan, who apparently is a national hero of \nsorts in Pakistan. He spread nuclear secrets all around the world for \nmoney. Our country has never even been able to interview him, to talk \nto him, to understand where these secrets went. As I said, he is not in \nprison, he is under house arrest. He is still considered a hero by \nsome.\n  We have to get serious about this issue of the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons. We are not getting serious about an issue such as this \nby dismantling the very structure that has helped us now for some 60 \nyears to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons or at least prevent the \nuse of nuclear weapons.\n  In the Appropriations Committee hearing I described earlier, I said: \nWe have been lucky, and someone said: Well, it is much more than luck. \nI said: I agree it is more than luck. It is a regime, it is a structure \nof nonproliferation that we have worked on. Many administrations worked \nseriously in this area.\n  This administration, regrettably, appointed people to positions of \nauthority on nuclear nonproliferation who didn't believe in the \nmission. They didn't even believe in the mission. The question for us \nnow is: Is this the way forward, to take apart the structure?\n  When I said we have been lucky, what I meant was that the structure \nhas certainly helped, but we are going to need more than that. We are \ngoing to need some good fortune. If we think we can live on a planet \nwith 25,000 nuclear weapons, that somehow, some way, some day, somebody \nis not going to steal one and detonate it in a major city--we have to \nbe serious about this.\n  India is a wonderful country. India is an ally of ours. It is an ally \nof the United States. But that should not justify our deciding to give \na green light to India--a country which has never signed the \nnonproliferation treaty--give the green light to produce more nuclear \nweapons. That is exactly what this agreement does. No one can stand up \nin this discussion and say: This agreement doesn't allow a country that \nhas refused to sign the nonproliferation treaty, this agreement does \nnot allow them to produce more nuclear weapons. It does on its face, \nand everybody knows it. Everybody wants to pretend as though it doesn't \nexist.\n  This is a horrible mistake. I am enormously surprised, after so many \ndecades of people talking and thinking seriously about nuclear \nnonproliferation, that we reward those countries that misuse nuclear \ntechnology in order to secretly produce nuclear weapons and secretly \ntest nuclear weapons. We now say to them: By the way, here is your \nreward, an agreement by which you can continue to do it; an agreement \nwhich is written in a way that says we will allow you to produce more \nnuclear weapons and, oh, by the way, if you test, we won't even put in \nthe agreement that we will nullify it. An agreement we might nullify. \nWe ought to put in the agreement, ``We will,'' which was promised in \nthe conference report.\n\n  So maybe I am not capable of understanding the world view of some \nthat allowing an ally of the United States, that has not signed the \nnonproliferation treaty, to produce additional nuclear weapons is \nsomehow strengthening our country or the world or is good for us. Maybe \nI missed something, but I don't think so. I think what is missing is \nthe logic and the commitment to nonproliferation of those who \nnegotiated this. What is missing is the determination and the \nrelentless effort by this country to lead in the direction of reducing \nthe number of nuclear weapons and not allowing the production of more.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time. How much time do I \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Five minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I reserve the remaining 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have a consent agreement that would \ncombine the two amendments. I ask unanimous consent that the order with \nrespect to H.R. 7081 be modified to provide that the Dorgan and \nBingaman amendments be combined into one amendment; that all debate \ntime specified previously remain available and the amendment be subject \nto the 60-vote threshold, as provided under the previous agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 588, S. 602.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 602) to develop the next generation of parental \n     control technology.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, with an amendment to strike all after the enacting \nclause and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Safe Viewing Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, let me thank Senator Dorgan for \nhis leadership on this issue and for his heartfelt and very well-\narticulated statement about the reasons why we need to amend this \nagreement before we proceed any further. I strongly agree with him, and \nI am honored to join with him in proposing an amendment that will \nimprove the agreement that is coming to the Senate floor tonight for \nconsideration.\n  The bill we are dealing with tonight seeks to obtain expedited \napproval of\n\n[[Page S10200]]\n\nthe United States-India nuclear cooperation agreement. The agreement \nwas the result of a bill we passed into law 2 years ago--nearly 2 years \nago--that exempted India from the very export controls that were placed \ninto the Atomic Energy Act as a result of India's decision to detonate \na nuclear weapon in 1974--with United States-supplied technology, I \nwould point out.\n  Let me be clear: I do believe it is time that we as a nation did more \nto reach out to India in areas such as energy and high technology. The \nPresident deserves credit for recognizing that the India of the 1960s \nand 1970s is not the India of today. India is a great leader in \ntechnology and needs to be an ally of our country on a great many \nissues, but I cannot support the proposed agreement before us today in \nthe form we are being presented.\n  By modifying our nonproliferation laws for India, and just for India, \nand in a circumstance where India has not signed the nonproliferation \ntreaty, not only are we sending the wrong signal to Iran, which is a \nsignatory and desires to have its own nuclear program, but we are also \nsending the wrong signal to North Korea, to Pakistan, and to Israel. \nThose three countries are not signatories to the nonproliferation \ntreaty, and they have detonated nuclear weapons. So approval of the \nagreement as it is now presented makes it difficult for us to justify \nour nonproliferation policies to the world at large, and in particular \nit makes it very difficult for us to justify them to other \nnonproliferation treaty signatories, such as South Africa, Brazil, and \nTaiwan, which have foresworn their nuclear weapons program as part of \nsigning up for the nonproliferation treaty.\n  The net result of approving the agreement as proposed today is that \nwe are making India a de facto weapon state without them having to sign \nthe nonproliferation treaty. India gets to have their cake and to eat \nit too. They obtain nuclear weapon state status but, by not signing the \nNPT, they do not have to adhere to its fundamental article VI \nrequirement that nuclear weapon states shall ``pursue negotiations in \ngood faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear \narms race.''\n  The amendment Senator Dorgan and I are offering seeks to make several \nimprovements to the underlying bill that relate to the question of what \nhappens if India again decides to detonate a nuclear weapon. The first \nsection, developed by Senator Dorgan, states simply that the United \nStates will not conduct trade in nuclear technology with India if they \ndetonate a nuclear weapon. That is sensible policy. It is consistent \nwith the Atomic Energy Act, which cuts off trade in nuclear technology \nif states such as India detonate a nuclear device.\n  The second part of the amendment, which I have added to the combined \namendment, requires the President to certify to Congress that the \nUnited States-supplied technology is not what has enabled India to go \nforward with detonation of a nuclear weapon.\n  Let me explain why this is important. India detonated five nuclear \nweapons in 1998 without the aid of advanced technology supplied by \nother nations. The reason is because the 45-nation group that is called \nthe Nuclear Suppliers Group, or NSG, developed a consensus that they \nwould not ship to India sensitive nuclear technology. As a result of \nthe bill we passed 2 years ago, this Nuclear Suppliers Group has now \napproved the export of sensitive nuclear technology to India. It is \nentirely conceivable that India may want to improve their nuclear \nweapons now that they have access to advanced technology from this \nNuclear Suppliers Group.\n  The certification we provide for in this amendment would force the \nPresident to ensure ahead of time that appropriate export controls are \nin place to begin with. It is one of the strictest conditions Congress \ncan place on a President, but it can be met. We routinely require end-\nuse monitoring of sensitive technologies that we export to other \ncountries. Embassy personnel inspect their purported destination to \nmake sure they are not used for illicit purposes. Certification, as we \nprovide for in this amendment, also places pressure on the President to \nwork with the IAEA to ensure that the safeguards applied to Indian \nfacilities are effective so the exported technology does not make its \nway into their weapons program. It seems to me that the President \nshould place this level of scrutiny on our nuclear exports to India.\n  Let me put up a chart to make the point I am trying to make with this \npart of the amendment. This chart tries to make the distinction \nbetween--that is reflected in the underlying agreement we are going to \nbe voting on--between the parts of India's nuclear program that are \nsafeguarded--and that is, to be specific, 14 nuclear reactors and 1 \nfuel reprocessing plant--and then the parts of India's nuclear program \nthat are not subject to any safeguards--and that is substantially more. \nThat is eight power reactors, a fast breeder program, and its entire \nmilitary program, which consists of two plutonium reprocessing plants, \ntwo uranium enrichment plants, and two heavy water plutonium production \nreactors.\n  The underlying agreement we are voting on contemplates that all the \nnonsafeguarded parts of the nuclear weapons program in India will be \nsupplied only with domestically produced fuel. The safeguarded parts \nare the parts that can be supplied with imported uranium fuel. So the \ntheory is we can take great consolation in knowing that nothing we are \nsending to India is, in fact, affecting the nonsafeguarded part of \ntheir nuclear program.\n  Now, around here, I don't know if you would call this a Chinese \nfirewall or what you would call it--this yellow line that separates the \nsafeguarded from the nonsafeguarded parts of the nuclear weapons \nprogram--but the truth is, under this agreement and the way it now \nstands, it is virtually impossible for us to be assured, in any \ncredible way, that what is being provided in the way of technologies or \nfuel to India for its nuclear program is, in fact, being kept just for \nthe safeguarded part.\n  Obviously, the other point is, as to the fuel, it is all fungible. \nIf, in fact, we are providing imported uranium fuel that can be used \nfor safeguarded reactors, there is no reason why the domestically \nproduced fuel can't be used for the nonsafeguarded reactors.\n  It is, in my view, vitally important that we try to make some \namendment to ensure that there is some degree of scrutiny over what is, \nin fact, occurring there, and that is the second part of the amendment \nI referred to--the net result of improving this. By modifying our \nnonproliferation laws for India, which has not signed the \nnonproliferation treaty, it is clear we are making an exception that \nwill cause great difficulty in our ability to encourage other countries \nto comply with the nonproliferation treaty.\n  The third part of the amendment we are offering requires that if \nIndia tests a nuclear weapon, we will not enable other countries to \nfurther India's nuclear program. This is called the third-party \nproblem; whereby, we enable other countries to help India's nuclear \nprogram. If India detonates a nuclear weapon, the President, under our \namendment, would have to recommend to Congress what export control \nauthorities can be used so our exports to other nuclear suppliers do \nnot end up helping India's program. The President, of course, would \nhave a wide array of such authorities to apply--from end-use monitoring \nof the technologies that were supplied to outright prohibition on \nproviding any of these technologies.\n  The United States and India, obviously, have deep and important ties. \nMany of our leading citizens have ancestry in India. Many of our \nleading citizens in our high-tech community were originally born in \nIndia. They have greatly contributed to the strength of our Nation. We \nowe them a great debt of gratitude, and we honor them as we raise \nquestions about this agreement.\n  We need to draw a line in the sand in certain areas. The area of \nnonproliferation, and the nonproliferation treaty in particular, is one \nsuch area where we do need to maintain black and white distinctions, \ngiven the terrible consequence we face if a nuclear detonation were to \noccur, either on our soil or on the soil of any other nation.\n  The amendment Senator Dorgan and I are offering that will be voted on \nthis evening places clear and unambiguous requirements on the \nPresident, should India detonate another nuclear weapon. I think that \nis the least we should\n\n[[Page S10201]]\n\ndo in our consideration of this very important agreement. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to call up his \namendment?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5683\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do call up amendment No. 5683.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself and \n     Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Feingold, and Mrs. \n     Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 5683.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit nuclear trade with India in the event that India \n    detonates a nuclear weapon and to impose certain certification, \n                  reporting, and control requirements)\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 106. PROHIBITION OF NUCLEAR TRADE IN EVENT OF NUCLEAR \n                   WEAPON DETONATION BY INDIA.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the United \n     States may not export, transfer, or retransfer any nuclear \n     technology, material, equipment, or facility under the \n     Agreement if the Government of India detonates a nuclear \n     explosive device after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 107. CERTIFICATION, REPORTING, AND CONTROL REQUIREMENTS \n                   IN EVENT OF NUCLEAR WEAPON DETONATION BY INDIA.\n\n       In the event the Government of India detonates a nuclear \n     weapon after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     President shall--\n       (1) certify to Congress that no United States technology, \n     material, equipment, or facility supplied to India under the \n     Agreement assisted with such detonation;\n       (2) not later than 60 days after such detonation, submit to \n     Congress a report describing United States nuclear related \n     export controls that could be utilized with respect to \n     countries that continue nuclear trade with India to minimize \n     any potential contribution by United States exports to the \n     nuclear weapons program of the Government of India; and\n       (3) fully utilize such export controls unless, not later \n     than 120 days after such detonation, Congress adopts, and \n     there is enacted, a joint resolution disapproving of the full \n     utilization of such export controls.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. First, let me thank my two colleagues from North Dakota and \nNew Mexico for combining their amendments in a way that I think makes \nsense. My colleague can correct me if I am wrong, the House was similar \nto both. There were somewhat different approaches, but I think they \noffer some clarity as to their concerns which, let me say at the \noutset, these are concerns I believe all of us share. There is not a \nsingle one of us, that I am aware of, in this body who doesn't have the \nsame worries and concerns that my colleague from North Dakota \nexpressed, as well as my friend and colleague from New Mexico. I will \nnot debate the number, whether it was 25,000 or 30,000 or 20,000--\nclearly, the problem with having a proliferation of nuclear devices \naround is a concern to all of us. Obviously, each and every one of us \nbears a responsibility to do everything we can to minimize the threat \nsuch weapons pose.\n  I don't know anyone more vigilant in that effort than my colleague \nfrom Indiana, along with my former colleague, Senator Nunn. The Nunn-\nLugar proposals, which regrettably were not pursued as aggressively as \nI think they should have been by the Bush administration, were to \nconvince the former Soviet Union and other nations to dismantle weapons \nof mass destruction and nuclear weapons in particular. That exists, and \nthere are those of us who would like to see it pursued more \naggressively. There are countless examples over the years of Members \nwho have sought various means by which we could reduce the threat. I \nwould argue, and I will, that this bill is very much in that tradition. \nThis is not a deviation from that effort. It is very much in that same \ntradition others have pursued, to create and formulate the means by \nwhich we can reduce those threats.\n  This bill is comprehensive in many ways. It is certainly not perfect \nby anyone's stretch of imagination. Contrary to the suggestion that \nthere has been one hearing on this, as if somehow this has been thrown \ntogether in the last couple weeks, there have been five major hearings \nwith multiple panels conducted by Senators Biden and Lugar. The other \nbody has conducted at least that many hearings. It all began about 4 \nyears ago, this process, not something just a week or two ago that has \nled to this.\n  You heard Senator Lugar say that he alone submitted 174 questions to \nthe State Department and other agencies, demanding their responses to \nthose questions and publicized them on his Web site. So the very \nquestions many of us have, have been addressed, maybe not to the \nsatisfaction of everyone but certainly pursuing the very issues.\n  The reason I mentioned that is if, in fact, this amendment were \nadopted, of course, there would be no means by which you could resolve \nthese matters with the other body. They have already adopted a bill \nwithout this language in it. Therefore, this would presumably pass \nwithout consideration. The fact is, that come next year the \nadministration--because the time runs out on this--would be submitting \nthe agreement without any of the agreements we have included in this \nbill, many of which do exactly what my colleagues from New Mexico and \nNorth Dakota are seeking to achieve. So the irony of ironies would be \nthat while I respect immensely their intent, what they seek, in fact, \nit would be counterproductive of the very goal they are trying to \nachieve and that is to strip away everything we have achieved under the \nleadership of Senators Lugar and Biden, along with Howard Berman's \nleadership in the other body, to include the kind of understandings and \nrequirements this bill mandated.\n  Is this a perfect bill? Absolutely not. But if we allow the perfect \nto become the enemy of the good, we are going to find ourselves, I \nthink, in a far more serious situation than the one Senator Dorgan and \nSenator Bingaman has described to you.\n  I would never make the argument to my colleagues that if you adopt \nthis amendment--I don't say hate; my wife advises that I don't use the \nword ``hate'' in front of the children--I deplore arguments that \nsuggest that if you adopt this, it is a killer amendment, and we would \nhave to go back and do further work. I think that is an insulting \nargument. In fact, if an amendment is a good amendment and ought to be \nadopted, we ought not to shy away from our responsibility. As a matter \nof fact, I will argue, the amendment is unnecessary; existing law does \nexactly what my colleagues are asking us to do today. But if we adopt \nthem, we run the risk of something coming back a lot worse than what \nSenator Biden, Senator Lugar, the Foreign Relations Committee, over \nextensive hearings, along with the work of the other body, have \naccomplished and achieved. As my colleagues listen to this debate, I \nhope they will take that under consideration.\n  I point out, the United States-India agreement will be resubmitted in \nJanuary if it is not approved now. The next President would not have to \nseek any special law, which is what we have, to speed up the process. \nRather, he could wait us out until the Atomic Energy Act forces us to \ntake a vote on a clean resolution of approval of the agreement, without \nany of the amendments we have adopted and worked on over the years.\n  Let me mention an argument Senator Lugar raised; I didn't. I regret \nnot having mentioned it because I think it is a compelling argument as \nwell. One of the arguments people need to understand is India does not \nhave an unlimited supply of materials by which to create nuclear \nweapons. They will be faced, without outside sources of supply, to make \na choice between nuclear weapons or the commercial powerplants.\n  I do not intend to speak as a great expert on Indian politics or the \npublic mood in India, but nations, particularly ones that live in the \nneighborhood--I don't have the map up here any longer--where India \nresides, what choice would they make if they could only make one? Is it \ngoing to be energy or security? That is a difficult choice. While all \nof us want to see the energy choices made, a nation surrounded by \nnations that have nuclear capabilities, not exactly close to the \ndemocracy India is, by the way, may very well decide to have different \nalternatives. If\n\n[[Page S10202]]\n\nyou are sitting in India's Parliament, you are a member of their \nCongress and you have one choice to make, security or energy, security \nor energy--how would we vote? How would we vote confronted by that \nchoice?\n  That is a choice with which India may well be confronted without \nadditional sources of energy here or supplies that would allow them to \npromote the more commercial use of this power.\n  I don't necessarily want to put India in that position to make that \nchoice because I think I know what choice they would make. I suspect it \nis the same choice we would make. We bear an obligation to the people \nof this country to keep them secure. I suspect the Indian \nparliamentarians feel likewise. When confronted by that choice, my view \nis they would choose to make security the choice, the very thing my \ncolleagues argued against would, in fact, be driving them to that \nconclusion.\n  Obviously, the energy debate is a critical one. Again, no one has \nbeen more of an advocate of green technologies than our colleague from \nNew Mexico, one of the stalwarts in this debate for many years--not \njust recently, where it has become popular to argue for alternative \nenergy resources. But if we take away this alternative, India is \ngrowing--1.3 billion people. It has 300 million people living at \nmiddle-class or upper middle-class standards. They have a billion \npeople living in abject poverty in India. They are seeking ways, of \ncourse, to bring many of those people out of poverty and improve the \nquality of their lives.\n  India understands that coal-fired electrical power plants are a \nliability, but India cannot afford to slow the growth of energy \nproduction at the same time its population is growing and trying to \ndeal with the economic circumstances of its people.\n\n  India says we would like to build more commercial powerplants. It \nseems to me, for those of us who want to reduce the carbon footprint, \nthe carbon emitters with India being a major supplier of carbon \nemissions it is in our interests to encourage them to move in a \ndifferent direction. If we do not have some sort of arrangement or \nunderstanding on how to achieve that while simultaneously moving them \naway from that choice I mentioned a moment ago, we end up potentially \nwhere they have more weapons, doing little or nothing about energy \nproduction. It is a lose-lose proposition. We end up with India with \nnuclear weapons, and we end up with a nation that continues to use \ncoal-fired plants, of course, endangering us further when it comes to \nthe issue of global warming and the like. That is a further reason, I \nwould argue, we ought seriously to understand the import of these \namendments and appreciate the alternative presented by the bill before \nus.\n  I mentioned earlier, in fact, the very concerns raised by my two \ncolleagues are covered by existing law. It is not as if there is some \nvacuum that exists, that there would be no repercussions should India \ndecide to pursue and test nuclear weapons. Let me share with my \ncolleagues. Again, I invite Members or their staffs to come over and be \nbriefed by staff who spent literally their adult lives, their \nprofessional careers working on these bills. The suggestion that this \nwas thrown together somehow in a quick hearing before the Foreign \nRelations Committee in a sense fails to understand the work done by our \ncollective staffs on these matters going back years. In fact, previous \nMembers of this body--no one cared more about this issue than John \nGlenn of Ohio. He was an advocate on this issue long before many were. \nI am going to share in a minute some of the law that bears his name and \nis still the law of the land when it comes to these issues, the Glenn \namendment, and how we deal with the issue of countries that would, in a \nsense, go into the use of nuclear weapons.\n  This amendment would bar any and all nuclear exports for all time, \nwithout any exception or waiver, if India detonates a nuclear device.\n  Section 106 sets a different standard for India than we have for any \nother nonnuclear weapons state, which is what it is under the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty and U.S. law. There is no need, I think. I \nthink it would be very harmful to single India out in such a manner. \nThere are other nations in a similar situation. I don't hear amendments \nbeing offered to suggest they all ought to be treated the same way. I \nsuspect you would run into a buzzsaw if you did so. We are picking out \nthe one great democracy in south Asia, with whom we have had a very \ntesty relationship for 35 years, which is critical for dealing with the \nfragile issues that section of the world poses, and we are going to \nsay: They and no one else gets that kind of treatment.\n  You can imagine the reaction we might get from a nation that is now \nreaching out to us for the first time in approaching half a century to \nget us back on a far different track than the one we are on.\n  India would clearly see this provision as an effort to put in place \nspecial penalties against that nation, if it were ever to respond.\n  Frankly, the proposed new section, as I said earlier, is a section I \nthink poses some serious issues. I have commented before, I have put \nthe language in of the administration. I think everyone mentioned \nearlier, and I will quote from the Secretary of State, she said:\n\n  We have been very clear with the Indians. Should India test, as it \nhas agreed not to do so, or should India in any way violate the IAEA \nsafeguards agreements to which it would be adhering, the deal from our \npoint of view would be at that point off.\n\n  Under Secretary of State Bill Burns, before our committee, repeated \nthat quote to us.\n  What is more, as I said, the amendment is unnecessary. Several \nprovisions of existing law already apply to India.\n  The Glenn amendment sanctions under the Arms Export Control Act cut \noff a wide array of foreign aid, defense exports, bank credits and \ndual-use items.\n  There is no waiver. No waiver under the Glenn amendment. That was \nmodified some years later, but there would be no waiver. The Glenn \namendment is tougher in many ways than what we talking about here, we \ncan argue, in that it doesn't provide any kind of relief. Congress \nenacted a waiver in 1999, somewhat of a waiver, after India and \nPakistan tested in the 1990s, but that waiver authority terminates for \neither country that tests again. So under the modified Glenn amendment, \nthere is no waiver authority. Under Glenn, the role of the United \nStates and our relationship with India is clear.\n  Section 129 of the Atomic Energy Act already prohibits exports to a \nnonnuclear weapon State if it detonates a nuclear device. That one is \nsubject to waiver by the President. India is still a nonnuclear weapon \nstate by definition, and therefore would be included under this. That \nlaw is on the books, very similar to what is being advocated in the \namendment posed by our two colleagues. The President could only use the \nwaiver under section 129, I would add, if he finds that ceasing exports \nwould be ``seriously prejudicial'' to the achievement of the U.S. \nnonproliferation objectives or would otherwise ``jeopardize the common \ndefense and security of the country.'' That is a high standard, I might \nadd, for the waiver authority.\n  Even if the President makes that determination, cooperation cannot \nproceed until 60 days of continuous session has passed after that \ndetermination has been submitted to Congress, further making that \nprovision almost impossible to apply that waiver standard.\n\n  So there are two sections, one under the Atomic Energy Act, one under \nthe Glenn amendment, that virtually do what our two colleagues talk \nabout with their amendment. The bill before us would amend the Atomic \nEnergy Act to ensure, by the way, that the Senate can take advantage of \nexpedited procedures--limits on debate and amendment--to pass a joint \nresolution to overturn such a Presidential waiver.\n  Even if you got to that point, we have now put a further safeguard in \nagainst it, making it virtually impossible to waive the authority under \nsection 129 of the Atomic Energy Act.\n  So the bill already improves the law relating to what could happen \nwith a so-called nonnuclear weapons state. We are using the language \nhere, but this applies to states that we all, to be honest, know have \nnuclear weapons. There are several nations we all know about in that \ncategory, but they are called nonnuclear weapons states. And yet, here \nthe language is very strong.\n  Again, I think these sections are important to note. The combination \nof\n\n[[Page S10203]]\n\nthe two amendments does cover the ground on all of this. I point out \nthat Senator Bingaman's part of this amendment, this new section 107, \nis not necessary either.\n  U.S. obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty already \ncompel the United States to assure that its nuclear exports do not help \nnonnuclear weapons states to produce weapons. That obligation bars \nhelping not only India but any nonnuclear weapons state. The Atomic \nEnergy Act and the Hyde Act already provide tools to address the \nconcern Senator Bingaman has raised.\n  Let's look at the specific provision, if you will, under the proposed \nsection 107. It would require a certification in the event of a nuclear \ndetonation by India that no United States material, equipment, or \ntechnology contributed to the detonation.\n  And what happens if the President makes that certification? The \namendment does not say what happens. What happens if the President does \nnot make the certification, or says it does not know whether any U.S. \nmaterial, equipment, or technology was involved? This is a \ncertification that may well be impossible to make under the law as \ndrafted in this amendment.\n  So even with the intent to do something about it, how can you make \nit? How are you going to determine whether, in fact, materials have \nbeen used, or is it just the assumption that if one occurred, it would \nbe, which may be an entirely false assumption when it comes to that \ncountry? How will we ever know for sure that no U.S. technology was \ndiverted?\n  In any case, it is the certification that carries no consequences. \nThe certification is not needed. Again section 104 of the Hyde act \nalready requires the President to keep Congress fully and currently \ninformed of any violation by India of its nonproliferation commitments \nand of this agreement.\n  Any contributions by U.S. exports to an India weapons program under \nthe United States-India agreement would certainly be a violation of \nIndia's commitments and of the agreement, and so would need to be \nreported to us, and would very likely be reported to us long before any \ndetonation, I might add.\n  Section 2 of the proposed act requires a report from the President \nafter an Indian test describing those United States export controls \nthat could be used to minimize any potential contribution that United \nStates nuclear exports to third countries might make to an Indian \nnuclear weapons program.\n  The Hyde act and the Atomic Energy Act already address this issue. \nAnd let me quote to my colleagues again. I apologize for citing in \ndetail these things, but you need to know this, because statements \nbeing made here on the floor about this, I say respectfully, are not \naccurate, about what existing laws require and mandate and demand in \nthese areas.\n  Section 104(d)(5) of the Hyde act requires the President of the \nUnited States:\n\n     shall ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to \n     maintain accountability with respect to nuclear materials, \n     equipment and technology . . . reexported to India so as to \n     ensure . . . United States' compliance with [obligations \n     under] article I of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\n  Section 104(g)(2) of the Hyde Act explicitly requires detailed \nreporting on any United States authorizations for the reexport to India \nof nuclear materials and equipment.\n  The Atomic Energy Act further requires that the United States not \nengage in civil nuclear cooperation with any country without an \nagreement for nuclear cooperation and that every such agreement must \ncontain a guarantee by the other country that it will not transfer any \nnuclear material or facility to a third country without the prior \napproval of the United States.\n  Section 127 of that act makes it explicit that for any U.S. export of \nsource or special nuclear material, nuclear facilities, or sensitive \nnuclear technology, that material, facility, or technology may not be \nretransferred to a third party without the United States's prior \nconsent. The transfer cannot go forward unless the third party agrees \nto abide by all of the agreements of section 127.\n  That section also requires that the source and special nuclear \nmaterial, nuclear facilities, and sensitive nuclear technology being \nexported must be under IAEA safeguards, and may not be used in or for \nresearch and development on a nuclear explosive device.\n  This assures us that any such report does not contribute to India's \nweapons program. The truth is that if India were to conduct another \nnuclear test or reexport by third countries, United States-origin \nnuclear material, equipment, or technology would be the least likely \nway for India to evade a cut-off of cooperation.\n  If any third country were to provide United States-origin nuclear \nmaterial, or equipment, or material device from the United States-\norigin material or equipment for India without the United States's \nconsent, the United States would have the right to cease nuclear \ncooperation with that country and to demand the return of material and/\nor equipment that has been provided under that country's nuclear \ncooperation agreement with the United States.\n  So third countries are highly unlikely, given the implications under \nthe existing law, to reexport without our permission, or run the risk, \nobviously, of facing all of the admonitions that the previously \nexisting law requires. A much more serious concern would be the risk \nthat other countries would export their own nuclear material or \nequipment, not our material but their own nuclear equipment and \nmaterial technology, to India after we had cut off exports. That \nconcern is not addressed at all by the Dorgan and Bingaman amendment. \nBut the bill before us does address that concern. Their amendment \nleaves that out entirely, which is actually a far more dangerous way \nthat this may happen.\n  So under the bill before us, by reiterating a provision under the \nHyde Act that if India should test again:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to seek to prevent a \n     transfer to India of nuclear equipment, of materials or \n     technology from other participating governments in the \n     Nuclear Suppliers Group or from any other source.\n\n  This bill already lays down a marker regarding the real concern if \nIndia were to test. Again, whether it is reexport or direct shipments, \nwe are in a position, I think, to respond aggressively. I point out, \nyou defeat this bill, we are back to the agreement and a lot of this, \nother than what I have mentioned in existing law, does not apply.\n  So, again, I say to my friends and colleagues who offered the \namendment, this is not a debate about whether some people care about \nnuclear weapons and others do not. The question is, are we being smart \nand intelligent about moving a major democracy that lives in a \ndangerous part of the world into a direction that will make it far more \ncooperative with us in doing exactly what the underlying amendment \nseeks to do, that is, to move away from weapons to commercial use, to \ndealing with the carbon emissions that are occurring here, to provide \nthat kind of new relationship with India that I think is absolutely \ncritical for our safety and security in the 21st century.\n  Walk away from this, drive a wedge between India and the United \nStates in that part of the world, then I think you are going to have \nexactly the kind of problem our two colleagues have suggested. It gets \ncloser to what they fear most. I believe what we have offered our \ncolleagues today drives us further away from that outcome, which is \nwhat all of us ought to be trying to achieve. That is the reason I \nreject these amendments, and urge my colleagues to do so when they \noccur on a vote later today. I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague Senator \nDodd in rising in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senators \nfrom North Dakota and New Mexico.\n  I believe the bill before us today and the Hyde act passed by \nCongress in 2006 addressed the possibility of a future Indian nuclear \ntest in a very clear and definitive way. I am confident the Congress \nhas provided the necessary assurances and authorities to protect United \nStates interests and promote strong nonproliferation policies in the \nevent of an Indian nuclear detonation.\n  The amendment seeks to address a concern that the Foreign Relations \nCommittee addressed in 2006, and last month when we voted 19 to 2 to \nreport the legislation pending before the Senate. Both bills ensure \nthat there is no\n\n[[Page S10204]]\n\nambiguity about the United States's legal and policy responses to a \nfuture Indian nuclear test.\n  If India tests a nuclear weapon, the 123 Agreement is over. This \nmeans the President could terminate all United States nuclear \ncooperation with India and fully and immediately use the United \nStates's rights to demand the return of all items previously exported \nto India. This would include any special nuclear material produced by \nIndia, through the use of any nuclear materials and equipment or \nsensitive nuclear technology exported or reexported to India by the \nUnited States. These steps can occur as a response to any nuclear test, \nincluding instances in which India describes its actions as being ``for \npeaceful purposes.''\n  In addition, the United States could suspend and revoke any current \nor pending licenses. One of the primary purposes of this agreement is \nto deter India from testing nuclear weapons. New Delhi has more to gain \nfrom peaceful nuclear cooperation through this agreement than in \ntesting.\n  The Hyde act and the bill before us were crafted to ensure that this \nis the case. Indian leaders argue that they retain the right to test. \nThis is true. They are a sovereign nation. However, India has been \nwarned repeatedly that consequences of another nuclear test would be \ndire.\n  In 2006, Secretary Rice stated in testimony that:\n\n       We have been very clear with the Indians. Should India \n     test, as it has agreed not to do, or should India in any way \n     violate the IAEA safeguards agreements to which it would be \n     adhering, the deal from our point of view would at that point \n     be off.\n\n  In a question for the record, I asked Secretary Rice at that time \nwhat the consequences of an Indian test would be. And she noted that \nunder existing law:\n\n       No nuclear materials and equipment or sensitive nuclear \n     technologies shall be exported to any nonnuclear weapons \n     state that is found by the President to have detonated a \n     nuclear explosive device.\n\n  Now, under United States law, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty, India is a nonnuclear weapons state. In 2006 the Hyde act \nwaived the application of the sanctions in the Atomic Energy Act to \nevents that occurred before July 2005 when President Bush and Prime \nMinster Singh signed the joint statement. This waiver was intended to \ncapture India's nuclear tests of 1974 and 1998, and permit U.S.-Indian \ncooperation in spite of those actions.\n  This does not apply to future Indian actions. So if India were to \ntest tomorrow, the waiver provided by Congress in 2006 would not apply, \nand nuclear cooperation could be terminated. Let me repeat that. Under \na law passed 2 years ago setting the parameters for congressional \nconsideration of this agreement, if India were to test a nuclear \nweapon, terminate, or abrogate IAEA safeguards, materially violate IAEA \nsafeguards, violate an agreement for cooperation with the United \nStates, encourage another nonnuclear weapons state to engage in \nproliferation activities, or engage in unauthorized proliferation of \nsensitive nuclear technology, the agreement and United States \ncooperation could be terminated.\n  If that is not enough to satisfy the Senators' concerns, I would \ndirect them to article 14 of the agreement:\n\n       Should India detonate a nuclear explosive device, the \n     United States has the right to cease all nuclear cooperation \n     with India immediately, including the supply of fuel as well \n     as the request for the return of any items transferred from \n     the United States, including fresh nuclear fuel.\n\n  Under Secretary Rood stated in testimony before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee on September 18, 2008 that:\n\n       Just as India has maintained its sovereign right to conduct \n     a test, so too have we maintained our right to take action in \n     response.\n\n  Under article 14, the United States can also demand the return of any \nnuclear materials and equipment transferred pursuant to the agreement \nfor cooperation as well as any special nuclear material produced in \nIndia, if it detonates a nuclear explosive device. This was confirmed \nin response to a question posed by the House of Representatives. The \nadministration answered that even ``the fuel supply assurances \n[contained in the 123 agreement] are not . . . meant to insulate India \nagainst the consequences of a nuclear explosive test or a violation of \nnonproliferation commitments.\n  The United States would be able to exercise its right under article \n14 of the agreement to require the return of materials and equipment \nsubject to the agreement after, one, giving written notice to India \nthat the agreement is terminated and, two, ceasing all cooperation \nbased on a determination that a mutually acceptable resolution of \noutstanding issues has been impossible or cannot be achieved through \nconsultation.\n  Both of these actions are within the discretion of the U.S. \nGovernment and do not require Indian agreement, and both can be taken \nat once.\n  In sum, the United States-India peaceful nuclear cooperation \nagreement ceases if India tests. This conclusion is consistent with any \nreasonable interpretation of the Atomic Energy Act, the Hyde Act, and \narticle 14 of this agreement. As a result, this amendment is \nunnecessary. The issues it seeks to address have been remedied. I urge \ncolleagues to vote against the amendment. The real effect of adoption \nof this amendment would be to, once again, delay consideration and \napproval of this important agreement. It is time to move forward and to \nvote on this legislation and start peaceful nuclear cooperation between \nthe world's two largest democracies.\n  The second portion of the amendment we are considering now requires a \ncertification and a report that are at best duplicative of provisions \nalready in law. This amendment would simply delay implementation of the \nU.S.-India 123 agreement in order to effect requirements that have \nalready been enacted. First, the amendment requires the President to \ncertify to Congress that no technology, material, or equipment, nor any \nfacility supplied by the United States to India under the 123 agreement \nassisted with a nuclear detonation, if one occurs in India. In my \nopinion, this provision is duplicative of section 104(g) of the Hyde \nAct passed by Congress in 2006. Under that existing law, the President \nis already required to report annually on whether U.S. civil nuclear \ncooperation with India is in any way assisting India's nuclear weapons \nprogram. This report is to include information on whether any U.S. \ntechnology has been used by India for any activity related to the \nresearch, testing, or manufacture of nuclear explosive devices. It is \nunclear what additional information is required by the Senator's \namendment than is available each year now to Congress under the Hyde \nAct.\n  Second, the amendment requires a report on any export controls that \ncould be used by the United States if India detonated a nuclear \nexplosive. The purpose of the export controls would be to ensure that \nno U.S. materials, equipment, or technology that may be in countries \nother than India could be reexported by those nations to India so as to \nminimize all trade with India and ensure that no U.S. technology or \nexports contributed to their nuclear weapons program.\n  Again, this provision is repetitive. In 2006, Congress endorsed \nsection 105 of the Hyde Act that created a Nuclear Export \nAccountability Program for all U.S. exports to India. The purpose of \nsection 105 was to ensure that our country was taking all appropriate \nmeasures to maintain accountability of all nuclear materials, \nequipment, and technology sold, leased, exported, or reexported to \nIndia to ensure full implementation of the IAEA safeguards in India and \nU.S. compliance with article I of the NPT. The program created by the \nHyde Act is a highly detailed accounting system focused on ensuring \nthat India is complying with the relevant requirements, terms, and \nconditions of any licenses issued by the United States regarding \nexports to India. This program represents the most comprehensive and \ndetailed system of accounting ever imposed. I believe it provides \nsubstantially the same information that is required in the Senator's \namendment, without the need for a new law.\n  The Hyde Act also addressed the concern that other nations might \ncontinue to supply India with any technology or fuel in the event of a \ncutoff by the United States. Section 103 of the Hyde Act makes it the \npolicy of the United States to strengthen the guidelines and decisions \nof the Nuclear Suppliers Group to move other nations toward \n``instituting the practice of a timely\n\n[[Page S10205]]\n\nand coordinated response by [Nuclear Suppliers Group] members to all \nsuch violations, including termination of nuclear transfers to an \ninvolved recipient'' and discourage ``individual NSG members from \ncontinuing cooperation with such recipient until such time as a \nconsensus regarding a coordinated response has been achieved.''\n  The conference report on the Hyde Act clearly states the definitive \ninterpretation of that provision. It reads:\n\n       The conferees intend that the United States seek agreement \n     among [Nuclear Suppliers Group] members that violations by \n     one country of an agreement with any NSG member should result \n     in joint action by all members, including, as appropriate, \n     the termination of nuclear exports. In addition, the \n     conferees intend that the Administration work with individual \n     states to encourage them to refrain from sensitive exports.\n\n  Section 103 of the Hyde Act also made it U.S. policy to seek to \nprevent the transfers of nuclear equipment, material, or technology \nfrom NSG participating governments to those countries with whom nuclear \ncommerce has been suspended or terminated pursuant to the Hyde Act, the \nAtomic Energy Act, or any other U.S. law.\n  In other words, if U.S. exports to a country were to be suspended or \nterminated pursuant to U.S. law, it would be U.S. policy to seek to \nprevent the transfer of nuclear equipment, material, or technology from \nother sources, including from other countries with which the United \nStates has substantial nuclear trade.\n  In sum, the amendment is duplicative. The issues raised here have \nbeen thoroughly dealt with under the Hyde Act of 2006, and the \nlegislation currently before us. As a result, the impact of this \namendment would simply be to delay congressional approval of this \nimportant agreement by sending it back to the House of Representatives. \nI do not believe such a course serves the U.S. security interests, and \nI urge defeat of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                            Financial Rescue\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am in strong agreement with the bipartisan \nleadership of the Foreign Relations Committee. I will address those \nissues shortly. But, first, since we have a rather full legislative \ncalendar this evening, I will touch briefly on the financial system \nrescue, a rescue of a locked-up credit system which is having its \nimpact on Main Street, where I live in the hearthand, and in every \ncommunity in the Nation where credit is locked up.\n  Today I was advised that the State of Missouri cannot issue bonds to \nbuild highways. The State of Maine is also having trouble. Local \ngovernments can't get loans. There is no money available in the credit \nmarkets for municipal bonds at reasonable rates. There is a threat that \nworkers will not get their paychecks if businesses or payroll companies \ncannot get the loans they need. Families will not be able to get loans \nfor college education, to buy a car, to buy a home. Farmers will not be \nable to get operating loans they must have in Missouri to begin their \nnormal agricultural operations.\n  When I came to the floor a week ago yesterday, I said we must pass \nsomething. At that time I said the Treasury's proposal lacks \naccountability, taxpayer protection, and transparency. Thanks to the \ngood work of our negotiators--and I commend the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, Senator Gregg from our side, and the House \nnegotiators for putting in those elements, as they are critical--the \ntaxpayers have a triple level of protection against losses. The CBO has \ncome out with a score saying it will be far less than the $700 billion. \nThere are some who think we might recoup all of it, but it is far \ncheaper than continuing the process we have right now where Federal tax \ndollars are being used to come to the rescue of failing savings and \nloans, investment banks, and we don't get any equity from those \nefforts. We don't have a means of recouping it. What is even more \nimportant, it does nothing to unlock the credit gridlock that threatens \nto bring this economy to a halt, with workers losing their jobs, small \nbusinesses unable to operate.\n\n  Yesterday, I strongly urged that we raise the Federal deposit \ninsurance limit from $100,000 so small businesses that have more than \n$100,000 don't have to continue taking their money out of the banks, \nleaving the banks less capital available to make loans, in order to get \nprotection of U.S. Treasury deposits. I heard the stories, and I talked \nwith a broker in Missouri yesterday who said: Small business clients \nare trying to move all their money out of banks above $100,000 and put \nit into Treasuries. Again, I am delighted that the leaders, our \nnegotiators, and the bipartisan leadership in both Houses agreed to \nextend the FDIC limit to $250,000. We will be looking at all of those \nthings, as well as general regulation of the financial markets when we \nreturn. I have lots of ideas. If anybody cares, I will be sharing them \nat the appropriate time.\n  I am also delighted that we are going to include the tax extenders, \ntax extenders that businesses need to continue to operate; tax \nextenders that, unfortunately, would only extend on a year-to-year \nbasis but are necessary for profitable operation so businesses can \ncontinue to hire and build the economy. Probably the greatest part of \nthat is delaying the burdensome and punitive alternative minimum tax \nthat is now threatening to hit many middle-income working Americans, \nunless we pass this bill. Another element, on which my colleague from \nIowa, Senator Harkin, has been a leader, is getting disaster relief. \nResidents in Missouri need it. Iowa needs it. Our neighbors in Illinois \nneed it. Many other places in the Nation need disaster relief. That is \nanother must-pass piece of legislation.\n  To return to the subject that the Senators from Connecticut and \nIndiana are addressing, we currently have before us a number of \nlegislative opportunities that, if we act and act properly, would send \na reinforcing signal to our allies and friends in the world that the \nUnited States values and appreciates their support and cooperation. We \nall know that anti-Americanism is growing throughout the world. It is \nmost evident in the socialist vitriol being spewed by Hugo Chavez in \nVenezuela, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Iran, and the widespread suspicion \nthroughout the Muslim world about America's intentions. In places such \nas Southeast Asia and south Asia, where we are competing for influence \nwith an emerging China, we must increase our engagement and strengthen \nour economic and strategic links with countries such as India, which I \nwill speak to in a minute.\n  Let's face it, we have a lot of work to do in rebuilding America's \nimage abroad and increasing security and stability throughout the \nworld. But we have a number of opportunities before us, opportunities \nwe must act upon. The way in which we get there is by engaging and \ndeploying our Nation's smart power. This consists of, but is not \nlimited to, public diplomacy efforts, educational exchanges, deployment \nof more Peace Corps volunteers and USAID foreign service officers, and \nsupporting free-trade agreements and increased economic engagement.\n  The first target of opportunity where America must act is Colombia. \nCongress must act on the Colombia FTA and renew the Andean Trade \nPreferences. Doing so would solidify our image as a nation committed to \nhelping a strategic ally in Latin America that is, in fact, standing \nshoulder to shoulder with us.\n  Colombia is a remarkable success in the fight against terrorism and \nnarcotrafficking that needs to be told. It is a country where its pro-\nAmerican leader, President Alvaro Uribe, has led a surge against \nnarcoterrorists militarily while simultaneously improving the overall \nsecurity, economy, and safety of the civilian population. They have \ndone so while ensuring that protection of human rights and adherence to \ninternational humanitarian law are fully integrated into their security \nforces.\n\n  In my visit there just over a month ago, I was greatly encouraged by \nthe tangible evidence I saw of a country in complete transformation. \nJust 6 years ago, in 2002, as much as 40 percent of Colombia was \ncontrolled by terrorist groups and ruthless narcotics-trafficking \ncartels. Many of my colleagues visited Colombia at that time and \nbrought back grim reports of a country slipping into a failed state.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an agreement to recess at 12:30.\n\n[[Page S10206]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Well, Mr. President, might I ask consent to conclude my \nremarks.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to the Senator, he can do that. I will propound a \nconsent request, Mr. President, that the Senator be allowed to conclude \nin 5 minutes. Is that appropriate?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. Five minutes; and my colleague would like 15 minutes. So I \nask, Mr. President, unanimous consent that the Senator from Missouri be \nallowed to proceed for 5 minutes and the Senator from Iowa for an \nadditional 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and thank my colleagues.\n  Since 1998, the United States has been supporting the \ncounternarcotics effort President Clinton initiated known as Plan \nColombia, and today our mutual objectives have evolved from a strict \ncounternarcotics focus to encompass counterterrorism activities as \nwell. Our investment has paid off.\n  With U.S. aid to Colombian security forces and assistance and trade \npreferences under the Andean trade preferences agreement, the Colombian \npeople have been positively transforming their nation. Others, however, \nunder the Andean trade preference agreement in Bolivia and Ecuador have \nproduced less encouraging results, even taking sides with aggressively \nhostile Hugo Chavez.\n  I believe we ought to have a debate about extending them the full \nbenefits of the Andean trade agreement. If I had the opportunity to \noffer an amendment, I would have limited the questionable Governments \nof Ecuador and Bolivia to 1 year while giving much longer protection to \nColombia.\n  The message is simple: reward our friends and allies in the world, \nnot those who wish us ill or support our enemies.\n  Colombia has been our friend and ally in an increasingly left-\nleaning, anti-American Latin America. We must take the opportunity to \nreward and thank them by passing the Colombia FTA.\n  This agreement also benefits America's economy by increasing exports \nand generating jobs. Upon entry into force of the agreement, over 80 \npercent of U.S. exports of agricultural, consumer, and industrial goods \nto Colombia would enter duty-free immediately.\n  The Colombian free-trade agreement will benefit America.\n  Another strategically important part of the world where the United \nStates has an opportunity to increase cooperation and deploy its smart \npower is in India.\n  India is a friendly democracy strategically sitting between the two \nplaces American strategists worry most about: China and the Middle \nEast.\n  We are natural allies as two of the world's largest democracies and \nwe should be much closer. And the feeling, by and large, is mutual \namong the people of India.\n  India has more Muslims--150 million or so--than any other country in \nthe world except Indonesia, which I have spoken extensively on this \nfloor about engaging more proactively. Positive engagement of American \nsmart power and increased economic opportunities will help prevent the \nlikelihood of al-Qaida or radicalization of this large Muslim \npopulation.\n  During my trip to India in March of 2006, the major item of interest \nto all of the Government and private-sector officials I met, from Prime \nMinster Singh to businessmen in New Dehli, was the support for the \ncivilian nuclear technology agreement which was signed as I was in the \nair. I was asked about it when I landed and could not answer. But I \nspent a day being fully briefed by our Embassy and intelligence \nofficials.\n  After extensive discussions with Indian and American officials, as \nwell as intelligence briefings, I reached the conclusion that this \nagreement is a very positive step for the United States and India.\n  It would aid in cementing a good working relationship with the \nworld's largest democracy in a strategic part of the world. I support \nthis agreement and agree with our bipartisan leadership that we must \ndefeat the amendments which would merely delay and possibly sidetrack \napproval.\n  India has three paramount challenges ahead that it must address: \nFirst, it must improve its infrastructure and roads. Second, it must \ndeal with the extreme poverty of its huge rural population. Thirty \npercent of its population live below the official poverty line. Third, \nIndia, just like the United States, must be able to meet the demand for \nincreases in energy.\n  A strong relationship between India and the U.S. is vital to ensuring \npeaceful development and continued prosperity in South and Southeast \nAsia.\n  Regional rivalries, particularly with China will continue to heat up \nin a race for energy to fuel both India's and China's rapidly expanding \neconomies and societies. An increase in nuclear power production in \nIndia through the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement would help to cool \nthese rivalries in their race for energy resources.\n  In a land where air quality is a major problem, despite recent \nimprovements, this agreement would allow India to meet its surging \nenergy requirements in an environmentally friendly manner.\n  Further, increasing the supply of energy in India, make no mistake \nabout it, also indirectly helps consumers at the pump here at home as \nwell.\n  In addition to nuclear power, during my visit I also encouraged the \ndevelopment of clean coal technology. With the fourth largest coal \nreserves in the world, India and the U.S. should work together to \ndevelop that source of energy as well.\n  Developing energy solutions together with India will increase our \nengagement and lead to other economic opportunities for Americans.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this agreement between the United \nStates and India without amendment.\n  It will safeguard Indian nuclear facilities and help meet the surging \ndemand for global energy supplies in this critical Nation.\n  And most importantly, it will solidify our relationship with a \nstrategically important country that for too long suffered under the \nburden of a Soviet-style economy. Now it is opening its market, shares \nour democratic values, and is on its way to becoming one of the world's \nthree largest economies.\n  I urge my colleagues to act on solidifying our partnership with two \ncritically important countries, Colombia and India.\n\n\n                           Tribute To Senator\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  Mr. President, I want to say that the passing of the mental health \nparity bill will be a great tribute to a wonderful friend, Pete \nDomenici, a true icon. He has been a longtime champion of this issue, \nand this will be a great testament to his leadership.\n  I worked with Pete on the Budget Committee. I say thanks, Pete, for \nmaking me take all the tough votes. It was ugly but necessary, just \nlike the financial rescue package.\n  He is most recognized for his work on energy. I am very proud to have \nsupported him in his efforts over many years to develop an abundant \nenergy resource, long before $4 gasoline brought the issue home to \nevery American.\n  Just as important to me, I will miss the great friendship of a \nwonderful man, Pete Domenici, and his magnificent wife Nancy.\n  Pete is known for his devotion to his friends and family--to his wife \nNancy of 50 years and their 8 children.\n  Pete is also known for his devotion and dedication to New Mexico.\n  Born and raised in New Mexico, Pete has served his State in the U.S. \nSenate now for 36 years--making him the most senior Senator New Mexico \nhas ever had.\n  Pete has also earned the title as the only Republican to ever be \nelected by New Mexico for a 6-year Senate term--in a State not known to \nlean Republican.\n  Pete's contributions to his State are well known to his constituents \nin New Mexico--whether it is fighting for solutions to the State's \nwater crisis, supporting New Mexico schools, or ensuring New Mexico \ngets their fair share of tax dollars.\n  Pete's contributions to our Nation are also well known. He \nunderstands the importance of keeping America as a leader in science \nand technology and has worked for improvements to the math and science \neducation our school children need to succeed.\n  Pete has also fought passionately for fiscal responsibility to ensure \ntax\n\n[[Page S10207]]\n\npayer dollars are spent wisely and curbing nuclear proliferation to \nkeep our communities safe.\n  In recent years, Pete has used his role as chairman or ranking member \nof the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to fight for our Nation's \nenergy security.\n  Pete worked across the aisle to pass the first comprehensive energy \nlegislation since 1992. Because of Pete and the bill he got through \nCongress, our Nation began investing in our own energy sources.This \nbill provided incentives to expand the production of energy from wind, \nsolar, geothermal and biomass sources to promote cleaner alternative \nsources of energy.\n  Pete also ensured that this bill promoted research and development of \nhydrogen and fuel-cell technology.\n  Pete didn't end the fight for our Nation's energy independence in \n2005 though.Since that time, he has been a leader in the Senate calling \nfor more action.\n  Before the gas price crisis that is now affecting families across the \ncountry, Pete sounded the alarm.He has called for bringing relief to \nfamilies struggling with pain at the pump by tapping our own domestic \nsupplies of gas and oil.\n  Pete has proposed the commonsense proposal--the Gas Price Reduction \nAct--to end our Nation's energy crisis.\n  It is this foresight, this leadership, and this passion to making our \nNation a better place and for making our communities better for our \nfamilies that will make Pete Domenici missed by all--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rockefeller). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I understand there is an order that the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa will be recognized next. But I asked \nhim graciously, would he give me a minute to speak in support of the \nUnited States-India nuclear cooperation agreement. I strongly endorse \nthis agreement because as one of those who advocate greater nuclear \npower in our Nation, the industrial base of India will work with our \nindustrial base at this time when we need to increase the number of \nplants we have in our Nation.\n  The United States-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and \nNonproliferation Enhancement Act will provide congressional approval of \nthe agreement reached between the United States and India that will \npave the way for bilateral cooperation in civilian nuclear energy. This \nagreement resulted from years of diplomatic negotiations. I note that \nmy dear friend, Ambassador Nick Burns, helped lay the foundation for \nthis agreement during his tenure as Under Secretary of State for \nPolicy.\n  As I publicly stated when this agreement was first announced in March \n2006, it is important that as we move to implement this historic \narrangement with India, we preserve two equally important objectives: a \nstrengthened strategic partnership with India that includes mutually \nbeneficial cooperation in civilian nuclear energy; and preservation of \nthe nuclear nonproliferation regime to prevent the further spread of \nnuclear weapons and related technologies. I believe the bill ably \ncrafted by Senators Biden and Lugar seeks to advance both of those \nobjectives.\n  As part of this agreement, India has agreed to separate its civilian \nnuclear fuel cycle from its military program, and to place the civilian \nprogram under full safeguards to be monitored by the International \nAtomic Energy Agency. This arrangement is intended to ensure that \ncooperation in civil nuclear energy will not assist India's nuclear \nweapons program in any way. India has also agreed to maintain its \nmoratorium on nuclear testing, work toward a Fissile Material Cutoff \nTreaty, and strengthen its domestic nuclear export control laws. The \nbill providing congressional approval for the agreement makes clear \nthat in the event India were to test a nuclear weapon in the future, \ncooperation under this agreement would be terminated.\n  Facilitating India's development of civilian nuclear energy will make \nan important contribution to a cause I value highly: reducing the \nemission of greenhouse gasses into the environment. As nations such as \nIndia grow and have increasing requirements for energy, it is \nimperative for the health of our global environment that they turn \nincreasingly to clean sources of energy such as nuclear power.\n  I am also hopeful that this agreement will open the door to United \nStates-India trade and investment in nuclear energy, and lead to new \nbusiness opportunities for American firms with expertise in civilian \nnuclear power. Today, the United States is looking to expand its \nproduction of civilian nuclear power; to do so with the participation \nof the industrial base of India should help to expand the safe and \neconomical production of civilian nuclear energy in both countries.\n  Mr. President, I support Senate approval of the United States-India \nNuclear Cooperation Agreement because I believe it will advance the \nUnited States-India strategic partnership, promote a clean energy \nsource to meet India's growing demand for energy, open the door to new \nbusiness opportunities for the U.S. nuclear energy sector, and still \npromote and preserve important nonproliferation practices and \nprinciples which remain in the interest of the United States and indeed \nthe international community.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to express my \nopposition to this deeply unwise United States-India Nuclear \nCooperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act. In truth, \nthis is not a nonproliferation enhancement act; it is a \nnonproliferation degradation and weakening act. If we pass this \nlegislation, we will reward India for flouting the most important arms \ncontrol agreement in history, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and \nwe will gravely undermine our case against hostile nations that seek to \ndo the same.\n  At a time when one of our primary national security objectives is to \nmobilize the global community to prevent Iran from producing nuclear \nweapons, the legislation before us would severely undermine our \ncredibility and consistency.\n  India has refused to sign the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty--\none of only four nations, by the way--and, three decades ago, produced \nits first nuclear weapon. It was precisely for this reason that \nfollowing India's first nuclear test in 1974, the United States felt \ncompelled to create the Nuclear Suppliers Group.\n  Since the 1954 Atomic Energy Act, the United States has prohibited--\nhas prohibited--the sale of any nuclear technology, peaceful or not, to \nany nation, such as India, that does not have full nuclear safeguards--\nfull nuclear safeguards. As was pointed out earlier by my colleague \nfrom North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, right now India has 22 nuclear \nreactors. Under this agreement, only 14 will come under IAEA, \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, safeguards--14. What about the \nother eight? What is going to happen to them? They are not under any \nsafeguards at all. So, again, we are undermining and we are overturning \nwhat the United States has been doing for over 50 years.\n  The legislation we now have before us permits the United States to \nunilaterally break that ban. It will open the floodgates for other \nnations, such as France and Russia, that already have agreements to \nsell to India pending--pending--the approval of this deal.\n  Listen to the views of LTG Robert Gard, chairman of the Center for \nArms Control and Proliferation. I quote his words:\n\n       The greatest threat to the security of the United States is \n     the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This deal [with India] \n     significantly weakens U.S. and international security by \n     granting an exception to the rules of the Nuclear Suppliers \n     Group and American laws, thereby undermining the entire non-\n     proliferation regime and inviting violations by other \n     nations.\n\n  I would add there is nothing in this agreement to prevent India from \ncontinuing on a parallel path its robust nuclear weapons program. India \nis allowed to continue producing--to continue producing--bomb-making \nmaterial, and it is free to expand its arsenal of nuclear weapons. Even \nworse, there is nothing in this legislation to prevent India from \nresuming nuclear weapons testing.\n  So I ask, why, in the twilight of the Bush Presidency--and we know \nwhat\n\n[[Page S10208]]\n\nhis ratings are and how the people feel about this Presidency--why are \nwe rushing to pass this gravely flawed agreement? It was hustled \nthrough the other body without any hearings and without a vote in the \nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee. Here in the Senate, the Foreign \nRelations Committee held just one hearing with just one witness who \nspoke in support of the agreement. Until Senators objected, an attempt \nwas made to pass the bill on the floor without any debate whatsoever. \nGiven the monumental national security implications of this \nlegislation--casting aside core principles of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty--this lack of debate and due diligence is simply \nextraordinary.\n  Leading arms control experts have condemned this agreement. Leonor \nTomero, director of nuclear nonproliferation at the Center for Arms \nControl and Nonproliferation, rendered this verdict:\n\n       The Bush administration ignored congressional conditions \n     and gave away the store in its negotiations with India, with \n     nothing to show for the deal now except having helped foreign \n     companies, enabled the increase of nuclear weapons and \n     nuclear-weapons materials in India, and seriously eroded a \n     thirty-year norm of preventing nuclear proliferation.\n\n  India is a peaceful nation, a strong democracy, and a friend of the \nUnited States. I have tremendous respect for India. But there are facts \nthat must be acknowledged: India is one of only four states that have \nrefused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; India continues \nto produce fissile material and expand its nuclear arsenal; India does \nnot have International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards on all elements \nof its civilian nuclear program; and India has failed to file a list of \nfacilities that will be subject to the IAEA safeguards. According to \nthe U.S. Department of State, in the past, Indian entities have sold \nsensitive missile technologies to Iran--to Iran--in violation of U.S. \nexport control laws.\n  I might just add one other thing. It has been said time and time \nagain that India is a great friend of the United States. I suggest that \none go back and look at the votes in the United Nations General \nAssembly and see how many times India votes with the United States and \nhas since the establishment of the United Nations. It is dismal. I was \ntrying to get that before the debate today, going all the way back. I \nhad that at one time. But I can tell you, last year, in 2007, in the \nGeneral Assembly, India voted with the United States 14 percent of the \ntime--one of the lowest in the world. This great friend of the United \nStates supported us in the United Nations 14 percent of the time. Is \nthat a real friend?\n  As I said, one more item: India, 22 reactors; only 14 are going to \ncome under IAEA safeguards, the other 8 used for military weapons \nprograms. Yet, despite this record, the legislation before us would \ngive India the rights and privileges of civil nuclear trade that \nheretofore have been restricted to members in good standing of the \nnonproliferation treaty.\n  As others have pointed out, this would create a dangerous precedent. \nIt would create a distinction between kind of ``good'' proliferators \nand ``bad'' proliferators. It would send mixed, misleading signals to \nthe international community with regard to what is and is not permitted \nunder the nonproliferation treaty. Under this legislation, the United \nStates would be saying, in effect, that India is a ``good'' \nproliferator and it should get special favorable treatment. What if, in \nthe months ahead, China or Russia decides to recognize Iran as a \n``good'' proliferator? On what grounds would we object, having \nrewritten the rules to suit our own interests and certain special \ninterests with regard to India?\n  I oppose this legislation. But there is one element of this \nprospective agreement with India that I believe is particularly \ndangerous and needs to be changed. It was talked about earlier. Under \nthe 2006 Henry J. Hyde Act, the United States must--must--ban the \ntransfer of enrichment or reprocessing technologies to India and it \nmust cut off--must cut off--nuclear trade with India if that nation \nresumes nuclear testing. The administration has successfully pressured \nthe Nuclear Suppliers Group to approve an India-specific waiver that \ndoes not incorporate these consequences if India resumes nuclear \ntesting. This is virtually an invitation to India to resume nuclear \ntesting, secure in the knowledge that a resumption of testing would not \nnullify this new nuclear trade agreement.\n\n  I believe this to be a grave mistake. That is why I am joining with \nSenator Dorgan and Senator Bingaman and others to offer a commonsense \namendment to this legislation in order to send an unambiguous warning \nto India with regard to resumption of nuclear testing. Our amendment \nstates:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the United \n     States may not export, transfer, or retransfer any nuclear \n     technology, material, equipment, or facility under the \n     Agreement if the Government of India detonates a nuclear \n     device after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  It is very simple, very straightforward.\n  In order to protect the integrity of the world's nonproliferation \nregime, I urge my colleagues to vote against the United States-India \nnuclear energy cooperation agreement. It will set a dangerous \nprecedent, and it will weaken our efforts to deny Iran a nuclear \nweapon. But if nothing else, at least we can adopt the amendment being \noffered by Senator Dorgan and Senator Bingaman and others to say that \nif, in fact, they do detonate a nuclear device, the United States will \nstop any export, transfer, or retransfer of any nuclear technology, \nmaterial, or equipment to India. So, again, I am a realist. I recognize \nthat this seems to be on a fast track. It will likely go to passage. So \nto minimize the damage, I urge Senators to support the Dorgan-Bingaman \namendment which will give India strong incentives not to resume nuclear \ntesting.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10208-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today, as one of those who made the \nweighty decision not to seek reelection, to share my most personal \nthoughts--tributes--to my esteemed colleagues who will quietly, humbly, \nand with a deep sense of gratitude to their States, to our Nation, \nbring to a conclusion their public service as U.S. Senators.\n  This is a diverse group of Senators. Whether we hail from small \nfarms, small cities or, in my case, from major metropolitan areas, we \nbring different backgrounds, different interests. That diversity gives \nthe Senate its strength to serve equally all Americans. What we share, \nhowever, is an unwavering love for our States, our country and for the \ninstitution of the U.S. Senate.\n  We aspire to Winston Churchill's quote: ``We make a living by what we \nget; we make a life by what we give.''\n  It has been my privilege, over my 30 years in the Senate, to serve \nwith a total of 261 Members. Each, almost, shall be remembered as a \nfriend.\n  I want to say a few special, heartfelt words about Senator Pete \nDomenici.\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  I first came to know Pete Domenici when I arrived in the Senate in \n1979. He beat me here by 6 years, and now has served New Mexico with \ndistinction for 36 years. Pete is a veritable renaissance man: baseball \nplayer, math teacher, lawyer, city commissioner, senator and, most \nimportantly, a loving husband, father and grandfather.\n  Senator Domenici made his mark with his leadership on fiscal and \nenergy\n\n[[Page S10209]]\n\nissues, especially with his influence in promoting clean, carbon-free, \nnuclear energy and moving America forward now that we have the reality \nof an energy shortage and a mission to lessen America's dependence on \nimported energy. America must move forward by increasing and enhancing \nits capability to develop nuclear powerplants. At one time in my \ncareer, I was privileged to be secretary of the Navy, and during that \nperiod, America had, either at sea or in port, some 70-plus naval \nvessels powered by nuclear plants, and we had a safety record second to \nnone. That can, and will, be duplicated with our growing domestic \nprograms.\n  A hallmark of my dear friend Pete, whom we sometimes call a ``grizzly \nold cuss,'' is how he so often expresses his feelings for his fellow \nSenators by saying, ``I love you, brother.'' Pete, we return that deep \nrespect and affection.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  Senator Chuck Hagel has served his native Nebraska and his country \nwith true heroism. When I was privileged to serve in the Department of \nthe Navy during the war in Vietnam, Chuck Hagel, together with his \nbrother, both served with courage in the same Army unit in South \nVietnam. He was awarded the Purple Heart not once but twice for his \nheroism and sacrifice in combat leadership.\n  His career has spanned the spectrum from public servant to \nentrepreneur, and this has given him a perspective on the world and \nglobal affairs, as well as of Main Streets in the hometowns and cities \nof his State.\n  Senator Hagel will be remembered for his efforts on behalf of his \nfellow veterans and men and women in uniform, together with their \nfamilies. At one time he served as president of the USO.\n  One of his proudest achievements will surely be his work with my \ncolleague from Virginia, a former highly decorated marine, Senator Jim \nWebb, who also served in Vietnam. The two of them started a very tough \nassignment, and that was to rewrite the existing G.I. bill. And along \nthe way, two ``old-timers,'' both World War II veterans--Senator \nLautenberg and I--enlisted in their ranks as cosponsors.\n  Our goal was to try and give to today's generation of men and women \nin uniform a level and diversity of benefits that approaches what the \nWorld War II generation received from a grateful nation at the \nconclusion of that conflict. The G.I. bill at that time enabled any \nsoldier, sailor or airman--and there were up to 16 million who served \nin World War II--to go to almost any university or college of his or \nher choice, and the funds were nearly sufficient to fund the costs for \ntuition, room and board, and school books.\n  But through the ensuing years, the successive G.I. bills were not \nquite as fulsome; they did not keep pace with the rising cost of \neducation. Prior to the Webb bill, today's generation was barely able \nto get enough funds to attend educational institutions in their home \nStates, let alone some of America's better-known educational \ninstitutions. This bill recognizes the great contributions of our \nmilitary men and women and increases significantly the G.I. bill \nbenefits. It will make a great difference in the lives of so many of \nthis generation, a generation that I believe is in every way equal to \nthe ``Greatest Generation'' of World War II, for it faces even greater \nchallenges as the uncertainty of threats and the advance of complexity \nof weapons face them today in a growing number of places worldwide.\n  I so admire this strong American, Chuck Hagel, who symbolizes ``duty, \nhonor, country.''\n  In public service, his compass is precise; for he always follows the \nneedle as it points to what course of action is ``best for America.''\n\n\n                              wayne allard\n\n  I turn now to Senator Wayne Allard, with whom I have been privileged \nto serve on the Armed Services Committee, who told his fellow \nColoradoans that if they chose him as their senator, he would only \nserve 2 terms. He kept his word, just as he has honorably kept his word \nto his constituents on many issues. I admire this senator and how well \nhe has served his state.\n  This veterinarian and small-business owner has been a forceful \nadvocate for military preparedness, for increased access to health care \nand for cutting spending, leading by example by often returning some of \nhis own office's funds to the U.S. Treasury. In a sense, he sent them \nback to his constituents.\n  He was also willing to roll up his sleeves and take on the tough task \nof overseeing the construction and budgeting, along with other senators \nand members of the House of Representatives, on the new Capitol \nVisitors Center. I might add, as a footnote, that when I was chairman \nof the Rules Committee, I co-sponsored some of the earliest pieces of \nlegislation to provide for this center. Senator Allard can be proud of \nhis efforts, which will serve present and future Americans who travel \nfrom afar to their nation's capital to learn about their government, \nthe longest-surviving democratic republic in world history.\n  I vividly recall journeying to Colorado, home State of one of my \nchildren, to travel through a magnificent area of the State with his \nlovely wife and children on behalf of his campaign to get elected to \nthe U.S. Senate. Those trips are memories I have and will keep safely \ntucked away.\n  I am proud to say I have come to know each of these fine men. And I \nfirmly believe that this is but yet another beginning in all of our \nlives, for, to quote Churchill again, ``the chain of destiny can only \nbe grasped one link at a time.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, our relationship with India is very \nimportant and I fully support developing closer strategic ties with \nIndia. I had the opportunity to visit India earlier this year, and I \nreturned with a renewed appreciation of the vital relationship between \nour two countries.\n  One of the topics I discussed with senior Indian government officials \nwas the proposed U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation agreement that we \nare considering today. This agreement does a great deal more than bring \nour two countries closer; it dramatically shifts 30 years of \nnonproliferation policy and seriously undermines our efforts to limit \nthe spread of nuclear weapons. If we pass this legislation today, we \nwill be making America--and the world--less safe.\n  The cornerstone of the nuclear nonproliferation regime, the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty, NPT, is based on the central premise that \nnon-nuclear weapons states agree not to try to acquire nuclear weapons \nin exchange for cooperation on peaceful civilian nuclear energy \nprograms. India chose not to take part in this grand bargain and \ninstead decided to become a nuclear weapons state. That is India's \nsovereign right. But it is our sovereign right--and our longstanding \npolicy--to not cooperate with any state that chooses to acquire nuclear \nweapons.\n  In fact, signatories to the NPT--including the United States--are \nspecifically prohibited from assisting, encouraging, or inducing any \nnonsignatory to develop nuclear weapons. And yet it has been made clear \nby numerous experts and even by officials of this administration that \nthis agreement could allow India to expand its weapons program by \nfreeing up domestically produced nuclear materials.\n  If the Senate passes this bill, we will be undermining the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty, the international nonproliferation regime, \nand U.S. national security. This agreement could fuel an arms race that \nwould have direct implications for regional stability--a particularly \nworrisome outcome given the history of turbulence in the region. Given \nthe gravity of this issue, I am extremely disappointed that the \nCongress is rushing consideration of the agreement--without time to \nconsider the most relevant intelligence, without testimony from \nindependent experts, and quite likely in violation of the Hyde Act.\n  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence \nCommittees, I have had a chance to study this issue closely. Over the \npast 2 years, I have spoken with a range of individuals from all sides: \nsenior Bush administration officials, business groups, nonproliferation \nand arms control experts, senior Indian officials, and concerned \nconstituents in my home state of Wisconsin. I have also reviewed the \nsupporting classified documents--something I hope all my colleagues \nhave also done. After reviewing those documents, I remain deeply \nconcerned about how this agreement will impact our national security.\n\n[[Page S10210]]\n\n  I laid my concerns last Congress when we first considered this issue. \nSince then, little has been done to address my core concerns. The \nthreat of nuclear weapons to the United States, and the spread of these \nweapons and the material needed to make them, are among the gravest \ndangers that our country faces. By passing this legislation, we are \nweakening, not strengthening the international regime created to \nmonitor and restrict their proliferation. The United States, as a \nsignatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, should be working to \nstrengthen the international treaties and regimes that have been \ndesigned to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. By passing this \nagreement in its current format we are doing exactly the opposite.\n  This deal will not only undermine the nonproliferation regime, but it \nmay also indirectly benefit India's weapons program. Two weeks ago, at \na Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Secretary Burns \nacknowledged that there can be no way to guarantee that cooperating \nwith India's civilian energy program will not indirectly benefit its \nweapons program. And yet despite this frank response, supporters of \nthis bill are determined to rush it though Congress. I am concerned \nthat Pakistan could feel the need to respond to India's enhanced \ncapacity by increasing its own production of nuclear materials, setting \noff an arms race in South Asia. Besides regional instability, there is \nanother danger to increased Pakistani nuclear stockpiles: the risk that \nal-Qaida could obtain such weapons. This threat is real and should not \nbe ignored.\n  In addition to these serious national security concerns, there are \nlegitimate procedural ones. This bill appears not to meet the \nrequirements of the legislation Congress overwhelmingly adopted to \nauthorize the agreement, the Hyde Act. I opposed the Hyde Act because I \ndidn't think it went far enough--now it turns out the administration \ndoes not even feel bound by it. To give just one example, the Hyde Act \nrequired that any technologies or materials transferred pursuant to \nthis agreement must be maintained under safeguards forever. Indian \nofficials have balked at this requirement and indicated that they would \ntake materials out of safeguards if their fuel supply was interrupted. \nThat means that if India tests a nuclear device and we cut off future \ntrade, India could turn around and use all of the reactors and fuel we \nhave provided for its weapons program, just as it did in 1974. The Bush \nadministration couldn't be troubled to even get a promise from India \nthat it would honor the safeguards and this legislation does nothing to \naddress this problem.\n  In late August the 45 members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, NSG, \nmet in Vienna to discuss whether they should overturn 30 years of \nprecedent and open up nuclear trade with India despite the lack of \ncomprehensive safeguards on India's nuclear facilities. While some NSG \nmembers attempted to reduce the negative impact this change will \ninevitably have on our ability to prevent the spread of sensitive \nnuclear materials, in the end they were unsuccessful. In the face of \nthe Bush administration's significant pressure for a ``clean'' \nexemption, there wasn't much they could do.\n  This undertaking by the Bush administration is particularly troubling \nin light of the recent report by the Institute for Science and \nInternational Security, ISIS, which indicates that the U.S. Government \nhas not devoted sufficient attention to ensuring that India adequately \nprotects sensitive nuclear and nuclear-related information. If this \nreport is even partially accurate, we should all be gravely concerned. \nThanks to our efforts, India is now eligible to buy advanced enrichment \nand reprocessing technologies. If these technologies are ever leaked, \nour ability to prevent acts of nuclear terrorism could be greatly \ndiminished.\n  With everything else going on right now it is clear there has not \nbeen adequate time to review the agreement and its supporting \ndocuments. Instead, we are ramming this through Congress so we can hand \nthe Bush administration a victory--regardless of the threat it poses to \nour national security.\n  Many of my colleagues have said that this agreement will bring India \ninto the mainstream but that appears to be wishful thinking. Why should \nIndia sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty or stop producing weapons \ngrade material if it now has access to all the technology and know-how \nit could need? India can now enjoy almost all the benefits afforded \nunder the NPT, regardless of the fact that it is still not a signatory.\n  Proponents of nuclear trade argue that because certain Indian \nfacilities will be placed under safeguards, this agreement will inhibit \nproliferation. This is not true. The purpose of safeguards is to \nprevent the diversion of nuclear materials to weapons programs. By \nproviding India new reactors and materials, this agreement frees up \ndomestic resources for India's weapons program. Rather than bringing \nIndia into the ``nuclear mainstream,'' this deal could enable the \nexpansion of its weapons program.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor the Dorgan-Bingaman amendment that would \nensure that the United States cuts off trade with India in the wake of \nnuclear tests and that we sanction any other nation that continues such \ntrade. I hope the Senate will adopt it, and I applaud the efforts of my \ncolleagues to improve this bill. I offered an amendment in committee \nthat would have helped close the loophole in the nonproliferation \nregime created by the NSG exemption, and I was disappointed that this \namendment was defeated. However, after careful review, I have come to \nthe conclusion that even if all of these improvements were adopted, \nthis deal would be fatally flawed.\n  Passing this bill will undermine international nonproliferation \nstandards, potentially encourage a disastrous regional arms race and \nthreaten our country's security. I intend to vote against this \nagreement and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe legislation approving the United States--India Nuclear Cooperation \nAgreement.\n  While I have concerns about this agreement's impact on the nuclear \nnonproliferation regime and the speed with which it has come to the \nfloor for a vote, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best \ninterests of the United States and our relationship with India and, \nwith vigorous oversight, will help strengthen our nuclear \nnonproliferation efforts.\n  This agreement has wide bipartisan support. The Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee reported this legislation favorably on a 19-2 vote. \nLast Saturday, the House approved this agreement by a vote of 298 to \n117 and I am hopeful the Senate will follow suit tonight.\n  While far from perfect, I believe this agreement will mark a first \nstep towards bringing India into the nuclear nonproliferation regime.\n  For years, India and the United States have failed to take advantage \nof our shared values of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in \ndeveloping a closer partnership.\n  I am hopeful this agreement will serve as a catalyst for solidifying \nrelations with the world's largest democracy in a critical part of the \nworld and enhance U.S.-India cooperation on a number of pressing \nissues: global warming, the war on terror, and stability in South Asia.\n  I do not take this vote lightly. As a U.S. Senator, I have worked \nhard to stop the development of new nuclear weapons and strengthen our \nnuclear nonproliferation efforts. I have introduced legislation calling \nfor a strengthened Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. I have fought \nagainst the research and development of new nuclear weapons like the \nrobust nuclear Earth penetrator and the reliable replacement warhead \nprogram. I have secured additional funding to remove vulnerable nuclear \nmaterials around the world. I have supported efforts to accelerate \nNunn-Lugar threat reduction programs.\n  Because of my commitment to nuclear nonproliferation efforts, I \ninitially approached plans for a U.S.-India nuclear cooperation \nagreement with some skepticism: 8 of India's 22 nuclear reactors--\nincluding India's fast breeder reactors, which can produce massive \namounts of plutonium for nuclear weapon--will be classified for \nmilitary uses and thus will remain outside of International Atomic \nEnergy Agency safeguards. India will retain the right to designate \nfuture nuclear reactors as ``military'' and not subject to \ninternational safeguards. India will continue to manufacture fissile \nmaterial\n\n[[Page S10211]]\n\nfor nuclear weapons and has not signed the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  Nevertheless, I supported the Hyde Act of 2006 which authorized the \nPresident to conclude a nuclear cooperation agreement with India \nbecause it included provisions which would help preserve the nuclear \nnonproliferation regime.\n  Under the terms of that bill any nuclear cooperation agreement will \nbe terminated if India conducts a nuclear test, proliferates nuclear \nweapons or nuclear materials, or breaks its commitments to the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency; the President must determine that \nIndia is meeting its nonproliferation commitments; the Nuclear \nSuppliers Group must decide by consensus and according to its rules to \nopen nuclear trade with India; the export of any equipment, materials, \nor technology related to the enrichment of uranium, the reprocessing of \nspent nuclear fuel, or the production of heavy water is prohibited; the \nPresident must create a program to monitor the end use of items \nexported to India to ensure that they are not diverted to nonpeaceful \nactivities; and no action may be taken to violate U.S. obligations \nunder the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  The question now before us is whether the agreement negotiated by the \nBush administration conforms with the Hyde Act and U.S. nuclear \nnonproliferation efforts.\n  I understand the serious questions that have been raised by many \nnuclear nonproliferation experts and my colleagues about critical parts \nof this agreement. By opening trade in civil nuclear fuel and \ntechnologies, will this agreement indirectly benefit India's nuclear \nweapons program by freeing up domestic resources for military purposes? \nDoes India agree with the administration that, under U.S. law, if India \nbreaks its moratorium and tests a nuclear weapon U.S. nuclear trade \nwill be terminated? Will our partners in the Nuclear Suppliers Group \nfollow suit? Why has India not filed a declaration with the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency of its civil nuclear facilities that \nwill be subject to international safeguards as required by the Hyde \nAct? Why did the exemption for India approved by the Nuclear Suppliers \nGroup not include guidelines baring transfer of sensitive nuclear \ntechnologies to states, like India, who have not signed the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty?\n  I believe the legislation now before us addresses many of these \nconcerns. It requires the President to certify that the agreement is \nconsistent with our obligations as a party to the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty and will not help India acquire or build nuclear \nweapons; states that it is the policy of the United States that, in the \nevent nuclear trade between India and the United States is suspended, \nsuch as following a Indian nuclear test, the United States will work to \nprevent the transfer of nuclear technologies and materials from other \nmembers of the Nuclear Suppliers Group or any other source. It also \nrequires the President to certify that the safeguards agreement between \nIndia and the International Atomic Energy Agency has come into force \nand India has filed a declaration of its civil nuclear facilities that \nwill be subject to those safeguards before nuclear trade can begin. It \nalso requires the President to certify that it is the policy of the \nUnited States to work with the other members of the Nuclear Suppliers \nGroup to restrict the transfer of sensitive nuclear technologies \nrelating to the enrichment of uranium and reprocessing of spent nuclear \nfuel.\n  And while I appreciate the assurances from the administration that, \nin accordance with U.S. law, nuclear trade with India would cease in \nthe event a nuclear test, I will support an amendment by Senator Dorgan \nand Senator Bingaman to make this action clear.\n  As I indicated before, I would have preferred more time to debate \nthis critical agreement. Yet I am also conscious of the fact that if we \nhad used the full 30 days to consider this agreement, we would be \npresented with a simple up or down vote on a one sentence resolution \napproving the agreement.\n  I appreciate the fact that we have the opportunity with this \nlegislation to lock in additional requirements and oversight of U.S.-\nIndian nuclear trade.\n  U.S.-Indian relations have come a long ways since the days of the \nCold War. We have overcome distrust and skepticism and have begun to \nbuild a fruitful, mutually beneficial relationship between the world's \nlargest democracy and the world's oldest democracy.\n  Whatever the problems we will face in the global arena in the next \ncentury, we will need to work with India.\n  By approving this legislation, we will not only open the door to the \ntrade in nuclear materials and nuclear technology--and provide new \nopportunities for U.S. businesses--we will open the door to closer \ncooperation on issues vital to U.S. national security interests in \nSouth Asia and around the world.\n  This is not the end of our efforts to bring India into the nuclear \nnonproliferation mainstream. This is one step that should be followed \nby close congressional oversight and robust and sustained American \ndiplomacy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the \nUnited States-India agreement on nuclear energy.\n  The agreement states it is intended for cooperation on the peaceful \nuses of nuclear energy and for other purposes. It is the phrase ``for \nother purposes'' that is most troubling. As I have seen over the years, \nit is always prudent that one requests all of the specific details of \nany agreement before approving such a deal. And the details of this \nagreement are most disturbing.\n  If you agree with me that the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction is one of the greatest threats to humanity's continued \nexistence then you should agree that preventing proliferation should be \none of the cornerstones of our foreign and national security policy. \nThus, there are only two reasons to support this agreement: first, it \nwould enhance our international efforts to prevent proliferation, and \nsecond, it would prevent further testing of nuclear weapons on the \nSouth Asian subcontinent.\n  Unfortunately, this agreement does neither. Instead it enhances the \nrisk of proliferation and ensures additional testing of nuclear weapons \nin South Asia.\n  This agreement undermines the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, NPT, \nand other agreements that have been essential to our efforts for \ndecades to prevent states from developing nuclear weapons. India is one \nof three states that has never signed the NPT, nor has it signed the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, CTBT. Nothing in this agreement requires \nIndia to do either. In effect, India will gain all the rights of a \nnuclear state and bear none of the responsibilities. Nothing in this \nagreement requires India to commit to eventual disarmament--an \nobjective that even the United States, as a treaty signatory, accepts. \nIt is possible to conceive of an end-state in which the United States \nand Russia disarm, but, in the case of India, there is nothing in this \nagreement that requires India to do so. This agreement would allow \nIndia to maintain a nuclear arsenal in perpetuity.\n  As of today, the United States is a signatory to the CTBT--although \nthe Senate has not yet ratified the treaty--but India is not. The \nUnited States has agreed to greater safeguards and constraints on its \nnuclear weapons program than has India. This is an extraordinary \nexception that the Senate is being asked to accept.\n  Equally important, this agreement undermines our efforts to contain \nthe spread of nuclear weapons to countries of concern. Right now those \ncountries are North Korea and Iran. We do not know what adversaries \ntomorrow will bring. Even so, our concerns over the Iranian and North \nKorean clandestine nuclear programs are sufficient to warrant \ndisapproving this exception for India's clandestine program. When the \nUnited States is trying to encourage Iran and North Korea to scale down \nand eliminate their nuclear weapons programs, to enter into a \ncooperation agreement with India for nuclear energy purposes would be \nsending the wrong message.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues that the United States has been \narguing that the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, and the \nUnited Nations\n\n[[Page S10212]]\n\nSecurity Council should impose stiffer sanctions on Iran and North \nKorea. In addition, pending before the Senate is H.R. 7112, the \nComprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of \n2008. This bill would place new sanctions on Iran. I support such \nsanctions, and I support similar efforts to establish accountability to \nthe India program.\n  Another added concern is that India might support Iran's secret \nweapons program. Already a number of companies in India have been \nsanctioned under U.S. export control law for providing sensitive \nmissile technologies to Iran. India's export control regime remains \ndeeply flawed. We have a history of this administration not disclosing \nintelligence information that is derogatory to their argument. In the \ncase of India, the administration did not report export control \nviolations of Indian companies until critical votes had occurred in the \nHouse.\n  What assurances have we received from the administration that they \nare not withholding critical information at this time from the \nCongress? The Senate has received a classified annex to the public \nNuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement, NPAS, but I would ask, is \nthat document complete? Does it address all the critical questions? I \nwould suggest to my colleagues that, until there is certainty that all \nthe answers to these serious questions are satisfactory; it is better \nto vote no on this agreement.\n  Nothing in this agreement would prevent India from further testing of \nnuclear weapons. Some would argue that it makes it certain that India \nwill continue testing, and, under this legislation, India can continue \nto receive nuclear materials from other countries even if the United \nStates were to suspend any that it is providing. I believe that it is \nunlikely that the United States will find much of a new market for its \nnuclear products should this agreement be approved. India has a history \nof trading with Russia, France, and others in this area, and trade with \nthese countries will, in the estimation of many experts, prosper.\n  As Michael Krepon, a noted analyst of the Pakistani and Indian \nnuclear programs, has observed, ``The upgrading of New Delhi's nuclear \nforces will most certainly require more nuclear testing.'' In the case \nof a test, I believe that India will argue that it was forced to in \norder to ensure the safety of its nuclear arsenal and India's nuclear \ntrading partners will argue against sanctions in the name of preserving \nwhat few Indian nuclear facilities remain under IAEA safeguards.\n  India officials have made it abundantly clear that they maintain the \nright to test. India's Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, said, ``Let \nme hence reiterate once again that a decision to undertake a future \nnuclear test would be our sovereign decision, one that rests solely \nwith our government.'' He noted ``We want to keep the option [of \nconducting further nuclear tests] open if the situation demands. If the \ninternational situation requires, we may have to [conduct nuclear \ntests].'' M.K. Narayanan, a member of India's Atomic Energy Commission, \nobserved that ``This deal deals primarily with civil nuclear \ncooperation. There is no reference here to the event of a test. If \nthere is a test, we come to that later on.''\n  If India does test, Pakistan may retaliate. As Pakistan has already \nindicated, it would match India step by nuclear step. In April 2006, \nPakistan's National Command Authority stated: ``In view of the fact the \n[U.S.-India] agreement would enable India to produce a significant \nquantity of fissile material and nuclear weapons from unsafeguarded \nnuclear reactors, the NCA expressed firm resolve that our credible \nminimum deterrence requirements will be met.'' There is already a \nnuclear and missile weapons race in South Asia. This agreement will \nonly accelerate it, and nuclear tests will fan the flames even hotter. \nIs this prospect in the interest of the United States? Has a National \nIntelligence Estimate concluded that such a scenario would enhance our \nnational security?\n  I return to the questions I posed at the beginning of my statement: \ndoes this agreement enhance our international efforts to prevent \nproliferation, and secondly, will it prevent the further testing of \nnuclear weapons on the South Asian subcontinent? The answer in both \ninstances is a resounding no, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak in \nsupport of H.R. 7081, the United States-India Nuclear Cooperation \nApproval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act.\n  I had the privilege to be serving as the Democratic leader in the \nU.S. Senate in late 2006 when, on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis, \nwe passed the Henry J. Hyde United States and India Nuclear Cooperation \nPromotion Act, which laid out the specific steps that needed to be \ntaken in order for our country to achieve a civilian nuclear agreement \nwith the nation of India. At the time, I felt it was important for the \nCongress to pass the Hyde Act as a critical step in further \nstrengthening the growing political, economic, and security partnership \nbetween the United States and India. Today, 2 years later, the Indian \ngovernment has acted to meet the guidelines set forth in that piece of \nlegislation, allowing us to consider H.R. 7081.\n  After our two countries reached a consensus on the text of the \nnuclear cooperation pact this past July, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan \nSingh faced a tough domestic battle to approve the agreement. However, \nhis government worked diligently to form a coalition of supporters for \nthe nuclear deal, and it eventually passed the Indian Parliament. On \nSaturday, in the House, Democrats and Republicans approved H.R. 7081 by \na landslide: 298 to 117. Now, we are here today to take the next step \nin approving this agreement and sending it to the President.\n  As I did back in late 2006, I would like to remind my fellow Senators \nhow important it is that we approve this measure to expand civilian \nnuclear cooperation with India. For much of the cold war, America's \nrelationship with India--a leader in the movement of nonaligned \ncountries--was too often characterized by ambivalence on both sides. \nBut in the nearly 20 years since the walls that separated East from \nWest have come down, our two countries have enjoyed an unprecedented \nlevel of engagement with one another that has proven truly beneficial \nfor both parties. And the citizens of our two countries are \nincreasingly interconnected through business, educational, and social \nlinkages.\n  India has emerged as one of the world's most important leaders of the \n21st century. India has experienced significant growth in the \ntechnological and service sectors, foreign investment has ballooned, \nand India has become a global center for cultural and artistic \nexpression. The entrepreneurial spirit of the Indian people, coupled \nwith their strong commitment to democratic values, has formed the \nbackbone of a society whose potential for growth knows few boundaries.\n  By voting for this agreement, the Senate will cement the gains that \nwe have achieved in our bilateral relationship and open two of the \nworld's top scientific communities to the type of civilian nuclear \ncooperation befitting our strong alliance.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee who, in conjunction with the Department of State, took the \ntime to examine this agreement over the past 2 weeks. I am equally \ngrateful to Senators Dorgan and Bingaman for their willingness to work \nwith the Senate leadership on this important bill. As these two \nSenators, and others, have pointed out, we cannot undermine the nuclear \nnonproliferation regime's decades of successes, and I appreciate the \ngoals of the Dorgan-Bingaman amendment to ensure the strength of our \ncontinued commitments to the nonproliferation regime. I certainly \nunderstand the concerns expressed in their amendment, but I believe \nthat this historic agreement provides the necessary safeguards and \noversight to ensure that our nonproliferation objectives will be \nrespected.\n  I also am heartened by the repeated public and private commitments by \nofficials of the U.S. Government to upholding nonproliferation. Because \nof Senator Dorgan and Bingaman's work, the Secretary of State stated in \na letter to me today, which has been entered into the record, a clear \ncommitment in the event of a nuclear test. Secretary Rice's letter \nstates: ``We've been very clear with the Indians . . . should India \ntest, as it has agreed not\n\n[[Page S10213]]\n\nto do, or should India in any way violate the IAEA safeguard[s] \nagreements to which it would be adhering, the deal, from our point of \nview, would at that point be off.'' With this commitment in hand, I am \nreluctant to vote for an amendment that I feel might jeopardize the \nimportant progress we have made over the past few years in securing \nthis deal with the Government of India. The strong and growing \npartnership between India and the United States must move forward, and \nI am proud that Senate passage of H.R. 7081 tonight will further deepen \nthis partnership.\n  In closing, I would like to remind my friends in the Chamber that the \nUnited States is the proud home to a large and vibrant community of \nIndian-Americans--my State of Nevada being no exception. America is a \ncountry that was built on the strength of our immigrants, and the \ncontributions of the nearly 3 million Indian Americans currently living \nin the United States have enriched our society immeasurably. We in the \nSenate have a tremendous opportunity to show them our commitment to \nimproving relations with the country of their ancestry. With that, I \nurge my colleagues to support this landmark agreement and vote to \nexpand civilian nuclear cooperation between our great country and the \nworld's largest democracy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, India has over 1 billion people and a \nrapidly growing economy. They recognize the need to provide electricity \nthat does not increase air pollution or greenhouse gases.\n  With this agreement we can help export U.S. technology and safeguards \nto monitor and support India's inevitable nuclear expansion or ignore \nIndia's growth as a nuclear power as we have for the past 30 years.\n  This agreement is good for the U.S. economy, good for international \nnuclear safeguards, and good for the environment.\n  As a rapidly growing economy, India will see an increased need for \nelectricity over the coming decades. As India--and the world--seeks to \nfind ways to increase generation while reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions, nuclear power will continue to grow. The civilian nuclear \nagreement with India will allow us to help export U.S. technology to \nmonitor this expansion and will facilitate a global approach to the \nchallenges of climate change.\n  India is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, yet \nthey have agreed to inspections by the International Atomic Energy \nAgency.\n  This will improve our ability to monitor and protect against \nproliferation of nuclear material.\n  India's growing civilian nuclear program will now be subject to \ninternational inspections.\n  India would like to cooperate with the United States in developing \nsafer nuclear technology consistent with the administration's goals.\n  From a practical standpoint, this agreement will increase \ninspections, verify compliance, and encourage cooperation on new \ntechnology.\n  I would also point out that this agreement has the support of the \nworld's leading nonproliferation watchdog, Mohammed El Baradei, \nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n  He said, ``this agreement is an important step towards satisfying \nIndia's growing need for energy. It would also bring India closer as an \nimportant partner in the nonproliferation regime.'' He went on to say, \n``It would be a step forward toward universalization of the \ninternational safeguards regime.''\n  I am of the belief that we need to advance the goals of the Nuclear \nNon-proliferation Treaty by opening up cooperation and transparency in \nIndia. Under this agreement, the United States and India will expand \nthe use of safeguards on critical nuclear technology and processes in \nthat country--something that is beyond our reach today.\n  India has developed its nuclear program for the past three decades \nand has not exported material or technology. However, there are strong \nand powerful political forces within India that would like to disclose \nless and make fewer sites subject to civilian inspection. This \nagreement subjects most of India's reactors to civilian inspection, \nincluding all of the breeder reactors. I believe if we reject this \npackage, it will be years before we are able to negotiate another deal, \nand it is unlikely to provide as much openness and transparency as we \nhave today.\n  With regard to the amendment offered by Senators Dorgan and \nBingaman--two Members for whom I have enormous respect--I believe this \namendment is duplicative and would only serve to delay, if not derail, \nthis important agreement.\n  This administration has been very clear that India would face severe \nconsequences if they tested another nuclear device. Also, this language \nduplicates the export controls and reporting requirements of Sections \n103, 104 and 105 of the Hyde Act.\n  I do not believe this amendment will provide any additional \nprotection or controls that are not already in place today, so I must \nrecommend my colleagues oppose this amendment and adopt the India \ncivilian nuclear agreement without changes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the years it has become more and more \napparent that two great democracies, the United States and India, are \nwell suited for not only a partnership but also a friendship. Our \ncooperation could mean not just increased economic opportunities for \nboth nations but also the opportunity for the United States and India \nto join together to spread the fundamental principles of freedom, \ndemocracy, tolerance, and the rule of law throughout the world.\n  As a founder and cochair of the Senate India Caucus, I have had the \nprivilege to work closely with Indian officials, Indian Americans, and \nmany other friends of India here in the United States to help promote \nthe already flourishing relationship between our two countries. There \nis no clearer evidence of this great friendship than the revolutionary \ncivilian nuclear agreement before us, which the House recently passed \nand we will vote on today.\n  This landmark agreement represents the latest example of the United \nStates and India, the world's largest democracy, working together on \nissues of mutual benefit. It will bring about an unprecedented level of \ncooperation between us, helping India to meet its growing energy \ndemands, while forging new economic opportunities for everyone \ninvolved.\n  The initiative will serve both the interests of the United States and \nthe interests of India, with its more than 1 billion citizens. In light \nof its track record as a responsible actor on nonproliferation issues, \nIndia is an appropriate and worthy partner in this historic deal. The \nagreement will pave the way for cooperative efforts in peaceful \ncivilian nuclear power, while simultaneously addressing concerns about \nnuclear proliferation.\n  I understand well the need for careful monitoring to protect against \nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons, and I am pleased with the \nsafeguards contained in this agreement. But as the nation of India \ncontinues to grow, their need for new, clean, and affordable energy \nsources grows as well.\n  Helping India develop a safe and responsible nuclear industry will \ngive its people the resources they need to grow their economy and \nstrengthen their nation, while helping America's nuclear industry in \nthe process.\n  Most importantly, if we do nothing, the people of India will have no \noption but to look elsewhere for nuclear assistance. That would be \nunfortunate for both nations. We must remain a strong partner for \nIndia, not just in the area of civil nuclear cooperation but also on \nlarger geopolitical matters.\n  If we approve this long-overdue agreement, we will send a strong \nmessage that India and the United States stand together as friends to \nface even the most difficult and pressing issues of our time. As we \nlook ahead to the future, each of our nations will do so with the \nconfidence that it has a friend, ready to work together.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has the \nopportunity to vote on the United States-India Nuclear Cooperation \nApproval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act and to finally approve \nthe peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement between the United States \nand India. This bill will seize the opportunity to build on the \nfoundation laid by President Bill Clinton and cement a new, cooperative \nrelationship with India, the world's largest democracy.\n\n[[Page S10214]]\n\n  Two years ago, Chairman Lugar and I worked with the administration to \nenact legislation that changed 30 years of U.S. non-proliferation \npolicy. We agreed to let the administration negotiate and submit to \nCongress a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement with India, despite \nthe fact that India has a nuclear weapons program. That wasn't easy. It \ntook soul-searching and compromise on the part of many Members of the \nSenate regarding the standards for such an agreement and for U.S. \npolicy.\n  Since the President's submittal of the proposed Agreement three weeks \nago, Senator Dodd and Senator Lugar have worked hard with the other \nMembers of the Foreign Relations Committee, the chairman of the Foreign \nAffairs Committee of the House of Representatives Howard Berman, the \nranking Republican member of that committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and \nwith the administration, to forge a bipartisan compromise on this \nimportant and complex issue. Senator Dodd and Senator Lugar especially \ndeserve a great deal of thanks for all the efforts that have been \nrequired of them to bring this bill, and this historic agreement, to \nthis point.\n  Enactment of this bill will help the U.S.-India relationship grow, \nwhile advancing India's ability to meet its energy needs in a way that \nfits within the cooperation framework Congress has worked so hard to \nestablish. It will help ensure that the agreement and any exports that \nflow from it will be consistent with U.S. law and our national security \ninterests, by adding to the tools that the Congress and future \nadministrations will have to keep watch over this agreement.\n  I look forward to the passage of this bill, its enactment into law, \nand the beginning of a stronger relationship between our two great \ndemocracies.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe United States-India Agreement for Cooperation on Peaceful Uses of \nNuclear Energy.\n  I do not feel any better about this agreement than I did when the \nSenate passed the Hyde Act back in November 2006. At that time, I \nstrongly felt that the administration was giving up more than it was \ngetting in return, and that India was essentially being rewarded for \nits continued failure to join the nonproliferation mainstream and sign \nthe Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  Today, I remain particularly concerned about two factors--the \npossibility that this deal will free up additional fissile material for \nIndia's nuclear weapons program and India's continued military \ncooperation with Iran.\n  While I am pleased that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nincluded language in the legislation requiring the President to certify \nthat approving the agreement is consistent with our obligation under \nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty not to assist or encourage India \nto produce nuclear weapons I am afraid that this does not go far \nenough.\n  Some experts believe that this deal could allow India to vastly \nincrease its production of nuclear weapons from an estimated 6 to 10 \nper year to several dozen a year, touching off an arms race in a region \nthat is already facing significant security challenges.\n  I simply do not understand how the United States could champion a \ndeal that rewards a country for producing nuclear weapons outside of \nthe NPT at the same time we are trying so hard to get Iran and North \nKorea to give up their pursuit of illicit nuclear programs.\n  I also remain concerned about India's continued relationship with \nIran, including its military relationship.\n  In 2006, Defense News reported that Iranian warships visited a port \nin the Indian city of Kochi to participate in a military training \nprogram. In 2007--nearly a year later--Defense News again reported on \nthe military relationship between Iran and India, citing an agreement \nbetween the two nations to form a joint defense working group.\n  This continued military-to-military cooperation is particularly \ntroublesome as Iran continues its reckless support of international \nterrorism and continues to enrich uranium in defiance of the United \nNations Security Council--making the Middle East an infinitely more \ndangerous place.\n  Furthermore, Iran has supported Shiite militias in Baghdad who have \nin turn murdered American troops. It has also continued its support for \nHezbollah and Hamas, and Iran's President has denied the Holocaust and \nthreatened to ``wipe Israel off the map.''\n  Let me be clear--I value strong United States-India ties, and \nappreciate that it is in the United States interest that these ties are \ndeepened.\n  But I regret that the Bush administration was unable to negotiate a \nbetter deal with India. Unfortunately the deal now before us has \nsignificant shortcomings that cannot be overlooked.\n  This is why I must vote against this bill today.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will vote against H.R. 7081, a bill to \napprove the United States-India Agreement for Cooperation on Peaceful \nUses of Nuclear Energy. This agreement represents a major shift in U.S. \nnonproliferation policy, with widespread ramifications for regional and \nglobal security, yet it is being rushed through the Congress with \nunseemly haste and reckless disregard for the deliberative process \noutlined for such agreements in the 1954 Atomic Energy Act. There is no \nneed for this rush to judgment; far from it, the Senate and the Nation \nwould be better served, in my opinion, to put this off until the heat \nand fury of the election season has passed and we can give this \nagreement the prudent consideration that it merits.\n  The world recognizes India as an economic and a nuclear power. Its \ngrowing economy, large population and soaring energy requirements make \nnuclear power generation an attractive option. However, we cannot \naddress assistance for India's electrical power needs without also \nconsidering that India is a military power with a sophisticated \ntechnological base that includes the ability to build and launch \nnuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles and ballistic \nmissile defense systems.\n  India has conducted nuclear tests since 1974 and has been under a \nglobal ban on trade in nuclear fuels and technology since that date. On \nSeptember 27, after the House of Representatives voted in favor of this \nagreement, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh addressed the Indian \ncommunity in New York with these words: ``India will be liberated from \nthe constraints of technology denial of 34 years. It will add an \nimportant strategic pillar to our bilateral partnership. We will widen \nour clean energy options.'' However, the Indian military and civilian \nnuclear programs are closely intertwined, and this new agreement will \nrequire new program separation measures that may prove difficult to \nensure or fully enforce. There is a real risk in that providing U.S. \ntechnology and materials to the civilian side of that equation may \nresult in enhancements in India's military nuclear program.\n  If the Congress approves this agreement, we must be prepared for the \npotential backlash of a nuclear arms race in the region. Pakistan, \nwhich has long had border disputes with India, has threatened to match \nany Indian nuclear capabilities. Pakistan has, like India, \nclandestinely developed a nuclear weapon capability and has conducted \nnuclear tests. Like India, Pakistan has not signed the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty (NPT), the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, or \nother nonproliferation agreements. But India will be rewarded for its \nthree decades of defiance of international nonproliferation accords \nwith access to nuclear technology and materials provided in this \nagreement, and it will not, in return, give up one iota of its military \nnuclear facilities or programs.\n  This agreement may have been a long time coming, but it is not yet \nfinal. In 2006, the Congress rejected President Bush's original U.S.-\nIndia nuclear cooperation agreement. Instead, the Congress adopted the \nHenry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation \nAct of 2006, which proposed several additional safeguards requirements \nto the agreement. President Bush signed the act, but the agreement he \nis now pushing so hard to get approved before he leaves office neither \nmeets all the requirements of the Hyde Act nor the procedures for \nconsideration of these agreements outlined in the Atomic Energy Act of \n1954.\n  India has not yet filed its declaration of the facilities to be \nsafeguarded with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Nor has the \nIndian government\n\n[[Page S10215]]\n\npublicly acknowledged that the safeguards would last ``in perpetuity.'' \nThere is no provision to terminate this agreement immediately in the \nevent that India conducts another nuclear test, as it last did in 1998. \nEven though this is the first agreement of its kind to require an \nexemption under the Atomic Energy Act, because India is not a signatory \nto the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Congress is being pushed to \noverride the statutory period for consideration of the agreement.\n  At a time when the United States is strengthening its sanctions on \nIran to halt its uranium enrichment, India has joined in non-aligned \nmovement statements supporting Iran's nuclear position in its \nnegotiations with the West and is a major supplier of refined petroleum \nproducts for Tehran. In addition, shortly after the House vote on the \nHyde Act in 2006, the State Department reported that Indian entities \nwere believed to have sold sensitive missile technologies to Iran.\n  According to those in the non-proliferation community, this agreement \ncreates a dangerous distinction between ``good'' proliferators and \n``bad'' proliferators and sends misleading signals to the international \ncommunity with regard to Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty norms, making \nthe task of winning international support to contain and constrain the \nnuclear programs of North Korea, Iran, and potential proliferators more \ndifficult.\n  We need to let the process work. There is no rush. The Congress will \nstill be here come January. India will still be around come January. \nThe Indian government may even have filed its facilities declaration \nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency by January. Only President \nBush will be leaving in January, but, if this agreement is approved, I \ncan assure him that his Administration will get all due credit for \nnegotiating it. Let us take a step back from this mad rush we are in, \nand do our job as the Founders intended, as a deliberative body, not a \nrubber stamp.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, momentarily we will be introducing a bill, \nbut my colleague from New York is here and wants to be heard. I just \nwanted to take 30 seconds, if I could. We have wrapped up the debate on \nthe U.S.-India nuclear accord and there will be no more discussion I \nknow of about that at this point. I will maybe insert some materials in \nthe Record but I did want to thank Senator Biden's staff and others. \nThere is a list which I will put in the Record, but Brian McKeon, Ed \nLevine, Anthony Wier, Fulton Armstrong, and, from Senator Lugar's \nstaff, Kenny Myers and Tom Moore, just did a great job on this. I want \nmy colleagues to reflect the effort of staff who have worked for years \non this. I appreciate immensely their efforts. There will be a vote \nlater this evening on that matter.\n  I yield the floor to my colleagues whom I know want to address the \nfinancial crisis issue or some other points. As soon as I have the \namended version of the bill, I will send it to the desk for their \nconsideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from New York yield for a unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the statement of the Senator from New York, I be \nrecognized for 10 minutes, and then other Republicans speaking on the \nrescue plan be allotted 10-minute segments from the Republican side.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I am going to offer a \nunanimous-consent request that covers that. I will have my colleague \nlook at it as well, so we may need some modification.\n  Mr. GREGG. I don't believe it covers the 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? The Senator \nfrom Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to be able to get in this line too, so I ask unanimous consent \nthat I speak following the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me object to this particular request of my colleague, \nand I will get back to it in a minute. I don't want to get to a \nsituation where there are limits without some consideration to make \nsure there is a balance to it.\n  Mr. GREGG. Let's go forward with the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. DODD. Then the Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10215-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10215-S10220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FINANCIAL CRISIS\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the extraordinary \nwork that has been done with respect to the rescue package, led in a \nbipartisan fashion, which has certainly produced significant changes in \nthe original request that came to the Congress from the Treasury \nDepartment. Tonight we will vote on legislation none of us wish we were \nconsidering and none of us can afford to see fail.\n  The costs of inaction are far too great. We are already seeing the \nconsequences of a freezing credit market that will only worsen. I hear \nacross my State of New York that small businesses are struggling to \nfind affordable loans to keep their doors open and their inventories \nstocked. Even larger businesses are being pushed to the breaking point. \nThroughout the country, the impact of this credit crisis is beginning \nto be felt with students who are seeing the sources of student loans \ndry up, interest rates on car payments are rising, families who had \nsaved up and acted responsibly are seeing higher mortgage rates \nshrinking their dream of home ownership.\n  Our economy runs on credit. Underlying that credit is trust. Both the \ncredit and the trust is running out. Essentially, what we are doing in \nan intangible way is restoring trust and confidence, and in a very \ntangible way helping to restore credit. Banks will refuse to lend to \nbusinesses and even to one another; investors continue to withdraw to \nthe safest investments: Treasury bills, even cash. Tens of thousands of \njobs in New York have been lost. A study this morning projected that \nNew York alone would lose at least 120,000 jobs.\n  I think we are here in some respects because we failed to tackle a \nhome mortgage crisis. Now we are facing a market crisis. If we fail to \ntackle the market crisis, we risk an even deeper economic crisis. I do \nnot think any of us want to see irresponsibility on Wall Street \ncompounded by ineffectiveness in Washington.\n  That is why we must act, even as we do so with regret and \nreservations, because we have little choice. The proposal we are \nconsidering is far from perfect, but it is a far cry from the original \nplan sent over by the Treasury Department that instilled virtually \nunlimited powers in the hands of the Treasury Secretary. As I said when \nwe first examined that original three-page proposal, we needed a plan \nthat included checks and balances, not a blank check.\n  Thanks to the leadership in the Senate and in the House, we have \nnegotiated through the Congress, on a bipartisan basis, a better \nalternative that instills taxpayer protections, asserts oversight, and \nmaintains greater accountability.\n  As is the case very often in effective compromises, no one is happy. \nBut we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good--or in this \ncase, the enemy of what is necessary. But as we vote for this proposal \ntonight, we must do so considering what steps we will take next.\n  On the floor at this moment are three of the leaders who shaped this \nplan under the very able leadership of Chairman Dodd, and the chief \nRepublican negotiator, Senator Gregg, and, of course, the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, Chairman Baucus. But I think we all recognize \nthis is not the end but the beginning of what we must do. I believe \nthere are three big goals we will have to address even after we pass \nthe rescue package tonight in the Senate and send it over to the House.\n  First, we must address the home mortgage crisis. For 2 years, I and \nothers have called for action as wave after wave of defaults and \nforeclosures crashed against communities and the broader economy. We \nare not yet through the woods. Millions of mortgages are underwater or \nunder the specter of adjustable rates set to rise.\n  I am proposing what we are calling the Home Owners Mortgage \nEnterprise,\n\n[[Page S10216]]\n\nan acronym obviously spelling ``home,'' to rewrite mortgages and homes \nso that creditworthy, responsible families can keep their homes and \nkeep making affordable payments. Through such a HOME program we would \nalso be able to consider freezing adjustable mortgage rates and even \nplacing a short-term moratorium on foreclosures.\n  When our country enacted a similar program in the Great Depression, \nwe saved 1 million homes without costing the taxpayers a dime. In fact, \nthe program ended with a surplus. Only by rewriting the terms of the \ndebt held by families whose mortgages can be salvaged will we recoup a \ngreat deal of the value of the debt we are purchasing from Wall Street \nfirms.\n  I also believe we need to consider a real tax credit for home buyers \nto jump-start the housing market. This has been an effective tool in \nthe past, and it can be an effective tool again. We have too much \nsupply and too little demand. Getting the liquidity that will be \ninjected into the credit markets to work its way through the entire \neconomy will take time. I think we need not only a supply of liquidity \nbut an increasing demand, particularly in the housing market.\n  Second, we must be vigilant on behalf of taxpayers, putting in place \nsafeguards so the Treasury is maximizing the value of the assets \npurchased with taxpayer dollars.\n  We need to have the flexibility to ensure we are not just subsidizing \ninvestors and executives, but we should tie this debt relief to strong \nrecapitalization requirements and greater accountability.\n  I also want to be sure that companies do not take undue advantage of \nthis program and sell securities to the Treasury with one stroke of the \npen and claim a deduction for the losses on those assets--in essence, \ndouble dipping, dumping their bad assets on taxpayers and getting a tax \nbreak as well.\n\n  I am proposing we build on a very creative provision in the bill \nbefore us and establish an e-TRUST program. That will stand for \nTransparent Rules Used to Safeguard Taxpayers. In the bill there is a \nprovision that transactions be put on the Internet. I wish to ensure \nthat the assets bought and sold by the Treasury Department are reported \nonline in real time so any American can log on and see how their tax \ndollars are being spent. All assets bought and sold must be available \non a publicly accessible Web site that discloses the buyers, sellers, \nand values of these assets. The American people are buying these \nsecurities, and so the American people must have easy access to their \nportfolio.\n  It is also important to the American people to understand that lying \nbehind these complex transactions with all kinds of long names that you \nread in the newspaper--collateralized debt obligations and credit \ndefault swaps and all the other words that are used to in some way \nexplain the complex financial transactions that brought us to this \nplace--are real assets. There are real homes owned by real people on \nreal land in real communities across America.\n  So we want to know how those securities that stand in for these real \nassets are being traded, bought and sold, and we want to be sure we \nrealize for the taxpayer the benefits of these transactions.\n  Third, I think there is general agreement we must pursue a broader \nreform. That is one of the lessons of this turmoil. I know Chairman \nDodd and others will be holding hearings to try to untangle how we got \nto where we are. We know we have to rein in executive compensation by \ngiving shareholders a greater role in and eliminating loopholes that \nallow boards to conceal the value of salary packages. We have to end \nthe quarter-by-quarter mentality in which long term prosperity is \nsubverted by short-term stock valuations. Obviously, we have to end the \nculture of recklessness in our financial markets endorsed by an \nideology of indifference in Washington.\n  If the American people invest in these companies, I think we should \nask the companies to invest in the American people. I think we should \nconsider requiring financial institutions participating in this \nTreasury plan to create an American priorities fund, to be part of \ntheir portfolio, to invest in clean energy, infrastructure, mass \ntransit, manufacturing, education and other public goods and goals that \nwould be well served by greater private investment.\n  Along with the rescue package will be a number of tax credits that \nwill be passed by the Senate tonight. Again, Chairman Baucus has done \nyeoman's work getting these tax credits put together. The Senate \nsupported them before. In it is a fix for the alternative minimum tax \nand an energy production tax credit.\n  In fact, we will be stimulating the economy for Main Street while we \npass this rescue package for our credit markets. I think that is the \nright combination. But we need to do more. Instead of toxic securities \nthat nobody can understand, are so complex and lack all transparency \nand accountability, banks should be investing in clean energy \nfacilities in Buffalo or new auto manufacturing plants in Detroit to \nbuild more fuel-efficient cars.\n  We should be repairing our bridges, our roads, our tunnels. We should \nbe investing in high-speed rail and making sure Amtrak is not a second-\nclass railroad but competes with the best anywhere in the world.\n  I think the agenda before the Congress is a very important one for \nour country. We cannot continue to shuttle from crisis to crisis. This \nis a sink or swim moment for our country. We cannot merely catch our \nbreath. We must swim for the shores and we must do so together, not \nonly as a united Congress but as a united country. There is so much \nwork to be done in America, so many investments that make us richer and \nstronger and safer and smarter that will enable us to look in the eyes \nof our children and grandchildren and tell them we are leaving our \ncountry in as good, in fact, better shape than when we found it.\n  At this moment, we cannot say that. But I am absolutely sure, based \non the bipartisan cooperation we saw on this bill, in responding to a \nreal crisis, that we will see more of that in the months ahead.\n  Our new President will certainly demand it of us, but we should be \ndemanding it of ourselves and demonstrate to the American people that \nthe Congress will lead the way into a much more confident and \noptimistic future for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from New York. \nShe was eloquent and hit right on the exact theme. I think this is a \nsad moment in many ways but a moment we have to confront. As she so \naptly describes, it is our job now not just to deal with this crisis \nbut to put our country on a better footing. So I thank her for her \nmessage and her words today.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for 10 \nminutes, and at the conclusion of my remarks, the Senator from Montana \nbe recognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I further ask unanimous consent that when we get into the \ndebate and the time has been divided, the Republican Members have 10 \nminutes to speak on the matter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, I wish to recognize and acknowledge \nthe Senator from Connecticut, the chairman of the Banking Committee, \nfor the tremendous work he has done over the past few days to bring \nthis piece of legislation to this point.\n  This is an emergency. This is a crisis. Those terms are often \noverused. In this instance, they are not being overused. We know the \nfinancial markets are under extreme duress. We have seen some of our \nlargest and most significant financial institutions fail or be \nreorganized in the last few weeks.\n  We also know, regrettably, that the credit markets are basically \nlocked up and that credit on Main Street is disappearing, that people \nare not able to get financing for the payrolls, financing for \ninventory, financing to buy a car, send children to school, rebuild the \nlocal hospital, rebuild the local school system. This is not a virtual \nevent, it is not an event of theory, this is a real event of very \nsevere economic consequences.\n  Action has to be taken. The chairman of the committee, working under\n\n[[Page S10217]]\n\na bipartisan, bicameral format with the Secretary of Treasury, has come \nup with this proposal to try to address this issue. Is this the answer \nto the entire problem? Obviously not.\n  The way I describe this is we have a patient who has suffered a \nsevere wound and is bleeding profusely. We are going to try to put a \ntourniquet on that patient so we can stabilize their condition, get \nthem to the hospital, and hopefully take other action which will cure \nthem and get them back on their feet, specifically get the economy back \non its feet, make sure Americans are able to go to work and enjoy a \nprosperous lifestyle.\n  This proposal, as it came from the Treasury, was simple, with a \npurpose of basically going forward with a significant amount of \ntaxpayers' dollars, $700 billion, taking those dollars and buying \ninvestments. That is an important point to remember, because there has \nbeen a lot of misrepresentation, regretably, demagoguery and hyperbole \nabout how we are throwing money at Wall Street. That is not the case.\n  What is happening is we will be purchasing assets, assets that have \nvalue. The Federal taxpayer will own those assets. Down the road, we \nwill probably sell those assets, and we will actually get money back in \nfor the taxpayer, into the Federal Treasury. We may actually break \neven, we may lose some money, but it is more likely, in my opinion, \nthat we will come close to breaking even, and we may actually, some \npeople tell us, make money for the taxpayer. But this is not $700 \nbillion out the window.\n  In doing this effort, we are going to free up credit, credit on Main \nStreet, that makes it possible for people on Main Street to do what \nthey usually do. America runs on readily available, reasonable, \naffordable credit. Every American has credit on something: their credit \ncard, their home, their car, their kids going to school, the little \ncompany they work for, if they work for a mom and pop, and even a \nmiddle-sized company probably has credit to make their payroll, \nprobably has credit to buy the inventory. All this is necessary in \norder to keep the economy going. Yet today we are seeing it dry up and \nwe are seeing it freeze up.\n  We are going to try to relieve that pressure so Main Street can \noperate as it should. In addition to what the Treasury Secretary felt \nhe needed to free up that credit, we as a Congress felt we needed to do \nsome other things. We needed to protect the taxpayer, and we have done \nthat in this bill. Every dollar that comes into the Treasury as a \nresult of reselling these assets will go to reduce the Federal debt, it \nwill not go to create new programs, it will go to reduce the Federal \ndebt.\n  In addition, we wished to make sure nobody is going to game the \nsystem, nobody is going to make a lot of money on this at the expense \nof the taxpayer. So we have language in here that limits, and \neliminates in some instances, any sort of golden parachute, limits the \nsalaries of the heads, the CEOs of these major companies who may take \nadvantage of this, and basically eliminates, as a result of the efforts \nof the Senator from Montana and his good ideas, eliminates the tax \ndeductions for high-income individuals above a reasonable amount.\n\n  In addition, as a result of the leadership of the chairman of the \ncommittee, again, we focused a lot of attention on making sure we can \nkeep people in their homes. We do not want people foreclosed on, and \ninterestingly enough, as a result of the Federal Government buying \nthese assets, which we will be buying, which are mostly mortgages, \nmortgage-backed securities, which we will be buying at 20 or 30 percent \nbelow face value, we as a government are going to be in a position to \nreorganize the mortgages of people who today cannot meet their payments \nbecause they bought a subprime mortgage and, as a result, they could \nnot make the mortgage payments when the mortgage reset.\n  We are going to be able to adjust those mortgages. If a person lives \nin their property as a personal residence, and if they have a \nreasonable income, hopefully, we will be able to structure it so they \ncan stay in that property today, something they most likely would not \nbe able to do if the economy played out in the present scenario.\n  So we are going to keep people in their homes and protect their \nopportunity to participate in a reasonable mortgage; at the same time, \nmaybe make money for the taxpayer, because once those mortgages start \nto perform again, they become more valuable, and we can resell them \ninto the market.\n  Fourthly, we address the issue of oversight. We create massive \ntransparency so everybody is going to know what is happening. As was \nmentioned earlier by the Senator from New York, things will be going up \non the Internet, so people know what is happening, plus we have \nsignificant oversight. We have a board headed by the Federal Reserve \nChairman to oversee the Treasury Secretary; we have a board for the \nCongress to oversee the Treasury Secretary. We have a new inspector \ngeneral just for this issue, a new GAO initiative just for this issue.\n  There will be significant oversight so taxpayer dollars are watched \ncarefully so we know proper actions are being taken. We heard from our \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives that they had concerns in \nthe area of give us an option of an insurance program. So as the \nnegotiations went forward, we put in the option of an insurance \nprogram.\n  We heard from colleagues on the Democratic side: Make sure the \ntaxpayers have an option, so if we do not recover all the money we put \nin, if there is some shortfall, there is an ability to go back to these \nfinancial institutions 4 or 5 years from now, when they are a little \nstronger, and get a payment to cover that shortfall. That option is in \nthere.\n  Then, in addition, we have expanded the FDIC coverage with this bill \nso people can have confidence in the money they are putting in their \nsavings accounts, in their checking accounts, in banks, is going to be \nsafe, and they do not have to move it around and maintain these \nartificial caps in their accounts. So that step is forward.\n  This is a plan that addresses the needs of the Main Street America \nthrough freeing up credit, but it also does it with a lot of efforts to \nprotect the taxpayer, protect the mortgagee, have the proper oversight, \nand do it in a way that is constructive and, hopefully, returns revenue \nto the Treasury rather than cost the Treasury revenue.\n  Is it the answer to the whole problem? No. Please do not assume that \nafter we pass this bill--and hopefully we will pass this bill--suddenly \nthe light is going to shine on the American economy. We are in for a \ndifficult economy for a considerable period of time. We know that. \nOther institutions will be under significant pressure. Regrettably, \nprobably some of these institutions will not survive this economic \nsituation.\n  But the option of not doing anything at this time is to virtually \nguarantee that we as economy will begin a very significant downturn of \ndisproportionate impact on people on Main Street. People will lose \ntheir jobs, people will lose their savings, people will find that they \ncannot get the credit necessary to keep their businesses open or to \nfunction at a reasonable level.\n  There is no question that if we do not get the credit markets working \nagain, we will face a dramatic downturn of proportions which we have \nnot been seen in my lifetime in the United States of America and in our \neconomy\n  It is something we should not risk. We should not roll those dice. \nThis is a program which we can do. It may not cost taxpayers anything. \nBut if it does cost taxpayers something, it is not going to be a \ndramatic amount of money. We can do it with proper safeguards, as we \nhave. As a result, it is an action we should take as a Congress, as \nrepresentatives of our citizenry, in order to fulfill our obligation to \nmake sure that when you see an impending crisis you know is going to \nhave a huge adverse effect on the people you represent, you move on \nthat crisis, you take action, and you try to revolve it.\n  That is what this proposal does. It is not the answer to all the \nproblems we have in this economy, but without it, we are going to have \na much more severe and difficult time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Before yielding to Senator Baucus, I announce that I have a \nnumber of Senators who I ask consent be recognized for 5 minutes: \nSenators Baucus, Mikulski, Brown, Cantwell, Harkin, Conrad, Casey, Bill \nNelson, Reed, Durbin, Obama, Schumer, Boxer, Menendez, and Kerry.\n\n[[Page S10218]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I wonder \nif I could amend that to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Let's make it 12 minutes for my colleague from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Given the gravity of this legislation, that time was a \nlittle short.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. So amended. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, a cloud hangs over the American economy. \nIt is a cloud made up of thousands of failures, and it is casting a \nshadow over our country. This cloud of failure is so vast that we have \na hard time seeing where it starts and where it ends. This cloud is so \nthick, we cannot see all the dangers it hides. We cannot tell even if \nthere is light right on the other side. And this cloud is moving fast. \nIt is speedier and stormier than most of us have seen in our lifetimes. \nThis cloud over the American economy contains the failures of people \nwhom we trusted to make this country prosper. It holds the failures of \nmany national institutions, their failure to be prudent, to be honest. \nThis cloud is made up of the failures of the private and public \ninstitutions that are supposed to safeguard our financial security. \nInstead, they let it slip away.\n  Americans are frustrated by the negligence that let this cloud of \neconomic crisis take shape. This week, many Americans were angry that \nthe Government seemed at first to want to shelter Wall Street from the \nrain but not America's working families. I share Americans' concerns. I \nshare Americans' frustrations. I share their anger.\n  I am pleased today because the Senate has heard America's voice. The \nbill the Senate will consider today improves the Treasury Department's \noriginal plan. We made it better. We made this bill work better for \nworking families who are already weathering financial storms and who \nnow face more rainy days because of Wall Street's greed.\n  The collapse of the financial markets does not sound like Main \nStreet's problem. Most Americans are too busy making ends meet to \nfigure out how frozen credit markets and a shortage of commercial paper \naffect their lives.\n  To most Americans, banks not lending to other banks sounds like a \nbank problem, not their problem. But these haywire markets are \neveryone's problem, and here is why.\n  If a bank cannot get credit, neither can its customers. Its customers \nare the local hardware store, the car dealership down the street. Its \ncustomers are college-bound young people and the new neighbor who just \nbought the house next door. These good people rely on their bank to pay \ntheir invoices and make payroll on time. The funds they depend on are \nalso now beginning to dry up. For example, a Montana businessman called \nme this week. His company has an $11 million outstanding loan, a 3-year \nloan. He uses it to keep his business stocked with inventory. The bank \nhas called that loan in. That 3-year loan is now being called in. He \nmust pay it off, according to the bank, in the next 90 days--not 3 \nyears, 90 days. The crisis is coming home for him now, that is for \nsure, and that threatens other good people.\n  If the hardware store and the car dealership lose business, pretty \nsoon employees and suppliers get hurt. If a neighbor cannot get a \nmortgage, painters, movers, and handymen will have one less paying job. \nThe young person who cannot afford college without a loan and the lady \nhoping to rent out her basement apartment or the guy who sells school \nbooks might come up a bit short. This financial crisis is closer to \nhome than we realize. It affects Americans who earn an honest living, \nfollow the rules, and work hard.\n  Honest Americans about to get hit harder by the financial storm are \nthe reason I worked to improve this plan. Working families are the \nreason I insisted on tax relief for struggling homeowners who can't pay \nthe mortgage and can't afford a tax hit when their indebtedness is \nforgiven. Working families are the reason I insisted on help for \nhometown banks in Montana and elsewhere that suffered when stock prices \nfell because of Wall Street's greed--not their fault at all, not the \nbankers, the Main Street bankers in our States. Working families are \nthe reason we all insisted on finding a way to get back much of the \nmoney spent on this plan.\n  The Treasury will buy assets with the money it spends. Later, the \nTreasury can sell those assets or hold them to maturity. In either \ncase, there is a good chance the Treasury will get back some or all of \nthese dollars. When I say the Treasury, those are taxpayers' dollars. \nThis bill, therefore, gives American taxpayers a stake in the companies \nthey are helping and a share in their future profits. The American \ntaxpayer's pocket should be the last place companies look for a \nbailout, but when these companies do ask for help, the American \ntaxpayer should be the first to benefit when the firms get back on \ntheir feet. This bill makes sure of that.\n  Americans taxpayers are the reason I insisted on cutting paychecks \nand closing golden parachutes of Wall Street executives. In just the \npast 5 years, the five biggest Wall Street firms paid more than $3 \nbillion to their top executives--5 years, five biggest firms, $3 \nbillion to their top executives. That is not right. It is not right for \nexecutives to get more big paychecks while their companies are getting \nassistance from the Government. If companies ask for taxpayer help on \nthe one hand, they can't give out big executive bonuses with the other. \nThis bill limits compensation to executives with golden parachutes.\n  The Treasury will have to issue guidelines on cutting executive \ncompensation. The Treasury Secretary will have to say: You can't play \nif you are going to overpay. These provisions are helpful, but we have \na lot more in this legislation, even more guidance given to the \nTreasury Secretary on executive compensation.\n  I also developed some provisions to cut tax breaks companies get for \nexecutive pay and to make sure executives pay tax on more of their \nincome than they do today. I don't want Main Street to subsidize \nseverance pay on Wall Street.\n  For taxpayers' sake, I also wrote a provision creating a special \nwatchdog to track and protect taxpayer dollars. I said that American \nresources must be used wisely and efficiently. This bill includes my \nproposal to create an independent inspector general to oversee this \neffort, this effort and nothing else, solely designed for this problem. \nI designed the office of this inspector general to be truly \nindependent, with the necessary resources to fight for every taxpayer \ndollar. I designed this inspector general to be accountable only to \nCongress and to the American taxpayer. It will be my personal mission \nto make sure this watchdog does his or her job. I want this inspector \ngeneral on the ground in New York inside the firms that facilitate \nTreasury auctions, watching every dollar that comes and goes. This \ninvestigator will hear from the Finance Committee as we work to protect \nthe American people's interests in this effort.\n  Finally, America's working families are the reason I am so glad this \nbill now includes tax relief. Last night, Senators Reid and McConnell \nannounced that this bill would include Senate-passed legislation--that \nis, earlier passed--that will create and extend tax incentives for \nrenewable energy to protect 20 million Americans from paying what is \ncalled the alternative minimum tax and also extend a number of vital \nexpiring tax credits for businesses and families. This is the right \ncall. Adding this tax relief will ensure that regular working Americans \nget financial help in this time of crisis.\n\n  As soon as this legislation passes, good-paying jobs will open in \ngreen energy, as wind and solar projects get up and running. Twenty \nmillion Americans who can't afford a higher tax bill are protected from \nthe alternative minimum tax. Families will get a break on college \ntuition, classroom expenses, and State and local sales taxes, and \ncompanies will get tax relief to do research and development, to grow, \nto offer even more good-paying jobs. Adding tax relief that creates \njobs, supports families, and secures a new energy future for the \ncountry makes this bill a lot fairer for hard-working Americans.\n  A ``yes'' vote on the financial rescue plan is now a vote to rescue \nAmerica's working families from this financial crisis with the right \ntax relief at just the right time. It is now time to act.\n  As a Senator, I was disturbed by this administration's attempt to \nrush\n\n[[Page S10219]]\n\nthrough a bill for business. But as an American, I am disgusted also by \nthe negligence and greed that got us into this mess. But at this time \nof crisis, we must not let our anger paralyze us. So many have failed \nto act responsibly. We must do better. We here in the Senate cannot \nfail. Failure to act would make today's economic cloud even bigger and \nmore dangerous. Failure to act could unleash the lightning bolts of \nrecession and the downpour of unemployment. Failure to act could turn \nthis cloud into a storm that tears through our entire economy.\n  The plan in front of us is not perfect. I wish we did a lot more \nhere. I wish we did not have to be where we are. I know many Americans \ndo not want it. But this is the best way to quickly disperse this \neconomic cloud and guard against a bigger storm. Like it or not, we \nmust have a plan big enough to counter our economic woes in a \nsystematic, comprehensive way.\n  I will vote for this legislation because America is under a cloud, \nand we cannot linger here. Congress must make sure this crisis does not \nget worse. With the addition of significant tax relief to this \nlegislation, Congress can actually lift the cloud a bit. Tax relief \nwill make things a little better for Americans feeling financial hurt.\n  With this vote, Congress must also promise the American people that \nthis will never happen again. The lesson of the cloud must lead us to \nbuild a strong financial framework that will not falter again. The \nlesson of the cloud must lead us to seek a brighter future for every \nAmerican family that helps us to weather this storm.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Will the Chair please notify me when 7 minutes has \nexpired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I stand before you today and perhaps \nlater on this evening to cast what is without question the most \nchallenging vote and the most important vote I have been asked to cast \nin 30 years as an elected official. I will vote in favor of the \neconomic stabilization bill because it does precisely one thing that we \ncan do to help unlock the credit markets and help the average working \nGeorgian, the average Georgia retiree, the average Georgia child who is \nlooking to the future, to benefit from what right now is a very \ndifficult situation.\n  I commend Senator Dodd for his leadership and Senator Gregg for his \nleadership. They have expended countless dollars in terms of political \ncapital and countless hours to come up with a solution that works.\n  There are so many misunderstandings in the public about what this is \nand what this isn't. So just for the few minutes I have, I wish to talk \nabout the core of it, why it is so important, why it makes sense, and \nwhy in the end we as a country will not only benefit but, more likely \nthan not, we will profit from the investment our Treasury makes.\n  The core of this is the $700 billion authorization to buy mortgage-\nbacked securities that are on the books of banks, savings and loans, \ninsurance companies, and other entities in the United States.\n  The first misconception is that the money is going to Wall Street. \nWall Street is not being bailed out. Everybody has forgotten that \nLehman Brothers went broke. Merrill Lynch sold itself for 30 cents on \nthe dollar. Bear Stearns sold itself or merged for 10 cents on the \ndollar. And AIG is paying the taxpayer 8.5 points over LIBOR to borrow \n$84 billion to dissolve itself. Those are no bailouts. This money goes \nto those who purchase the securities that were underwritten by Moody's \nand Standard & Poor's as investment grade and hold them on their \nbalance sheets as an asset which is now valued virtually at zero.\n  As the Treasury comes in and Secretary Paulson buys these securities, \nhe will make a market in these securities. Once he makes a market, \nthere will be attraction of other investors to jump in for a very good \nreason. I don't know what price they will establish, but say it is 50 \ncents, 60 cents or 70 cents on the dollar. A lot of people don't \nrealize that most of these securities, though some of them are in \ntrouble, are not in trouble to the extent of 20, 30, or 40 percent.\n  By way of example, the worst foreclosure rate in the United States is \nthe State of Nevada--19 percent. If you had a mortgage-backed security \nthat was 100 percent mortgages in the State of Nevada, then, with a 19-\npercent foreclosure rate, if those foreclosures sold for nothing at \nsale, then that bond would be worth 81 cents on the dollar at maturity. \nIf somebody paid 50, 60, or 70 percent for it, they would have an 11-, \n21-, or 31-percent margin in that security. The power to hold it to its \nmaturity and the power to buy the security and make a market is what \nmakes this a genius proposal from the standpoint of getting to the \nheart of the American problem.\n\n  Then what it does is it establishes three things. One, it establishes \na floor. I want to go back to what Senator Gregg said a few minutes \nago. Inaction on the part of the Congress this week on this plan will \ncontinue a downward spiral that will accelerate, will deepen, and will \ntouch the life of every American citizen, and it will touch it and harm \nit for a long period of time.\n  If we are able to pass it, and quickly go to the marketplace and \nestablish the market for these securities, we create a foundation from \nwhich, over time, we can grow out of this. Americans' credit will be \nback again, albeit much tighter than it has been before. And it should \nbe because we should have learned the lessons from some of the excesses \nof lending operations before. But credit will return.\n  What will happen is people will continue to have their jobs. What \nwill happen is people who need to sell a house will now see that people \nare coming back into the marketplace so they can sell it. All in all, \nby loosening what is now a clogged credit system at mainstream banks \nand savings and loans all over the United States of America, we will \nreturn a sense of normality to the American economy. The failure of the \nCongress to do that will establish a continued downward spiral that \nwill be a disastrous for the individual average American in whatever \nState they live.\n  So for me this is a difficult vote because you never want to find \nyourself in this situation. But tonight is not a night to say no to the \nfuture of the American people. Tonight is not a night to say no, we do \nnot have a responsibility to help. Tonight is not a night to try to \nfind some philosophical way to figure out how somebody else ought to do \nit.\n  It is on the shoulders of the Congress of the United States of \nAmerica. The people affected are our citizens, the people who have \nvoted for us and sent us here. It is absolutely critical we unclog the \nfinancial markets, free up credit to the average American and, over \ntime, restore the American economy to what it has been and always will \nbe: the best entrepreneurial capitalistic system in the world. But \nfailure can sign an end to that very reputation this country so loves \nand so deserves.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I believe I am part of the Democratic \nqueue. Therefore, I seek recognition to discuss the so-called rescue \nplan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Well, Madam President, I am here to talk about this \nrescue plan. Regrettably, a rescue plan is needed because I am afraid \nif we do not act today and we do not act with resolve, our economy \ncould come to a crashing halt. I am afraid of massive layoffs. I am \nafraid of small businesses folding. I am worried that retirement and \npension funds could shrink. Therefore, I will vote for this bill, but \nknow that, like the taxpayers, who I know are angry and mad as hell, so \nam I. We all agree that greed on Wall Street and lax regulatory \npractices of this administration got us into this mess. Taxpayers who \nplayed by the rules are asking tough questions. What are their \nquestions?\n  Barbara, what did you do to prevent us from getting into this? What \nare you going to do to make sure it does not happen again? And what are \nyou going to do to make sure that heads roll?\n  Well, let me tell you this: Heart and soul, I am a regulator and a \nreformer. Time and time again, we have seen the consequences of a lax \nregulatory culture and very wimpy enforcement. Time and time again, I \nvoted for more teeth and better regulation. I voted for\n\n[[Page S10220]]\n\nregulation and more teeth in the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \nget lead paint out of toys and the lead out of the bureaucracy. I voted \nto strengthen FDA regulation to make sure it did not approve dangerous \ndrugs. I also worked to stop predatory lending and flipping in the \nmortgage market.\n  I remember way back in 1999 how all this banking mess got started. \nPhil Gramm, a Senator from Texas, and Bliley, a House Member, advocated \nsomething called the banking deregulation bill. It passed, and it got \nus into this mess because it got rid of the distinction between \ninvestment banks and commercial banks, and lowered the bar on \nregulation. It allowed for casino economics.\n  During that debate, and that vote, I was one of nine Senators who \nvoted against it because I said with what we were doing we were going \nto create an environment where we were creating whales and sharks, and \nthe minnows would be eaten alive. Well, regrettably, my prediction \nproved right. During that debate, I was told: Get with it, Barb. We are \nin a global market. You are kind of old-fashioned.\n  You bet I am old-fashioned. I believe in old-fashioned values called \nhonesty, integrity, putting the public good above private interests. \nWall Street went around acting as if they were masters of the universe. \nNow they have taken us into a black hole in our economy.\n  We need to get back to basics, whether it is regulating toxic \nsecurities or tainted dog food. Our leader, Senator Dodd of \nConnecticut, has done a masterful job in improving this bill.\n  But while we are looking at reform and regulation and rescue, there \nare those who also say: Are there going to be any heads that roll? \nWell, you bet. What we are doing here is for those who said ``let the \ngood times roll,'' we are making sure we are bringing in the FBI so \nthat heads roll.\n  I went to work when I smelled this crisis coming in January and at an \nAppropriations hearing said to Director Mueller of the FBI: What is \nhappening in terms of mortgage fraud? He said: Senator Mikulski, we now \nhave over 2,000 investigations going on. It has now tripled in number. \nI said: Do you need money?\n  He did not want to answer because OMB, the Bush administration, did \nnot want to say they did. But working on a bipartisan basis, we added \nseveral million dollars to hire more FBI agents. And right this minute, \nthey are investigating mortgage fraud, predatory practices, deceptive \nmarketing, lending schemes, and so on.\n  So Senator Mikulski, while voting for reform, also made sure she has \nthe FBI coming in against the scam artists who also helped get us into \nthis mess.\n  So, yes, I have supported reform. Yes, I have supported going after \nthe real crooks and the bad guys. Because not everybody in the mortgage \nmarket or in mortgage securities or in our financial matters is a \ncrook. But we have to restore confidence. The way we will restore \nconfidence is to vote for this rescue plan. It will deal with the \ncredit crisis. If we do not deal with the credit crisis, I believe that \nMain Street economies will pay the bill, we will have to pay the bill \nfor the bailout, and we will pay the bill once again in lost jobs, the \nability to get a loan, and also with shrinking retirements and \npensions. So, Madam President, I will vote for this bill. But I have \nheard the taxpayers loudly and clearly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, once again, I thank my colleague from \nMaryland. We have served together a long time here over the years, and \nher passion, her eloquence are consistent in that same voice I heard \nseveral decades ago as a new Member of the House of Representatives. \nShe has never retreated from those values. Once again, I heard them \nagain today.\n  She is absolutely right, in my view, and I will speak at some length \nwhy this legislation is necessary, but also, as importantly, that the \nsteps be taken so we never see America face another day such as this \none again. So I thank my colleague from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10220-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ORDER OF PROCEDURE--H.R. 1424\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to H.R. 1424, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1424) to amend section 712 of the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, section 2705 of the \n     Public Health Service Act, section 9812 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 to require equity in the provision of \n     mental health and substance-related disorder benefits under \n     group health plans, to prohibit discrimination on the basis \n     of genetic information with respect to health insurance and \n     employment, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, as to that last unanimous consent \nagreement, let me translate that into English. Sometimes these \nunanimous consent agreements get a little confusing. What we are going \nto try to do over the remaining 3\\1/2\\ hours or so is to divide the \ntime equally. The minority side has agreed to limit their Members to 10 \nminutes each. I have not made a similar request here, but I will at \nsome point if Members are not understanding of the desire of everyone \nto be heard--or almost everyone--on this matter.\n  At a point in the next few minutes, I will share some remarks that \nwill explain how this bill has arrived to the point that it has and why \nI think it is important we support this effort this evening.\n  Again, I am very grateful. I will have some comments to make about \nJudd Gregg, my colleague from New Hampshire. Certainly, Max Baucus, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, has been an incredible ally and \nsupporter over these last 2 weeks trying to fashion something that \nwould give us a sense of confidence about emerging from this economic \ncrisis. But I will reserve some comments in a few minutes about all \nthat.\n  I see my colleague from Tennessee, who I would like the Record to \nreflect, while he is, I think, the most junior member on the minority \nside in the Banking Committee, his contribution should never be \ncalibrated by the seat in which he sits in terms of seniority. I want \nmy colleagues to know while Bob Corker has not been a longtime Member \nof this body, his contribution is that of a very senior Member of this \nbody. It has been invaluable.\n  He is knowledgeable, thoughtful, pragmatic, and made wonderful and \ncomprehensive suggestions to the product we have before us today. I \nwant my colleagues to recognize that. So I thank Senator Corker of \nTennessee for being a very good Senator in a moment such as this, which \nis a sad day, as I said earlier, but a day which we must address.\n  So with that, let me yield the floor for Senator Corker to make some \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I say to the Senator: Mr. Chairman, I \nthank you very much for those comments. I want to tell you, I have been \nin the Senate now for about a year and 9 months, and the way the Senate \nhas responded over the last 10 days I am very proud of, and I thank you \nfor your leadership on the Banking Committee.\n  I think the negotiations that took place right after the, quote, \nPaulson plan came forth have created a vehicle that will be successful.\n\n[[Page S10221]]\n\n  I know your leadership was there, with your demeanor in dealing with \npeople on both sides of the aisle, in making sure all good ideas were \nheard, but then, at the same time, shepherding forth a bill we can vote \non tonight--one that is steeped with taxpayer protections, steeped with \noversight, and gives the citizens of our country what they need to \nensure they are protected.\n  I know, as you mentioned, all of us are angry at the situation. I \nknow each of us hears the phone ring in our front offices and knows the \nnumber of people across the country who are upset we, as a country, are \nwhere we are. But, I say to the Senator, what you have done, Mr. \nChairman, and what those who have worked with you at the table and \npeople throughout this Senate have done, is to put aside blame, not let \nthe anger cloud our judgment.\n  Certainly, there are things we want to deal with when we come back in \nJanuary to ensure this does not happen again. But I think what you have \ndone and what Kent and others in this body today have done, sitting at \nthe table and in meetings and building support, was to let cooler heads \nprevail.\n  Let me say to you, thank you for letting me serve with you. I want to \nthank everybody in the Senate for the way everyone has responded to \nthis critical situation.\n  We can spend a lot of time talking about how we got here, and I know \nthere are colleagues who are bringing out old news articles about \ncertain things that were said years ago to try to sort of express, if \nyou will, their frustration. But, obviously, the matter before us is to \nsolve this problem, to make sure we deal with it in a way that is \nappropriate to the American people.\n\n  I have been on the phone this week with bankers across our State. I \nwas just on the phone with businesses across our State. Many of them \nare already dealing with this credit crisis. Many of them are very \naware of how this can overwhelm the citizens of our State. Obviously, \nour care in pursuing this rescue package is to make sure that those \nhard-working people all across this country who wake up every day and \ndo the things they are supposed to do--save for retirement, save for \ntheir children's education--are not tremendously adversely affected by \nexcesses that have occurred in our financial systems.\n  A lot of people are having difficulty sort of comprehending, if you \nwill, what has happened with our financial institutions. We have had a \nlot of discussions about technical issues, regarding the derivatives \nand regarding toxic assets and those kinds of things. But we have an \nadage in Tennessee talking about our farming community, our agriculture \ncommunity that has to do with something called being land poor. In \nother words, people have assets, but those assets are not usable, if \nyou will, to pay the monthly mortgage and to pay other kinds of things. \nRight now our financial institutions have assets on their books they \ncannot transfer. They cannot create liquidity. This is seizing up, if \nyou will, the credit markets throughout our country. There is a lack of \ntrust that exists between our financial institutions. My fear is if we \ndon't do something prudent and drastic at this moment in time, again, \nthose very hard-working people across our States will be very adversely \naffected.\n  Look, there are a lot of ways we can deal with this problem. There \nare a lot of ideas about how we place equity back into our financial \nmarkets. They all end up at the same place, and that is we have to \ncreate a cure, if you will, for the lack of liquidity, having those \nfrozen assets on the books of these financial institutions.\n  I believe if the Treasury Secretary and those around him who are \nproperly overseeing this carry out their responsibilities in an \nappropriate manner, with any degree of prudence--and I believe they \nwill with the oversight measures we have built in--this is something \nwhere the taxpayers will not only get their money back but should, in \nfact, get a return. As all of us know, all of this money is coming back \ninto the Federal Treasury to be spent to reduce our Federal deficit.\n  So let me say tonight, to me, is critical. It is something that is an \nunpleasant task because the general public sees this as something, in \nsome cases, other than what it is, and that is something that is \ndirectly helping the people across our country. I think there is a \nreason for their anger. I, too, share that anger. But at the end of the \nday, this is something I believe needs to pass.\n  Upon passage, the next step that needs to occur is that the Treasury \nSecretary and all of those working with him need to put in place a very \nprudent, a very transparent process so that all of us can see the value \nof these assets that are being bought in real time. So tonight's vote \nis very important.\n  The next phase is also very important as it relates to making sure \nthis vast amount of money we are talking about actually comes back into \nour Treasury.\n  Then there is a third component we all need to be committed to, and \nthat is when we come back in January, we need to work together, as we \nhave during this crisis, to be sure this never happens again. I know \nthe chairman of our Banking Committee and all of us have been stunned \nat the fact that financial institutions could own hundreds of billions \nof dollars of assets outside the knowledge of regulators.\n  So tonight, to me, this vote in this body is the first step in a \nthree-step process; that is, immediately giving the Treasury Secretary \nthe ability to deal with this crisis in a way that is prudent, that \ngets our banking systems back in more of an orderly process, ensuring \nthat payroll checks are cashed, that home mortgages are obtainable, and \nthat student loans are obtainable. The second step is staying involved \nin ensuring that the Treasury Secretary implements prudent policies in \nmaking sure the taxpayer money comes back. And the third step is making \nsure we reform this process so these types of excesses never happen \nagain.\n  Let me say in closing on that topic, I started out very skeptical. \nWhen we began talking to Secretary Paulson in our banking hearing, I \nwas skeptical of his three-page bill. I think this body, working with \nthe House, has exercised the right amount of due diligence and \noversight. I think we have a bill tonight we can be proud of. There \nwill be human mistakes made down the road. But we have a bill in place \nwe can be proud of. I urge my colleagues to strongly support this \nlegislation to help our country avert what I believe will be one of the \ngreatest fiscal crises, financial crises, we will have dealt with as a \ncountry in modern times.\n  I wish to thank Chairman Dodd for his leadership in this crisis, and \nhis steady hand, which I believe with all my heart is going to make \nthis country stronger.\n  Madam President, if I could have 2 minutes with unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business, I would appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Tribute to Senators\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, there are a number of distinguished \nSenators who are leaving this body this year. I know there have been a \nnumber of tributes given to all of them and their service. Senator \nWarner is a very distinguished Senator whom I have known, it seems from \nafar, almost all of my life. I have watched him with great admiration, \nand I have watched him lead us on the Armed Services Committee. Chuck \nHagel, who exercises this tremendous independence, somebody with whom I \nhave really enjoyed serving on Foreign Relations; Wayne Allard from \nColorado who is honoring a two-term pledge to leave this body after two \nterms to go back to the people of Colorado, he has been distinguished \nin his service on the Banking Committee; Larry Craig of Idaho who, \nagain, in the energy area, has offered great counsel and made sure that \nwise decisions were made in that particular committee--I honor all of \nthem. I wish them well. I think we are all better having had the \nopportunity to serve with them.\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  There is one particular Senator with whom I have spent more time than \nthe others just because of committee assignments, and that is Pete \nDomenici. Pete is the ranking member on our Energy Committee. I have \nloved listening to his many insights. He has with him Frank and Scott \nwho, hopefully, will stay with us and who, together as a group, I think \nhave offered wise counsel to all of us on that committee.\n\n[[Page S10222]]\n\n  There is something about Pete, though. His kindness and his \nencouragement to me as a person have been most unique. As Chairman Dodd \nmentioned earlier, I am one of the most junior Members here, but Pete \nhas constantly encouraged me to step out, to make my positions known, \nto go ahead and forget the fact that I am positioned where I am here in \nthe Senate and to take on a leadership role where it is important for \nme to do so. There is a special place in my heart for people such as \nPete Domenici who encourage all of us to step out and to try to \nexercise our full potential. I will miss him greatly. I know he loves \nthis body. I know that in many ways he will be lost as he leaves this \nbody. But I want to assure him today that as he leaves, this is one \nSenator he has encouraged, he has caused to be a better person, and \nPete Domenici will always be a part of the Senate service I offer in \nthis body. So I wish him well. I wish the others well.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee. \nAgain, I appreciate his tremendous efforts that have brought us to this \nmoment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5685\n\n  I have an amendment at the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5685.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes to describe \nthis amendment to my colleagues at this hour. I wish to talk as well \nabout some of my colleagues who have helped us get to this point.\n  There is a crisis in our country. That has been said so many times \nnow. I hope the impact of that statement is not being lost because of \nthe repetition of it. We need to address it swiftly and forcefully. \nThat is why we are here today.\n  Normally, when you talk about bringing up a bill, there is a certain \namount of joy involved in putting something together that you think is \nproactively going to make a difference. In this case, we are coming \ntogether around a proposal and a bill that is in response to a \nsituation that has angered millions of Americans and angers most of us \nhere to be in this situation but also heightens the sense of \nresponsibility that requires us to act. Therefore, we will spend the \nnext few hours sharing with each other, as well as with the American \npeople, why we are in this situation, to some degree, but clearly what \nour response is to it and our hopes that this proposal will make the \ndifference that many Americans expect.\n  If Americans doubt we are living in perilous times in our Nation's \nhistory, they need to look no further than at what is happening in the \nfinancial markets over the last few days. Clearly, this is no ordinary \ntime, no normal economic downturn. This is a day unlike other days. \nThis crisis, and the choice it demands, is unlike few we have ever seen \nbefore, even those who have served in this Chamber for several decades. \nThis Chamber may not be full, but millions, in time, will hear the \nwords we speak, and millions will feel the vote we cast around 7 p.m. \nthis evening. In the end, once the reputations we stake, for good and \nill, have long since gone to dust; once this day has turned from flesh \nand blood to textbook page for a child who is not yet born; one of two \nthings will be said about us and how we acted on this heavy day. They \nwill say the Senate did what was right, or they will say the Senate \nwashed its hands of this problem and walked away.\n  If this bill could be written as starkly as that, the vote would be \nunanimous. But bills never are. They are full of jargon and verbiage \nand compromise, and as necessary as they are, they can crust over and \nobscure the essence of our choice. We read stories of foolish choices \nin our history books and from our safe distance, it is so easy to \nshout: Why didn't they know any better? But up close, in the flesh and \nblood of the moment, even on a day such as today, making the wrong \nchoice can be supremely easy.\n  Nearly eight decades ago, the men who sat in these chairs--and there \nwere only men in those days--were faced with a crisis not unlike the \none we face today. They faced a recession that threatened to turn much \nworse. They did what was easy. They lashed out at the world and threw \nup huge barriers to trade. They found someone to blame--not because it \nwas good economics but because it felt good. President Hoover signed \nthe 13 letters of his name with six gold pens and launched a trade war. \nThe world retaliated. Commerce shut down. And passing a bill that felt \ngood drove us deeper and deeper into depression.\n  This week, on both sides of the Capitol, I could imagine how pleasant \nit would feel to vote no. In that respect, those who stand on the other \nside of this issue will have a much happier week. What a rush of \naffirmation they will get as they stick a finger in the eye of the \nbankers and the tycoons whose greed brought us to this crisis. Believe \nme, I can sympathize.\n  But after the vote has been cast for pique and for spite, what then? \nAfter the rush of righteousness fades, what then? It has been said: \n``Let justice be done, though heavens fall.'' It is a noble thought, \nbut it is much easier to say when the heavens are in no danger of \nfalling on you. Who will they fall on? They will fall on the million or \nmore families who can lose their homes. They will fall on the mothers \nand fathers telling their children that the college loan isn't coming \nthrough and struggling to explain why. They will fall on workers laid \noff all over this country as credit dries up and as businesses fail to \nmake their payrolls and as they send their employees home with pink \nslips through no fault of their own.\n  We are one Nation, one economy, and one body. We can take a cut at \nWall Street, but Wall Street will not feel the worst of the pain--not \nby a long shot. The blood will not come from them. My colleagues know \nwho will feel the pain, who will be bled the most by this crisis: those \nwhose economic world is made up of credit cards and mortgage payments, \nnot hedge funds and credit default swaps. The men and women and \nfamilies we represent will feel the pain of a ``no'' vote.\n  The world will feel the pain, too, I might add, men and women and \nfamilies just like ours who don't speak our language, who are asleep on \nthe other side of the world as I speak these words right now but who \nare bound to us in a web of commerce more tightly than ever before in \nworld history. They are watching, too, I might add.\n  Today's Washington Post quotes a banker in Germany, a man who did \nnothing to cause this crisis but who will suffer from it as much as if \nhe did. And his faith in America, even now, even today, ought to \ninspire each and every one of us in this Chamber.\n\n  Let me quote him for you:\n\n       All I can say is that I simply cannot imagine that the \n     Americans will not come up with some sort of a solution. \n     Anything else is outside the realm of my imagination.\n\n  Outside the realm, Madam President, of his imagination that this \nSenate of ours will not solve this problem, in conjunction with the \nwork of the other body. He is speaking of a nation of doers, of fixers, \nof problem-solvers, of people with optimism and confidence in our \nfuture. We can be that Nation again. In fact, we must be.\n  Madam President, I love my job here in the Senate. I normally sit in \nthe seat right behind me here, my father's desk. I sit it in every day, \nhave for 28 years. I love that desk, love this Chamber, and today there \nis not a place I would rather be. I am sure my colleagues, each one of \nthem, have their own stories, 100 of them, of their love of this job \nand of this place and what it means to be a Senator. But how can we \npossibly weigh those hundred jobs, if you will, against the 600,000 or \nmore that have been lost in America just this year alone and the \nmillion more that could follow if we could save those jobs by giving up \nour own? How could we not? Who could come to this floor and say with a \nclean conscience: I will save my job but put hundreds of thousands of \njobs at risk all across this great country of ours. I don't believe a \nsingle Member of this body, regardless of party, would ever make that \ntrade. They would be willing to give up their job to save that of \nothers.\n\n[[Page S10223]]\n\n  As Edmund Burke said to his constituents centuries ago:\n\n       The legislator's ``unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, \n     his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, \n     to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not \n     derive from your pleasure; no, nor from your law and the \n     constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse \n     of which he is deeply answerable.''\n\n  I am answerable today, as are all of us in this Chamber, and I intend \nto answer correctly. I intend to answer yes, we ought to do this to get \nour country back on its feet again. That is the job of a Senator.\n  By now, it is well known how we arrived at this critical moment. \nYears of what Secretary Paulson himself has called bad lending \npractices went essentially unchecked by a regulatory system that was \nnot on the job. These bad lending practices have been primarily in the \narea of mortgage lending.\n  As we all know, culpability for these practices exists in every link \nof the lending chain, from mortgage brokers to lenders to the \ninvestment banks. Certainly there are many borrowers who acted \nirresponsibly. They should not be excused for the consequences of their \nactions but neither should those whose culpability was significant and \ncatastrophic in terms of their impact on mortgage lending and on the \ncredit markets.\n  Almost 2 years ago, the Senate Banking Committee held the first \ncongressional hearing of the new Congress on predatory lending. At that \nhearing, I and others of that committee, Democrats and Republicans, \nwarned of a coming wave of foreclosures that could devastate millions \nof homeowners and have a devastating impact on our economy. Some, \nunfortunately, scoffed at those predictions. Well, no one is scoffing \nanymore. Financial market turmoil is affecting families and businesses \nall across this country, and the contagion has spread beyond the shores \nof our own Nation.\n  A paper in my State, the Connecticut Post of Bridgeport, CT, reported \nthat, at Sacred Heart University, Julie Savino, dean of student \nfinancial assistance, is fielding calls from parents who never before \nsought financial aid. Laid off or without medical insurance or unable \nto secure a home equity line of credit, parents are suddenly on the \nhunt for alternative means to pay for their children's education. Some \nstudents have had to walk away from their educations all together, she \npoints out.\n  Reuters News Service reported that Kansas City cabinetmaker Anthony \nGallo had no debt 18 months ago. None. Now he is being forced to borrow \njust to make payroll.\n  Let me quote Mr. Gallo:\n\n       My line of credit has been cut to nothing. We are all \n     hurting and wondering what is going to happen. They have got \n     to do something to save the banks. They can't kill our \n     economy.\n\n  The fact is, the banking and financial system is an essential part of \nour Nation's economy. A halt in the flow of money threatens not only \nWall Street firms--which would not bring us here today--but endangers \nthe way of life for millions of Americans far beyond Lower Manhattan. \nRight now, banks are afraid and in some cases unable to lend money, \nmoney companies need to make payroll, money families need to pay \nmedical bills, money students need to pay for college, money small \nbusinesses need to stock their shelves with inventory, money a gas \nstation needs to supply its pumps with gas, and money investors provide \nto entrepreneurs to start new businesses and create new jobs. We know \nthat money isn't moving. That is what the credit crunch means.\n  Very few Americans have ever heard of something called the LIBOR, \nwhich stands for the London interbank offered rate. This is a rate \nbanks charge when they make loans to other banks. It is also the rate \nthat is used to calculate the cost of home loans, student loans, auto \nloans, and small businesses. Yesterday, LIBOR jumped over 400 percent \nin just 1 day.\n  In many ways, this is the canary in the coal mine, if you will. It is \na sign of the strains that are threatening the essential flow of credit \nto the people of our country and, indeed, the industrial world.\n  Another canary in the coal mine is the rate on Treasury bills. \nSeveral days ago, fearful investors rushed into safe Treasury \nsecurities, sending yields on Treasurys into negative territory for the \nfirst time in at least half a century. When people see that the money \nthey have placed in banks and money market funds is earning negative \ninterest, they may feel compelled to pull their money out of such \nfinancial institutions. This could result in even further erosion of \nthe supply of money in our economy.\n  Our economy is on a precipice--and that is not an exaggeration, that \nis not hyperbole--and we must do what we can to move it back from that \nbrink. The legislation before us and the amendment I have offered, this \ncomprehensive amendment before the Senate today, represents an effort \nto do just that.\n  Just 10 days ago, the administration--if I may just remind my \ncolleagues, this is the bill, I hold it in my hands, three pages long--\nthe administration sent to us a bill that called for $700 billion to go \nout without any questions asked, without any oversight, any \naccountability, or any taxpayer protection. Three pages. I might point \nout, as I said to some, a no-documentation loan for $100,000 to a \nsubprime borrower a few years ago was four pages long. Here is a \nrequest for $700 billion that is three pages long. And my colleagues on \nboth sides here said no to that, we are not going to do that.\n  As a result, over these last 2 weeks, we have put together a piece of \nlegislation that gives us much more heightened protection about how \nthis program would work. There are a lot of people who deserve \ntremendous credit, but I thank my colleagues for rejecting this offer \nof three pages for $700 billion in return for drafting a comprehensive \nbill that I believe will provide the kind of security people \nare looking for with a plan of this magnitude. I refused, along with my \ncolleagues, to provide a blank check on this not just for this \nadministration--I would do it with any administration, and my \ncolleagues did as well. This crisis demanded we bring together Members \nof the House of Representatives, the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, \nand hammer out a better solution for the American people.\n\n  Our leader, Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, deserves \nincredible credit for his determination to stick with it and not walk \naway and demand each and every day, when things began to fall apart, \nthat we stay and work at it. He was joined by the minority leader, \nSenator McConnell, equally committed, I would point out, to the same \nefforts, as well as a number of others who played significant roles.\n  Judd Gregg of New Hampshire I have been talking about and spending a \nlot of time with over these last 2 weeks, working out this particular \nbill that we brought together, and I thank him for his efforts.\n  Jack Reed of Rhode Island was the principal author of the warrants in \nthis bill, to make sure the American taxpayer comes first. If these \ninstruments turn out to be more profitable and they actually are sold \nand we make our money back, the people who will get the benefit of that \nfirst are the American taxpayers, and Jack Reed demanded that.\n  Pat Leahy looked at the provision of this original proposal which \nsuggested that no court of law, no agency could ever question how this \n$700 billion was going to be used, and the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee said that passage will not last and struck it and offered new \nlanguage that provides judicial protection in this bill.\n  I have mentioned Bob Corker already, Senator Corker of Tennessee, who \nwas valuable over the last 2 weeks, and Mel Martinez and Chuck Hagel.\n  My colleague from New York, Chuck Schumer, who is knowledgeable about \nthis subject matter and who represents the State of New York--I can't \nbegin to describe how valuable Chuck Schumer has been in this process. \nFrom the very beginning, there hasn't been a meeting that has occurred \nor a discussion held where he hasn't played an invaluable role in \nseeing to it that we stayed with it.\n  Dick Durbin, the majority whip, and Bob Bennett of Utah--again, the \nranking Republican on the Banking Committee historically has played a \nvery important role on so many issues during his tenure here and again \nwas tremendously helpful.\n  Max Baucus, whom I have mentioned--chairman of the Finance \nCommittee--played a critical role as we fashioned this together.\n\n[[Page S10224]]\n\n  My dear friend and colleague, Kent Conrad, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, was incredible in his determination that this package be \nfiscally sound, that we have provisions that would guarantee our debt \nwould be retired as part of the effort here when resources are sold and \nthe profits are gained. So I thank my friend. He is here, in fact, on \nthe floor. My colleague has been a tremendous help in all of this, \nMadam President.\n  I want to also mention, from the other body, Barney Frank of \nMassachusetts, my counterpart on the House Financial Services \nCommittee, was, again, tireless over the last couple of weeks in this \neffort, and Congressman Roy Blunt, Speaker Pelosi, Representative \nBoehner as well, and Rahm Emanuel.\n  There are so many people, and I want to be careful, but clearly this \nwas a huge effort. I wish in many ways that the American people could \nhave been a witness to these gatherings that went on day after day. I \nthink they would have been proud of their Congress at a time when \nCongress's reputation is not great. I think they would have been proud \nto see the effort that was being made, not where people were running to \na political corner wearing a Republican or Democratic hat but coming \ntogether as Senators and Congressmen, along with those from the \nTreasury Department, to make a difference. All of these Members of \nCongress undertook the enormous and in many respects thankless but \nnevertheless vital task of crafting this proposal which we offer to our \ncolleagues this afternoon--the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of \n2008.\n  This legislation would address, we hope, our Nation's economic \nemergency in three key ways: economic stabilization, taxpayer \nprotection, and home ownership preservation.\n  This bill gives the Treasury Secretary the authority to respond \nquickly, forcibly, but responsibly to the current crisis. It authorizes \nhim to buy a total of $700 billion in troubled assets, broken down into \nthree separate tranches, with the final tranche subject to \ncongressional review and approval.\n  Madam President, $700 billion is a staggering amount of money. We all \nunderstand and share the anger of the American people that they are \nbeing asked to commit that sum. But in a $14 trillion economy, this is \nthe kind of financial firepower that must be brought to bear to contain \nthe financial crisis.\n  Secondly, in consideration of the extraordinary burden this bill \npotentially places on the taxpayer, we maximize, to the extent \npossible, protections of the taxpayer.\n  The bill establishes an oversight board to review and shape the \npolicies of the Treasury Department in carrying out this program. \nUnlike the original Treasury proposal, this bill subjects the actions \nof the Treasury Secretary to strong judicial review that would prohibit \nactions that are arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise unlawful. It \nplaces firm limits on executive compensation to help ensure that \ncorporate executives whose companies receive taxpayer benefits do not \nwalk away with golden parachutes and are not otherwise rewarded for \nwrongdoing.\n  We require taxpayers to receive warrants so that they can benefit \nwhen a company benefits from taxpayer assistance. In addition, we \nrequire that any profits generated from the sale of these assets \npurchased with public funds go to reducing our national debt.\n  We provide for extensive reports so that Members of Congress and the \npublic at large will know how every dime of this program is being used. \nWithin 48 hours of any transaction, the Treasury Secretary will have to \nreport the amount, the terms, and the participants associated with that \ntransaction. The General Accounting Office will have immediate and \nongoing audit authority and report to Congress every 60 days. A special \ninspector general will be established to monitor and police the \nprogram's activities and its participants.\n  The third priority advanced by this legislation is home ownership. \nThis is not an ancillary objective; it is inherent, in my view, to our \nefforts to resolve this economic crisis.\n  Chairman Bernanke himself has spoken forcefully on this point. Our \neconomy will recover only when we put an end to the spiral of \nforeclosures that are pulling down our entire financial system. To that \nend, the legislation requires that all Federal agencies that own or \ncontrol mortgages or mortgage-backed securities preserve home \nownership. In addition, the legislation expands eligibility for the \nHOPE for Homeowners program, which allows lenders and borrowers to \naccess Federal mortgage insurance in order to put homeowners on a path \nto security, not financial ruin.\n\n  This is not an easy vote. There will be no balloons or bunting or \nparades for Members at the end of this process, only the knowledge that \nat one of our Nation's moments of maximum economic peril we acted, not \nfor the benefit of a particular few but for all Americans so that they \nand those who come after them may enjoy the full blessings of life in \nthis great Nation of ours.\n  We are a nation of optimism and confidence. Americans deserve to have \nthat restored. Our job tonight will give them a chance to do that. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, it is tremendously ironic that we are \nhere today. It is ironic in the sense that as we ignore what the \nConstitution tells us, we embrace defeat, difficulty, and peril.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of \narticle I, section 8 of the Constitution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Section. 8. \\1\\ The Congress shall have Power To lay and \n     collect taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts \n     and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of the \n     United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be \n     uniform throughout the United States;\n       \\2\\ To borrow money on the credit of the United States;\n       \\3\\ To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among \n     the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;\n       \\4\\ To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and \n     uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the \n     United States;\n       \\5\\ To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of \n     foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;\n       \\6\\ To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the \n     Securities and current Coin of the United States;\n       \\7\\ To establish Post Offices and post Roads;\n       \\8\\ To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by \n     securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the \n     exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;\n       \\9\\ To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court;\n       \\10\\ To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed \n     on the high Seas, and Offenses against the Law of Nations;\n       \\11\\ To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal \n     and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water;\n       \\12\\ To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of \n     Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years;\n       \\13\\ To provide and maintain a Navy;\n       \\14\\ To make Rules for the Government and Regulation on the \n     land and naval Forces;\n       \\15\\ To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute \n     the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel \n     Invasions;\n       \\16\\ To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining \n     the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be \n     employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to \n     the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and \n     the Authority of training the Militia according to the \n     discipline prescribed by Congress;\n       \\17\\ To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases \n     whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles \n     square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the \n     acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of \n     the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all \n     Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the \n     State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, \n     Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful \n     Buildings;--And\n       \\18\\ To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper \n     for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all \n     other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of \n     the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I also ask unanimous consent that the 10th amendment to \nthe Constitution be printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited\n\n[[Page S10225]]\n\n     by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, \n     or to the people.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. For those of you who are not familiar with those two \nportions of our Constitution, they are very clear. Article I, section 8 \nis the enumerated powers that are given to Congress. They are very \nspecific. They are very direct. It tells us what we are to be dealing \nwith and what we are not to be dealing with. It tells us the extent to \nwhich the Federal Government is to intervene in the lives of Americans.\n  The 10th amendment, on the other hand, says that whatever is not \nincluded, specifically listed right here in the enumerated powers, is \ntotally and absolutely reserved for the rights of the States.\n  As a practicing physician, I compare where we are today to a \nphysician who commits malpractice. We have a patient with cancer. They \nhave a secondary pneumonia because of the cancer. We are going to treat \nthe pneumonia. We are going to give the antibiotics, we are going to \ngive something to lower the temperature, we are going to give something \nto suppress the cough, we are going to give something to thin the \nmucous, but we are not going to fix the cancer. We are going to ignore \nthe cancer.\n  Let me tell you what the cancer is. The cancer is Congresses that, \nfor years upon years, have totally ignored the Constitution of the \nUnited States and taken us to areas where we have no business being. \nThere is no way you can justify, in the U.S. Constitution, that the \ncountry ought to be the source of mortgages for homeowners in this \ncountry. Yet Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac control 70 percent of the \nmortgages in this country.\n  I plan on voting for this bill. I support that we have to do \nsomething now. But how we got here is very important if we are going to \nfix things in the future. The fact is that, at the same time we are \ndebating this very important issue, we have on the floor another \nviolation of the enumerated powers, which is the Amtrak and Metro \nearmark fiasco. It is going to be very interesting to see the Members \nof this body as they vote to bail out the financial institutions in \nthis country while at the same time they continue to commit the same \nerror that got us there in the first place. There is no question Amtrak \nis going to get reauthorized. The American people are going to spend \n$2.3 billion subsidizing the riders on Amtrak in this country.\n  In 2006 we subsidized food on Amtrak to $100 billion--I think it is \ndown to $70 million now--despite an explicit provision within the \nAmtrak bill that says they will never sell anything for less than its \ncost and they were to lose no money on food.\n  Where is the answer? The answer is there has been no oversight to \nmake sure Amtrak doesn't lose money on food. We have ignored it. We \nhave ignored the enumerated powers of the Constitution. We are now \ncommitting the same Federal error in a much smaller way on Amtrak as we \ndid on housing. If anybody in America is mad about this situation, \nthere is only one place they need to direct their anger and it is right \nin the Congress of the United States.\n  It is not specific Members, it is bad habits. We are not going to cut \nout the cancer. We are not going to give the radiation therapy. What we \nare going to do is we are going to continue to treat the symptoms \nrather than directly go after the cause that has created the greatest \nfinancial risk and peril this country has ever seen. We are not going \nafter the cause.\n  The cause is get back within the bounds of the Constitution that very \nspecifically says where we have business working and where we do not. \nBecause we are out of those bounds, we have now put at risk every job \nin this country, the savings and retirement of people who worked for \nyears, because we decided we would ignore the wisdom of our Founders \nand create systems that are outside the enumerated powers that were \ngiven to us because we know better.\n  We do not know better. It is obvious. There is no administration to \nblame. It is not the Clinton administration or the Bush \nadministration's fault we are in this mess. Because if you say that, \nwhat you have to say is you did all the oversight, you had all the \nhearings, you knew what was going on and you didn't do anything about \nit. So either we didn't know or we did know and did nothing about it.\n  There is only one place to come to hold accountability and it is in \nthis body. You are going to get to see tonight people continue to vote \noutside the bounds of the Constitution, as we reauthorize $2.3 billion \nof subsidies for Amtrak, and we do not hold Amtrak accountable. We are \ngoing to give $1.5 billion and the mother of all earmarks to Virginia \nand Maryland for a Metro system that the Federal employees use more \nthan anybody, and we are subsidizing an additional $100 million through \nindividual agencies to pay them to ride it. And we wonder why we have \nthese problems.\n  It is very simple. We are committing malpractice. We are not living \nup to the oath we undertook when we became Members of this body. That \noath says you will defend and uphold the Constitution. It doesn't say \nyou will rewrite it because it pleases you politically. We are here \ntoday because of fatal errors on the part of Members of this body to do \nsomething that is totally outside the bounds of the wisdom and \nforesight our Founders gave us.\n\n  Those are tough words. But we are in tough times. If we do not get \nabout withdrawing and getting back within the realms of the power \ngranted to us, this is just the first in a very large roll of problems \nthis country is going to face.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me describe for a moment the problems that are coming \nif we get past this one. Here are the problems that are coming. We are \non an unsustainable course. The unfunded liabilities for Medicare alone \nare $100 trillion. A child born today in this country faces $400,000 \nfor taxes for things they will never get a benefit from--$400,000. Who \nin this country starting out even could absorb that debt, pay the \ninterest on it, and ever hope to own a home or have a college \neducation? Yet this body continues to spend more, authorize more, and \ncreate bigger and more intrusive Government, limiting the power of the \ngreat American experiment to, in fact, supply an increased standard of \nliving.\n  We are in tough times, but they are going to get tougher until the \nAmerican people hold this body accountable to live within the rules set \nout in a very wise, a very providential way that served this country \nwell. We ignore this book, this Constitution, at our peril. We are \nreaping exactly what we have sown.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I want to recognize the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could I ask for an additional 5?\n  Madam President, first I thank Chairman Dodd for his extraordinary \nleadership. Let me say to every Member, we are fortunate to have Chris \nDodd at this critical position at this important time. He has conducted \nhimself as a superb professional. Thank you, Chairman Dodd, for the \nleadership you have provided for the country, and to the rest of the \nnegotiating team from the Senate, Senator Gregg, who did such a strong \njob of leadership in those negotiations, Senator Schumer, Senator \nBaucus, Senator Jack Reed--all of whom made major contributions; \ncertainly our own leader Harry Reid, who insisted that we stay at it \nuntil the job was done.\n  Colleagues and countrymen, this is a defining moment. History is \nbeing written. Our economy is threatened. We all understand that at the \nheart of this matter is a housing crisis compounded by a fiscal crisis \ncompounded by an energy crisis, all of them closing in on the country \nat this moment. The home foreclosure rate is the highest level ever. We \nhave seen the stock market decline by more than 22 percent since its \npeak last October, with the most recent plunge, the day before \nyesterday, the Dow falling 777 points in 1 day. We all know that.\n  Even more important is what is happening in the credit markets. \n``Credit Enters a Lock Down, and Wheels of Commerce Freeze Up.''\n\n[[Page S10226]]\n\n  But in this story from the New York Times of September 26 are these \ntwo paragraphs:\n\n       With the economy already suffering the strains of plunging \n     housing prices, growing joblessness, and the newfound \n     austerity of debt-saturated consumers, many experts fear the \n     fraying of the financial system could pin the nation in \n     distress for years.\n       Without a mechanism to shed the bad loans on their books, \n     financial institutions may continue to hoard their dollars \n     and starve the economy of capital. Americans would be \n     deprived of financing to buy houses, send children to college \n     and start businesses. That would slow economic activity \n     further, souring more loans, and making banks tighter still. \n     In short, a downward spiral.\n\n  We can see the beginnings of precisely that dynamic in the credit \nmarkets. This, the spread between the 3-month rates on LIBOR and \nTreasury bills, is a measure of the risks banks see in lending to each \nother. It has shot up to record levels in these last 72 hours. That \nmeans credit is being choked up. That means credit is being locked up. \nThat means the economy is being locked down. What is the result of all \nthis? We have already seen major financial institution after \ninstitution fail: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Bear Stearns, Lehman \nBrothers, Washington Mutual--the largest savings and loan association \nin America--AIG--the largest insurance company in the world--Wachovia, \nMerrill Lynch and, overseas, FORTIS and four other major financial \ninstitutions, just over the weekend.\n  Colleagues, we can connect the dots. Something dramatic and serious \nis occurring.\n  The Chairman of our own Federal Reserve said this to us: If we fail \nto act, unemployment could rise to 8 or 9 percent in the next 6 months. \nWhat would that mean? That would mean between 3 and 4\\1/2\\ million more \nAmericans would lose their jobs in the next 6 months. Colleagues, let's \nfocus on this point. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve is telling us, \nabsent our action, 3 to 4\\1/2\\ million more of our countrymen could \nlose their jobs in the next 6 months.\n  The truth is, none of us knows if this package will be enough--but it \nis a beginning. It is a solid beginning. It is a bipartisan beginning. \nWe may need to do more, but much has already been done.\n  Let's look at the package that was sent us. The administration sent \nus a package with no equity stake for taxpayers. That meant no upside \nfor taxpayers. Seven hundred billion dollars was provided in a lump \nsum. All the power in the hands of one person, the Secretary of the \nTreasury, and no limits on executive compensation or golden parachutes.\n  In the negotiations from Thursday until now, we have dramatically \nchanged this package. Taxpayers will now receive an equity stake, so \nthey have a potential profit when markets recover. Funding is now to be \nreleased in three installments, not just one lump sum, allowing for \nadditional congressional oversight.\n  An oversight board will now be created to ensure that the Treasury \nactions protect taxpayers and are in the Nation's economic interests. \nAnd now, no golden parachutes will be allowed, and executive \ncompensation will be capped.\n  In addition, FDIC insurance is now raised from $100,000 per account \nto $250,000 an account.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, this is a defining moment. All of us \nunderstand the anger of our constituents and our own anger. I must say, \nas I have been part of this effort over this last week, my own anger \nlevel has risen as I have heard descriptions of the extraordinary \nrisky, reckless behavior of people all throughout the chain who have \nhelped create this crisis.\n  We will hold them to account. Already the FBI has launched four \ninvestigations. People will be criminally charged, I believe, before \nthis is over. Today, we have a decision to make. Do we support a \npackage to soften the blow, to try to prevent this downward spiral from \naccelerating and intensifying?\n  That is our challenge. That is our charge. This is our best chance. \nThis is our best chance. I ask my colleagues to support it. Again, we \nunderstand this is a tough vote. But our country needs us now. Our \ncountry is counting on us now. Let's not miss the chance to do \nsomething important for our Nation to prevent this crisis from \nintensifying.\n  I especially wish to thank the chairman of the Banking Committee who \nhas given his all to this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nbipartisan legislation we will vote on tonight, that will help to \nstabilize our financial markets, to prevent catastrophic consequences \nfor our entire economy.\n  Nobody is happy with the crisis we face, with the urgent pressure to \ntake decisive action or with the very limited policy options available \nto us at this point. I share the anger of many of my constituents over \nthis crisis, and I subscribe to the principles many of them invoke. As \nthe Senator has pointed out, the initial proposal the Treasury \nSecretary presented to us was deeply flawed. That is why I pushed for \nstrong taxpayer protections to be included in the plan. That is why I \ninsisted that any plan include limitations on excessive compensation \nand golden parachutes for executives of the Wall Street firms that \nhelped create the current crisis and that now seek Federal assistance.\n  Those controls and safeguards are part of the bipartisan package now \nbefore the Senate. That is why I advocated for strong oversight and \naccountability provisions rather than a blank check for the Secretary \nof the Treasury.\n  Those oversight and accountability protections, too, have been \nincluded in this package. I supported the proposal for a special \ninspector general to review the way this program will operate. But the \nfact is, unfortunately, we have to face the reality that the collapse \nof the housing bubble and the mortgages, the subprime mortgages and the \nexotic securities that floated along with them, do not just affect the \nexecutive suites on Wall Street. In fact, the ramifications cascade \nthroughout our economy, affecting the credit lines needed by small \nbusinesses to meet their payroll, the young couple seeking to buy their \nfirst home, the automobile dealer trying to finance his inventory, the \n55-year-old worker whose 401(k) plan lost a great deal of its value, \nand even our States and counties.\n  The State of Maine found itself unable to finance a routine $50 \nmillion transportation bond last week. How did we get here? Well, the \nculprits are many. They include the greedy Wall Street traders whose \nculture rewards risk taking and focuses on short-term problems.\n  They include unscrupulous mortgage brokers who pushed people into \nmortgages that were totally unsuitable for them. They include the naive \nor the deceptive borrower who simply did not understand or \nmisrepresented their ability to pay once their mortgage rate reset.\n  They include, at the heart of this scandal, the Government-backed \nmortgage finance companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that took on \nhuge amounts of risk with paltry levels of capital.\n  Sixteen years ago, some Members of Congress warned of the potential \nsystemic risks Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac presented. Officials in both \nthe Clinton and Bush administrations issued warnings and proposed \nreforms. In 2005, legislation that would have made a difference was \nactually considered by the Senate Banking Committee and proposed by \nRepublican members of that committee. The full House considered a bill \nthat would have helped, although, unfortunately, it rejected some \nstrengthening amendments.\n  Unfortunately, these reforms did not get enacted until this July, \nwhen the sheer pressure of the mortgage crisis finally forced Congress \nto act. This is a huge crisis. There are some $1 trillion worth of \nsubprime mortgages in the country. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae hold or \nguarantee more than 40 percent of America's mortgages and lately have \nbeen buying more than 80 percent of new mortgages because the private \nsector for the mortgage finance market has virtually disappeared.\n  As a former Maine financial securities and banking and insurance \nregulator, I understand this is a very complex problem. Its roots lie \nin the past\n\n[[Page S10227]]\n\ndecade of the real estate bubble, the relaxed lending standards, the \nexistence of this huge and exploding subprime mortgage market, the \ncreation of complicated securities tied to mortgages that were not held \nby the originators of those mortgages, and then the sale of those \nsecurities when their risks were poorly disclosed, not well understood, \nand lightly regulated, if at all.\n  The subprime mortgages were bundled together into mortgage-backed \nsecurities that were, in turn, linked to complicated financial \ninstruments that in some cases were not regulated at all. An example \nare the swaps we have heard discussed. The swaps are not securities so \nthat, as such, they were not regulated by the SEC. While they perform a \nfunction very similar to an insurance policy, they are not insurance in \nthe traditional sense, so they escaped regulation by State insurance \nregulators.\n  The lack of regulation set the stage for deep losses for countless \ninvestors and other entities that had entered into the swap contracts. \nBut frustrated and angry though we are, the focus of our attention must \nbe on averting the worsening storm of financial distress, and we must \nhave the much-improved bipartisan package to halt its spread and to \nmitigate its damage.\n  We have all seen the big headline events, the bank failures, the \nGovernment takeover of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the failures of Bear \nStearns and Lehman Brothers, the forced sales of Merrill-Lynch and \nWachovia. These are the big headline events, and they may seem detached \nfrom people's daily lives, but they are not. Millions of Americans are \nbeing reminded that the cost and supply of new mortgages, the value of \nour homes, the availability of student loans, the interest rates on our \ncredit cards, the short-term loans for business payrolls and supplies, \nthe value of our retirement savings, are all tightly connected to the \nglobal web of credit and finance.\n  Economists of every ideological leaning agree we face a catastrophic \ncrisis if we do not act. Monday's sudden drop in the stock market, the \ndisappearance of interbank lending, the flight from money market funds, \nall stand as indicators of trouble and signs of panic.\n  As the economists noted a few days ago:\n\n       The potential costs of producing nothing, or too little too \n     slowly, include a financial crisis and a deep recession \n     spilling across the world.\n\n  Time is short, and I am not referring to the time until adjournment. \nWe must act because the crisis will grow worse with delay and because \nthe Treasury does not have unlimited authority or resources to continue \ncase-by-case rescues.\n  The current compromise agreement includes principles for which I have \npushed, including strong protections for taxpayers so it is very \nunlikely that taxpayers will be on the hook for $700 billion. In fact, \nthere is a chance, with proper management of this program, that in some \ncases the taxpayers could actually make a profit. The bill now includes \nstrong protections, curbs on excessive executive compensation, \nincluding golden parachutes, and tough oversight and accountability.\n  We must act now. None of us wants to see the further devastating \nconsequences for our economy.\n  It also benefits from the addition of two new features. The first is \ntemporarily raising the deposit-insurance protection for bank and \ncredit-union customers from the current $100,000 per account per \ninstitution to $250,000. This is important to reassure consumers about \nthe safety of the banking system in a time of turmoil, and to provide \nadded protection for people who feel obliged to move assets to safe \nhavens.\n  The second added feature is making the tax-extenders package that was \noverwhelmingly approved by the Senate in September a part of this \nstabilization package. Providing additional tax relief for individuals \nand small businesses in a time of stress and rising prices is in itself \na step toward economic stability.\n  I am pleased to note that the tax provisions include energy-related \nmeasures such as new language on application of the wood-stove credit. \nWe are not only providing general tax relief, but also targeted \nmeasures that will encourage more use of renewable resources and reduce \nour dependence on imported oil, whose increased cost aggravates the \nother injuries from which our economy suffers.\n  This bipartisan financial-stabilization package, endorsed by our \ncongressional leadership and by both Presidential candidates, does not \neliminate the need to keep reasonable questions in mind. While \nexchanging Treasury funds for currently depressed or unmarketable \nmortgage-related assets would obviously be a powerful tool for freeing \nthe channels of credit and investment, many questions remain about how \nthe Government would ensure that mortgages and mortgage-backed \nsecurities are carefully appraised so that taxpayers do not overpay or, \nworse yet, stand liable for debts used to purchase currently \nunmarketable assets; that the purchased assets are carefully managed; \nand that taxpayers are adequately protected through such devices as \nwarrants or contingent equity interests in return for their financial \nexposure.\n  The bill before us now includes a provision that addresses those \nconcerns in a comprehensive fashion. It directs the President, 5 years \nafter the Troubled Asset Relief Program takes effect, to evaluate the \nultimate cost, if any, to taxpayers, and to propose a program for \nrecovering any shortfall from the financial industry. Considering that \ntaxpayers may actually make money on the resale of troubled assets \npurchased by the Treasury, this added level of protection seems to \ninsulate them from risk of losses.\n  The current upheaval in the financial markets certainly has created \ngreat strain on the lives of families throughout the country as well as \nour financial markets. And it threatens a terrible recession here and \naround the world. The bill before us is not perfect, but it reflects a \nconsensus on the shape of an effective intervention, and it provides \nrobust provisions for accountability and taxpayer protection.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this carefully crafted \nand urgently needed measure, and in my call for a thorough review of \nour financial regulatory system so that the current crisis does not \noccur again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Rhode Island \nbe recognized for 6 minutes, the Senator from Pennsylvania for 5 \nminutes, and then my colleague and friend from New York for 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, first let me commend Senator Dodd for his \nextraordinary leadership and also my colleagues Senators Conrad, \nBaucus, Gregg, Schumer, Corker, Bennett, and our colleagues in the \nHouse, particularly Barney Frank and Spencer Bachus. Last Thursday, \nunder the direction of Chairman Dodd, we worked on a bipartisan and \nbicameral basis and sketched out the outline of the bill we have today. \nWe reacted to the blank check presented to us by the Treasury \nSecretary. We provided detail. We provided oversight. We provided \nprotections for taxpayers. Now, this much-improved proposal has now \ncome to this floor for a vote. I hope we can support it.\n  We are in the midst of a terrible economic crisis. The American \npeople are justifiably outraged that they have been put in a position \nwhere they must essentially contribute $700 billion to stabilize our \nfinancial system and, indeed, the global financial system. They are \nalso outraged that this is the result of lax oversight over many years. \nIt is a result of indifference to the plight of homeowners and workers, \nbecause they have seen very little in terms of real, tangible support \nfrom this administration with respect to their problems and concerns, \nsuch as making a decent living, educating their children, and providing \nfor health care for their families.\n  But we have to act, and we have to act decisively. Because what is \nthreatened here is the welfare not just of a few but of all Americans. \nWhat is at stake is their financial welfare and their financial future.\n  It would be nice to say this proposal is a cure but, frankly, it is a \ntourniquet for a hemorrhaging economy. If we don't apply this \ntourniquet today, the chances of reviving the economy and restoring it \nare diminished dramatically. I believe we must act along the\n\n[[Page S10228]]\n\nlines outlined by Senator Dodd and our colleagues in the Senate and the \nHouse. If this problem were only restricted to Wall Street, this would \nbe a different bill. But every American feels the effect of this \nfinancial crisis, from the value of their pensions, their investments, \nand their overall wealth. It has spread beyond Wall Street and is \naffecting Main Street and the credit markets that are so central to \neverything we do. Auto sales are plummeting this month because credit \nis difficult to obtain. That means our car companies are facing an \nadditional hurdle in terms of keeping thousands of Americans employed \nin good jobs. The cost and availability of college loans will be \nimpacted if the credit crisis continues. The cost of small business \nexpansion will increase. There are homeowners who are rushing to \nclosings and discovering that the loan has been pulled because the \nbanks won't lend. Their affairs are in disarray. We have to act and we \nhave to act smartly.\n  What we have seen over the last several weeks and days is a \ndeterioration in the financial and credit markets, and we have to \ncounter that. The plan presented to us by the Secretary of the Treasury \nwas virtually a blank check: Give me $700 billion and I will take care \nof things.\n  We would not accept such a blank check. We insisted, first, that \nthere be an oversight mechanism so the Secretary's actions were not the \nonly actions in terms of sound policy moving forward. Then we insisted, \nat my suggestion and the suggestion of others, that we provide for an \nequity interest that the taxpayers would receive in those companies \nthat participate in this program. There would be an equity \nparticipation with warrants, so that taxpayers share in the recovery of \nthese companies, not just the shareholders and executives of these \ncompanies. That is not only fair, it is sensible. When you assume risk \non Wall Street, you get paid to do so. The American taxpayers deserve \ntheir share from the risk they are bearing. This is an improvement.\n  In addition, we addressed an issue that is critical to all \nhardworking Americans; that is, imposing restraints on excessive \ncompensation of some executives.\n  However, we have to do much more. In fact, as soon as we conclude \nthis debate, Chairman Dodd will organize hearings so that we can get on \nwith another fundamental responsibility--the restructuring of the \nregulatory framework for banking and finance. Part of that includes \nreviewing executive compensation and ensuring that shareholders have a \nsay in compensation decisions. That is just one aspect of an elaborate \nagenda of reform that has to be undertaken. To stop now and simply \nprovide support to the current crisis without a refinement and a \nrebalancing of our regulatory structure would be a terrible \nmiscalculation on our part. We have to move forward.\n  In addition to the efforts underway today, we have to renew our focus \nin providing an approach to regulation that is sensible, sound, and \ndoes not interfere with innovation and ingenuity, but does not result \nin the indifference and lack of oversight that is a large part of this \nproblem.\n  There are other aspects within this bill we need to address. First, \nthere is language with respect to mark-to-market accounting rules. What \nwe have done is affirmed the SEC's authority to enforce proper \naccounting practices. I hope, in response to this crisis, that we do \nnot abandon the principle of mark-to-market accounting rules. \nEssentially what some people are urging is that we cook the books \nbecause we have a huge problem. In other words, let's make it go away \nwith accounting techniques. That is how we got into this situation. To \nuse that approach is adding, in my view, insult to injury. I hope we \ncan maintain strong accounting standards and work our way through this \nproblem without sacrificing these standards.\n  There is something else we have to recognize. We have to do more to \nhelp Americans who are facing foreclosure. It is only through helping \nthe homeowners that we will we get to the bottom of the crisis.\n  I thank the chairman for his kindness and leadership on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, less than 2 weeks ago, the Treasury \nSecretary came to the American people with some bad news. He said he \nneeded Congress to help. And soon, after significant debate, Congress \nwill deliver.\n  The problem we face as a Nation is urgent and unprecedented. As a \nresult of lax lending practices earlier in the decade, millions of \nAmericans now find themselves either delinquent or unable to cover \ntheir mortgages.\n  If this were the only problem, we could address it individually by \nhelping those who were victims of fraud and letting those who made bad \njudgments or who lied on their loan applications pay for their \nmistakes.\n  But what began as a problem in the subprime mortgage market has now \nspread throughout the entire economy. And here is where the crisis hits \nhome.\n  After banks made these risky mortgages, they sold them. The \ninstitutions they sold them to then shopped them around the world. And \nnow these troubled assets are frozen on the balance sheets of the \nbusinesses that you and I rely on to buy everything from dishwashers to \nnew homes.\n  At the heart of the rescue plan is a need to lift these assets off \nthe books and to restore confidence in the institutions that hold them. \nThen, once the housing market stabilizes, we will sell them back.\n  Many economists, including those at the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office, predict that once the assets are sold off over the next \nfew years, the net loss to taxpayers could be negligible.\n  But for now, the practical problem we face is this: credit, the \nlifeblood of our economy, is frozen. And unless we act, it is expected \nto remain that way.\n  This means that the lives of ordinary American families could be \nseverely disrupted, commerce could dry up, and millions of jobs could \nbe lost.\n  The original White House proposal for addressing this crisis was \nunacceptable to Members on both sides in its initial form. But both \nparties have since made sure that the taxpayers are protected once a \nfinal deal is reached.\n  For my part, I came to the Senate floor and put down a firm marker: \nif Congress was going to help companies that got us into this mess, \nthen executives at these companies would play by our rules. I also said \nthat the Government wouldn't be allowed to use this plan as an excuse \nto fund new programs: No golden parachutes, limits on executive pay, \nand no favors for special interests.\n  Thanks to bipartisan insistence on all of these points, the plan that \nthe House voted on earlier this week included every single one of our \ninitial demands. And so does the plan that the Senate will vote on \ntonight.\n  This process hasn't been easy.\n  For the past week, Members of Congress and their staffs have worked \naround the clock to craft a rescue plan that is designed to protect \nAmerican families from the shockwaves of the credit crisis.\n  When that plan failed in the House, we picked up the pieces, and we \nput together an even better plan that we think will make it through the \nHouse, and onto the President's desk this week.\n  It is important that we act now, because the crisis is spreading.\n  Small business owners in Kentucky are writing urgent letters to my \noffice saying that their interest rates are already skyrocketing and \nputting their businesses--and employees' jobs--at risk.\n  A woman in central Kentucky wrote that she is afraid she will have to \nsell off part of her family's farm.\n  A retired school counselor wrote to say she can't afford to see her \nsmall retirement savings vanish.\n  A small business owner in La Grange told me he might not be able to \nmake payroll because, in just the past week, the interest rate on the \nloan he took out to finance his building more than tripled.\n  The current crisis may have its roots in the actions of a few. But \nits effects could potentially reach into every single home in Kentucky, \nand every other home in America.\n  This economic rescue plan is a necessary effort to protect the vast \nmajority of Americans--whose day-to-day lives depend on ready access to \ncredit--from the misdeeds of Wall Street. And at this point, doing \nnothing to prevent an economic collapse is no longer an option.\n  Here is what the second largest newspaper in America, the Wall Street\n\n[[Page S10229]]\n\nJournal, said about the rescue plan earlier this week: ``It deserves to \npass because in reality it is an attempt to shield middle America from \nfurther harm caused by the mistakes of Wall Street and Washington.'' \n``The current seizure in the credit markets is real,'' the Journal \nadded, ``and it will do far more harm if not repaired soon.''\n  For lawmakers, failing to pass this economic rescue plan would be \ngrossly irresponsible. The voters sent us to Washington to respond to \ncrises, not to ignore them. To that end, we have acted swiftly. And \nlawmakers from both political parties have worked hard to protect \ntaxpayers at the beginning and at the end of this plan.\n  Thanks to our insistence, this rescue plan will have strong Federal \noversight. Not only will there be a strong and diverse executive \noversight board watching every single transaction, but we will also \nhave the ability to investigate, pursue, and punish any executive who \nengages in fraud or who attempts to use this plan for personal \nenrichment.\n  If the Government is forced to take over the biggest companies, the \nfirst thing we will do is wipe out existing compensation packages for \nfailed executives. Then, we fire them.\n  For most other institutions we assist, failed executives will no \nlonger get million dollar payouts. And those who previously negotiated \nseverance packages will pay one fifth of them in taxes--on top of the \nstandard 30 to 40 percent tax currently in place. This means that \nexecutives at these firms will have to hand over more than half of \ntheir existing pay packages to the taxpayer.\n  Moreover, no executive who hasn't already worked out a compensation \npackage will be allowed to get one. At these companies, the days of \ngolden parachutes are over.\n  As another way of protecting taxpayers, Republicans insisted early on \nthat every dollar the government gets back as a result of this program \ngoes directly to reduce the Federal debt. This plan guarantees it. \nEvery dime we get back will be used to pay our debts.\n  Since Monday's House vote, we have made some significant improvements \nto the bill. In order to protect bank customers, Congress will allow \nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to insure deposits up to $250,000 \nfor 1 year, up from the current $100,000.\n  We also added significant tax relief for American families and \nbusinesses, including a temporary patch on the AMT middle class tax \nthat will protect millions of Americans--including 135,000 \nKentuckians--from an average $2,000 increase in their annual tax bill.\n  At the moment, this plan represents the best way to bring stability \nto the credit markets, avoid a credit meltdown, and put America on the \nroad to economic recovery. But Congress's job does not end there. After \ncompleting this bipartisan effort, Members of Congress must recommit \nourselves in strengthening America's long-term economic security.\n  We should refocus our attention on a balanced energy plan that \nenables us to find more American energy resources and use less, and by \nrefusing to spend money we do not have on programs that we do not need, \nthus laying a strong economic foundation for our children to inherit.\n  Soon, Senators will cast this historic vote. And when we do, the \nAmerican taxpayers should know this: This plan was written with their \nbest interests in mind. Not a dime will be spent without strict \noversight. Failed executives will be held accountable. No more golden \nparachutes. In the end, the American people can expect to recoup most, \nif not all, or even more of the money that is spent.\n\n  The legislation is not something any of us really wanted to consider. \nUnder ordinary circumstances, high-flying businessmen who make bad \ndecisions or abuse shareholder trust should be allowed to fail. But the \nsituation we find ourselves in is serious, it is urgent, and failing to \nact now would have devastating consequences for our Nation's economy. \nWe must contain the damage. The potential consequences of inaction for \nour Main Street economy are simply too great.\n  Madam President, I also wish to mention that as of earlier today, \nthere were--I have a list of 106 groups supporting the rescue package. \nI would mention two that I think are noteworthy: the AARP and the \nHeritage Foundation. That pretty well sums up the broad ideological \ndiversity, shall I say, of the organizations that support this rescue \npackage. I ask unanimous consent to have that list printed in the \nRecord at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Also, Madam President, I would say to my conservative \nfriends who had reservations about this, the National Review supports \nthis package. I mentioned that the Heritage Foundation supports the \npackage. With mixed levels of enthusiasm, the columnists Charles \nKrauthammer and George Will would support the package. Larry Kudlow, \nthe conservative commentator on CNBC, supports the package. Of course, \nthe Wall Street Journal supports the package. Even Newt Gingrich, an \nearly critic, said, when pressed a couple days ago, if he were here he \nwould vote for the package.\n  So, Madam President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Groups Supporting a Bi-Partisan Financial Rescue Package\n\n       1.

Madam President, thank you very much.\n  I rise today to talk for a few moments about the emergency economic \nstabilization bill.\n  First of all, I commend the work of a number of people here, but in \nparticular Chairman Dodd, who did not want this assignment, had a tough \nassignment to work with people in both parties in both Houses to get \nthis done. We have a lot more work to do after this, but I commend him \nfor his work and for his leadership under very difficult circumstances.\n  There are a lot of ways to describe the challenge we face in America \ntoday economically and many ways to describe what we have to get done, \nwhat we are going to vote on tonight. I think if you could boil it down \nto one word or a couple of words, it would be--one word would be \n``credit,'' or lack of credit. I think that is the basic problem. The \nfreezing or seizing up of credit markets is not some far-off economic \nconcept. That means small businesses in Pennsylvania and across the \ncountry cannot have access to credit to meet payroll and to hire people \nand to grow the economy. Probably half of our economy is small \nbusiness, if not more. It means that families, when they go to finance \nan education, higher education, or when they go to purchase an \nautomobile or something for their home, they cannot get access to \ncredit.\n  We live on credit, and thank God we have it. But that system we rely \nupon, that families rely upon, is put at risk now because of what has \nhappened lately. We can spend a lot of time figuring out why this \nhappened, and we should after the debate is over. But right now, we \nhave to act.\n  One headline does not tell the whole story, but it gave me a sense of \nwhat was going on. This is from USA Today on Monday, September 29. The \nheadline reads: ``Tight credit costs small-business owners.'' In one \nheadline, I think it encapsulated the challenge this problem is for our \neconomy.\n  I think I am seeing it not just in headlines and anecdotes about what \nis happening to people who own small businesses across the country; we \nare all seeing it, as well, in the unemployment rate, in the job loss \nacross America, which I would argue, as bad as it is now--and a lot of \nfamilies have been living in this recession. I don't care what the \neconomists say, when you are paying higher prices for gasoline and food \nand education and health care and everything in the life of a family \ngoes up, you are in a recession.\n  I think in the last couple of weeks we have seen a terrible downturn \nin the job market. In Pennsylvania, for example, between July and \nAugust of this year--and this does not even include September, where \nthe numbers will be a lot worse--just in 1 month, we lost 31,000 jobs \nin Pennsylvania. This is not just in Philadelphia, with a little more \nthan 21,000 jobs lost, or in Pittsburgh, with 7,700 jobs lost; I am \ntalking about smaller communities as well. In Johnstown, PA, a small \nlabor market on this list, they lost 500 jobs in 1 month. In Altoona, \nPA--again, right next door to Johnstown, a small market--500 jobs lost \nin 1 month. Again, none of this includes the month of September. So we \nare seeing it everywhere in our State. If small businesses cannot grow \nand cannot have access to credit, they are not going to create the jobs \nwe need.\n  One more statistic, and then I will wrap up. The Pennsylvania \nforeclosure rate in August 2007 versus August 2008 went up 60 percent. \nSo even in a State that has been relatively--relatively--free of some \nof the trauma that Nevada and California and Florida and some other \nStates have been hit with, even in Pennsylvania that foreclosure rate \nis going up at a rate much higher than the national average.\n  So what is this bill about? We have heard a lot about the description \nof it. I do not believe it is a bailout. We can debate what that means. \nI do not believe it is. I think it is a bill to stabilize our economy \nand our businesses and our families.\n  But there are a lot of taxpayer protections built into this \nlegislation that were not there when we started: taxpayer warrants, as \nSenator Jack Reed talked about today; reimbursements, so at the end of \nthe road 5 years from now, if taxpayers have not gotten what they \ndeserve, these companies that might benefit will have to reimburse; \nvery tough oversight, several levels of oversight.\n  We do not have time to go into all of them, but there is a special \ninspector general to crack down on what is happening when this program \nis implemented. There are limits on CEO and executive pay. It is the \nfirst time in American history that we have limited or put some \nrestrictions on that pay. There are foreclosure prevention strategies, \nan expansion of the HOPE for Homeowners.\n  This is good legislation which we are making even stronger.\n  Finally, what we have to do after this is over, as important as this \nlegislation is, is we have to get to work on regulation. We have to not \njust implement the right policies to regulate in a way we did not \nregulate before in America, but also, once those regulations are in \nplace, we need to have people in Washington who are willing to crack \nheads--figuratively, of course--on those who abuse the public trust, \nthose who abuse the rules and get people into mortgages, for example, \nthey cannot pay for.\n  Finally, we have to make sure, in the months ahead and the years \nahead, we invest in the long-term economy, invest in health care and \neducation, the skills of our workers, to build a strong economy not \njust for this year and next year but for the next generation.\n  But in the end, this legislation we are voting on tonight is about \ncredit. We are either going to do something about it and allow people \nto have access to credit or not. I think we have to act, and we have to \nact promptly.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, with Senator \nDeMint's permission, that he and I be switched in order in the \nunanimous consent roster.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, 12 days ago we were struck by two bolts almost out \nof the blue: the suggestion that our financial system was on the verge \nof collapse and a proposal under which unprecedented power, discretion, \nand taxpayer dollars would be given to the Federal Government \nessentially in the form of one person--the Treasury Secretary--to \nintervene in the market.\n  There have since been many amendments to this plan and much talk \nabout taxpayer protection--all of it well intended, thoughtful window \ndressing. So make no mistake, if Congress passes this bill, it will be \npassing, 12 days later, an unprecedented expansion of Government power \nand discretion along with $700 billion of hard-earned taxpayer funds.\n  After listening to many people I deeply respect, including thousands \nof hard-working Louisianians, I will--indeed, I must--vote no. I will \nnot vote\n\n[[Page S10231]]\n\nno because I do not think we face very serious economic challenges. We \ndo. Credit is drying up, and that presents a real threat to all \nAmericans. I will not vote no because I do not think the Federal \nGovernment needs to act. It does, as soon as responsible action is \npossible. I will vote no because we do not need to use $700 billion of \nhard-earned taxpayer money in this way, cross this line, set this \nprecedent.\n\n  We need to stabilize the market and increase liquidity, not replace \nthe market with unprecedented Government intervention at taxpayer risk \nand expense. We need to minimize the pain on average Americans who did \nnothing wrong, not wipe it away from politicians, lenders, and, yes, \nsome borrowers who did plenty wrong who were plenty reckless.\n  My fundamental concerns with this plan are only heightened by the \nfact that to implement it, tens of thousands of judgment calls will \nhave to be made as to what to buy and for how much. Those judgment \ncalls will be made by whom? Teams of new bureaucrats who came from Wall \nStreet and who want to go back there. That ensures bias and even \ncorruption.\n  My deep general unease is only fueled by the fact that there has been \nno real discussion of the fundamental, long-term reforms that are \nneeded--breaking up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, demanding real money \ndown for all home purchases, and establishing aggressive, progrowth tax \nand economic policy. What is worse, there has probably been no real \ndiscussion of this because neither this Congress nor the one about to \nbe elected will pass any of it.\n  A week ago, I may have voted in anger. Although that is still there, \nI act now with a profound sense of sadness and disappointment because \nthis unprecedented expansion of Government intervention at taxpayer \nexpense is the product of an appalling lack of political leadership--\nfirst, crying fire in a crowded movie theater, then demanding that the \nonly escape is to take dangerous action like tearing down the walls \nthough there are plenty of exit doors in sight.\n  I truly pray that much of what I have said is proven wrong. I will \ntry very hard to do just that myself, particularly in terms of the next \nstep, by working tirelessly to pass the fundamental reforms we need so \nthat a repeat of this mess--however much a repeat is actually \nencouraged by this bailout--never happens again. However we vote on \nthis first step, I hope we can come together on the next step in terms \nof meeting that challenge: passing the fundamental reforms we need. In \nthat spirit, I ask the leaders of this Congress to call this Congress \nback this year immediately following the election to do just that.\n  Now is the time to enact real solutions that grow our economy, \ndevelop small businesses, and increase opportunities for all Americans. \nNow is the time to reform the misguided Government policies that caused \nthis mess in the first place. And now is the time to stop knee-jerk \npolitical reactions and focus on real solutions to secure our Nation's \nfuture, not just for next week but for our next generation.\n  Madam President, I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, for how long would the Senator from \nIllinois like to be recognized?\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, 6, 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I am in control of the time. How much time?\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I yield the Senator from Illinois 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Thank you very much, Madam President. I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut not only for yielding time but \nalso for the extraordinarily hard work he has put in over the last \nseveral days and, in fact, over a week. And I want to thank his \ncounterparts on the other side, including Senator Gregg, for their hard \nwork.\n  The fact that we are even here voting on a plan to rescue our economy \nfrom the greed and irresponsibility of Wall Street and some in \nWashington is an outrage. It is an outrage to every American who works \nhard, pays their taxes, and is doing their best every day to make a \nbetter life for themselves and their families. Understandably, people \nare frustrated. They are angry that Wall Street's mistakes have put \ntheir tax dollars at risk, and they should be. I am frustrated and \nangry too.\n  But while there is plenty of blame to go around and many in \nWashington and Wall Street who deserve it, all of us--all of us--have a \nresponsibility to solve this crisis because it affects the financial \nwell-being of every single American. There will be time to punish those \nwho set this fire, but now is not the time to argue about how it got \nset, or whether the neighbor smoked in his bed or left the stove on. \nNow is the time for us to come together and to put out that fire.\n\n  When the House of Representatives failed to act on Monday, we saw the \nsingle largest decline in the stock market in two decades. Over $1 \ntrillion of wealth was lost by the time the markets closed. It wasn't \njust the wealth of a few CEOs or Wall Street executives; the 401(k)s \nand retirement accounts that millions count on for their family's \nfuture became smaller. The State pension funds of teachers and \ngovernment employees lost billions upon billions of dollars. Hard-\nworking Americans who invested their nest egg to watch it grow saw it \ndiminish and, in some cases, disappear.\n  But while that decline was devastating, the consequences of the \ncredit crisis that caused it will be even worse if we do not act now.\n  We are in a very dangerous situation where financial institutions \nacross this country are afraid to lend money. If all that meant was the \nfailure of a few banks in New York, that would be one thing. But that \nis not what it means. What it means is if we don't act, it will be \nharder for Americans to get a mortgage for their home or the loans they \nneed to buy a car or send their children to college. What it means is \nbusinesses will not be able to get the loans they need to open a new \nfactory or make payroll for their workers. If they can't make payroll \non Friday, then workers are laid off on Monday. If workers are laid off \non Monday, then they can't pay their bills or pay back their loans to \nsomebody else. It will go on and on and on, rippling through the entire \neconomy. Potentially, we could see thousands of businesses close; \nmillions of jobs could be lost, and a long and painful recession could \nfollow.\n  In other words, this is not just a Wall Street crisis, it is an \nAmerican crisis, and it is the American economy that needs this rescue \nplan. I understand completely why people would be skeptical when this \nPresident asked for a blank check to solve this problem. I was, too, as \nwas Senator Dodd and a whole bunch of us here. That is why, over a week \nago, I demanded that this plan include some specific proposals to \nprotect taxpayers--protections that the administration eventually \nagreed to, and thanks to the hard work of Senator Dodd and Republican \ncounterparts such as Senator Gregg, we in the Senate have agreed to, \nand now, hopefully, the House will agree to as well.\n  Let me go over those principles. No. 1, I said we needed an \nindependent board to provide oversight and accountability for how and \nwhere this money is spent at every step of the way. No. 2, I said we \ncannot help banks on Wall Street without helping the millions of \ninnocent homeowners who are struggling to stay in their homes. They \ndeserve a plan too. No. 3, I said I would not allow this plan to become \na welfare program for Wall Street executives whose greed and \nirresponsibility got us into this mess.\n  Finally, I said that if American taxpayers are financing this \nsolution, then they have to be treated like investors. They should get \nevery penny of their tax dollars back once the economy recovers.\n  This last part is important because it has been the most \nmisunderstood and poorly communicated part of this plan. This is not a \nplan to just hand over $700 billion of taxpayer money to a few banks. \nIf this is managed correctly--and that is an important ``if''--we will \nhopefully get most or all of our money back, and possibly even turn a \nprofit, on the Government's investment--every penny of which will go \ndirectly back to the American people. If we fall short, we will levy a \nfee on financial institutions so that they can repay us for the losses \nthey caused.\n\n[[Page S10232]]\n\n  Now, let's acknowledge, even with all these taxpayer protections, \nthis plan is not perfect. Democrats and Republicans in Congress have \nlegitimate concerns about it. Some of my closest colleagues--people I \nhave the greatest respect for--still have problems with it and may \nchoose to vote against this bill, and I think we can respectfully \ndisagree. I understand their frustrations. I also know many Americans \nshare their concerns. But it is clear, from my perspective, that this \nis what we need to do right now to prevent a crisis from turning into a \ncatastrophe.\n  It is conceivable, it is possible, that if we did nothing, everything \nwould turn out OK. There is a possibility that is true. And there is no \ndoubt there may be other plans out there that, had we had 2 or 3 or 6 \nmonths to develop, might be even more refined and might serve our \npurposes better. But we don't have that kind of time and we can't \nafford to take that risk that the economy of the United States of \nAmerica--and, as a consequence, the worldwide economy--could be plunged \ninto a very deep hole.\n  So to Democrats and Republicans who have opposed this plan, I say: \nStep up to the plate. Let's do what is right for the country at this \ntime because the time to act is now.\n  I know many Americans are wondering what happens next. Passing this \nbill can't be the end of our work to strengthen our economy; it must be \nthe beginning. Because one thing I think all of us who may end up \nsupporting this bill understand is that even if we get this in place, \nwe could still have enormous problems--and probably will have big \nproblems--in the economy over the next several months and potentially \nlonger. Because the fact is, we have had mismanagement of the \nfundamentals of the economy for a very long time, and we are not going \nto dig ourselves out of this hole immediately. So this is not the end; \nthis is the beginning.\n  As soon as we pass this rescue plan, we need to move aggressively \nwith the same sense of urgency to rescue families on Main Street who \nare struggling to pay their bills and keep their jobs. They have been \nin crisis a lot longer than Wall Street has. I have said it before and \nI say it again: We need to pass an economic stimulus package that will \nhelp ordinary Americans cope with rising food and gas prices, that can \nsave 1 million jobs by rebuilding our schools and roads and our \ninfrastructure, and help States and cities avoid budget cuts and tax \nincreases. A plan that would extend expiring unemployment benefits for \nthose Americans who lost their jobs and cannot find new ones. That is \nthe right thing to do at a time when consumer confidence is down and we \nare in great danger of slipping into a big recession.\n  We also must do more than this rescue package in order to help \nhomeowners stay in their homes. I will continue to advocate bankruptcy \nreforms. I know my colleague from Illinois, Dick Durbin, has been a \nstrong champion of this, as have many others. It is the right thing to \ndo, to change our bankruptcy laws so that people have a better chance \nof staying in their homes, and so we don't see communities devastated \nby foreclosures all across the country. We should encourage Treasury to \nstudy the option of buying individual mortgages as we did successfully \nin the 1930s. Finally, while we all hope this rescue package succeeds, \nwe should be prepared to take more vigorous actions in the months ahead \nto rebuild capital if necessary.\n  Just as families are planning for their future in tough times, \nWashington is going to have to do the same. Runaway spending and record \ndeficits are not how families run their budgets; it can't be how \nWashington handles people's tax dollars. So we are going to have to \nreturn to the fiscal responsibility we had in the 1990s. The next White \nHouse and the next Congress are going to have to work together to make \nsure we go through our budget, we get rid of programs that don't work \nand make the ones we do need work better and cost less.\n  With less money flowing into the Treasury, some useful programs or \npolicies might need to be delayed. Some might need to be stretched out \nover a longer period of time. But there are certain investments in our \nfuture we cannot delay precisely because our economy is in turmoil.\n  Mr. President, I have exceeded the time a little bit. I ask unanimous \nconsent for a couple more minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator have as much time \nas he would like to have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, there are certain investments in our future \nthat we can't delay precisely because the economy is in turmoil. We \ncan't wait to help Americans keep up with rising costs and shrinking \npaychecks, and we are going to do that by making sure we are giving our \nworkers a middle-class tax cut. We can't wait to relieve the burden of \ncrushing health care costs. We can't wait to create millions of new \njobs by rebuilding our roads and our bridges, by investing in broadband \nlines in rural communities, and by fixing our electricity grid so we \ncan get renewable energy to population centers that need them. We need \nto develop an energy policy that prevents us from sending $700 billion \na year to tyrants and dictators for their oil. We can't wait to educate \nthe next generation of Americans with the skills and knowledge they \nneed to compete with any workers, anywhere in the world. These are the \npriorities we cannot delay.\n  Let me close by saying this: I do not think this is going to be easy. \nIt is not going to come without costs. We are all going to need to \nsacrifice. We are all going to need to pull our weight because, now \nmore than ever, we are all in this together. That is part of what this \ncrisis has taught us, that at the end of the day, there is no real \nseparation between Wall Street and Main Street. There is only the road \nwe are traveling on as Americans. We will rise or fall on that journey \nas one Nation and as one people.\n  I know many Americans are feeling anxiety right now about their jobs, \nabout their homes, about their life savings. But I also know this: I \nknow we can steer ourselves out of this crisis. We always have. During \nthe great financial crisis of the last century, in his first fireside \nchat, FDR told his fellow Americans that:\n\n       There is an element in the readjustment of our financial \n     system more important than currency, more important than \n     gold, and that is the confidence of the people themselves. \n     Confidence and courage are the essentials of success in \n     carrying out our plan. Let us unite in banishing fear. \n     Together, we cannot fail.\n\n  We cannot fail. Not now, not tomorrow, not next year. This is a \nnation that has faced down war and depression, great challenges and \ngreat threats, and at each and every moment, we have risen to meet \nthese challenges--not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as \nAmericans, with resolve and with confidence; with that fundamental \nbelief that here in America, our destiny is not written for us, it is \nwritten by us. That is who we are, and that is the country I know we \ncan be right now.\n  So I wish to thank again the extraordinary leadership of Chairman \nDodd and the Banking Committee, as well as Chairman Baucus and Majority \nLeader Reid. They have worked tirelessly. I also wish to thank the \nleadership in the House of Representatives.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation, understanding that this will not solve all our problems. \nIt is a necessary but not sufficient step to make sure this economy, \nonce again, works on behalf of all Americans in their pursuit of the \nAmerican dream.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I have friends and colleagues whom I \nrespect deeply who are on all sides of this bailout issue. One of them \njust spoke. We all to want do what is right for America, and I believe \nthose who have crafted this plan had pure and noble motives. They want \nthis country to succeed. They want prosperity. I just do not believe \nthat this bill gets the job done. In fact, in the long term, I am\n\n[[Page S10233]]\n\nconvinced it will do more harm than good.\n  We are the Nation that has been called the bastion of freedom, and we \nare the Nation that has sacrificed blood and treasure to share that \nfreedom with the world. We have fought communism, dictators, and \ntyranny. We have helped establish democracies and free-market economies \nacross the globe. Because of America, millions of people are now \nelecting their leaders, and millions have been taken out of poverty and \nenjoyed prosperity. Yet as the blood of our young men and women falls \non foreign soil in the defense of freedom, our own Government appears \nto be leading our country into the pit of socialism.\n  We have seen this Government socialize our education system and make \nour schools among the worst in the world. We have seen this Government \ntake over most of our health care system, making private insurance less \nand less affordable. We have seen this Government socialize our energy \nresources and bring our Nation to its knees by cutting the development \nof our own oil and natural gas supplies. And now we see this Congress \nyielding its constitutional obligations to a Federal bureaucracy, \ngiving it the power to control virtually our entire financial system. \nAmericans understand this and they are angry. They are our judge and \nour jury. They are watching what we are doing, and they will render \ntheir verdict based on our actions.\n  If we were honest with the American people and explained the failures \nthat have led to this financial crisis, we might have the credibility \nto ask our citizens to allow us to borrow another $700 billion in their \nname to try to fix this problem. But we are not being honest. This \nproblem was not created by our free enterprise system. It was created \nby us, the Congress and the Federal Government.\n  With good intentions, we made a mess of things. We wanted our economy \nto grow faster, so we allowed the Federal Reserve to create easy and \ncheap credit. But this allowed people to borrow and lend irresponsibly. \nWe wanted to help the poor, so we forced banks to make loans to people \nwho could not afford to pay them back. We wanted every American to own \na home, so we created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to encourage and \nguarantee mortgages for more people who could not afford them. And all \nof these easy mortgages, many of which required no downpayment, \ninadvertently increased the prices of homes to unsustainable levels and \ncreated a massive oversupply of unsold homes. Now the value of homes \nhas fallen, as has the value of the mortgages attached to them.\n  We allowed and even encouraged Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to bundle \nup these risky subprime mortgages so they could be sold as securities \nto investors in America and all over the world. We guaranteed these \ninstitutions with the full faith and credit of the Government so their \nsecurities could be sold at above-market rates, allowing them to borrow \nhuge amounts and fuel an explosion in subprime mortgage lending. We \nalso allowed these mortgage giants to use their taxpayer-supported \nprofits to spend over $200 million lobbying Congress to keep us quiet, \neven when we saw that our brainchild had become a financial \nFrankenstein.\n  All of our good intentions are now blowing up in our face, and we are \nasking the American people to bail us out. We must also plead guilty to \nother misguided policies that have made the situation even worse. Our \nfoolish energy policies have created a huge financial burden on every \nAmerican family and severely damaged our economy. By not opening our \nown energy supplies, we are now sending nearly $700 billion a year to \nother countries to buy oil. This has dried up capital at home and made \nus dependent on foreign countries for our credit.\n  We have also squandered and wasted hundreds of billions of hard-\nearned tax dollars on unnecessary and ineffective Federal programs and \nthousands of wasteful earmarks. Last week, we passed a bill with the \nhighest rate of pork spending in history. While our talk of gloom and \ndoom has heightened the financial panic here and around the world, and \nwhile we are asking Americans to bail us out, we are still spending \nmoney as if there is no tomorrow. Years of wasteful spending and bad \npolicies have resulted in a huge national debt of nearly $10 trillion. \nMuch of this debt is held by China and Saudi Arabia and other foreign \ncountries that some now say are dictating our financial policies.\n  We know Americans are now the victim of our misguided good \nintentions, along with our free enterprise system that has been \nseverely damaged and weakened. We know our bad policies have taken the \naccountability out of our markets by artificially insulating investors \nfrom normal risk. This has led to careless lending, careless investing, \nmany bad decisions, and possible criminal activity on Wall Street. \nWhile many are blaming Americans and our free enterprise system for the \ncrisis, we know the Government is the root cause of this crisis.\n  I believe this Congress should admit its guilt, prove we have learned \nfrom our mistakes, and correct the bad policies immediately that have \ncaused these problems. We should insist the Federal Reserve end the \neasy money policy. We should repeal the laws that require our banks to \nmake risky loans, and fix the accounting requirements that force banks \nto undervalue their assets. We should develop a plan to break up Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac and sell them to private investors who will run \nthem as private companies.\n  We should reduce corporate and capital gains taxes to encourage \ncapital formation and boost asset values. We should also repeal the \nsection of Sarbanes-Oxley that has driven billions of dollars of \ncapital overseas. And we should do even more to grow our economy and \nlessen our dependence on foreign countries. We should immediately pass \na law that expedites the development of our oil and natural gas \nreserves to help relieve the burden of high prices and gas shortages \nfor our families.\n  We should immediately adopt a freeze on nonsecurity discretionary \nspending and pass a moratorium on earmarks until we fix this wasteful \nand corrupting system. We should sacrifice our political pork as we ask \ntaxpayers to sacrifice for our mistakes.\n  We have caused a terrible financial mess, and we must honestly tell \nthe American people that whether we pass this huge bailout or not, \nthere will likely be suffering and pain for our great country. But \nAmericans and our free market economy are resilient. And with fewer \nmisguided laws and less onerous regulations, we will get through this \ncrisis, as Americans have many times before. But we must tell Americans \nthe truth.\n  Congress says it was deregulation and capitalist greed that has run \nwild and undermined our financial system. Instead of reducing our role \nin the economy, we are trying to use this crisis to expand our power to \ncontrol and manage the free enterprise system. We are here saying that \nour banks and mortgage companies have stopped lending money, that \npeople can't get loans to buy cars, homes, or to run a business, and \nthat our economy of the United States is on the verge of collapse.\n  We are telling people not to worry because we are going to rescue \nthem with their own money. Congress is going to allow the Treasury \nSecretary to take $700 billion from taxpayers to buy bad loans and \ninvestments from anyone he chooses anywhere in the world. This, we say, \nwill free up capital, get the credit markets working again, and put our \neconomy back on track.\n  But this Congress refuses to change our Nation's monetary policy that \ncreated the cheap money and inflated the housing bubble. We refuse to \nchange the accounting laws and regulations, even though they are making \nthe problem worse. We refuse to lower capital gains and other taxes to \nattract capital and promote growth. We refuse to repeal Sarbanes-Oxley, \neven though it hasn't worked and it has cost our economy billions. And \nwe refuse to expedite the development of America's energy resources, \neven though it would help every American and grow our economy.\n  None of these things are even on the table for discussion. We are \ntelling the American people to hand over $700 billion or the world \neconomy is going to collapse. This is why people are so upset. It is \nbecause Congress is being dishonest and arrogant. We are not being \nhonest with them about how we got into this mess, and we are not\n\n[[Page S10234]]\n\nbeing honest with them about what we need to get out of it.\n  I strongly oppose this legislation. It takes our country in the wrong \ndirection. It forces innocent taxpayers to bail out Government policies \nand Wall Street mistakes. It asks the American people to take a leap of \nfaith and trust people who have consistently misled them.\n  I am deeply saddened by the tone of this debate. I am afraid many of \nthe supporters of this bill have bullied people into supporting it, \nusing fear. There may be good reason for fear, but I think most people \nwill agree that some of the statements have been reckless and \nirresponsible. I hope I am wrong and this bill will truly solve the \nproblem.\n  Let me say again that I know every one of my colleagues is doing what \nthey believe is right for America. But based on what I know, I cannot \nin good conscience support it. I know the Senate is going to pass it \ntonight, and I can only hope the House will defeat it so we can pursue \nbetter alternatives.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                          loan transfer rights\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, large numbers of mortgages acquired by \nthe Government under this proposal are going to need to be modified. \nLarge numbers of mortgages are going to need to be refinanced. If it \nbecomes useful to hire outside companies that have the expertise and \ntechnology ready to work with borrowers and financial institutions to \nmodify or refinance mortgages, it is important that the Government have \nthe authority to do so.\n  Is it your understanding that Treasury, the FDIC, or whomever \nTreasury selects to manage the residential mortgage loans the \nGovernment purchases, has the authority to enter into contracts with \nprivate companies on a competitive basis to facilitate loan \nmodifications or facilitate refinancings, should the Government decide \nto do so?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, under current law and under the provisions in this \nbill, that authority exists.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does Treasury have the authority to transfer the servicing \nrights to any modified or refinanced loan?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5687\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5687.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the \n                    tax on high income individuals)\n\n       At the end add the following:\n\n     SEC. 304.

Madam President, let me be very frank. While the bailout \npackage we are dealing with tonight is far better than the absurd \nproposal that was originally presented to us by the Bush \nadministration--which, if you can believe it, would have given the \nSecretary of the Treasury a blank check to spend $700 billion in any \nway he wanted, without any transparency, without any oversight, and \nwithout any judicial review--this bill, far better than that, is still \nshort of where we should be. And I want to thank Senator Dodd and \nothers for their very hard work in improving this legislation. But in \nmy view, this bill is still not good enough. It should be rejected by \nthe Senate, unless an amendment I am about to offer is passed.\n  This country faces many serious problems in the financial market, in \nthe stock market, and in our economy. We must act, but we must act in a \nway that improves the situation. We can do better than the legislation \nwe are dealing with tonight.\n  This bill does not effectively address the issue of what the \ntaxpayers of our country will actually own after they invest hundreds \nof billions of dollars in toxic assets.\n  This bill does not effectively address the issue of oversight, \nbecause the oversight board members were hand picked from the Bush \nadministration.\n  This bill does not effectively deal with the issue of foreclosures, \nand addressing that very serious issue which is impacting millions of \nlow- and moderate-income Americans in the aggressive, effective kind of \nway we should be.\n  This bill does not effectively deal with the issue of executive \ncompensation and golden parachutes. Under this bill, the CEOs and the \nWall Street insiders will still, with a little bit of imagination, \ncontinue to make out like bandits.\n  This bill does not deal at all with how we got into this crisis in \nthe first place and the need to undo the deregulation fervor which \ncreated trillions of dollars in complicated and unregulated financial \ninstruments, such as credit default swaps and hedge funds.\n  This bill does not address the issue that has taken us to where we \nare today, the concept of ``too big to fail,'' the need for taxpayers \nto bail out institutions which are so large that they will cause \nsystemic damage to our entire economy if they go bankrupt. In fact, \nwithin the last several weeks we have sat idly by and watched gigantic \nfinancial institutions such as the Bank of America swallow other \ngigantic financial institutions such as Countrywide and Merrill Lynch.\n  Who is going to bail out the Bank of America if it begins to totter? \nNot one word about the issue of too big to fail in this legislation, at \na time when that problem is, in fact, becoming even more serious. This \nbill does not deal with the absurdity of having the fox guarding the \nhenhouse. Maybe I am the only person in America who thinks so, but I \nhave a hard time understanding why we are giving $700 billion to the \nSecretary of the Treasury, who is the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, \nwhich, along with other financial institutions, actually got us into \nthis problem. Maybe I am the only person in America who thinks that is \na little bit weird, but that is what I think.\n  This bill does not address the major economic crises we face--growing \nunemployment, low wages, and the need to create decent-paying jobs, \nrebuilding our infrastructure, and moving us\n\n[[Page S10235]]\n\nto energy efficiency and sustainable energy.\n  On top of all that, there is one issue that is even more profound and \nmore basic than everything else that I have mentioned, and that is, if \na bailout is needed, if taxpayer money must be placed at risk, whose \nmoney should it be? In other words, who should be paying for this \nbailout which has been caused by the greed and recklessness of Wall \nStreet operatives who have made billions in recent years? That is what \nmy amendment is all about. It is an issue that we have to bring to the \nfloor of the Senate because that is what the American people want to \nhear discussed.\n  The American people are bitter, they are angry, and they are \nconfused. Over the last 7 years since George W. Bush has been \nPresident, 6 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and \nare in poverty. Today, working families are lining up at emergency food \nshelves in order to get the food they need to feed their families. \nSince President Bush has been in office, median family income for \nworking-age families has declined by over $2,000; 7 million Americans \nhave lost their health insurance; 4 million have lost their pensions; \nconsumer debt has more than doubled; and foreclosures are the highest \non record.\n  Meanwhile, the cost of energy, food, health care, college, and other \nbasic necessities has soared. While the middle class has declined under \nPresident Bush's reckless economic policies, the people on top have \nnever had it so good. For the first 7 years of Bush's tenure, the \nwealthiest 400 individuals in our country saw a $670 billion increase \nin their wealth. At the end of 2007 they owned over $1.5 trillion in \nwealth. That is just 400 families--$670 billion increase in wealth \nsince Bush has been in office.\n  In our country today we have the most unequal distribution of income \nand wealth of any major country on Earth, with the top 1 percent \nearning more income than the bottom 50 percent, and the top 1 percent \nowning more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. We are living at a time \nwhen we have seen a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to \nthe very wealthiest people in this country; when, among others, CEO's \nof Wall Street firms receive unbelievable amounts in bonuses, including \n$39 billion in bonuses in the year 2007 alone for just the five major \ninvestment houses.\n  We have seen the incredible greed of the financial service industry \nmanifested in the hundreds of millions of dollars they have spent on \ncampaign contributions and lobbyists in order to deregulate their \nindustry so hedge funds and other unregulated financial institutions \ncould flourish. We have seen them play with trillions and trillions of \ndollars in esoteric financial instruments in unregulated industries \nwhich no more than a handful of people even understand.\n  We have seen the financial services industry charge 30 percent \ninterest rates on credit card loans and tack on outrageous late fees \nand other costs to unsuspecting customers. We have seen them engaged in \ndespicable predatory lending practices, taking advantage of the \nvulnerable and the uneducated. We have seen them send out billions of \ndeceptive solicitations to almost every mailbox in America.\n  I used to think that my home was the only one that was receiving \nthem. It turns out that billions of other solicitations went out to \nprobably every home in America. What they hoped to do was to gain new \ncustomers for credit card companies and then, through the very small \nprint on the back of the solicitation, have the opportunity, have the \nability to monkey around with interest rates so when people thought \nthey were getting zero interest or 2 percent, it turns out that a few \nmonths later they were paying very high interest rates.\n  Most important, of course, we have seen the financial services \nindustry lure people into mortgages they could not afford to pay, which \nis one of the basic reasons we are tonight in the midst of all of this. \nWe have a bailout package today which says to the middle class that you \nare being asked to place at risk $700 billion, which is $2,200 for \nevery man, woman, and child in this country. You are being asked to do \nthat in order to undo the damage caused by this excessive Wall Street \ngreed. In other words, the ``Masters of the Universe,'' those brilliant \nWall Street insiders who have made more money than the average American \ncan even dream of, have brought our financial system to the brink of \ncollapse, and now, as the American and world financial systems teeter \non the edge of a meltdown, these multimillionaires are demanding that \nthe middle class, which has already suffered under Bush's disastrous \neconomic policies, pick up the pieces they broke.\n  That is wrong and that is something I will not support. The major \npoint I want to make this evening is, if we are going to bail out Wall \nStreet, it should be those people who have caused the problem, those \npeople who have benefited from Bush's tax breaks for millionaires and \nbillionaires, those people who have taken advantage of deregulation--\nthose people are the people who should pick up the tab and not ordinary \nworking people.\n  I have introduced an amendment which gives the Senate a very clear \nchoice. We can pay for this bailout of Wall Street by asking people all \nacross this country, small businesses on Main Street, homeowners on \nMaple Street, elderly couples on Oak Street, college students on Campus \nAvenue, working families on Sunrise Lane--we can ask them to pay for \nthis bailout. That is one way we can go or we can ask the people who \nhave gained the most from the spasm of greed, the people whose incomes \nhave been soaring under President Bush, to pick up the tab. They threw \nthe party, they became drunk on greed, and now I believe they should \nfoot the bill. What my amendment proposes is quite simple. It proposes \nto raise the tax rate on any individual earning $500,000 a year or \nmore, or any family earning $1 million a year or more, by 10 percent. \nThat 10-percent increase in the tax rate from 35 percent to 45 percent \nwill raise over $300 billion in the next 5 years; $300 billion is \nalmost half the cost of the bailout.\n  If what all the supporters of this legislation are saying is correct, \nthat the Government will get back some of its money when the market \ncalms down and the Government sells some of the assets it has \npurchased, this amount of $300 billion should be sufficient to make \nsure 99.7 percent of taxpayers do not have to pay one nickel for this \nbailout.\n  Most of my constituents did not earn a $38 million bonus in 2005 or \nmake over $100 million in total compensation in 3 years, as did Mr. \nHenry Paulson, current Secretary of the Treasury and former CEO of \nGoldman Sachs. Most of my constituents did not make $354 million in \ntotal compensation over the past 5 years as did Richard Fuld, the CEO \nof Lehman Brothers.\n  Most of my constituents did not cash out $650 million in stock after \na $29 billion bailout for Bear Stearns, after that failing company was \nbought out by JPMorgan Chase. Most of my constituents did not get a \n$161 million severance package as E. Stanley O'Neil, former CEO of \nMerrill Lynch, did.\n\n  Last week, I placed on my Web site, sanders.senate.gov, a letter to \nSecretary Paulson in support of the content of my amendment--which was \npretty simple. It said that it should be those people best able to pay \nfor this bailout, those people who have made out like bandits in recent \nyears--they should be asked to pay for this bailout. It should not be \nthe middle class.\n  To my amazement, and I am a Senator from a small State--to my \namazement some 48,000 people--and here they are, these are their names, \nand I will not read them all off, 48,000 people have already cosigned \nthis petition, and the names keep coming in and the message is very \nsimple: We had nothing to do with causing this bailout. We are already \nunder economic duress. Go to those people who have made out like \nbandits. Go to those people who have caused this crisis and ask them to \npay for the bailout.\n  The time has come to assure our constituents in Vermont and all over \nthis country that we are listening and understand their anger and their \nfrustration. The time has come to say that we have the courage to stand \nup to all of the powerful financial institution lobbyists who are \nrunning amok, all over this building--from the Chamber of Commerce to \nthe American Bankers Association to the Business Roundtable--all of \nthese groups who make huge campaign contributions, spend all\n\n[[Page S10236]]\n\nkinds of money on lobbyists--they are here, loudly and clearly. They \ndon't want to pay for this bailout. They want Middle America to pay for \nit.\n  So this is a moment of truth. I hope very much that this Senate will \nsupport the amendment I have offered.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his passion, \neloquence, and commitment. He is never shy. This institution could use \na little bit more of similar expressions of feelings for constituents. \nI thank him for that speech.\n  I see my colleague from Alabama. We are going back and forth. At that \npoint after Senator Sessions, Senator Schumer is next in line.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I believe I am to be recognized for 10 minutes, but I \nask that I be notified after 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to say to Senator Sanders \na couple things. First, I think it is indeed breathtaking that this \nSenate would authorize basically one person with very little real \noversight, a Wall Street maven himself, and allocate $700 billion in \nAmerica's wealth, which I would have to say would be the largest single \nauthorization of expenditure in the history of the Republic.\n  So I have to say, fundamentally, I think we have not done a good \nenough job in creating an oversight mechanism that will work, so I am \nnot going to vote for the bill; I am not. I would say, however, and \nnote this point, that my colleague, Senator Shelby from Alabama, \nchaired the Banking Committee in 2005. He held hearings on the problems \nat Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.\n  Alan Greenspan, the then-Chairman of the Federal Reserve, wrote a \nletter saying that if we did not fix Freddie and Fannie this very kind \nof calamity would occur. He put that in writing. Senator Shelby pushed \nthrough legislation to regulate it. It came through the committee on a \nstraight party-line vote; all Republicans, as I recall, voted for \nadditional oversight and reform of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and all \nDemocrats voted against additional regulation of Freddie Mac and Fannie \nMae.\n  So I wish to say, I am prepared to support good regulation, sound \nregulation, and I reject the idea that this problem all arose because \nRepublicans opposed regulation.\n\n\n                                 Amtrak\n\n  In a few minutes we are going to have a vote on Amtrak \nreauthorization and appropriations as a standalone bill. The majority \nleader, Senator Reid, has filled the tree. That means we cannot offer \nany amendments. In the late 1990s, we directed that, after 2002, Amtrak \nwould no longer receive funding from the Federal Government. We ordered \nthat. And yet, we are again appropriating, for 5 years, almost $2 \nbillion a year to fund this entity. We do not stand by our decision.\n  Why is Amtrak losing money? Primarily it is because long-distance \ntrains account for 80 percent of its cash operating losses, while \ncarrying only 15 percent of the passengers.\n  Now, I know people have romantic views about trains. They would like \nto see everybody ride in trains. But people are not riding trains for \nlong distances. And as a result, the taxpayers are eating huge losses. \nI would say, fundamentally, we can do better about that, and we need to \nquit mandating, for political reasons, routes that might pass through \nour States but are dead losers.\n  The Heritage Foundation did a study on a predecessor bill that was \nvery similar to the one we are considering. They found that the bill \nwould only disrupt the necessary reform process and perpetuate low-\nquality service at a much higher cost to the taxpayers. This bill lacks \nany substantive reform proposal, it is replete with directives, \nalterations, restructurings, subsidies, reports, 5-year plans, and \nother forms of top-down micromanagement techniques that are designed to \ncreate the impression that Amtrak is making improvements. In fact, \nHeritage said, instead of reforming and improving Amtrak, the \nlegislation may actually make it worse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would say one more thing. I checked the price of a \ntrain ticket from Birmingham, AL, to Washington, DC. I found that the \ntrain makes 18 stops and takes 18 hours. The Amtrak ticket is $445. \nWhat happens if you take a one-stop flight from Alabama to Washington? \nIt costs a little over $300, and makes only one stop. So this is why \npeople are making these choices. They have multiple choices on when \nthey leave Birmingham and what time they want to leave on a flight to \nWashington. But a person on a train can only leave one time a day; it \ntakes them 18 hours, and they have to eat on the train at high cost.\n  That is why we are having problems. We should have had reform in this \nAmtrak bill, and I do not like that it is brought up at the very last \nminute, and the majority leader has fixed it so there can be no real \ndebate or amendments offered.\n\n\n                                  AMT\n\n  The alternative minimum tax patch is a huge part of the tax extenders \npackage. It will cost almost $79 billion in tax revenue, just this year \nalone. And it is extraordinarily skewed to favor single individuals. In \n2006, around 7 percent of married taxpayers with children were AMT \nfilers, compared to less than 1 percent of single individuals.\n  Families with children are getting caught up in it, because when you \ncalculate your alternative minimum taxable income, you can't claim \npersonal exemptions. It is unfair to those families. It is also unfair \nto the low-tax States. High-tax States benefit much more than lower tax \nStates such as Tennessee or Alabama, because you also can't claim \ndeductions for state and local taxes.\n  We need a better AMT fix next year. Perhaps it is too late to do it \nthis year. But I urge my colleagues next year when this issue comes up, \nwe need to look at this very closely. We need to be sure we end this \nbias against struggling families; we need to end the bias against \nStates that do not have high taxes.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, the Senator from New York is next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, I wish to compliment my \ncolleague from Illinois, Barack Obama. His speech was not only on the \nmoney, but the way he has handled himself throughout this crisis has \nbeen nothing short of Presidential. He has been erudite, he has been \nthoughtful, he has been effective, he has been behind the scenes, no \nshowboating, no big statements, untrue to what he is. He was perfect.\n  Now I rise to support the legislation before us. It has become clear \nover the past few months we live in amazing and dangerous times. Who \nwould have ever thought that the lowly mortgage, long regarded as the \nsafest of investments, could bring our financial system to its knees.\n  The system was overleveraged, overextended, overoptimistic. Now we \nare all paying the price. But that is where we are. While we must look \nback and see what went wrong, we also have to look forward--that is our \nimmediate task--and try to avoid a meltdown.\n  As we confront this crisis, we are faced with dangers on both sides; \nScylla, the proverbial monster, from doing nothing, a real danger; \nCharybdis, the whirlpool, from doing the wrong thing. It is as bad to \ndo the wrong thing as to do nothing.\n  There are real dangers to inaction. Chairman Bernanke held us \nspellbound in the Speaker's office Thursday night when he described the \nconditions of the economy, without hyperbole, without raising his \nvoice. His discussion was, in short, frightening. Our economy's body is \nin terrible shape because its arteries, the financial system, is \nclogged. It will cause a heart attack, maybe in a day, maybe in 6 \nmonths, but we will get a heart attack for sure if we do not act.\n\n  So we must act. Unfortunately, when we act, we are not just acting \nfor Wall Street. Unfortunately, Wall Street, with all its excesses, is \nconnected to Main Street. Right now, you cannot get a car loan if you \ndo not have a FICO score, a credit rating score that is very high, 720.\n  If that stays, we will sell 6 million fewer cars this year, and tens \nof thousands of workers in Buffalo, in Detroit,\n\n[[Page S10237]]\n\nand St. Louis will be laid off through no fault of their own. That is \nnot right. That is not fair. That is the system in which we live.\n  If we do nothing, we hurt innocent workers, millions, even though \nthey were not to blame. But there was also the danger of Charybdis, \ndoing something wrong. Let's make no mistake about it. The plan \nSecretary Paulson first presented was awful--$700 billion, a blank \ncheck, an auction: you let me do it, I will figure it out, even \nexemptions from breaking the law, the language seemed to say.\n  Through the hard work of the chairman and many of us on the Banking \nCommittee, both sides of the aisle, the other house, we changed it. \nThere is real tough oversight. There is protection for the taxpayers. \nSenator Reid did an amazing job in getting warrants written in the bill \nthat are mandatory and tough. The taxpayer will come first, before the \nbondholder, before the shareholder, before the executive.\n  We worked hard as well to limit executive compensation. It is not \neverything the Senator from Montana, the chair of Finance, and I wanted \nin the negotiations but a good, large first step. We broke down the \namount. There will have to be congressional approval for the second \n$350 billion. There will be a requirement that the President notify for \n$100 billion. So the first amount of money, $250 billion is given with \nthis legislation, another $100 billion for the President, if he \ncertifies real need; but $350 billion subject to congressional \ndisapproval. Even if we are out of session, we will come back.\n  So the legislation was improved, and it was logical to improve it; \n$700 billion is a lot of money, even on Wall Street. None of the \nthousands of money managers would invest that sum without appropriate \ndue diligence. There were times when the Secretary of the Treasury was \nsaying: You do not have to do due diligence. We deferred.\n  So to Secretary Paulson's TARP proposal we have added some important \nprovisions, THO, taxpayer protection, housing and oversight. The new \nadditions add, because the new additions are AMT relief--I ask \nunanimous consent for an additional minute. I thought I was supposed to \nget 6.\n  Mr. DODD. I will give the Senator an additional minute.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you. We have added THO, taxpayer protection, money \nfor homeowners and real oversight. And now more. The new additions \nSenator Reid came up with will be money directly to Main Street, money \nfor businesses that invest to create jobs during a time of economic \ndownturn, tax breaks for new kinds of energy--solar, wind--that our \neconomy awaits, relief from the AMT, which affects not the wealthy but \nin New York, at least, people making $50,000, $75,000, $100,000, \n$125,000 who were paying too much under the AMT.\n  So this package is an improvement. Is it the way I would have written \nit? No. Is it the way any of us would have individually written it? No. \nBut given the improvements, this package is better, significantly \nbetter than doing nothing. I hope we will get strong bipartisan support \ntonight, I hope we will get strong bipartisan support in the House, and \nthen we will move on to make the regulatory changes so this never \nhappens again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I want to quickly thank a few people. \nIt is obvious, the people who have worked extra hard and done such a \nmarvelous job. But I have been involved many times in negotiations such \nas this. In fact, the last time we did one of these, I was chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, and we had a savings and loan bailout. I remember \nit well. It is worth mentioning for a moment because, as Senator Dodd \nwill remember, just as our Secretary of the Treasury is telling us, if \nthis works right, we could, in fact, make money instead of losing \nmoney. So whenever we talk about $700 billion as if it were being lost \nor given to somebody and they could run away with it, when we did the \nsavings and loan bailout, we were told when you pay for all these \nassets and take them in, they may bring you as much money as you spent. \nAnd lo and behold, it took a few years, but the Treasury made money on \nthat last bailout we had to put together. I predict that the amount of \nmoney that will be lost on this one will be much less than the 700. As \na matter of fact, if it worked right, the taxpayer could get reimbursed \nand, in fact, some money could get paid down on the national debt. I \nstart with that.\n  Having said that, I thank those who spent extra amounts of time, \nenergy, and did a great job, starting with the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Dodd. I don't think we ought to be partisan. I heard \nsome Democrats talk about only Democrats that had been active in this. \nIt wasn't you, Senator Dodd. But you know that on your side you were \nbusy. On our side we had a rather marvelous negotiator named Judd \nGregg. I believe we want to thank him unequivocally for his work. He \nsurely has done a yeoman job with Republican Senators, explaining what \nyou all were doing. From that, there are numbers of other people, and I \nsay thanks to all. You have done a terrific job.\n  Our job here in the next few hours is to pass a bill and send it to \nthe House and challenge them to vote for it. It is past time, but it is \nabsolutely obvious that we must put confidence back into the credit \nsystem of the United States. We must put confidence back into the \ncredit system of the United States. That means this rather fantastic \ncredit system, which has gone awry without any doubt, because it has \nbeen manipulated, abused, but nonetheless it is still the greatest \ndelivery system that the world has ever seen in terms of delivering \nmoney where money has to be, where money is needed, is now rocking. It \nis in the tenth round of a heavyweight bout, and it is about to be \nknocked out. We have to do something to make sure that doesn't happen.\n  I am very pleased that the Secretary of the Treasury, in spite of \nwhatever faults have been enumerated on the floor--and he claims some \nfaults himself. He talks about not being an eloquent speaker. I imagine \nhe hears Senator Dodd or he hears some other Senator, and he goes back \nand does his work, and he wonders why the good Lord made him so that he \ncan't talk as well as them. But he knows a lot. For those who don't \nthink he should have been in this job, they are mistaken. He has come \nup with solutions to this point.\n  He has told us how to solve the problem of the credit system being \nfilled with toxic assets. Toxic assets have been explained enough here \nfor me not to have to do it again, but essentially, for the most part, \nthey are mortgaged-backed securities that are no good. They were no \ngood from the beginning; ``no good'' meaning the person who bought the \nhouse and gave the mortgage could not have made the payments from the \nvery beginning. They were given an opportunity to buy and sign the \npromissory notes, with people having full knowledge that they weren't \nearning enough. They were a credit risk, and they should not have had \nthese mortgages.\n  There were so many of them issued over the past 10 to 12 years that \nthey permeate the system. When they get there in sufficient numbers, \nthey clog the system, much like cars on a freeway speeding at 65 miles \nan hour and having a crash. It is across all six lanes. All the cars \nare stopped until you move the broken-down, crumbled-up cars. You move \nthem off, and then things run again. So we must move them off and let \nthe part of the American financial system that is great, let the \nliquidity run its course so it is available where money should be \navailable under the American free enterprise, capitalist system.\n  We are hopeful that Secretary Paulson, in analyzing this, analyzing \nthe way to get that wreckage out of the way, in creating this $700 \nbillion entity that could go out there and use that money to buy up \nthis salvage, hold it in the name of the people, can then, believe it \nor not, sell it so that they might make money off of it. That is \nperhaps why Secretary Paulson came to us with four pieces of paper \nsaying: This is what we ought to do. He clearly understood that while \nit is complicated, it is very simple. While it takes many pages because \nof the way we do legislation, four pages explains it in his language, \nas he would need the language to do his job.\n  In any event, the current situation in the United States has created \na problem where the financial and credit markets are blocked up. No \nmatter\n\n[[Page S10238]]\n\nhow you say it, either say toxic assets, with salvage from a car wreck, \ncall it what you may, you must get the toxic assets out of the way. \nThat is what this fund is going to do.\n  I, for one, had a difficult time at the beginning understanding why \nwe should do this. I actually was kind of upset and mad at the same \ntime that we were in this situation at this particular time in our \neconomic history, when such modernism has been imposed on the financial \nsystem in great gobs. It is terrifically efficient and modern, filled \nwith all kinds of technological breakthroughs that make the system \nwork. Here we were, nonetheless, loading a system with promissory notes \nand mortgages that from the very beginning were not going to make it, \nthousands upon thousands of them being packaged up, with a bow put on \nthem, making them look like securities that were valuable and shipping \nthem out and getting them through the market.\n  What we are being asked for here tonight is to vote yea for a bill \nthat contains the proposed rescue mission that Secretary Paulson, on \nbehalf of the President, has put together and submitted to us. We made \nit better in that we made sure it has oversight. We made sure that the \nother things our people were complaining about were taken care of. We \nhave taken care of those, and it is a better bill in that regard.\n  Then we were shocked the other night when the House voted no on the \nbill. It has come back to the Senate, and here our people have thought \nit through. I hope House leaders have paid attention and listened. As I \nlook down at my friend Senator Dodd, I say I am hopeful and certainly \nalmost positive that he and others have talked to the leadership on the \nHouse side about what we are going to do tonight and what we hope they \nwill do, when they get the results of our vote.\n  I think I am safe in predicting the enthusiasm around here is to vote \nthis out. It will pass overwhelmingly, in my opinion. Nobody is happy. \nNonetheless, we are going to get it done. This is one of the most \ndifficult situations to explain to the American people that I have ever \nbeen involved in.\n  This afternoon, I was on a little TV show, and the announcer said to \nme: Senator Domenici, I want to ask you a question that I was asked \ntoday.\n  I said: You mean this day, today?\n  Yes, an hour ago.\n  What was the question, I said.\n  He said: I have $250,000 and I would rather lose it than to see our \nbanking system socialized. Why aren't you saying that? She said to the \nannouncer, why aren't you condemning the socialization of our banking \nsystem?\n  Of course, it was my turn to answer. I said: My oh my, it is hard to \nexplain to people. First of all, the Secretary is only given 2 years to \naccomplish this entire job, 2 years. In 2 years, I think we could \nhardly socialize a system as big as the United States banking and \nfinance system. You are in and out and hope it works. So I believe many \npeople in this country are paying attention and trying to understand \nit, but we are all having difficulty communicating.\n  I hope when we are finished tonight, we will be able to explain it \nbetter to our people. And before we are finished, some of the fear and \ntrepidation that Members of the House have about voting for this can be \ndissuaded and we leave the scene. And we can vote with confidence for \nthe country, for the right thing, and make sure that our finance system \nis given a chance to come out from under this absolutely perilous load \nthat has been thrust upon it.\n  There will be plenty of time after that to assess blame. I would \ncaution that if you read anything about it, either side ought to be \ncareful about laying blame on the other side. I look to the Democrats \nand say: Be careful as you try to blame President Bush and Republicans \nexclusively for this. I say to Republicans the same thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to my distinguished \nfriend and colleague from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I am as angry as any New Jerseyan, as \nany American, about the economic situation we have been put in. But the \ntruth is, for those who are honest with themselves, they know we are in \nan economic crisis and doing nothing is not an option. If we don't get \ncredit flowing again, businesses won't be able to operate. People in \nour neighborhoods will lose their jobs. Getting a loan for a car, an \neducation, or a home will become increasingly difficult, if not \nimpossible. I believe the American dream itself is facing one of the \ngreatest risks in recent history. What we have before us is an economic \nstabilization plan. It is not perfect. But it will help protect and \ncreate jobs by restoring stability and confidence to our economy.\n  We have taken the plan the administration sent us. We rejected it and \nreworked it. George Bush first sent us a plan with no accountability, a \nplan where the idea of checks and balances was: We write the check, and \nthey fill in the blank. But we have changed that plan, made vast \nimprovements, and put taxpayers first. The plan provides for oversight, \naccountability, an oversight board, and a special inspector general. \nThe plan makes sure there is congressional review and, ultimately, \napproval for any additional funding over $350 billion. In this plan, \ntaxpayers will be treated as investors. If we take on a risk, we will \nbe given warrants, the equivalent of a shareholder, given a stake in \nany future profit that might lie ahead for that company.\n  If we step in during the decline, taxpayers must be allowed to share \nin the profit. So the plan is structured to reward taxpayers with \nprofits while protecting them from losses.\n  This plan says there will be no more golden parachutes. People who \nled us into this mess cannot be rewarded for failure. Besides \nstrengthening our economy's foundation, it creates jobs, provides \nrelief for struggling homeowners, and will help small businesses access \ncredit, the small businesses that create 75 percent of America's jobs.\n  Tonight's vote provides also tax relief for the middle class by \ntaking care of the alternative minimum tax in the next year. It pushes \nfor loan modifications to help struggling homeowners stay in their \nhomes and stop property values from falling in our neighborhoods. This \nvote tonight invests in America's renewable energy, to drive down gas \nprices and create American jobs that can't be outsourced.\n  Now, this plan is not perfect, but it is necessary. We still have a \nlong way to go toward tackling the root of this crisis, which is the \nhousing market. I hope we will set the goal of saving at least a \nmillion families from foreclosure. We still have a long way to go to \nestablish the strong regulatory enforcement I have called for in the \npast that prevents the kinds of abuses that got us into this situation \nin the first place. But, again, doing nothing is not an option. Jobs \nare on the line. People's cars, houses, and educations are on the line. \nThose who would reject this plan tonight out of ideology will be \npunishing not the CEOs but hundreds of thousands of Americans who will \nlose their jobs.\n  Madam President, I am going to heed the call of Senator Obama. It is \ntime for us to come together and act in the best interests of this \ncountry. Clearly, we are experiencing unprecedented times. I, along \nwith some of my colleagues, warned many times in the past about the \ngathering specter that irresponsible lending posed, but we were \ndismissed as alarmists. This is one instance where I wish I had been \nwrong.\n  But tonight is not about looking back and pointing fingers. It is \nabout looking forward and preventing even further damage to our economy \nbefore it is really too late. Tonight is about keeping the American \ndream stable enough that we can make it a solid promise for tomorrow, \nand that is why I will be voting yes.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nto speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise today to speak before we take \nwhat will be one of the most important votes, unrelated to war, many of \nus will cast in the U.S. Senate.\n  The proposal before us provides $700 billion to buy illiquid assets \nfrom financial institutions. The stated goal of this scheme is to \nreturn confidence and liquidity to our credit markets.\n\n[[Page S10239]]\n\n  We did not get into this situation in a matter of days, and we are \nnot going to fix it with a piece of legislation quickly cobbled \ntogether in back rooms of the U.S. Capitol.\n  In fact, this crisis has been years in the making. Over the last \ndecade, trillions of dollars were poured into our mortgage finance \nmarkets, often at the direction of well-intended, albeit ill-conceived, \nGovernment programs.\n  At first, the money backed conventional mortgages with standard \ndownpayments and properly verified incomes.\n  Over time, the number of home buyers who met conventional loan \nrequirements dwindled. In order to fuel the upward spiral, mortgage \nproducts became more exotic, requiring less of borrowers and involving \nmore risks.\n  Without regard for fiscal prudence and simple economics, mortgage \nbrokers, realtors, homebuilders, mortgage bankers, and home buyers \ncreated the conditions that helped inflate the housing bubble.\n  At the same time, Wall Street was developing ever more sophisticated \nfinance vehicles to ensure that money continued to flow into the \nmortgage markets to meet the demand.\n  Mortgages were pooled, packaged, and rated ``investment grade'' by \nthe credit rating agencies. They were then sold into a market eager to \npurchase securities with a wide range of risks and yields.\n  Many purchasers employed massive amounts of leverage, layering risk \nupon risk in an effort to maximize return. To cover their risks, many \nof these buyers also bought credit protection from one another, \nentering into derivatives contracts with nominal values in the hundreds \nof trillions of dollars.\n  Eventually, economic reality caught up with us. Housing prices \nstalled and then began falling.\n  Many who bought homes with unconventional loans were unable to afford \ntheir rising payments. Because home values were dropping, they were \nunable to refinance and delinquency rates skyrocketed. This trend has \nnot yet abated.\n  Once homeowners began defaulting, the value of mortgage-backed \nsecurities plummeted.\n  Collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, that were comprised of the \nriskiest mortgage-backed securities became worthless. As a result, \nfinancial institutions holding securitized assets have suffered \nenormous losses and have been desperately trying to raise new capital.\n  I have been a member of the Senate Banking Committee for over 20 \nyears. When I joined the committee, the savings and loan crisis was \njust beginning to unfold.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that it took nearly 10 years, five \nCongresses, and 3 administrations until that smaller, more contained \ncrisis was resolved.\n  Personally, I learned a few solid lessons from that experience. I \ncame to understand that bank management, bank capital, and sound \nregulatory policy make a major difference.\n  What I learned then has guided me ever since.\n  For example, in 1995, I opposed the expansion of the Community \nReinvestment Act. I did not take this position because I am against \nlending to minorities or low-income individuals. My concerns were based \non the simple fact that credit cannot be safely extended on any basis \nother than risk, and risk cannot be mitigated through social \nengineering.\n  The appropriate allocation of credit is not political, it is based on \nmerit. Those with good credit receive the best terms and lowest rates. \nThose with bad credit receive the worst terms and the highest rates, or \nin some cases, no credit at all.\n  The CRA was an attempt to get around this fact and it failed. I \nremind my colleagues of this as we prepare to buy assets backed by the \nvery same mortgages born of this flawed policy.\n  I find it ironic that many of those who supported the legislation \nthat upended the basic concept of risk-based lending are now saying \nthat our present circumstances are an indication that the free market \nfailed. Federal policy, not free market decisions, fueled risky loans \nto unqualified borrowers.\n  In 1999, I opposed the financial modernization bill. Despite Alan \nGreenspan's proclamations, I did not think it provided a sufficient \nregulatory structure to oversee the financial system it created. I was \nalso concerned that it lacked some basic consumer privacy protections. \nMany are now claiming that deregulatory effort led us directly to where \nwe are today.\n  In 2001, I became concerned about the banking regulators' effort to \nmodernize bank capital standards through what is known as Basel II. \nWhile it was very important to update those standards, it appeared to \nme that ``modernization'' was focused more on reducing bank capital \nlevels than improving bank capital standards.\n  During the process, it often seemed that the regulators were more \ninterested in industry priorities than protecting the banking system. I \nspent nearly 5 years trying to ensure that the regulators produced a \nbalanced rule that focused on safety and soundness.\n  When I became chairman of the Banking Committee in 2003, I \nimmediately became concerned with the financial health and regulatory \nstructure of the Government sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac.\n  I did not think the entities had sufficient capital, management \ncontrols, or regulatory oversight. I was particularly troubled about \ntheir size because their combined portfolios amounted to nearly $2 \ntrillion at that time.\n  I believed that their operations posed a systemic risk to the \nfinancial markets. After each disclosed that they had committed serious \naccounting fraud, my concerns grew more focused and I stepped up my \nefforts to pass legislation.\n  Those efforts were rebuffed by the Democrats on the Banking \nCommittee. And, let us be clear as to what the GSEs were doing at this \ntime.\n  From 2004, when we began considering GSE legislation, up until very \nrecently, the GSEs went on a nearly trillion dollar sub-prime and Alt-A \nmortgage-backed security buying spree. Madam President: $1 trillion.\n  I do not know for sure what motivated them in this effort, but I do \nknow the GSEs were spending hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying \nCongress in an effort to stave off additional regulation.\n  Fannie's and Freddie's greatest allies were those that advocated and, \nat times, demanded that the GSEs continue to facilitate sub-prime and \nAlt-A borrowing. As long as they complied, real regulation was dead.\n  This symbiotic relationship, in turn, fueled an already over heated \nmarket to grow even hotter.\n  As the driving force in mortgage finance, this purchasing effort also \nbroke down what scant underwriting standards remained in the market \nplace. Many, if not most, of the toxic assets that this taxpayer-funded \nbailout is designed to buy were originated in an atmosphere created by \nthe GSEs and facilitated by their supporters here in Congress.\n  During the securitization boom that took off in the last 5 years, I \nalso became very concerned about the regulatory oversight of the credit \nrating agencies whose ratings were crucial to getting securities sold.\n  When I looked at the system in place, I soon realized it was \ndominated by two companies and that the regulatory structure provided \nno real oversight and actually prevented competitors from entering the \nmarket.\n  Considering the value that mutual, money market, retirement pension \nfunds, and insurance companies, and other important investors place on \nthe ratings, I recognized that immediate legislative action was \nnecessary to address the shortcomings of the oversight regime. We took \nthat action in the fall of 2006.\n  Unfortunately, it now appears even that effort came too late. The \nrating agencies provided investment-grade ratings on securities worth \nhundreds of billions. A large percentage of those ratings have since \nbeen downgraded.\n  I remind my colleagues that those securities also happen to make up \nthe troubled assets that are now the focus of this bailout.\n  Finally, in 2007, I publicly questioned the adequacy of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission's Consolidated Supervised Entities \nProgram.\n  This nonstatutory program was put in place by the SEC to allow the \nfive big investment banks to meet European regulatory standards without \nhaving to submit to Federal Reserve\n\n[[Page S10240]]\n\nsupervision as provided in the Financial Modernization Act. The program \nalso allowed the investment banks to significantly reduce their capital \nrequirements.\n  Because I already felt that the 1999 act did not provide adequate \nsupervision, I was troubled that the investment banks continued to \nchafe even at this minimal supervision.\n  With their trillions in assets, global operations, and hundreds of \nthousands of employees, they were content to be ``regulated'' by a \nprogram with a staff of less than 20 people, and they vigorously \nlobbied the Banking Committee to keep it that way.\n  Needless to say, I had serious concerns about this arrangement.\n  These concerns crystallized when Chairman Dodd marked up legislation \nthat would not only have codified the SEC's regulatory concoction, but \nalso would have expanded the powers of the investment banks, allowing \nthem access to taxpayer-insured funds through ownership of insured \ndepositories.\n  I requested that the Banking Committee hold hearings to examine this \nstructure in greater detail before we ratified that which the SEC \ncreated through regulatory fiat. Once again, we did not.\n  Instead, my Democrat colleagues voted not only to codify the CSE \nprogram, but also to expand it. My Republican colleagues voted to \nreject it and argued for additional committee action.\n  Today, the CSE program is gone because our investment banks have \neither gone bankrupt, merged, or become that which they fought so hard \nto avoid: Bank holding companies supervised by the Federal Reserve.\n  I would also like to point out to my colleagues that a large number \nof the assets that will be purchased under the Paulson plan were either \noriginated or held by the CSE regulated firms: Bear Stearns, Lehman \nBrothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, or Goldman Sachs.\n  We did not get to where we are today by accident, it was a path we \nchose.\n  My warnings about the risk of basing credit decisions on well-\nintended social mandates rather than sound, fact-based underwriting \nwere dismissed.\n  My concerns about the inadequacy of the regulatory structure put in \nplace in the financial modernization legislation went unacknowledged.\n  My efforts to ensure that bank capital standards were designed to \nensure safety and soundness, rather than industry concerns, were \nconducted largely alone.\n  When I urged focus one of the SEC's Consolidated Supervised Entities \nProgram, my Democrat colleagues ignored me and instead voted to ratify \nand expand the program.\n  When we attempted to pass meaningful GSE reforms, we were repeatedly \nstopped.\n  I commend Senator Dodd, who in the end, worked with me to pass a \nbill. Unfortunately, that effort came too late because the GSEs had \nalready gorged on billions of dollars of toxic sub prime paper and no \nlonger could function on a stand-alone basis.\n  As often as I have argued that we needed to address systemic risks in \nthe financial markets, my advice has been dismissed, and my concerns \nhave proven to be fully justified.\n  I now have serious concerns about the bailout package we are \npreparing to pass.\n  My foremost concern relates to the manner in which we are attempting \nto address the problem.\n  The Paulson plan focuses on a single problem--illiquid assets held \nthroughout the financial system.\n  I believe we have a number of interrelated problems that need to be \naddressed in order of their significance.\n  First, and most urgent, is liquidity. Then we must address the \nsolvency of our financial institutions and declining home values, not \nto mention our entire regulatory structure.\n  I believe Congress can address the liquidity issue by increasing the \ncombined resources of the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury.\n  By enhancing the Federal Government's existing lending facilities and \nguarantee programs, we can help stabilize money market funds and \nprovide loans to troubled financial institutions without exposing \ntaxpayers to massive losses. This act alone would allow us some time to \nconsider thoroughly our next steps.\n  Thereafter, we must determine how to address the troubled assets on \nthe books of financial institutions and continue the process of dealing \nwith declining home values. This will likely be a long and difficult \nprocess, a fact that is not being shared with the American people.\n  As long as we address the immediate liquidity problem by expanding \nlending facilities using the illiquid securities as collateral, we can \nthen take the necessary time to do our work in a more responsible and \nthoughtful manner. It appears, however, that we are not going to \nsubject this bill to our normal process.\n  With that in mind, I would like to take some time to look more \nclosely at what this unprecedented piece of legislation would do.\n  The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 would create the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program.\n  It would authorize the Treasury Secretary to purchase up to $700 \nbillion worth of troubled assets from just about any type of \ninstitution.\n  In exercising this authority, the Secretary would be vested with \nnearly unfettered power.\n  The Secretary could purchase any financial instrument he deems \nnecessary to promote financial market stability. He could purchase not \nonly mortgage-related assets, but securities based on credit card \npayments, auto loans, or even common stock.\n  The Secretary could purchase assets from any institution, not just \nfinancial institutions so long as they have ``significant operations in \nthe United States.''\n  What constitutes ``significant operations'' is left undefined, \nleaving the Secretary a great deal of latitude in determining which \ninstitutions would qualify for the program.\n  Certainly the Secretary could purchase assets from private equity \nfirms and hedge funds, but also corporations and State governments. \nGiven the lack of standards and the breadth of the Secretary's \nauthority, it should be no surprise if politically connected entities \nget special treatment under this program.\n  Under a provision hidden deep in the legislation, the Treasury \nSecretary also has the authority to purchase troubled assets from \nforeign central banks and governments.\n  The Secretary has unlimited authority on how the purchased assets are \nmanaged and sold. Treasury could even set up Government-run hedge funds \nthat compete with private companies.\n  While the Treasury Secretary's authority expires at the end of 2009 \nand can be extended for only 1 additional year, the Treasury's \nauthority to manage purchased assets is perpetual.\n  Treasury could also purchase assets after the termination of its \nauthority, if it has entered into agreements to purchase prior to the \ntermination date. This program will be with us for decades to come.\n  The few restrictions imposed on the Treasury Secretary's authority \ncould undermine the effectiveness of the program. If the Secretary \npurchases more than $100 million in troubled assets from an \ninstitution, he must obtain non-voting common stock or preferred equity \nin the institution.\n  To complicate matters further, the bill does not provide clear \nguidance on how many warrants the Secretary should obtain or what their \nterms should be.\n  If the Secretary makes direct purchases of troubled assets, the \nselling institution must adopt standards on executive compensation and \ncorporate governance.\n  If the Secretary purchases more than $300 million in troubled assets \nfrom an institution, the institution must adopt restrictions on \nexecutive pay and golden parachutes for any new senior executives it \nhires.\n  The legislation also restricts the amount of executive compensation \nparticipating institutions can deduct for tax purposes. While this may \nmake us feel good, these provisions will likely limit the number of \ninstitutions that utilize the program.\n  Not to mention that the compensation restrictions are prospective. In \nother words, the people who created this mess get to walk away with \ncash in hand, and the people hired to clean it up get penalized.\n\n[[Page S10241]]\n\n  This will no doubt undermine their efforts to resolve their financial \nproblems by hindering their ability to hire new management\n  Upon enactment of the legislation, the Treasury Secretary is \nauthorized to purchase up to $250 billion in troubled assets. This \npurchase authority can be increased by another $100 billion if the \nPresident certifies that such additional authority is needed.\n  The Secretary's authority can be, and likely will be, increased to \n$700 billion if the President certifies the need and Congress does not \nenact a joint resolution of disapproval.\n  It is extremely difficult to obtain the two-thirds votes in both the \nHouse and Senate to override a veto. Therefore, for all intents and \npurposes, this distribution system is a mirage. It does not effectively \nlimit the Treasury Secretary's ability to spend $700 billion.\n  The bill would establish a Financial Stability Oversight Board to \nreview and make recommendations on the Secretary's operation of the \nprogram. The oversight board is fatally flawed.\n  First, the Secretary of the Treasury is one of its members. This \nmeans that the Treasury Secretary is reviewing his own actions.\n  Second, the other members of the board include the Chairman of the \nFed, the Director of the Federal Home Finance Agency, the Chairman of \nthe SEC, and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. I think \nthere is a constitutional question about whether a Secretary can have \nhis actions reviewed by any person other than the President.\n  Even if the board is constitutional, why is the Chair of the FDIC not \na member? After all, the FDIC has the most experience of any Federal \nagency in buying and selling bank assets. It also is concerned about \nresolving bank problems with the least cost to the taxpayers.\n  Regardless of who sits on the board, we will be setting a bad \nprecedent by having heads of agencies oversee our Cabinet Secretaries.\n  Finally, the oversight board's authorities are not well defined, so \nit is not clear what happens if the oversight board disagrees with the \nTreasury Secretary's actions. Can it prevent him from acting? Will \ndisagreements result in litigation? Such bureaucratic infighting could \nvery well undermine the effectiveness of the program, to the extent it \ncan be effective at all.\n  The bill also establishes a Congressional Oversight Panel, whose \nmembers will be selected by the leaders of the House and Senate. The \npanel is charged with providing reports on the program, the \neffectiveness of foreclosure mitigation efforts, and the state of our \nfinancial regulatory system.\n  This is work the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial \nServices Committee should be doing.\n  The bill also provides for oversight of the program by the \nComptroller General, establishes an Office of the Special Inspector \nGeneral for the program, and subjects the Secretary's actions to \njudicial review.\n  While I think it is important to oversee this new entity's \nactivities, this hodgepodge of authority is likely to hamper the \nprogram's effectiveness as it struggles to satisfy redundant and time-\nconsuming requests for information.\n  These oversight bodies might not check the Secretary's authority, but \nthey will ensure that this program generates lots of paper. More \nimportantly, they do nothing to address the fundamental flaws with this \nplan.\n  The Secretary is required to issue regulations to address conflicts \nof interest. Interestingly, the Secretary may start buying assets \nbefore these rules are put into place. This is a loophole that could \nhave serious long-term consequences for the program.\n  The bill does not require that taxpayer losses be repaid by its \nbeneficiaries. It only directs the President to present a legislative \nproposal to recoup such losses from the financial services industry.\n  This is something that the President could do even without this \nlegislation. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the beneficiaries \nof the program will pay.\n  Indeed, it is likely that companies that did not participate in the \nprogram would end up covering its costs.\n  The bill would grant the SEC the authority to suspend mark-to-market \naccounting, establishing a dangerous precedent that could lead to the \npoliticization of our accounting standards, something I have fought for \nyears.\n  The newest addition to the bill is a precipitous increase in the \ndeposit insurance amount from $100,000 to $250,000. We are about to \nmore than double the exposure of the already depleted deposit insurance \nfund, and by extension, the American taxpayer, on a whim.\n  I will remind my colleagues that the track record for overnight \nincreases in deposit insurance is not pretty. In 1980, Congress \nincreased deposit insurance coverage for all accounts from $40,000 to \n$100,000 without the benefit of hearings or open discussion.\n  At that time, proponents argued such a change was necessary to \nstabilize the banking industry. What followed was a massive bailout of \nthe savings and loan industry to the tune of well over $100 billion.\n  This time around, we are proposing a 150 percent increase when the \ndeposit insurance fund is already stressed and in need of \nrecapitalization.\n  At a time the FDIC's problem bank list is growing and more failures \nare anticipated, this higher deposit insurance coverage will increase \nthe FDIC's expected payments for failed insured depositories. Those \ncosts, which would ordinarily be passed on to the banking system in the \nform of higher premiums, will instead be placed directly on taxpayers.\n  Let's also be realistic about this. To the extent this measure is \nintended to address the concerns of those who handle large transaction \naccounts, such as corporate treasury deposits, those people are not \ngoing to be comforted by additional coverage levels.\n  If they believe a bank is in trouble, they will withdraw their money \nbecause deposit insurance does not increase confidence in a failing \ninstitution.\n  Let's also be clear about what this means for taxpayers.\n  If, on the front end, the $700 billion bailout is not enough to shore \nthings up, rest assured, there will now be more insurance on the back \nend should banks begin to fail. The American taxpayer will pay, both \ncoming and going.\n  The bill does do some good things, however. It permits the Federal \nReserve to pay interest on reserves, which will improve its ability to \nconduct monetary policy and serve as a lender of last resort.\n  The bill does marginally increase the availability of the HOPE for \nHomeowners program and requires the Secretary to implement a plan to \nassist homeowners to the extent it acquires mortgages or other assets \nbacked by mortgages.\n  While I generally do not support bailing out corporations or \nindividuals, if we are going to get into the bailout business, then \nfunds should be directed to individuals as well. The provisions in this \nbill for individual homeowners, however, are inconsequential compared \nto the $700 billion going to Wall Street.\n  As I said, I am no advocate of bailouts. I voted against the Chrysler \nbailout. I can not say I would have supported a bailout in this \ninstance, but I can say the chances would have been much greater if the \nunderlying plan had been subjected to greater scrutiny and examination. \nThat said, I agree that we need to do something to address the current \nliquidity crisis in the marketplace.\n  My greatest concern is that we have not spent any time determining \nwhether we have chosen the best response. There are many well informed \npeople who argue that we have not.\n  In fact, just this morning, a Nobel prize winning economist indicated \nthat using a reverse auction program to buy distressed assets from \nfinancial institutions was not going to be enough to ``revive the \noperations of the banks.''\n  I am not sure whether he is right or wrong. I am also not certain \nwhether the Secretary is right or wrong. To the extent other options \nexist, I believe we failed the American people greatly in not examining \nthem.\n  Many around here are finding comfort in the notion that ``something \nis better than nothing.'' I believe that is a false choice. The choice \nwe faced was between pursuing an informed response or panic.\n  Unfortunately, we chose panic and are now about to spend $700 billion \non something we have not examined closely. Yes, in the end, we will \nhave ``done\n\n[[Page S10242]]\n\nsomething.'' At the same time, however, we will have done nothing to \ndetermine whether it will accomplish anything at all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I have a unanimous consent that has been \ncleared on both sides. I ask unanimous consent that an additional 30 \nminutes be allocated for debate with respect to H.R. 1424, equally \ndivided and controlled between the leaders or their designees, and that \nthe debate with respect to the House message on H.R. 2095 be delayed \naccordingly, and that any other provisions remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Nelson of Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, the things that have been \nadded to this bill such as the FDIC provisions as well as the energy \ntax extenders and other tax extenders that I have already voted in \nfavor of, certainly I support them, but the underlying bill rewards the \nbanks and leaves the little person with the short end of the stick, and \nthat is not right. This plan rewards the investment banks that ran us \ninto the ground and it hardly does anything to help the homeowners who \nare facing foreclosure.\n  If, under this bill, the financial institutions participate in the \nTreasury's program, they should accept reasonable limits on executive \ncompensation, but under the bill they don't. The limits on executive \ncompensation are left to the Treasury Secretary's discretion. Some CEOs \nwho caused this crisis in the first place will benefit from this \nbailout and will also walk away with golden parachutes. That is not \nright. This creates a moral hazard the U.S. Government will undertake.\n  This bill sends a message to Wall Street that if they play fast and \nloose in the name of short-term profits, the Government will actually \nmake up for their losses. And the bill does very little to help \nindividual homeowners. Until we stabilize the housing market, which is \nthe underlying ability to restructure the economy from this crisis--\nuntil we stabilize the housing market, and until we stem the record \nnumber of foreclosures, our market simply is not going to improve. \nWhile this bill authorizes the Treasury to develop and carry out a \nplan, it does not require financial institutions participating in the \nprogram to modify or refinance any loan. It only requires the Treasury \nto encourage loan modifications. Voluntary refinancing efforts will not \nsolve our foreclosure crisis. We should mandate these efforts. We \nshould start by requiring Fannie and Freddie to refinance the mortgages \nthey hold on their books.\n  Furthermore, I think this bill should do more to investigate the \nbusiness practices of major credit rating agencies. They fostered the \nenormous growth of the mortgage-backed securities. They gave \nsecurities, mainly consisting of subprime mortgages, the gold standard \nor the triple A rating. That rating gave investors the confidence that \nthey were making safe investments. Without that triple A rating, \ninsurance companies and pension funds and other investors would not \nhave bought those products.\n  So I am calling for an investigation to probe the business practices \nof those agencies. Investors relied on and trusted those credit \nratings, and the public deserves to know how these rating agencies \nconcluded that such risky investments could receive such high credit \nratings.\n  I could say a lot about this, but let me just say that the bottom \nline is, ultimately, this bill forces taxpayers to bail out investment \nbanks that caused the crisis in the first place, and it does nothing to \naddress the real problem, which is home foreclosures and a \nresuscitation of the housing market. Until we stop the record level of \nforeclosures, this crisis is going to continue to worsen, whether we \npass this bill or not.\n  For these reasons, I oppose this bill. I think Congress can do \nbetter, and I think Congress can come up with a better, more targeted \nsolution to this complex crisis.\n  It saddens me that I would oppose so many of my colleagues who have \noffered very cogent reasons. It is true we have to do something, but \nthis particular legislation is not the right solution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I understand we have some time on our \nside. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from South Carolina be \nrecognized for 7 minutes, the Senator from Florida be recognized for 7 \nminutes, and that I be recognized for the remainder of the time, and \nthat obviously we would go back and forth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, before we get too far into explaining \nthe problems we face with this bill, I think we need to acknowledge the \nhard work on behalf of those who have brought us to this point. We know \nit is not perfect. The chairman knows it is not perfect, but I think he \nhas done the country a great service. To the Senators who have \nnegotiated this with their House colleagues, to the staff who has been \nworking night and day, from my point of view, you have stepped to the \nplate and you have done the country a great service.\n  Do more, we will. Make no mistake about it. To those who wonder: Will \nmore follow? Yes. There will be more corrective action following in the \nCongress. Please understand, after we take this decisive action, there \nwill be more troubles lying ahead for America. But we have two choices \nas far as I am concerned: A bad choice we all recognize, and a \ncatastrophic choice if we do nothing.\n  Now, there are a lot of people getting phone calls. I am a king of \nthe phone calls. I have been involved in immigration, Gang of 14, you \nname it. People have called my office, and you are always welcome to \ncall and I will listen to what you have to say. But the people are \nagainst this proposal. Who are the people? That is the first thing you \nhave to decide as a Member of the Senate. Whom do you represent?\n  Do you represent every corner of society: Republicans, Democrats, \nIndependents, libertarians, and vegetarians?\n  One thing I have found is that a phone call from mad people helps you \nonly so much. There will always be people calling my office telling me \nwhat I can't do. I think it is up to me to have a little broader view \nof what to do.\n  I challenge you to come to South Carolina and walk up and down Main \nStreet and not find concern on the faces of people in business. I \nchallenge you to go to retirement communities in South Carolina and not \nsee fear in the faces of people who depend on their 401(k) plans for \ntheir retirement. I have never seen anything like it.\n  This is not about investment banks; this is about the ability of \nSonic Drive-in to expand their franchise--a very big business--but, \nmore importantly, it is about the plumber who can't make payroll \nbecause he can't get credit. It is about the lady who owns the diner, \nsecond-generation owner in Greenville who wants to expand and can't get \nmoney. It is about people trying to buy a car and they can't buy the \ncar, and the dealerships in South Carolina are about to fold. It is \nabout you--the average American--soon, if we don't act, being unable to \nexercise your hopes and dreams because you will not be able to borrow \nmoney.\n  Borrowing money responsibly is the heart and soul of a free market \neconomy. The reason we are here today is people have borrowed money \nirresponsibly, and all of us are to blame. But if this was about an \ninvestment bank and a few CEOs, I don't think 70 Senators would vote \nfor this legislation.\n  This is about something more fundamental. This is about a problem \nthat started and has infiltrated our economy to the point that if we \ncan't muster the political courage to listen to the phone calls and act \ndecisively and tell people who are mad: I am sorry, there has to be a \nsolution even if you don't agree, then average, everyday people are \ngoing to lose everything they have worked for throughout their life. \nPeople are not going to be able to send their kids to school and small \nbusinesses and big businesses in this country are going to fold next \nweek. I said next week.\n\n[[Page S10243]]\n\n  If you told me that Wachovia Bank, one of the largest banks in \nAmerica, would be sold at 10 cents on the dollar, I would have said I \ndon't think that can happen. But I would have been wrong. It is \nhappening, and it will continue to happen until we find a solution. \nThis proposal, to those who crafted it, you have done a very good job \nafter having been dealt a very difficult hand. It allows intervention \nin a way that will protect the taxpayer.\n  To those who say that $700 billion of taxpayer money will be spent \nand it is gone, you don't know what you are talking about. You are \nscaring people. That is absolutely not true. I am convinced we are \ngoing to get most of the money back, if not all of it back, by the way \nwe have crafted this proposal. But I am equally convinced if we do \nnothing, we are headed to recession, maybe a depression. And you think \nit costs a lot now. Just do nothing and see what it costs. Nobody wants \nto be in this spot, but if you don't want to be in these spots, don't \nrun for office.\n  So to the people of South Carolina, on Main Street, to the car \ndealerships, to the small business enterprises, to the manufacturers, \nto the retired communities, to those with whom I have met over the last \nday or so, I have your message too. I have gotten the phone call, but I \nhave also gotten your message. At the end of the day, I have to rely \nupon what good sense God may have given me, and sometimes I doubt how \nmuch sense I have. A lot of people obviously doubt it because they call \nme a lot. But I am convinced a lot of smart people are telling me \nthings that I can visualize and see with my own eyes; that it is no \nlonger about academia.\n  I have been home. I have seen people not be able to get loans to make \npayroll.\n  I know what is going to happen if I don't act, if I don't take a \nrisk. If I am not willing to take a political risk, I know what happens \nto people I represent in large numbers. They are going to lose a lot \nmore than I will lose.\n  We can stand replacing a few Senators. We cannot stand being unable \nto borrow money at the most basic level. This is not about an \ninvestment bank. This is about banks, small and large banks, and \nlending institutions that are locked down and cannot loan money. This \nis about the availability of credit that is going to be so high that no \naverage working person is going to be able to borrow a dime. This is \nabout Main Street. This is about the people I grew up with, and I \ndidn't grow up on Wall Street.\n  I am the first person to go to college in my family. My dad owned a \nliquor store. Everything I know about politics I learned in the liquor \nstore, a pretty good place to learn from. We borrowed money to make \ninventory. We owned a restaurant right next door. My mom worked 18 \nhours a day. I know what it is like to see my parents work hard and \ncannot afford to get sick because there is no money coming in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I end with this thought: I know this is not a perfect \nbill, and I know this is a bad choice. But I also know from my common \nsense and my life experiences that I need to act and I need to act now, \nand I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, one quick thought. We are all entitled to \nour opinions. Pat Moynihan used to say everyone is entitled to their \nown opinions but not to their own facts.\n  As I listened to my friend from Florida, Senator Nelson, talk about \nthe executive compensation section of this bill, I must respond.\n  As to this legislation, section 111, negotiated by Senator Max \nBaucus, myself, and others, let me be very clear. When Treasury buys \nassets directly, the institution shall observe standards limiting \nincentives allowing clawback and prohibiting golden parachutes. When \nthe Treasury buys assets at auction, an institution that has sold more \nthan $300 million in assets is subject to additional taxes, including a \n20-percent excise tax on golden parachute payments triggered by events \nother than retirement. And also we eliminated the deduction for \ncompensation above $500,000, and we prohibit golden parachutes at other \ncertain institutions--anything but mild. It is the first time ever in \nthe history of the Congress that we are actually going to pass \nlegislation dealing with golden parachutes. More will be done, but this \nbill does take very concrete, specific actions in that regard.\n  Again, you are entitled to your own opinions but not your own facts.\n  I yield 5 minutes to Senator Kerry of Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I am still trying to process the \nstatement of my good friend, Senator Graham, about everything he \nlearned in the liquor store. I know him well enough to know he learned \na lot more than that, and he practices it well. He promised me to sit \ndown and define precisely what he did learn.\n  I listened carefully to a lot of our colleagues. Obviously, there is \nan extraordinary amount of anger here, and that anger runs deep all \nacross the country, and it ought to run deep. It is hard to convey to \nsome of our fellow citizens the degree to which a lot of us share that \nanger.\n  There is a stunning trail here of lack of accountability, of \narrogance in the marketplace that literally built a kind of Ponzi \nscheme, a house of cards, out of greed. There is a stunning trail of \nignored advice to people in positions of responsibility who could have \ndone things. And there is a shocking trail of regulators who are in \nposition, who have the authority, and who didn't use that authority. \nAll of this we know as we come here tonight.\n  But the fact is, there are bigger stakes, and none of us has the \nluxury of standing around here sort of being angry and being \nfrustrated. The truth is there is the potential of our financial system \nliterally collapsing. That is not because Wall Street needs to be \npicked up and ``bailed out.'' It is because the liquidity crisis is \npreventing every-day businesses, community banks in local communities, \nsmall businesses that need to have working capital to make the purchase \nof the orders they need to fill. Everything is frozen. People are \nlosing their earnest money on homes because the banks are not \nfulfilling the obligation. They are scared to lend. Cars are not being \nsold. It runs all the way down into the economy.\n  The stark reality is if we don't act tonight, if we don't act \nimmediately, and if we don't act with strength, that whole system can \ncome grinding to a halt and many more people are going to be hurt to a \nfar greater degree--savings accounts wiped out, retirement accounts \nwiped out, the ability to be able to retire when they expect it, \nsending kids to college, paying off college loans--a whole host of \nthings.\n  It is ugly that we are here. This is a distasteful vote. None of us \nlikes this vote, but the fact is we have a responsibility to put our \ncountry, our economy, our security, and our strength ahead of all of \nthose dislikes and do the responsible thing today.\n  I want to say that I believe the Senate has acted responsibly in this \neffort on a bipartisan basis. I salute what Senator Dodd, Senator \nBaucus, working with us on the Finance Committee, and Senator Gregg, \nSenator Corker, and others on the Republican side have done to be \nresponsible to bring the bill together.\n  The fact is that more than 65 percent of the banks have significantly \ntightened their lending standards for small businesses. What happens \nis, one of the reasons it is important to take the FDIC funding up to \n$250,000 is some people are looking at their banks locally and they are \nscared, so they move money to another bank which has an impact on the \nbank that doesn't have any relationship to the real strength of the \nbank but then weakens it. By raising that amount, we are going to give \nconfidence to community banks, midsize banks, and others.\n  The banks pay for that insurance, incidentally. It is not exactly a \ngift from the Government. The insurance is paid for.\n  Every day approximately 10,000 more homes are going into foreclosure; \n5 million homeowners, 1 in 11 homes are either in default or \nforeclosure. It is the highest level since 1979. And this legislation \nwe are going to pass tonight is going to help keep the mortgage credit \nflowing to keep people in their homes on a readjusted basis, something \nmany of us have been fighting for some period of time.\n  In addition, it is going to help families get student loans so they \ncan continue to help their kids get through\n\n[[Page S10244]]\n\ncollege and build the economy in the future.\n  Let me emphasize, this is not the original plan that was sent to us \nby the administration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Can I get 1 additional minute?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. KERRY. We have strengthened this so significantly through the \nefforts of Senator Dodd and others. There is an executive compensation \nlimitation, contrary to what the Senator from Florida said. Executives \nare not going to walk away with millions of dollars. There is an effort \nto help homeowners. There is accountability with an inspector general. \nThere is judicial review. Significantly in this effort the American \ntaxpayer is going to take ownership of these assets at a lower cost. \nAnd when the economy comes back, which it will, those assets are going \nto rise in value, and the American taxpayers are going to recoup this.\n  I was on the Banking Committee back when we did the 1990 RTC. We saw \nthis happen when we took good loans, separated them from bad loans, and \nrestored confidence in the banking system.\n  Once again I say to my colleagues, this is not about party, this is \nnot about politics. This is a vote--we don't always get them here--that \nis absolutely strictly about our country and our future. I hope the \nSenate is resoundingly going to pass this legislation tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts \nfor an eloquent statement and a strong one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I begin by expressing my thanks to \nChairman Dodd, for his leadership in this effort, his tireless work, \nand my colleague Senator Judd Gregg who has done a tremendous job \nstepping in and also providing a tremendous amount of leadership. I \nthank both of them for the work they have done to bring us to the \npoint.\n  I also thank Secretary Paulson. I heard recently people expressing \nperhaps this is some sort of a power grab by the Secretary of the \nTreasury. This man will be out of office in 3 months or so after the \nnext President is sworn into office. That is the last thing, I know, on \nhis mind. He has worked tirelessly. He deserves our thanks for his \npatience, for explaining to some of us at all hours what it is he \nthinks is necessary we do.\n  This is important to all Americans, but I also understand their anger \nand frustration. While I was in Florida over the last 24 hours, I was \nspeaking with an old friend, a schoolteacher. He is not someone who is \ninvolved in banking and finance. He said: This bothers me. I pay my \nbills. All my life, if I borrow money from a bank, nobody bails me out. \nWhat is going on? What are we going to do?\n  We talked about it. I explained to him the difficulties of our \nfinancial markets at this point in time. His last words to me were: Go \nup there and do something. Get something done. He understood, as I hope \nall Americans will come to understand, this is a very difficult moment, \nbut it is a moment from which we cannot shrink.\n\n  How we got here, we could talk about that for hours, and we will. \nWhen we come back in January, we have to pick the bones. We have to go \nover how we got to this position and what we can do to revamp the \nregulatory scheme to make sure we don't get into a situation such as \nthis again, and do what we can to revamp the regulatory situation which \ndates back to almost now a century. It needs to be reanalyzed and put \nin place in a different way.\n  There is something important this bill mentions too, which is mark to \nmarket. I spoke with many local bankers in Florida, small bankers, guys \nlending money to keep small businesses in business. They were very \nconcerned about the mark-to-market accounting rules. We know that is in \nthe purview of the SEC. Here it is talked about and encouraged to \nreassert the authority of the SEC to look into it. I know it will be a \nbig difference to small banks struggling in Florida with liquidity to \nhave the capital that every-day Floridians need to make their lives \nwork.\n  I am also encouraged that we have strong oversight over the Secretary \nof the Treasury. There is an oversight board. I also understand and \nagree with Chairman Dodd that, in fact, there are strong provisions in \nthis bill that are going to prevent executive compensation abuses that \nnone of us want to see happen as a result of what we are doing today.\n  The fact is, whether it is floor plans for car dealers, whether it is \nthe car loans for those who would buy the cars, whether it is someone \nwho is there to purchase a house but cannot get the money, we cannot \nget the housing market going again if there is no liquidity, if there \nis no credit; whether it is a line of credit for a small business.\n  I have another anecdote. A small businessman said: I always paid my \nbills. I was never late with a payment. I go to the bank to exercise my \nline of credit, and they tell me I can't. He now has to stop his plans. \nHe can't do what he was planning to do in his business to expand it, \ngrow it, buy new equipment, simply because the bank said you have done \neverything right; we just can't lend you the money because we don't \nhave it ourselves. That is the situation with which we are dealing, \nproviding the safeguards the American people expect us to do.\n  We have to come back in January to do regulatory reform, to do \noversight of what we are doing now, which needs to be done repeatedly, \ncongressional oversight over how this is being implemented, to make \nsure we provide the American people the confidence and the comfort of \nknowing that while we got into a real mess and while Wall Street got us \ninto this mess, the fact is this is impacting every-day Americans, this \nis impacting Floridians of every walk of life.\n  To fulfill our responsibilities every now and then, a tough vote has \nto be taken. This is a tough vote. It isn't easy. A lot of people have \ngreat angst about it. I understand their angst, and I share their \nanger. At the same time, we are here to solve problems and get business \ndone, working in a bipartisan manner, coming together.\n  This is a great country. We are going to come through this crisis, \nthrough this moment, and we will be stronger for it. In the meantime, \nwe have to do the right thing. The bill may not be perfect, but the \ntimes will not wait for tomorrow. The times will not wait for us to \nhave a perfect bill. We have no choice but to act, and we need to act \nnow.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. We need a strong \nbipartisan vote to send a message to the House of Representatives, to \nsend a message to America, that the Senate is going to stand strong and \ndo the right thing for the American people.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I yield to my distinguished friend and \ncolleague from California 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I say thank you to the Americans whose \noutrage at the administration's original blank check bailout stopped \nthat arrogant proposal in its tracks. We were all stunned. They and \ntheir allies were telling us the fundamentals of our economy were \nstrong 2 weeks before we heard it was crashing. They had failed to use \nthe powers Congress had given them to stop bad mortgages. Where was the \noversight in their proposal? Where was the taxpayer equity? Where was \nthe control over CEO pay? The answer back from Mr. Paulson on a phone \ncall with dozens of Senators was: There would be no restrictions on \nthis bailout. Well, count me out.\n  A far better plan then emerged from the Banking Committees, but for \nme it did not do enough.\n  I wrote to Mr. Paulson urging smaller installments; reforms. I pushed \nfor direct investments or loans rather than toxic acid purchases. We \ndidn't get it. But in this Senate legislation, we did get more FDIC \nprotection for bank depositors, which is crucial to deterring an \nepidemic of bank closures, something that was at the heart of the Great \nDepression.\n  Broader FDIC protection will help small businesses that need \ncertainty in meeting their payrolls. That is where working families \ncome in. Most working families today can't miss even one\n\n[[Page S10245]]\n\npaycheck, given our high cost of living. We need to retain and create \njobs, which is why I support another change in this legislation--$16 \nbillion in incentives for job-producing renewable energy businesses. \nPlus, there are billions more in tax relief for businesses and \nindividuals. We lost 84,000 jobs in August alone. We must act.\n  Another provision, originally written by Senators Wellstone and \nDomenici, will keep many families from going bankrupt by ensuring that \nmental health illness will be covered fairly. So this legislation \nbefore us is much improved, and I hope it will pass.\n  I wish to share what California treasurer Bill Lockyer says will \nhappen if we do not act, but, first, Madam President, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a letter from Governor \nSchwarzenegger.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  October 1, 2008.\n       Dear Members of the California Congressional Delegation: \n     It's now very clear that the financial crisis on Wall Street \n     is affecting California--its businesses, its citizens' daily \n     lives and its state government's ability to obtain financing \n     to pay for critical services.\n       This is how serious the situation is: our State Treasurer \n     warns that the credit market has already frozen up to the \n     point that it chills even the State of California's ability \n     to meet its short-term cash flow needs. Additionally, without \n     immediate action from you and your colleagues in Congress, \n     California will be unable to sell voter-approved bonds for \n     the highway, school, housing and water construction projects \n     that our state is relying on to help carry us through this \n     difficult economy. The state of our already-slow economy \n     makes the financial situation even more urgent.\n       It is daunting that California, the eighth-largest economy \n     in the world, cannot obtain financing in the normal course of \n     its business to bridge our annual lag between expenditures \n     and revenues. This means California may soon be forced to \n     delay payments for critical services, such as teachers, law \n     enforcement and nursing homes. The same thing would happen to \n     California's counties and cities. That is, unless Congress \n     acts quickly to restore confidence in our financial system.\n       I am writing to urge you to vote in favor of the Emergency \n     Economic Stabilization Act. This plan is critical to the \n     well-being of every community in California, and across the \n     nation. Swift action in Congress is needed to restore \n     confidence in our financial system.\n       Let's be clear, this plan is not a ``bailout'' for Wall \n     Street. To the contrary, the plan is about protecting Main \n     Street.\n       We are currently witnessing the initial consequences of \n     depositors and investors withdrawing assets from a financial \n     system in which they have lost confidence and putting them in \n     FDIC-insured accounts and federal obligations. That means \n     there's little money for normal commerce and what money is \n     available is too costly. This dramatically reduces economic \n     activity, translating into fewer jobs, lower wages, reduced \n     savings and threatened pensions. If the stabilization plan \n     fails, these outcomes will materialize in scale.\n       California's businesses, both large and small, also face \n     the prospect that banks will not be able to renew loans. It \n     goes without saying that, when people and companies can't get \n     the money to buy cars, inventory goods, plant crops, expand \n     business and go to school, economic activity slows down, \n     leading, to job losses, wage reductions, savings declines and \n     pension failures all along Main Street, California.\n       The situation is urgent. The crisis we face demands swift \n     action and bipartisan leadership. Congress must pass this \n     economic stability plan without further delay.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, our treasurer says we would not be able \nto sell voter-approved highway, school, and water bonds that are \ndesperately needed for California's economy and for the creation of \ngood-paying new jobs. He says they would not be able to get the credit.\n  California also desperately needs access to short-term borrowing from \nbanks to finance our budget.\n  Now, how did we get here? There are a lot of people saying don't \npoint fingers and don't talk about it. I am going to talk about it. It \nwas deregulation fever. That is my opinion. It started in the 1980s, \nwith lawmakers interfering with Federal regulators over the savings and \nloan crisis. It continued in 1995, when the Republicans took over and \nthey wanted to place a moratorium on all new regulations.\n  That effort failed, but their success came in 1999, when Senator Phil \nGramm and his allies tore down the firewalls that separated various \nfinancial institutions. And then the deregulation of the energy \nbusiness. You all remember Enron and those traders--that is T-R-A-D-E-\nR-S--saying: Well, grandma can't pay the bill, isn't it funny?\n  Phil Gramm recently said we are a nation of whiners. I say his legacy \nis a disaster.\n  I believe, and I hope, this package will do what is needed to restore \ntrust in the short term. For the long term, we need regulatory reform \nand change that will bring us job-producing investments in America, not \nin foreign lands. Remember, $10 billion a month is going to Iraq. We \nneed those dollars here at home.\n  So I look forward to that work on behalf of my great State of \nCalifornia and this great Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I could engage the chairman in a colloquy, as I \nunderstand it, we have about 15 minutes left on our side under the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes remaining on the minority \nside.\n  Mr. GREGG. Fourteen minutes. How much time remains on the majority \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes on the majority side.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then I understand we are going to Amtrak for half an hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. If I may inquire of my good friend and colleague who has \nbeen very generous, I may ask for a little generosity in terms of time. \nI am running into a crunch, and I have a couple Members who may wish to \nspeak for a couple minutes. But let me get to that point.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are here at a very significant time \nrelative to the Congress's responsibility to act and try to avoid a \nsignificant crisis for our Nation. I listened to Ranking Member Shelby, \nformer Chairman Shelby, whom I have the most tremendous respect for. \nAnd you know, when you think about how we got here, had this Nation \nlistened to Richard Shelby, we probably wouldn't be here. If there had \nbeen adequate capital formation of these institutions, if there had \nbeen adequate oversight, if there had been proper underwriting, we \nwouldn't be here.\n  Unfortunately, we are here, and the hand we have been dealt is a \npretty bad hand, and the options are few. Our situation as a Congress \nis this: If we fail to act, we will fail the Nation. We will fail our \nconstituents, we will fail the people on Main Street, and we will fail \nfuture generations.\n  The problem has been outlined here eloquently by a number of \nspeakers. The Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from South \nCarolina, and the Senator from Florida, since I have been on the floor. \nI know earlier today a number of Members spoke brilliantly about the \nproblem. But let me simply restate it because we need to understand it \nclearly.\n  This isn't so much about the problem of Wall Street. This is about \nthe problem that is coming at Main Street. America runs on credit--\ncredit that is easily available and reasonably priced. There are very \nfew Americans who haven't borrowed money to buy their car, to send \ntheir children to college or to expand their home. There are very few \nsmall businesses in this Nation--whether it is a restaurant on Main \nStreet or a shoe store on Main Street or the local person who is taking \na risk in the software industry--very few businesses in this Nation, \nsmall, medium or large but especially small that don't depend on their \nline of credit from the bank which finances them through difficult \ntimes and allows them to buy the things they use to resell. What we are \nseeing today is a closing down of that credit so the person on Main \nStreet would not be able to buy a car, would not be able to send their \nchild to college, and the people who pay them would not be able to \nfinance their payroll, would not be able to buy the inventory they need \nin order to be financially successful, and the contraction feeds on \nitself and grows and expands.\n  It has been described here a number of times by the example of a \nfour- or\n\n[[Page S10246]]\n\neight-lane highway--in New Hampshire, it would be a four-lane highway--\nwhere you had a crash that blocked the highway. And behind that crash \nyou had trucks carrying the checks that pay the people who work in \ntown; you have trucks carrying the checks that maintain the hospitals, \nmaintain the school system, allow the kids in the town to go to \ncollege, and allow the city to pick up the garbage, pave the streets, \npatrol the streets, and protect the people against fire. Those trucks \nare all stuck in that traffic jam and they can't move. What the Federal \nGovernment is suggesting we do, what the Treasury Department has \nsuggested we do, and what we have worked out as a program to do is to \ncome in, as a government, and take that crash off the highway so \ncommerce can occur again in a reasonable manner.\n  Now, we have heard a lot about the cost of this program. There has \nbeen an immense amount of misrepresentation and theater and hyperbole \nand I am afraid some people in our society have decided to demagogue \nthis issue for their own personal aggrandizement and benefit. They say \nit is $700 billion thrown at Wall Street to protect the fat cats of \nWall Street. Well, that simply is inaccurate. We are going to put $700 \nbillion into the process, but with that $700 billion we are going to \nbuy assets, assets that have real value.\n  We are not throwing it out the window. What we are going to do is \ntake nonperforming loans, mortgage-backed securities off the books of \nbanks and allow those banks to replace those loans with assets they can \nlend against. What does that do? It creates credit. It allows those \nbanks to start lending again. They can't lend today because they have, \nas their base, nonperforming assets. They can't lend against those \nassets. Their capital isn't adequate.\n  So we are going to take those assets, and we are going to hold them \nas a Federal government. We are going to take them at a fairly big \ndiscount from their face value. If it is a mortgage note, we might take \nit at 20 or 30 percent below what the original note was issued at. Then \nwe are going to work with the people who have those mortgages, those \npeople in homes who have those mortgages, if they are the principal \nresidents of those homes and they have a job, and we are going to try \nto make it so there is no foreclosure against them, so they can stay in \ntheir home and so they can pay that mortgage. By doing that, we are \ngoing to make those mortgages valuable again. As the economy starts to \nrecover, we are going to take those mortgages and we will resell them \ninto the market or hold them until they are paid off. In either \ninstance, it is very likely the taxpayers' dollars will be recovered; \nthat there will be no loss to the taxpayer.\n  So when we hear these people in the public market, these talking \nheads, so to say, claim we are about to spend $700 billion to benefit \nWall Street, they are totally inaccurate. Actually, what we are doing \nis we are trying to spend money to free up credit on Main Street so \npeople can keep their jobs and at the same time do it in a way that \nprotects the taxpayers of America by getting value back.\n  Now, after the original proposal came up here from the Treasury, at \nthe request of the Congress, through the negotiation process with House \nand Senate Democrats and House and Senate Republicans at the table, we \nalso did a few other things which I think were very good.\n\n  No. 1, we said any revenues we get from this--and we are going to get \na lot of revenues. If we spend $700 billion, we may get $600 billion \nback, maybe $700 billion or we may get $800 billion back. All those \nrevenues will go to reduce the Federal debt. It is not going to go to \nnew programs. It goes to reduce the Federal debt. We intend to protect \nthe taxpayer.\n  In addition, we said that if somebody participates in this program, \nwe are not going to allow them to get a windfall. We are going to put a \nstrict limit on their ability to get excess compensation if they are \nsenior members of the company that participates. We are going to limit \ngolden parachutes. We are going to make it clear that there can't be \nthat type of gaming of the system.\n  In addition, we are going to take something called warrants on behalf \nof the American taxpayer. That says if there is an upside--beyond just \ngetting the money back from the notes we take--if there is an upside to \nthat company, we may benefit in it. If we buy the nonperforming debt \noff the books of the company at too high a price and there is a \ndownside, the company will have to give us some equity to cover that. \nSo the taxpayer, again, is protected, and we don't have excessive \ncompensation.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we put in language, under the leadership of \nthe chairman of the committee, Senator Dodd, which we said that for \npeople in their homes the stress will be to keep them in their homes. \nThe prejudice will be to keep them in their homes. We don't want \nforeclosures.\n  Equally importantly, we put in place tremendous regulatory oversight \nso there will be absolute transparency and so the American people can \nlook at what is happening and know what is happening and know what is \nbeing done. It will be reviewed. We have an oversight board headed up \nby the Federal Reserve Chairman, we have an oversight board for the \nCongress, and we have a special prosecutor and a special GAO team. In \naddition, we have a number of reports which are necessary to go \nforward.\n  Now, if we do all this, will it solve the problem? Is the economy \nsuddenly going to turn around? No. No, it is not. We are in a very \ndifficult economic time. There will be other failures, there is no \nquestion about it. There will be financial failures, and the economy \nwill probably continue to slow. But if we fail to do this, we will \nconfront catastrophic events which will affect every American in the \narea of their income and their savings. People will lose their jobs if \nwe don't do this, literally hundreds of thousands of people, \npotentially. Tens of thousands anyway. Their assets will be reduced and \ntheir ability to have a normal commercial life on Main Street, to have \na normal activity, will be dramatically harmed.\n  We saw a little glimmer of what is out there if we fail to act on \nMonday, when the stock market fell 777 points, which represented losing \n$1.2 trillion of American assets. That meant pension funds, 401(k)s, \nIRAs, and things people depend on were dramatically reduced. People \nclose to retirement were shocked by that, and all of us were stunned. \nIt was a statement by the markets of what they think would happen if we \ndo not act and act aggressively and boldly, as this proposal is both \naggressive and bold.\n  Some will say: Well, the markets have come back so it doesn't matter. \nLook at that. The markets have come back because they presume the \nCongress will act in a commonsense way and that we will actually pass \nthis piece of legislation.\n  There is no question but that this is a time that tries the political \nsoul of this institution. A ``yes'' vote here, as the Senator from \nConnecticut has mentioned a number of times, doesn't get you a whole \nlot of accolades anywhere. But there are times when, as Members of this \nbody, we have a responsibility to act in a mature, thoughtful, and \nappropriate way, with our fundamental purpose being to avert a clear \nand present crisis that is going to confront this Nation. This is one \nof those times. To do nothing would neither be logical nor responsible. \nSo we need to act. We need to pass this proposal.\n\n  I wish I could say that when we pass this the Nation will suddenly \nfire up and be reenergized and we will not see a further slowdown. That \nis not going to happen. But if we fail to pass this bill, I am fairly \nconfident, as has been said by a number of people, including both \nPresidential candidates, the results will be a great period of trauma \nfor our Nation, especially for everyday Americans who do not deserve \nit. They don't deserve it. That is why it is our responsibility to act \nat this time.\n  This is the vehicle before us. This is the opportunity that presents \nitself, to take action to try to mitigate what will be an \noverwhelmingly damaging event. Therefore, we should be voting for this \npiece of legislation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I don't think 5 minutes would possibly \nbe enough time for me to explain all\n\n[[Page S10247]]\n\nthe things I would like to say. I am sure I could spend an hour talking \nabout credit default swaps. I am sure I could spend 2 days talking \nabout the lack of transparency in the financial markets. I am sure I \ncould spend a lot of time explaining what I think is the right thing we \nshould do to put as much liquidity into the markets as possible. So I \nwill try to be succinct.\n  I came to the Senate knowing what it is like to take a tough vote. To \nmake a decision that is right for the American public. It's most \nimportant to do the right thing. I also know what it is like to see \nmillions of dollars in the stock market go away and watch a stock \nbubble burst. I also know what it is like to stand on the Senate floor, \nas I did 3 years ago, when someone tried to cram legislation in the \nDefense authorization bill to open up drilling in the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge, and I said then that it was the equivalent to legislative \nblackmail.\n  I am not going to vote for this legislation tonight based on whether \nsomeone crams in tax credits, for which I actually have fought so hard. \nI am going to render my decision based on what I think is important for \nthe American people.\n  I think there is something that is missing in our discussion. I \napplaud Chairman Dodd who has worked hard on the Banking Committee. I \napplaud my colleague who just spoke, who spoke eloquently about the \nneed to do something. But the problem with the legislation before us is \nthat it is choosing winners and losers in corporate America. It is \ninserting the Federal Government in a role in which they decide, along \nwith the private sector, exactly how funds should be allocated.\n  I am for the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government backing \nthese institutions. What I am not for is turning the keys to the \nTreasury over to the private sector.\n  There is much we could agree on tonight. We could agree on the new \nchanges to the FDIC rule. We could agree on mark to market accounting \nchanges and to bringing better marketing and accountability to the \nsystem. We could agree on the uptick rule and other predictability \nmeasures that help the market understand that there is a broad \ncommitment by this institution to do something to help stabilize the \nmarkets.\n  But I am very concerned about the ``pick here, pick there'' approach \nthat has transpired in the last several weeks. I ask you to just think \nof one institution, in my State, Washington Mutual--which I would not \nnecessarily applaud for its subprime lending rates or for its use and \nbacking of credit default swaps, but I would ask you to consider the \nfact that as that institution was forced into sale by this Government, \nwho were the winners and losers in that? J.P. Morgan got the assets of \nthat institution and benefitted from that. In fact, J.P. Morgan \npredicted on a conference call the night they acquired Washington \nMutual that after 1 year with their investment, they would have an over \n$500 million return on that investment. That is 27-percent returned in \n1 year.\n  The FDIC got some money out of that, too. And then to say nothing \nabout the over 60,000 shareholders who were wiped out.\n  My complaint is: where is J.P. Morgan who should be standing up for \nthe retirement plans, the deferred compensation plans, and other \npackages that the employees at that company were due?\n  It is very convenient for us to now choose that we are going to add \nto J.P. Morgan's bottom line. In fact, if we would instead do what I am \nsuggesting, we could have an equity proposal instead of having TARP, \nthe Troubled Asset Relief Program, as the roof over America. Instead, \nwe could have an equity program where the United States would leverage \nour capital and spur 10 to 12 times the private sector investment at \nthe same time, our Nation would be better funded, better prepared, for \nthe onslaught of trouble that is still going to remain after we pass \nthis legislation.\n  I could not even get my amendment to be considered. So, so much for \nthe transparency of the Senate.\n  I am going to continue to work for this idea, for equity, for a more \nleveraged position, and that we do the traditional role that Government \nhas done time and time again: to use our equity to leverage the private \nsector to secure our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois wishes to speak. I \nask for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 13 days ago I sat in on a meeting just a \nfew feet away from this Chamber. At this meeting was the Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve and the Secretary of the Treasury. There were about \n12 of us in the room: the leadership from the House and Senate, \nDemocrats and Republicans. I listened as they told us in very serious \ntones that unless we did something, there would be a meltdown of the \nAmerican economy and the global economy. And unless we acted quickly, \nwe could face a collapse of our economy, businesses would fail, people \nwould lose their jobs, they would lose their savings if we did not act.\n  That was a story told to 12 of us at the table who had heard a lot of \nthings as politicians, but we never heard anything like that before. Of \ncourse, it was not told to us in the context of something we had never \nheard or considered. With all of the problems of Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac and Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and AIG, we knew there was a \nproblem with the economy. We didn't know it was that bad.\n  Obviously, the first question is, How did we reach this point, this \nterrible crisis? I think it is very clear how we reached it. We reached \nit with reckless deregulation of the credit industry. We stepped aside \nand allowed these institutions to operate without oversight, without \ntransparency, without accountability, and greed took over. People were \nmaking millions of dollars overnight, and they pushed the Government \naside and said: Don't get in our way. There is money to be made.\n  Of course, we have this because of the reckless behavior of those on \nWall Street who took advantage of the situation and a lot of innocent \npeople. I can recall offering amendments on this floor to stop \npredatory lending practices like the subprime mortgage market \ngenerated. I can recall debating the high priest of deregulation, Phil \nGramm of Texas, who warned that if Durbin's amendment would pass it \nwould destroy the subprime mortgage market. The year was 2001.\n\n  Wouldn't it have been better for America had my amendment passed and \nthat mortgage market come to an end? I lost that amendment on the floor \nof the Senate by a vote of 50 to 49. The subprime mortgage market went \nforward, bringing us to this crisis today.\n  The bill produced by this administration, by Treasury Secretary \nPaulson, a three-page bill, easily read, was a stunning grab at power. \nIt said there would be no accountability, that the actions of the \nTreasury Secretary in allocating $700 billion of taxpayer money could \nnot be held accountable in any court in this land or by any \nadministrative agency, and that any rules that were drawn up for his \nconduct would not be subject to the normal public approval process. It \nwas an incredible grab for power.\n  We knew there was a crisis, but this was not the answer. Chris Dodd \nof Connecticut and Judd Gregg of New Hampshire went to work with their \ncounterparts in the House, Democrats and Republicans, and made \nsignificant changes in this bill, changes that protect taxpayers on the \nupside so when the companies get well, the money will come back to us \nas it should; to protect, as well, that taxpayers will not pay for the \nmillion-dollar bonuses and golden parachutes of the CEOs who created \nthis mess.\n  If we have to buy their mistakes, for goodness' sake, do we have to \nbuy them a gold watch when they leave? No. In this bill we will not. We \nprovide the oversight to make sure that taxpayer dollars are watched \nclosely. We don't want any single-bid, Halliburton operations. We want \nto make sure this money is well spent by professionals who are held \naccountable.\n  I wish I didn't have to vote for this proposal. I can think of where \n$700 billion could be better spent in America today for families across \nIllinois and across this Nation. I would certainly be coming to the aid \nof those who are facing foreclosure, 10,000 families a day\n\n[[Page S10248]]\n\nwho were lured into the tricks and traps of these rotten mortgages and \nnow stand to lose their homes and everything they ever saved. There is \nnot a penny in this bill for the kind of help they need.\n  We talked about it, but when it came to the bankruptcy provision that \ncould have provided it, guess who overwhelmed us. The banks and the \nmortgage lenders. They had the last word and took out that bankruptcy \nprovision.\n  I thank Chairman Dodd for his efforts in including it, and for a lot \nof others, as well, on the House side. We didn't include it.\n  I wish I didn't have to vote for this bill, but if we fail to act and \nthis economy clearly does go into a meltdown, we cannot say that in \nCongress we have met our responsibility by going home empty-handed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 1 minute 16 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to reserve that time and \nput it into the next bill coming forward, the Amtrak bill, so we would \nthen have 16 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nmajority has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague and friend \nfrom California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I understand I have 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, they say Senators have 6-year terms so \nthey can take tough votes when tough votes are called for, so that they \ncan vote for the best interests of their country even sometimes when \ntheir constituents do not understand it or may be opposed to it.\n  I have received 91,000 phone calls and e-mails from California, \n85,000 of them opposed to this measure. There is a great deal of \nconfusion out there. People don't understand. What was printed most \nprominently was the original Paulson proposal, a proposal which gave \none man control over $700 billion to dispense as he chose, above the \nlaw, with no administrative view or legislative oversight.\n  This is not that proposal. I thank the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, both sides of the Banking Committee. It would be one thing \nif we had a choice, but I do not believe we have a choice. Let me give \nyou an example.\n  In my State, we have 3.5 million small businesses. We have over 20 \nmillion people employed in those small businesses.\n  Now, some businesses function on cash. Most function on credit. When \ncredit is frozen, they cannot make payroll. And when they cannot make a \npayroll, they give out pink slips. So you will see, through electrical \nand plumbing contractors, retail establishments, even grocery stores, \ncomputer stores, automobile sales, we are now hearing from people who \nsay they want to buy a home, they cannot get a mortgage; they want to \nget a car, they cannot get a loan. This is what is beginning to happen.\n  This is not a give-away. This essentially is a strategic plan to buy \nassets, both good and bad, to pump liquidity into the market, to be \nable to free up credit, so that once again the economy can function. \nThe Government will hold these assets. Over time we believe they will \nmake money, and the Government will be the first paid back.\n  So I think if we do care about the livelihood of our constituents, \nthere is only one vote and it is yes.\n  This bill is not the bill that was put forward by Secretary Paulson \non September 20. His bill was essentially a nonstarter--startling in \nits unbridled allocation of power to one man: the Secretary of Treasury \nwhom we know now, and to a Secretary of Treasury after January whom we \ndo not know.\n  It placed this man above the law, above administrative oversight and \nabove congressional action, and essentially gave him $700 billion to do \nwith what he thought best.\n  This bill didn't fly with virtually anyone who looked at it, \nparticularly constituents, who have called in the tens of thousands of \nphone calls all across this land.\n  My office has received over 91,000 calls and e-mails with over 86,000 \nopposed. The bill before us is not Paulson's 3-page proposal. Rather, \nit is a bipartisan effort that adds oversight, accountability, \nassistance to homeowners, executive compensation limits, and other \nmeasures to protect taxpayers.\n  But there still is a lot of misinformation on this bill.\n  This is not a $700 billion gift for Wall Street.\n  Rather, the--Federal Government will buy equity in certain assets, \nboth good and bad to pump liquidity into the marketplace and unfreeze \ncredit which is increasingly freezing and unavailable.\n  Over time, these assets will be sold and the Federal Government will \nbe the first paid back on the investment. The belief is that by doing \nthis the Federal Government will clear much of the bad debt on the \nbooks of certain strategic financial institutions, restoring stability, \nadding liquidity, and unfreezing credit.\n  Recently, we have seen major U.S. institutions fail: Bear Stearns, \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and AIG. \nAnd, two retail banks, not investment banks: Washington Mutual and \nWachovia. If we do nothing, more institutions will fail.\n  Now, you may say: What does this mean to me? I work hard, I pay my \nbills, I pay cash.\n  Here's what it will mean to you: It will be harder for most Americans \nto get any credit. Therefore, jobs will be lost.\n  And we may well face a deep recession.\n  California has 3.75 million small businesses with an average of 5.6 \nemployees. That adds up to over 20 million jobs.\n  Some of these businesses are funded with cash, but most are funded \nwith credit. When credit freezes, payrolls cannot be met. And when \npayrolls cannot be met, pink slips are sent out.\n  And this will happen to retailers, grocery stores, restaurants, \nelectrical and plumbing contractors, apparel manufacturers, computer \nand electronics stores, and auto dealerships.\n  Sales at auto dealerships have fallen dramatically in the past year. \nFord sales are down 34 percent, Chrysler sales are down 33 percent, \nToyota sales are down 29 percent, and GM sales are down 16 percent.\n  The list will go on and on.\n  Importantly, there have now been several improvements to this bill. \nFirst, The FDIC insurance rate covering bank deposits has been \nincreased from $100,000 to $250,000. Americans will know that their \ndeposits are secure up to $250,000.\n  The legislation will provide tax relief to working families.\n  One example: the Alternative Minimum Tax is a real problem. It was \nmeant to apply only to 200 wealthy people, but it was never adjusted \nfor inflation and it has crept down the income scale to the point where \nmore than 25 million taxpayers today may well have to pay an \nAlternative Minimum Tax.\n  In California, 700,000 people paid this tax last year. But 4 million \nCalifornians will pay that tax this year unless we take action.\n  This bill takes that action. For 1 year it will prevent this tax \nincrease.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has reviewed this bill and concluded \nthat the net cost to taxpayers is ``likely to be substantially less \nthan $700 billion.''\n  Again, these investments are first in line to be paid back.\n  It must be remembered that there was a great deal of criticism when \nthe U.S. Government bailed out Mexico in 1996 with $20 billion. The \nfact is, the money was paid back ahead of time and $600 million in \nprofit was made.\n  Let me give you the following points. This bill mandates that the \nGovernment provide loan modifications for the subprime mortgages it \nacquires. This will help keep families in homes rather than foreclosing \nand putting the house on a deteriorating housing market where property \nvalues drop and homes are looted. The bill limits executive \ncompensation. It provides strong oversight and accountability, \nincluding a financial stability oversight board, a\n\n[[Page S10249]]\n\nfive-member congressional oversight panel, an inspector general, and a \nconstant presence at Treasury by the Government Accountability Office.\n  This is the only choice Congress can make.\n  One can rail against it and vote ``no'' on it, but that is not going \nto solve the problem. We have one chance, and one chance only, to solve \nthe problem, and it is this bill.\n  I wish I could write it differently. Others wish they could write it \ndifferently, but the fact is that we are faced with this. Again, there \nis no question this is a tough vote.\n  But there is no question that this is a vote that I believe has to be \nmade.\n\n\n                          CONTRACTING PROCESS\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Chairman Dodd, with the scale of this undertaking and \nthe volume of assets that will be managed, I want to ensure that the \ncontracting provisions for asset managers under the package lead to the \nengagement of financially sound institutions that have the best and \nbrightest financial minds.\n  The package gives the Treasury Secretary broad authority, including \nthe explicit authority to waive certain portions of Federal acquisition \nregulations when retaining asset managers. Along those lines, I want to \nensure that, despite the safeguards that have been provided, the \nSecretary does not take a narrow approach but, rather, seeks the \nbroadest collection of asset management experts to assist him. \nTherefore, I ask my colleague from Connecticut, the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, do you believe that it is the intent of Congress \nthat the contracting process must be as full and open as possible and \nthat the Secretary should consider a broad range of asset managers, \nincluding broker-dealers, insurers, and other experts?\n  Mr. DODD. I absolutely agree with the gentleman from New Jersey. The \nscale of this undertaking is vast, and the exposure to the taxpayer \nmust be well managed. Therefore, I urge the Secretary to look broadly \nfor the best expertise in assisting him in managing this program.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                                BIOMASS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have been working with \nChairman Baucus and his staff for the past year on an amendment to the \nsection 45 production tax credit. My amendment modifies the definitions \nof qualified open-loop and closed-loop biomass facilities to clarify \nthat additional power generation units placed in service at existing \nqualified facilities are eligible for the production tax credit.\n  This clarification was necessary to remove an ambiguity as to whether \nsuch additional units of power qualify for credit. This ambiguity was \ninadvertently created by language in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 \nrelating to additional units of power appended to municipal sold waste \nfacilities.\n  As you know, my concern has been that the failure to clarify that \nadditional units of power do qualify for the credit will discourage \ntaxpayers from expanding existing biomass electricity production \nfacilities and, thus, from producing more renewable biomass \nelectricity.\n  However, it appears that the language that was adopted by the Senate \non September 23 does not achieve the goal of eliminating this ambiguity \nin all circumstances. Is that your understanding as well?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, it is. I understand your concern that the language \nin the bill we adopted on September 23 could still leave some taxpayers \nin an ambiguous position with respect to additional units of power \nadded to biomass facilities qualifying for the credit. Let me assure \nyou that my staff and I will continue to work with you to address this \nmatter.\n  Ms. SNOWE: I want to thank the chairman of the Finance Committee as \nwell as Senator Bill Nelson for their work on addressing the \nincremental biomass production ambiguity. Clearly, at a time when our \nNation's manufacturing industry is besieged by historic energy costs, \nwe must provide the incentives for expanded biomass production. The \nproduction tax credit was intended to be provided for companies that \nexpand their production in and beyond 2005, and I believe we must have \nconcise and clear language that these facilities should receive the \ncredit for producing renewable energy in their operations. I look \nforward to working with Chairman Baucus, Ranking Member Grassley, and \nSenator Nelson to reconcile this inadvertent confusion.\n\n\n                            basis reporting\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the energy policy in the pending \nlegislation is partially paid for by a proposal that requires brokers \nto report to their clients and to the IRS the basis of securities that \nare sold during the year. This provision expands existing information \nreporting requirements that require brokers to report the sales \nproceeds of securities that are sold. The IRS estimates that in 2001 \nthe tax gap associated with all capital gains was about $11 billion. \nProviding this information will reduce burden on axpayers and increase \nthe accuracy of tax returns that are filed.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Senator Baucus and I asked the Government \nAccountability Office to review the accuracy of tax returns that are \nfiled reporting capital gains. The GAO found that as many as 7 million \nindividual taxpayers, or 36 percent, who sold securities in 2001 may \nhave misreported capital gains or losses, and around half of those \ntaxpayers did so because they misreported their basis. This information \nreporting proposal will reduce errors and help taxpayers to file their \nreturns more accurately.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Congress intends that the Treasury Department issue \nguidance and regulations that will help brokers implement this \nreporting requirement, including the issue of year-end \nreclassifications. The existing regulatory authority under Internal \nRevenue Code section 6045 fully applies to the new basis reporting \nrules proposed in this legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Congress further intends that the IRS will exercise \nits administrative authority to revise forms and take other actions as \nappropriate to help brokers and taxpayers understand and comply with \nthis new law so that burden is reduced, errors decrease, and compliance \nis enhanced.\n\n\n                           VEHICLE TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to seek clarification of an \nimportant provision that was included in the tax extenders package that \nthe Senate approved on September 23.\n  As my good friend knows, the Senate amendment to H.R. 6049 \nestablishes in section 205 a new tax credit for plug-in electric drive \nvehicles. The credit is for passenger vehicles and light trucks and \nvaries in amount depending on the vehicle's weight and battery \ncapacity. Your leadership has been critical to securing this credit, \nwhich I strongly support because it will help reduce America's \ndependence on foreign oil by giving people incentives to build and \npurchase advanced, fuel-efficient vehicles.\n  Indiana has consistently been a key contributor to innovation in \nvehicle manufacturing. We are proud that our auto manufacturers and \nsuppliers are focused on building the next generation of fuel-efficient \nvehicles and components. This plug-in electric drive motor vehicle tax \ncredit is essential to help consumers overcome any hesitation to \npurchase these vehicles and to provide investors with confidence that \nthe Government is committed to the electrification of our Nation's \ntransportation sector.\n  Section 205 of the Senate-passed amendment to H.R. 6049 describes the \nvehicles that would qualify for the tax credit. Eligible vehicles \ninclude, in part, motor vehicles with at least a 4 kilowatt hour \nbattery used for propulsion, an offboard energy source to recharge the \nbattery, and in the case of passenger vehicles or light trucks of no \nmore than 8,500 pounds, a certificate of conformity under the Clean Air \nAct.\n  The bill language does not expressly state whether a van would \nqualify, but many commercial and government fleets use vans.\n  The relevant Environmental Protection Agency regulations referred to \nby the bill, such as 40 C.F.R. 86.082-2, define a van as a ``light-duty \ntruck.'' It would appear that the committee intends that a plug-in \nelectric drive van, meeting the appropriate weight and emission \nstandards, would qualify for the new tax credit for plug-in electric \ndrive motor vehicles. Mr. Chairman, is this analysis of the committee's \nintent correct?\n\n[[Page S10250]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. To my good friend from Indiana, the answer is yes. The \nnew tax credit for plug-in electric drive motor vehicles was intended \nto be, within weight and emission limits, vehicle design neutral. Vans \nare clearly a subset of light trucks and would be eligible if they meet \nthe weight, energy, and emission criteria under the provision.\n\n\n                  administrative procedures act review\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. As the Senate considers extraordinary legislation to \naddress the current economic crisis, I believe it is imperative for the \nRecord to reflect the intent behind the provisions I worked with \nSenator Dodd to include in this legislation. In an effort to ensure \nthat there is no doubt about what we intended, I would ask the Banking \nCommittee chairman, Senator Dodd, whether it is his understanding that \nour efforts to ensure that any actions taken by the Treasury Secretary, \nunder the authority of this legislation, be reviewable under the \nAdministrative Procedures Act.\n  Mr. DODD. I would say to the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee that is what we intend.\n  M. LEAHY. And the provision we have included in section 119 of the \nSenate's legislation, to ensure that this review is available, the word \n``law,'' as it is used, means any State or Federal law, or common law \ninterpreting such State and Federal laws?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes. The Senator from Vermont is correct. My understanding \nand intent is that this section would allow for review in the event any \naction by the Treasury Secretary was in violation of any State or \nFederal statute, or common law interpreting a statute.\n  Mr. LEAHY: I thank the Senator. It is not our intent to permit the \nTreasury Secretary to quash or alter any private right of action on the \npart of shareholders of entities from which the Secretary purchases \nassets, nor allow the Secretary to confer immunity from suit any \nparticipating financial institution.\n  Mr. DODD. I would say to the Senator from Vermont that is correct as \nwell.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And with the savings clause we have added to the \nlegislation, we also intend to prohibit the Treasury Secretary from \ninterfering with or impairing in any way the claims or defenses \navailable to any other person. For example, no person's claims in \nrelation to any assets purchased by the Treasury Secretary under the \nTruth in Lending Act should be impaired, and no person who has been \nharmed by the conduct of a financial institution should have their \nclaims affected in any way. Is this the understanding of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut as well?\n  Mr. DODD. It is. That is what we intend.\n   Mr. LEAHY. And by agreeing with the administration's request to \nautomatically stay on appeal injunctions issued against the Treasury \nSecretary for actions taken under the authority of this legislation, we \nhave assured that existing waivers of sovereign immunity under the \nTucker Act, the Contracts Dispute Act, the Little Tucker Act, the \nFederal Tort Claims Act, and relevant civil rights laws would apply to \nthe Treasury Department's new responsibilities, just as these laws have \napplied to the Treasury Department's actions prior to the bailout \nmeasure. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. I say to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee that is \nwhat we intend with the savings clause.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We also included a provision to make sure that mortgagers \nwhose mortgages are purchased by the Treasury maintain all of the \nclaims and defenses they have in relation to those loans, whether \npursuant to their contracts, or under State or Federal consumer \nprotection law. It is not our intent to deprive homeowners any recourse \nthey may have against lenders who committed fraud or other violations \nof law in inducing any homeowner into taking a mortgage. Does the \nChairman of the Banking Committee agree with me on this point?\n  Mr. DODD. I do.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And finally, I ask as a general matter whether the Senator \nfrom Connecticut agrees with me that civil litigation brought by \nshareholders, or by or on behalf of financial institutions that \npurchased troubled assets, against officers, directors, and in some \ncases counterparties whose alleged misconduct caused or contributed to \ntheir losses, are matters for the justice system to resolve?\n  Mr. DODD. I agree with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished, chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Dodd, for engaging in this colloquy. And I thank him \nfor consulting me early in this process to ensure that any legislation \nthe Senate considers contains appropriate safeguards to ensure that the \nextraordinary authority given to the Treasury Secretary is reviewable, \nand that the rights of American citizens are preserved.\n\n\n                      auto financing company loans\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. As Treasury implements this new program, it is clear to me \nfrom reading the definition of financial institution that auto \nfinancing companies would be among the many financial institutions that \nwould be eligible sellers to the government. Do you agree?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, for purposes of this act, I agree that financial \ninstitution may encompass auto financing companies.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. It also seems clear from the \ndefinition of troubled assets that, should the Treasury Secretary, \nafter consulting with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, determine \nthat purchasing auto loans would promote financial market stability by \nopening up the market for car sales, that Treasury has the authority to \nmake such purchases, so long as it transmits that determination to \nCongress.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, should the Treasury Secretary, after consulting with \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve System, determine that purchasing \nauto loans is necessary to promote financial market stability and \ntransmits such determination in writing to the Congress, then the \nTreasury Secretary could engage in such purchases.\n  I am keenly aware of these issues as Chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over financial aid to commerce and \nindustry and which wrote the Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of \n1979.\n  Ms. STABENOW. First, I want to commend Chairman Dodd for his \nleadership on this bill. The credit crisis is having a significant \nimpact on the hard-working men and women at GM in Michigan and \nthroughout the country who proudly build American-made cars and trucks; \nthe men and women who sell and finance Chrysler vehicles; and the \nindividuals who service Ford vehicles in dealerships throughout the \ncountry.\n  With the credit markets having largely frozen up, domestic automobile \nmanufacturers and finance companies face the most difficult conditions \nthey have faced in decades. They have been hit with a double whammy: \nhigh gasoline and diesel prices, coupled with evaporating credit.\n  Considering the importance of the auto industry to our country I \nwanted to reiterate the points raised by my colleague, by clarifying \nthat the Treasury has the authority to purchase auto loans and that \nauto financing companies could participate in the program if determined \nnecessary by the Treasury, after consulting with the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve System, to promote market stability.\n  Mr. DODD. This is correct. As previously stated, an auto financing \ncompany could be included in the definition of financial institution \nand auto debt could be included in the definition of troubled assets \nafter the appropriate steps are taken.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chairman. By getting credit back into the \nhands of our motor vehicle industry, we can help Main Street survive \nthe credit crunch. We can get people back to work. And we can get cars \nand trucks moving again throughout the country.\n\n\n                 definition of a financial institution\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to ask of the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Development a question.\n  Is it Chairman Dodd's understanding that the definition of a \nfinancial institution in section 3(5) of the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act includes the holding companies of such institutions \ndescribed as ``any bank, savings association, credit union, security \nbroker or dealer or insurance company''?\n\n[[Page S10251]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, I completely agree that this would include holding \ncompanies of such companies listed and other companies that the \nSecretary may determine are eligible for this program.\n  Mr. REED. Section 113(d) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act \nstates that warrants should be issued for companies that sell their \nassets to the Secretary, under the requirements of the section. Is it \nChairman Dodd's understanding that if a company selling such assets is \na subsidiary that is not traded on an exchange but that has a holding \ncompany or parent that is traded on an exchange, that the stock of such \nholding or parent company would be referenced in the warrant?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, it is the intent of the committee and of the Congress \nthat this section intends that the securities of the parent or holding \ncompany of such a subsidiary would be used in the warrant. Nothing in \nthis language is intended to exclude holding companies of subsidiaries \nand warrants should be exercised to the greatest extent possible for \nthe benefit of the taxpayer.\n  Mr. REED. If I could ask one more question of the chairman, certain \noff-balance sheet entities or affiliates may sell troubled assets to \nthe Government, to include but not limited to structured investment \nvehicles, qualified special purpose entities, special purpose entities, \nconduits, shell companies, and other legal entities. Is it the case \nthat such entities or their holding or parent company would be required \nto enter into warrants with the Government?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, I agree that this is the case and that it was the \noriginal intent of the committee and of the Congress to ensure that \nwarrants are exercised to the greatest extent for the benefit of the \ntaxpayer, to include recovery of losses and administrative expenses \nalong with a premium set by Treasury.\n\n\n                         tax credit investments\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to commend the senior Senator from \nConnecticut, who chairs the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \nAffairs, for the extraordinary effort he and his staff have put in over \nthe past several days to bring us to the point where we are preparing \nto vote on an economic stabilization package. While we all regret being \nin this situation, I think there is widespread recognition that we need \nto act to get our financial and credit markets operating again.\n  I have one particular concern I would like to address to the \nchairman, if I may. One of the problems created by the turmoil in the \nfinancial and credit markets is that many of the institutions needing \nliquidity, or those which normally would provide liquidity to the \nmarketplace, hold illiquid low-income housing tax credit investments, \nmany of which require further funding. These tax credit investments \nexist at the expense of the Federal Government since the holders of \nthese investments achieve their return by taking credits against their \ntaxes in the form of the section 42 low-income housing tax credit, \nLIHTC. Among the institutions with substantial holdings and which have \nhistorically provided liquidity to this market, but which can and no \nlonger do so, are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as several of the \nbanking institutions which have been most adversely affected by the \ncrisis in the markets. The ability of these institutions to use the \ncredits has been severely impaired, and I am deeply concerned that, as \nwith so many other financial assets, the holders will dump them into \nthe market at distressed prices. The buyers at these distressed prices \nwill be the very institutions that would have bought new credits at \nnondistressed prices. The result will be that instead of investing new \nmoney in new affordable housing, these buyers will instead use that \nmoney to buy existing credits at distressed prices and much less money \nwill flow into the production of new affordable housing in the next few \nyears. In fact, the turmoil in the capital markets has already severely \nrestricted the flow of new funds into new affordable housing and this \nmarket has taken a serious downturn at a time when adding to the stock \nof affordable housing is critically important.\n  I would like to ask Chairman Dodd if he believes that his amendment \nto H.R. 1424--specifically, section 3(9)(A) of division A--gives the \nFederal Government authority under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, \nTARP, to purchase existing low-income housing tax credit investments \nfrom the holders of those investments. Unlike many of the other assets \nthe Government may purchase in other sectors, these investments can be \npurchased at little or no cost to the Treasury because the Government \nis already paying for them in the form of tax credits.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to assure my colleague from Maryland \nthat I read that language as allowing such purchases, if necessary, to \nmaintain liquidity in this particular market. I want to commend him for \nbringing this important matter to my attention as soon as we received \nthe original Treasury proposal. My staff informed Senator Cardin's \nstaff that Treasury officials believed the proposal they sent to \nCongress authorized the purchase of such credits, and we concurred.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank the chairman for reassuring me. I think Treasury \nwould bolster the market tremendously if it purchases such credits \nwhere necessary to: (1) create liquidity for those financial \ninstitutions currently holding these credits; and (2) stimulate the \nproduction of affordable housing in a market which has deteriorated \nsubstantially--all at little cost to the Government.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my colleague from Maryland has made an \nexcellent suggestion for how Treasury ought to maintain liquidity with \nregard to the LIHTC. I thank him for his concern. The housing crisis in \nthis country affects nearly everyone in some respect, including lower \nincome individuals and families who cannot afford to buy homes and \ndepend on the steady supply of affordable rental housing. My amendment \nto H.R. 1424 gives Treasury the authority, flexibility, and resources \nit needs to address this critical issue.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his assistance on \nthis matter. We are being reminded, in the most painful way, that not \nall Americans can afford or want to own a home. Therefore, it is \nimperative that we maintain and add to the stock of affordable rental \nhousing in this country during these difficult times. The LIHTC is the \nmechanism for doing that.\n\n\n                           section 101(c)(1)\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman of the \nSenate Banking Committee, the Senator from Connecticut, a question \nabout the intent of section 101(c)(1) of the substitute amendment to \nH.R. 1424.\n  Section 101(c)(1) of the bill provides the Secretary with direct \nhiring authority, which is a useful tool to allow a Federal agency to \nmake an immediate employment offer to an applicant. It is my \nunderstanding that this provision merely waives the normal approval \nprocess of direct hiring authority by the Office of Personnel \nManagement and that section 101(c) does not otherwise waive application \nof title 5. Does the chairman agree with my interpretation?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Hawaii's \ninterpretation of that provision.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the Senator very much for that clarification.\n\n\n                      carbon dioxide sequestration\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with my \ngood friend Senator Baucus, the distinguished chairman of the Committee \non Finance. I wish to address section 115 of the bill, which provides a \ntax credit for carbon dioxide sequestration. Specifically, in section \n115 of the bill, new section 45Q(d)(2) of the code provides that the \nSecretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Administrator of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, shall establish regulations for \ndetermining adequate security measures for the geological storage of \ncarbon dioxide to qualify for the $20 per ton credit, such that the \ncarbon dioxide does not escape into the atmosphere or affect \nunderground sources of drinking water. Carbon dioxide sequestration in \nthis provision includes storage at deep saline formations and unminable \ncoal seems under such conditions as the Secretary may determine under \nthese regulations. Is my understanding correct that the legislation is \nintended to require that EPA, in consultation with the Secretary of the \nTreasury regarding the carbon sequestration tax credit under this \nprovision, will establish the\n\n[[Page S10252]]\n\nspecific substantive environmental criteria and requirements for \nsecurity and other measures for the geologic storage of carbon dioxide \nsuch that it does not escape into the atmosphere or affect underground \nsources of drinking water, and that the Secretary of the Treasury will \nthen apply such criteria and requirements in establishing the \nrequirements to qualify for the tax credit under this section?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works is correct. The legislation \nis intended to leave the substantive environmental criteria and \nrequirements for carbon sequestration to EPA, including security-\nrelated issues, and as was done with respect to carbon sequestration in \nsection 706 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, this \nprovision is not intended to limit the legal requirements and \nauthorities of EPA. EPA's criteria and requirements for carbon \nsequestration will be applied by the Secretary of the Treasury after \nconsultation.\n\n\n                   foreclosure prevention provisions\n\n  Mr. REID. I would like to ask the chairman of the Committee, Senator \nDodd, a question about the elements of this bill that deal with \nforeclosure prevention. I know this has been a priority for the Senator \nfrom Connecticut. I wonder if he could review the provisions of the \nlegislation that will help more Americans keep their homes.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the leader for his question and for his leadership \nin helping guide us through this crisis. He is exactly right. I have \nbeen saying throughout this process that foreclosure prevention has \nbeen one of the key reasons we need to move forward with the Emergency \nEconomic Stabilization Act.\n  The legislation has a number of key provisions dealing with \nforeclosure prevention:\n  First, it requires that the Secretary of the Treasury ``implement a \nplan that seeks to maximize assistance for homeowners'' in keeping \ntheir homes. This means Congress has rejected an ad hoc approach by the \nTreasury in favor of a programwide system to keep families in homes.\n  In the case where the Secretary owns whole loans, we expect him to \nmodify those loans to ensure long-term affordability for American \nfamilies. The legislation outlines that this should be done by a \nreduction in principal, a reduction in the interest rate, a refinance \nthrough the HOPE for Homeowners Program, or any equivalent method that \nensures that these hard working Americans are restored to sustainable \nhome ownership.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that millions of Americans were sold \nloans that the mortgage brokers and lenders knew or should have known \nthe borrowers could never afford. These ``exploding'' adjustable rate \nmortgages, ARMs, interest-only loans, and payment-option ARMs were \ndesigned to entice borrowers with low initial payments. Yet, after a \ncouple of years, the payments would explode, increasing by 20 percent, \n30 percent, or more. This is driving delinquency and foreclosure rates \nto historically high levels and driving home prices down, creating the \neconomic downturn we are now facing.\n  Second, all other Federal agencies that own or control mortgages, \nincluding the FDIC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, FHFA, and the \nFederal Reserve Board, must also implement plans to maximize assistance \nto homeowners. The FDIC, under the leadership of Chairman Sheila Bair, \nhas already started down this road with the assets it has taken from \nIndyMac Bank, and we expect the other agencies to work with the FDIC in \ndeveloping their own programs. The FHFA, which is the conservator for \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, now oversees hundreds of billions of \ndollars of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, MBS, which they \nwill now be obligated to aggressively modify as a result of this \nlegislation.\n  Third, one of the serious complications the modern mortgage market \nhas created is the difficulty of doing modifications for loans that \nhave been pooled and securitized into a host of MBS. It is often \ndifficult to get the various investors in the numerous MBS backed by a \nparticular pool of mortgages to all agree to do a modification.\n  This legislation, however, mandates that the Treasury and the other \nFederal agencies that own or control MBS must aggressively pursue loan \nmodifications with other investors and must consent to all requests \nfrom servicers for reasonable modifications. In fact, it is our hope \nthat the Federal Government will gain control of sufficient percentages \nof these pools that their ongoing pursuit of modifications and \nreasonableness in their willingness to accept offers that ensure \nfamilies can keep their homes will tip the balance and lead to more \nmodifications.\n  Finally, this bill includes three new provisions for the HOPE for \nHomeowners that should expand its reach and allow us to help many more \nhomeowners avoid foreclosure and get into affordable, stable, FHA-\ninsured mortgages.\n  As I have been saying for well over a year, the epicenter of the \ncurrent financial and economic crisis is the housing crisis and the \nheart of the housing crisis is the foreclosure crisis. I understand the \nneed to move to stabilize the financial system as a whole--that is why \nI have devoted countless hours over the past weeks to negotiate this \nfinal package.\n  But I would not support this bill, nor ask my colleagues to do so, if \nI was not convinced that it adds important new tools to address the \ncore problem--rising delinquencies and foreclosures. Obviously, this \nbill does not include everything I would want but it is an important \nstep forward.\n  Mr. REID. I want to thank my colleague for laying out these important \npoints. The Senator has been one of the earliest and strongest voices \nraising the alarm about the danger of increased foreclosures. I thank \nhim for his leadership.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the attached technical explanation of the tax provisions of \nthe Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF TITLE III (TAX PROVISIONS) OF DIVISION A OF \n    H.R. 1424, THE ``EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008''\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       This document, prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee \n     on Taxation, provides a technical explanation of Title III \n     (Tax Provisions) of Division A of H.R. 1424, the ``Emergency \n     Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,'' scheduled for \n     consideration by the Senate on October 1, 2008.\n\nA. Treat Gain or Loss from Sale or Exchange of Certain Preferred Stock \n by Applicable Financial Institutions as Ordinary Income or Loss (sec. \n                            301 of the bill)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under section 582(c)(1), the sale or exchange of a bond, \n     debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of \n     indebtedness by a financial institution described in section \n     582(c)(2) is not considered a sale or exchange of a capital \n     asset. The financial institutions described in section \n     582(c)(2) are (i) any bank (including any corporation which \n     would be a bank except for the fact that it is a foreign \n     corporation), (ii) any financial institution referred to in \n     section 591, which includes mutual savings banks, cooperative \n     banks, domestic building and loan associations, and other \n     savings institutions chartered and supervised as savings and \n     loan or similar associations under Federal or State law, \n     (iii) any small business investment company operating under \n     the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, and (iv) any \n     business development corporation, defined as a corporation \n     which was created by or pursuant to an act of a State \n     legislature for purposes of promoting, maintaining, and \n     assisting the economy and industry within such State on a \n     regional or statewide basis by making loans to be used in \n     trades and businesses which would generally not be made by \n     banks within such region or State in the ordinary course of \n     their business (except on the basis of a partial \n     participation) and which is operated primarily for such \n     purposes. In the case of a foreign corporation, section \n     582(c)(1) applies only with respect to gains or losses that \n     are effectively connected with the conduct of a banking \n     business in the United States.\n       Preferred stock issued by the Federal National Mortgage \n     Corporation (``Fannie Mae'') or the Federal Home Loan \n     Mortgage Corporation (``Freddie Mac'') is not treated as \n     indebtedness for Federal income tax purposes, and therefore \n     is not treated as an asset to which section 582(c)(1) \n     applies. Accordingly, a financial institution described in \n     section 582(c)(2) that holds Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac \n     preferred stock as a capital asset generally will recognize \n     capital gain or loss upon the sale or taxable exchange of \n     that stock. Section 1211 provides that, in the case of a \n     corporation, losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets \n     are allowed only to the extent of gains from such sales or \n     exchanges. Thus, in taxable years in which a\n\n[[Page S10253]]\n\n     corporation does not recognize gain from the sale of capital \n     assets, its capital losses do not reduce its income.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       Under the provision, gain or loss recognized by an \n     ``applicable financial institution'' from the sale or \n     exchange of ``applicable preferred stock'' is treated as \n     ordinary income or loss. An applicable financial institution \n     is a financial institution referred to in section 582(c)(2) \n     or a depository institution holding company (as defined in \n     section 3(w)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 \n     U.S.C. 1813(w)(1)). Applicable preferred stock is preferred \n     stock of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac that was (i) held by the \n     applicable financial institution on September 6, 2008, or \n     (ii) was sold or exchanged by the applicable financial \n     institution on or after January 1, 2008, and before September \n     7, 2008.\n       In the case of a sale or exchange of applicable preferred \n     stock on or after January 1, 2008, and before September 7, \n     2008, the provision applies only to taxpayers that were \n     applicable financial institutions at the time of such sale or \n     exchange. In the case of a sale or exchange of applicable \n     preferred stock after September 6, 2008, by a taxpayer that \n     held such preferred stock on September 6, 2008, the provision \n     applies only where the taxpayer was an applicable financial \n     institution at all times .during the period beginning on \n     September 6, 2008, and ending on the date of the sale or \n     exchange of the applicable preferred stock. Thus, the \n     provision is generally inapplicable to any Fannie Mae or \n     Freddie Mac preferred stock held by a taxpayer that was not \n     an applicable financial institution on September 6, 2008 \n     (even if such taxpayer subsequently became an applicable \n     financial institution).\n       The provision grants the Secretary authority to extend the \n     provision to cases in which gain or loss is recognized on the \n     sale or exchange of applicable preferred stock acquired in a \n     carryover basis transaction by an applicable financial \n     institution after September 6, 2008. For example, if after \n     September 6, 2008, Bank A, an entity that was an applicable \n     financial institution at all times during the period \n     beginning on September 6, 2008, acquired assets of Bank T, \n     an entity that also was an applicable financial \n     institution at all times during the period beginning on \n     September 6, 2008, in a transaction in which no gain or \n     loss was recognized under section 368(a)(1), regulations \n     could provide that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock that \n     was applicable preferred stock in the hands of Bank T will \n     continue to be applicable preferred stock in the hands of \n     Bank A.\n       In addition, the Secretary may, through regulations, extend \n     the provision to cases in which the applicable financial \n     institution is a partner in a partnership that (i) held \n     preferred stock of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac on September 6, \n     2008, and later sold or exchanged such stock, or (ii) sold or \n     exchanged such preferred stock on or after January 1, 2008, \n     and before September 7, 2008. It is intended that Treasury \n     guidance will provide that loss (or gain) attributable to \n     Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac preferred stock of a partnership is \n     characterized as ordinary in the hands of a partner only if \n     the partner is an applicable financial institution, and only \n     if the institution would have been eligible for ordinary \n     treatment under section 301 of the bill had the institution \n     held the underlying preferred stock directly for the time \n     period during which both (i) the partnership holds the \n     preferred stock and (ii) the institution holds substantially \n     the same partnership interest.\n       In particular, substantial amounts of the preferred stock \n     of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are held through ``pass-through \n     trusts'' analyzed as partnerships for Federal income tax \n     purposes. Substantially all the assets of such a pass-through \n     trust comprise Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac preferred stock, and \n     the trust in turn passes through dividends received on such \n     stock to its two outstanding classes of certificates \n     (partnership interests): an auction-rate class, where the \n     share of the underlying preferred stock dividend is \n     determined by periodic auctions, and a residual class, which \n     receives the remainder of any dividends received on the \n     underlying stock. The bill's delegation of authority to the \n     Secretary anticipates that regulations will promptly be \n     issued confirming in general that losses recognized by such a \n     trust on or after January 1, 2008, in respect of the \n     preferred stock of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac that it acquired \n     before September 6, 2008, will be characterized as ordinary \n     loss in the hands of a certificate holder that is an \n     applicable financial institution and that would be eligible \n     for the relief contemplated by this provision if the \n     applicable financial institution had held the underlying \n     preferred stock directly for the same period that it held the \n     pass-through certificate. In light of the substantial amount \n     of such pass-through certificates in the marketplace, and the \n     importance of the prompt resolution of the character of any \n     resulting losses allocated to certificate holders that are \n     applicable financial institutions for purposes of their \n     regulatory and investor financial statement filings, \n     unnecessary disruptions to the marketplace could best be \n     avoided if the Secretary were to exercise the regulatory \n     authority granted under the provision to address this case as \n     soon as possible and, in any event, by October 31, 2008.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       This provision applies to sales or exchanges occurring \n     after December 31, 2007, in taxable years ending after such \n     date.\n\n    B. Special Rules for Tax Treatment of Executive Compensation of \nEmployers Participating in the Troubled Assets Relief Program (sec. 302 \n           of the bill and secs. 162(m) and 280G of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       An employer generally may deduct reasonable compensation \n     for personal services as an ordinary and necessary business \n     expense. Sections 162(m) and 280G provide explicit \n     limitations on the deductibility of compensation expenses in \n     the case of corporate employers.\n     Section 162(m)\n\n                               In general\n\n       The otherwise allowable deduction for compensation paid or \n     accrued with respect to a covered employee of a publicly held \n     corporation is limited to no more than $1 million per year. \n     The deduction limitation applies when the deduction would \n     otherwise be taken. Thus, for example, in the case of \n     compensation resulting from a transfer of property in \n     connection with the performance of services, such \n     compensation is taken into account in applying the deduction \n     limitation for the year for which the compensation is \n     deductible under section 83 (i.e., generally the year in \n     which the employee's right to the property is no longer \n     subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture).\n       Covered employees\n       Section 162(m) defines a covered employee as (1) the chief \n     executive officer of the corporation (or an individual acting \n     in such capacity) as of the close of the taxable year and (2) \n     the four most highly compensated officers for the taxable \n     year (other than the chief executive officer). Treasury \n     regulations under section 162(m) provide that whether an \n     employee is the chief executive officer or among the four \n     most highly compensated officers should be determined \n     pursuant to the executive compensation disclosure rules \n     promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 \n     (``Exchange Act'').\n       In 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission amended \n     certain rules relating to executive compensation, including \n     which executive officers' compensation must be disclosed \n     under the Exchange Act. Under the new rules, such officers \n     consist of (1) the principal executive officer (or an \n     individual acting in such capacity), (2) the principal \n     financial officer (or an individual acting in such capacity), \n     and (3) the three most highly compensated executive officers, \n     other than the principal executive officer or financial \n     officer.\n       In response to the Securities and Exchange Commission's new \n     disclosure rules, the Internal Revenue Service issued updated \n     guidance on identifying which employees are covered by \n     section 162(m). The new guidance provides that ``covered \n     employee'' means any employee who is (1) the principal \n     executive officer (or an individual acting in such capacity) \n     defined in reference to the Exchange Act, or (2) among the \n     three most highly compensated officers for the taxable year \n     (other than the principal executive officer), again defined \n     by reference to the Exchange Act. Thus, under current \n     guidance, only four employees are covered under section \n     162(m) for any taxable year. Under Treasury regulations, the \n     requirement that the individual meet the criteria as of the \n     last day of the taxable year applies to both the principal \n     executive officer and the three highest compensated officers.\n       Compensation subject to the deduction limitation\n       In general.--Unless specifically excluded, the deduction \n     limitation applies to all remuneration for services, \n     including cash and the cash value of all remuneration \n     (including benefits) paid in a medium other than cash. If an \n     individual is a covered employee for a taxable year, the \n     deduction limitation applies to all compensation not \n     explicitly excluded from the deduction limitation, regardless \n     of whether the compensation is for services as a covered \n     employee and regardless of when the compensation was earned. \n     The $1 million cap is reduced by excess parachute payments \n     (as defined in sec. 280G, discussed below) that are not \n     deductible by the corporation.\n       Certain types of compensation are not subject to the \n     deduction limit and are not taken into account in determining \n     whether other compensation exceeds $1 million. The following \n     types of compensation are not taken into account: (1) \n     remuneration payable on a commission basis; (2) remuneration \n     payable solely on account of the attainment of one or more \n     performance goals if certain outside director and shareholder \n     approval requirements are met (``performance-based \n     compensation''); (3) payments to a tax-qualified retirement \n     plan (including salary reduction contributions); (4) amounts \n     that are excludable from the executive's gross income (such \n     as employer-provided health benefits and miscellaneous fringe \n     benefits (sec. 132)); and (5) any remuneration payable under \n     a written binding contract which was in effect on February \n     17, 1993. In addition, remuneration does not include \n     compensation for which a deduction is allowable after a \n     covered employee ceases to be a covered employee. Thus, the \n     deduction limitation often does not apply to deferred \n     compensation that is otherwise subject to the deduction \n     limitation (e.g., is not performance-based compensation) \n     because the payment of compensation is deferred until after \n     termination of employment.\n\n[[Page S10254]]\n\n       Performance-based compensation.--Compensation qualifies for \n     the exception for performance-based compensation only if (1) \n     it is paid solely on account of the attainment of one or more \n     performance goals, (2) the performance goals are established \n     by a compensation committee consisting solely of two or more \n     outside directors, (3) the material terms under which the \n     compensation is to be paid, including the performance goals, \n     are disclosed to and approved by the shareholders in a \n     separate vote prior to payment, and (4) prior to payment, the \n     compensation committee certifies that the performance goals \n     and any other material terms were in fact satisfied.\n       Compensation (other than stock options or other stock \n     appreciation rights) is not treated as paid solely on account \n     of the attainment of one or more performance goals unless the \n     compensation is paid to the particular executive pursuant to \n     a pre-established objective performance formula or standard \n     that precludes discretion. Stock options or other stock \n     appreciation rights generally are treated as meeting the \n     exception for performance-based compensation, provided that \n     the requirements for outside director and shareholder \n     approval are met (without the need for certification that the \n     performance standards have been met), because the amount of \n     compensation attributable to the options or other rights \n     received by the executive would be based solely on an \n     increase in the corporation's stock price. Stock-based \n     compensation is not treated as performance-based if it is \n     dependent on factors other than corporate performance. For \n     example, if a stock option is granted to an executive with an \n     exercise price that is less than the current fair market \n     value of the stock at the time of grant, then the executive \n     would have the right to receive compensation on the exercise \n     of the option even if the stock price decreases or stays the \n     same. In contrast to options or other stock appreciation \n     rights, grants of restricted stock are not inherently \n     performance-based because the executive may receive \n     compensation even if the stock price decreases or stays the \n     same. Thus, a grant of restricted stock does not satisfy the \n     definition of performance-based compensation unless the grant \n     or vesting of the restricted stock is based upon the \n     attainment of a performance goal and otherwise satisfies the \n     standards for performance-based compensation.\n     Section 280G\n       In general\n       In some cases, a compensation agreement for a corporate \n     executive may provide for payments to be made if there is a \n     change in control of the executive's employer, even if the \n     executive does not lose his or her job as part of the change \n     in control. Such payments are sometimes referred to as \n     ``golden parachute payments.'' The Code contains limits on \n     the amount of certain types of such payments, referred to as \n     ``excess parachute payments.'' Excess parachute payments are \n     not deductible by a corporation. In addition, an excise \n     tax is imposed on the recipient of any excess parachute \n     payment equal to 20 percent of the amount of such payment.\n       Definition of parachute payment\n       A ``parachute payment'' is any payment in the nature of \n     compensation to (or for the benefit of) a disqualified \n     individual which is contingent on a change in the ownership \n     or effective control of a corporation or on a change in the \n     ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a \n     corporation (``acquired corporation''), if the aggregate \n     present value of all such payments made or to be made to the \n     disqualified individual equals or exceeds three times the \n     individual's ``base amount.''\n       The individual's base amount is the average annual \n     compensation payable by the acquired corporation and \n     includible in the individual's gross income over the five-\n     taxable years of such individual preceding the individual's \n     taxable year in which the change in ownership or control \n     occurs.\n       The term parachute payment also includes any payment in the \n     nature of compensation to a disqualified individual if the \n     payment is made pursuant to an agreement which violates any \n     generally enforced securities laws or regulations.\n       Certain amounts are not considered parachute payments, \n     including payments under a qualified retirement plan, and \n     payments that are reasonable compensation for services \n     rendered on or after the date of the change in control. In \n     addition, the term parachute payment does not include any \n     payment to a disqualified individual with respect to a small \n     business corporation or a corporation no stock of which was \n     readily tradable, if certain shareholder approval \n     requirements are satisfied.\n       Disqualified individual\n       A disqualified individual is any individual who is an \n     employee, independent contractor, or other person specified \n     in Treasury regulations who performs personal services for \n     the corporation and who is an officer, shareholder, or highly \n     compensated individual of the corporation. Personal service \n     corporations and similar entities generally are treated as \n     individuals for this purpose. A highly compensated individual \n     is defined for this purpose as an employee (or a former \n     employee) who is among the highest-paid one percent of \n     individuals performing services for the corporation (or an \n     affiliated corporation) or the 250 highest paid individuals \n     who perform services for a corporation (or affiliated group).\n       Excess parachute payments\n       In general, excess parachute payments are any parachute \n     payments in excess of the base amount allocated to the \n     payment. The amount treated as an excess parachute payment is \n     reduced by the portion of the payment that the taxpayer \n     establishes by clear and convincing evidence is reasonable \n     compensation for personal services actually rendered before \n     the change in control.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n     Section 162(m)\n       In general\n       Under the provision, the section 162(m) limit is reduced to \n     $500,000 in the case of otherwise deductible compensation of \n     a covered executive for any applicable taxable year of an \n     applicable employer.\n       An applicable employer means any employer from which one or \n     more troubled assets are acquired under the ``troubled assets \n     relief program'' (``TARP'') established by the bill if the \n     aggregate amount of the assets so acquired for all taxable \n     years (including assets acquired through a direct purchase by \n     the Treasury Department, within the meaning of section 113(c) \n     of Title I of the bill) exceeds $300,000,000. However, such \n     term does not include any employer from which troubled assets \n     are acquired by the Treasury Department solely through direct \n     purchases (within the meaning of section 113(c) of Title I of \n     the bill). For example, if a firm sells $250,000,000 in \n     assets through an auction system managed by the Treasury \n     Department, and $100,000,000 to the Treasury Department in \n     direct purchases, then the firm is an applicable employer. \n     Conversely, if all $350,000,000 in sales take the form of \n     direct purchases, then the firm would not be an applicable \n     employer.\n       Unlike section 162(m), an applicable employer under this \n     provision is not limited to publicly held corporations (or \n     even limited to corporations). For example, an applicable \n     employer could be a partnership if the partnership is an \n     employer from which a troubled asset is acquired. The \n     aggregation rules of Code section 414(b) and (c) apply in \n     determining whether an employer is an applicable employer. \n     However, these rules are applied disregarding the rules for \n     brother-sister controlled groups and combined groups in \n     sections 1563(a)(2) and (3). Thus, this aggregation rule only \n     applies to parent-subsidiary controlled groups. A similar \n     controlled group rule applies for trades and businesses under \n     common control.\n       The result of this aggregation rule is that all \n     corporations in the same controlled group are treated as a \n     single employer for purposes of identifying the covered \n     executives of that employer and all compensation from all \n     members of the controlled group are taken into account for \n     purposes of applying the $500,000 deduction limit. Further, \n     all sales of assets under the TARP from all members of the \n     controlled group are considered in determining whether such \n     sales exceed $300,000,000.\n       An applicable taxable year with respect to an applicable \n     employer means the first taxable year which includes any \n     portion of the period during which the authorities for the \n     TARP established under the bill are in effect (the \n     ``authorities period'') if the aggregate amount of troubled \n     assets acquired from the employer under that authority \n     during the taxable year (when added to the aggregate \n     amount so acquired for all preceding taxable years) \n     exceeds $300,000,000, and includes any subsequent taxable \n     year which includes any portion of the authorities period.\n       A special rule applies in the case of compensation that \n     relates to services that a covered executive performs during \n     an applicable taxable year but that is not deductible until a \n     later year (``deferred deduction executive remuneration''), \n     such as nonqualified deferred compensation. Under the special \n     rule, the unused portion (if any) of the $500,000 limit for \n     the applicable tax year is carried forward until the year in \n     which the compensation is otherwise deductible, and the \n     remaining unused limit is then applied to the compensation.\n       For example, assume a covered executive is paid $400,000 in \n     cash salary by an applicable employer in 2008 (assuming 2008 \n     is an applicable taxable year) and the covered executive \n     earns $100,000 in nonqualified deferred compensation (along \n     with the right to future earnings credits) payable in 2020. \n     Assume further that the $100,000 has grown to $300,000 in \n     2020. The full $400,000 in cash salary is deductible under \n     the $500,000 limit in 2008. In 2020, the applicable \n     employer's deduction with respect to the $300,000 will be \n     limited to $100,000 (the lesser of the $300,000 in deductible \n     compensation before considering the special limitation, and \n     $500,000 less $400,000, which represents the unused portion \n     of the $500,000 limit from 2008).\n       Deferred deduction executive remuneration that is properly \n     deductible in an applicable taxable year (before application \n     of the limitation under the provision) but is attributable to \n     services performed in a prior applicable taxable year is \n     subject to the special rule described above and is not \n     double-counted. For example, assume the same facts as above, \n     except that the nonqualified deferred compensation is \n     deferred until 2009 and that 2009 is an applicable taxable \n     year. The employer's deduction for the nonqualified deferred \n     compensation for 2009 would be limited to $100,000 (as in the \n     example above). The limit that would apply under the \n     provision for executive remuneration that is in a form other \n     than deferred deduction executive remuneration and that is \n     otherwise deductible for 2009 is $500,000. For example, if\n\n[[Page S10255]]\n\n     the covered executive is paid $500,000 in cash compensation \n     for 2009, all $500,000 of that cash compensation would be \n     deductible in 2009 under the provision.\n       Covered executive\n       The term covered executive means any individual who is the \n     chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of an \n     applicable employer, or an individual acting in that \n     capacity, at any time during a portion of the taxable year \n     that includes the authorities period. It also includes any \n     employee who is one of the three highest compensated officers \n     of the applicable employer for the applicable taxable year \n     (other than the chief executive officer or the chief \n     financial officer and only taking into account employees \n     employed during any portion of the taxable year that includes \n     the authorities period).\n       The determination of the three highest compensated officers \n     is made on the basis of the shareholder disclosure rules for \n     compensation under the Exchange Act, except to the extent \n     that the shareholder disclosure rules are inconsistent with \n     the provision. Such shareholder disclosure rules are applied \n     without regard to whether those rules actually apply to the \n     employer under the Exchange Act. If an employee is a covered \n     executive with respect to an applicable employer for any \n     applicable taxable year, the employee will be treated as a \n     covered executive for all subsequent applicable taxable years \n     (and will be treated as a covered executive for purposes of \n     any subsequent taxable year for purposes of the special rule \n     for deferred deduction executive remuneration).\n        Executive remuneration\n       The provision generally incorporates the present law \n     definition of applicable employee remuneration. However, the \n     present law exceptions for remuneration payable on commission \n     and performance-based compensation do not apply for purposes \n     of the new $500,000 limit. In addition, the new $500,000 \n     limit only applies to executive remuneration which is \n     attributable to services performed by a covered executive \n     during an applicable taxable year. For example, assume the \n     same facts as in the example above, except that the covered \n     executive also receives in 2008 a payment of $300,000 in \n     nonqualified deferred compensation that was attributable to \n     services performed in 2006. Such payment is not treated as \n     executive remuneration for purposes of the new $500,000 \n     limit.\n        Other rules\n       The modification to section 162(m) provides the same \n     coordination rules with disallowed parachute payment and \n     stock compensation of insiders in expatriated corporations as \n     exist under present law section 162(m). Thus, the $500,000 \n     deduction limit under this section is reduced (but not below \n     zero) by any parachute payments (including parachute payments \n     under the expanded definition under this provision) paid \n     during the authorities period and any payment of the excise \n     tax under section 4985 for stock compensation of insiders in \n     expatriated corporations.\n       The modification authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury \n     to prescribe such guidance, rules, or regulations as are \n     necessary to carry out the purposes of the $500,000 deduction \n     limit, including the application of the limit in the case of \n     any acquisition, merger, or reorganization of an applicable \n     employer.\n     Section 280G\n       The provision also modifies section 280G by expanding the \n     definition of parachute payment in the case of a covered \n     executive of an applicable employer. For this purpose, the \n     terms ``covered executive,'' ``applicable taxable year,'' and \n     ``applicable employer'' have the same meaning as under the \n     modifications to section 162(m) (described above).\n       Under the modification, a parachute payment means any \n     payments in the nature of compensation to (or for the benefit \n     of) a covered executive made during an applicable taxable \n     year on account of an applicable severance from employment \n     during the authorities period if the aggregate present value \n     of such payments equals or exceeds an amount equal to three \n     times the covered executive's base amount. An applicable \n     severance from employment is any severance from employment of \n     a covered executive (1) by reason of an involuntary \n     termination of the executive by the employer or (2) in \n     connection with a bankruptcy, liquidation, or receivership of \n     the employer.\n       Whether a payment is on account of the employee's severance \n     from employment is generally determined in the same manner as \n     under present law. Thus, a payment is on account of the \n     employee's severance from employment if the payment would not \n     have been made at that time if the severance from employment \n     had not occurred. Such payments include amounts that are \n     payable upon severance from employment (or separation from \n     service), vest or are no longer subject to a substantial risk \n     of forfeiture on account of such a separation, or are \n     accelerated on account of severance from employment. As under \n     present law, the modified definition of parachute payment \n     does not include amounts paid to a covered executive from \n     certain tax qualified retirement plans.\n       A parachute payment during an applicable taxable year that \n     is paid on account of a covered executive's applicable \n     severance from employment is nondeductible on the part of the \n     employer (and the covered executive is subject to the section \n     4999 excise tax) to the extent of the amount of the payment \n     that is equal to the excess over the employee's base amount \n     that is allocable to such payment. For example, assume that a \n     covered executive's annualized includible compensation is $1 \n     million and the covered executive's only parachute payment \n     under the provision is a lump sum payment of $5 million. The \n     covered executive's base amount is $1 million and the excess \n     parachute payment is $4 million.\n       The modifications to section 280G do not apply in the case \n     of a payment that is treated as a parachute payment under \n     present law. The modifications further authorize the \n     Secretary of Treasury to issue regulations to carry out the \n     purposes of the provision, including the application of the \n     provision in the case of a covered executive who receives \n     payments some of which are treated as parachute payments \n     under present law section 280G and others of which are \n     treated as parachute payments on account of this provision, \n     and the application of the provision in the event of any \n     acquisition, merger, or reorganization of an applicable \n     employer. The regulations shall also prevent the avoidance of \n     the application of the provision through the \n     mischaracterization of a severance from employment as other \n     than an applicable severance from employment. It is intended \n     that the regulations prevent the avoidance of the provision \n     through the acceleration, delay, or other modification of \n     payment dates with respect to existing compensation \n     arrangements.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years ending on or \n     after date of enactment, except that the modifications to \n     section 280G are effective for payments with respect to \n     severances occurring during the authorities period.\n\n    C. Exclude Discharges of Acquisition Indebtedness on Principal \nResidences From Gross Income (sec. 303 of the bill and sec. 108 of the \n                                 Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Gross income includes income that is realized by a debtor \n     from the discharge of indebtedness, subject to certain \n     exceptions for debtors in Title 11 bankruptcy cases, \n     insolvent debtors, certain student loans, certain farm \n     indebtedness, and certain real property business indebtedness \n     (secs. 61(a)(12) and 108). In cases involving discharges of \n     indebtedness that are excluded from gross income under the \n     exceptions to the general rule, taxpayers generally reduce \n     certain tax attributes, including basis in property, by the \n     amount of the discharge of indebtedness.\n       The amount of discharge of indebtedness excluded from \n     income by an insolvent debtor not in a Title 11 bankruptcy \n     case cannot exceed the amount by which the debtor is \n     insolvent. In the case of a discharge in bankruptcy or where \n     the debtor is insolvent, any reduction in basis may not \n     exceed the excess of the aggregate bases of properties held \n     by the taxpayer immediately after the discharge over the \n     aggregate of the liabilities of the taxpayer immediately \n     after the discharge (sec. 1017).\n       For all taxpayers, the amount of discharge of indebtedness \n     generally is equal to the difference between the adjusted \n     issue price of the debt being cancelled and the amount used \n     to satisfy the debt. These rules generally apply to the \n     exchange of an old obligation for a new obligation, including \n     a modification of indebtedness that is treated as an exchange \n     (a debt-for-debt exchange).\n     Qualified principal residence indebtedness\n       An exclusion from gross income is provided for any \n     discharge of indebtedness income by reason of a discharge (in \n     whole or in part) of qualified principal residence \n     indebtedness. Qualified principal residence indebtedness \n     means acquisition indebtedness (within the meaning of section \n     163(h)(3)(B), except that the dollar limitation is \n     $2,000,000) with respect to the taxpayer's principal \n     residence. Acquisition indebtedness with respect to a \n     principal residence generally means indebtedness which is \n     incurred in the acquisition, construction, or substantial \n     improvement of the principal residence of the individual and \n     is secured by the residence. It also includes refinancing of \n     such indebtedness to the extent the amount of the \n     indebtedness resulting from such refinancing does not exceed \n     the amount of the refinanced indebtedness. For these \n     purposes, the term ``principal residence'' has the same \n     meaning as under section 121 of the Code.\n       If, immediately before the discharge, only a portion of a \n     discharged indebtedness is qualified principal residence \n     indebtedness, the exclusion applies only to so much of the \n     amount discharged as exceeds the portion of the debt which is \n     not qualified principal residence indebtedness. Thus, assume \n     that a principal residence is secured by an indebtedness of \n     $1 million, of which $800,000 is qualified principal \n     residence indebtedness. If the residence is sold for $700,000 \n     and $300,000 debt is discharged, then only $100,000 of the \n     amount discharged may be excluded from gross income under the \n     qualified principal residence indebtedness exclusion.\n       The basis of the individual's principal residence is \n     reduced by the amount excluded from income under the \n     provision.\n       The qualified principal residence indebtedness exclusion \n     does not apply to a taxpayer in a Title 11 case; instead the \n     general exclusion rules apply. In the case of an insolvent \n     taxpayer not in a Title 11 case, the qualified\n\n[[Page S10256]]\n\n     principal residence indebtedness exclusion applies unless the \n     taxpayer elects to have the general exclusion rules apply \n     instead.\n       The exclusion does not apply to the discharge of a loan if \n     the discharge is on account of services performed for the \n     lender or any other factor not directly related to a decline \n     in the value of the residence or to the financial condition \n     of the taxpayer.\n       The exclusion for qualified principal residence \n     indebtedness is effective for discharges of indebtedness \n     before January 1, 2010.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision extends for three additional years the \n     exclusion from gross income for discharges of qualified \n     principal residence indebtedness.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for discharges of indebtedness \n     on or after January 1, 2010, and before January 1, 2013.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this is an enormous package--$700 billion. \nThat ain't chicken feed! That is 17 times what we spend annually on \nhealth care for our Nation's veterans. That is 14 times what we spend \nannually on highways and mass transportation. That is more than the \nannual defense budget, which supplies our troops and fuels our planes \nand naval vessels around the globe. That is more than the total amount \nthe Federal Government will spend on homeland security over the next 17 \nyears. And that number actually hides the real potential cost because \nthe Treasury Secretary would be authorized to buy and sell an unlimited \namount of these troubled assets in the next 2 years.\n  It is an enormous amount of money. And it involves granting an \nenormous amount of authority to the Secretary of the Treasury. I \nbelieve many Americans, and that includes this Senator, would not \npretend to understand all of the nuances of the financial mess that we \nare told is creeping into our Main Street communities and threatens to \njeopardize the security of millions of Americans. But we all understand \nthat, when working families were suffering because of the economic \npolicies of these past 8 years, nobody in the Treasury Department or \nthe Federal Reserve told us about the dangerous course we were on. When \nthe Senate tried to pass an economic stimulus bill just last week, \nwhich included unemployment benefits and financial assistance for these \nsame working families struggling with rising energy and food prices, \nthose efforts were met with filibusters and fierce opposition from the \nWhite House that now wants a bailout of Wall Street. Apparently Wall \nStreet institutions are too big and too important to be allowed to \nfail, but the same isn't true when it comes to working families.\n  West Virginia has always had its share of economic troubles. But, it \nhas been further battered by the Bush administration's feckless fiscal \npolicies. The annual budget cuts imposed by the Bush administration and \nits allies in the Congress have punished the people of my State and \nmany other States. Everything from health care, to law enforcement, to \nprograms for children have been put on the chopping block.\n  I grew up in the Great Depression. That economic collapse followed a \ndecade of business prosperity. Three Republican administrations had \npursued policies that brought the country to the brink of economic \nruin. Those administrations pushed to get the government off the backs \nof business, a ``return to normalcy,'' President Harding called it. \nThey had pushed through enormous tax cuts, including the largest tax \ncut in American history to that point all the while proclaiming the \nvirtues of big business: ``The business of America, is business,'' \nthundered President Coolidge.\n  For the past 8 years, we have again heard the same slogans reflecting \nthe same philosophy and seen another Republican administration follow \nthe same reckless path. ``Unleash capitalism'', has been the cry for \nthe past 8 years. ``Get the Government off our backs.'' The government \nis the problem, not the solution. We have heard it all before.\n  Well, the financial oversight agencies have had an 8 year holiday. \nFor 8 years, Wall Street has run wild, as they loaned money they did \nnot have, to people who could not afford these loans, to buy houses and \nother real estate that were enormously overpriced. Now, faced with \nfinancial troubles, the Wall Street barons look to the very Government \nthat they had been resisting to save them to the tune of $700 billion. \nAs the fear spreads and confidence erodes, now the turmoil on Wall \nStreet threatens to wash over Main Street as banks refuse credit, old \nloans default, and investments that fund the pensions of the average \nAmerican plummet in value.\n  Republicans espouse the theory of trickle down economics--that the \nbenefits of economic growth will trickle down to the working family. \nWhat hogwash. This crisis proves that the only thing that trickles down \nto the working family is the losses that come from Wall Street run \nwild. I fear the enormity of the potential crisis that looms over our \nentire economy. The scope and the cost of the bill speak to the \nseverity of the challenge that our financial leaders believe our \ncountry is confronting. This is legislation I do not want to support, \nyet I fear the consequences of its failure in this body. I fear \nopposing this legislation because I fear even more what might happen to \nour States, our workers, their pensions, and their jobs if this turmoil \non Wall Street spreads further into our economy.\n  I am somewhat comforted by the improvements Congress has made in an \notherwise total giveaway of funds and authority to the executive \nbranch. The EESA bill is 113 pages compared to the 3-page proposal \nrequested by the administration. Much of the new language includes \nchecks on the new authority:\n  No. 1 sunsets the legislation on December 31, 2009--15 months from \nnow--but the Treasury may extend the program until 2 years after the \ndate of enactment;\n  No. 2 releases $700 billion to the Treasury in parts--the first $250 \nbillion is available immediately, the next $100 billion is available \nafter Presidential certification, and the next $350 billion is \navailable unless a joint resolution of disapproval, subject to \nexpedited procedures, is passed within 15 days of the Treasury request;\n  No. 3 includes the Appropriations Committees in the list of \ncongressional committees that will receive regular reports;\n  No. 4 creates a new Congressional Oversight Panel in the legislative \nbranch, which would be required to report to the Congress 30 days after \nthe Treasury Secretary first exercises his authorities and every 30 \ndays thereafter. The members of the panel would be appointed by the \nHouse Speaker, the Senate majority leader, the House and Senate \nminority leaders;\n  No. 5 requires the Comptroller General to report to the Congress \nevery 60 days;\n  No. 6 creates a special inspector general, which would be subject to \nPresidential appointment and Senate confirmation, and would be required \nto report to the Congress within 60 days of confirmation and quarterly \nthereafter;\n  No. 7 creates a Financial Stability Oversight Board in the executive \nbranch. The board would consist of the chairman of the Federal Reserve, \nTreasury Secretary, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Director of the Federal \nHousing Finance Agency, the overseer for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, \nand would be required to report to the Congress quarterly. In addition, \n60 days after the Treasury Secretary first exercises his authorities \nand every month thereafter, and 7 days after the purchasing authority \nreaches each $50 billion tranche, the Secretary would be required to \nreport to the Congress;\n  No. 8 within 2 days of the Secretary exercising his authority under \nthe act or within 45 days of enactment, the Secretary would be required \nto publish program guidelines explaining how troubled assets would be \nselected, priced, and purchased.\n  I believe that our duty is clear. We must pass this legislation or \nfurther destabilize our country's economic situation. But after we pass \nit, if we do, we must then go after all of those who so cavalierly put \nthe rest of us at such incredible risk.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, providing a $700 billion financial rescue \nplan without requiring reform and regulation of the financial markets \nis a serious mistake. That is exactly what this legislation does.\n  I believe that we are in an economic crisis that does require a \nresponse by Congress.\n  But it cannot be a response that commits the American taxpayers to a \nlarge\n\n[[Page S10257]]\n\nrescue fund for many of America's biggest financial institutions while \nstill leaving in place unregulated financial markets that allowed this \nfinancial crisis to happen.\n  Despite my best efforts there is nothing in this legislation that \nwill require the regulation of the very financial markets that have, in \nrecent years, helped create a casinolike atmosphere with large \nfinancial institutions exhibiting unprecedented greed in search of \nshort-term profits and big bonuses that knew no bounds.\n  I will not vote for a plan that I believe fails to address the \ncentral cause of this crisis: unregulated financial markets that hide \nthe unbelievable speculation and reckless investments by some major \nfinancial institutions whose losses are now being loaded on the backs \nof the American taxpayers. Those financial markets must be regulated \nnow!\n  In 1999 when Congress debated a large deregulation bill titled the \nFinancial Modernization Act, I was one of only eight Senators who voted \nno and I warned then in Senate debate that ``this bill will also raise \nthe likelihood of future massive taxpayer bailouts.'' I wish I had been \nwrong.\n  Nine years later we are considering a ``massive taxpayer bailout'' \nplan that provides no regulation of the hedge funds and derivative \ntrading that has caused much of the financial wreckage in our economy.\n  The plan also fails to restore the protections that were removed in \nthe Financial Modernization Act to separate FDIC insured bank \noperations from the risky speculative investments in real estate and \nsecurities.\n  Under this plan the creation of exotic securities that are traded in \nfinancial darkness by unregulated hedge funds and other institutions \ncan continue. It is estimated that there is a notional value of more \nthan $60 trillion of credit default swaps in our economy. No one knows \nwhere they are, whose balance sheets they may threaten, or how much \nadditional risk they pose to financial firms. Yet, I was told this plan \ncould not require regulation and transparency of these financial \nmarkets because there was opposition in Congress and the White House. \nThat is not a satisfactory answer for me. And I don't believe it is \nsatisfactory to the taxpayers.\n  The legislation contains some provisions that I strongly support. I \nbelieve we should increase the FDIC insurance to $250,000 per account. \nI also strongly support the tax extenders and the tax incentives for \nrenewable energy.\n  But in the end, if this plan is about restoring confidence, the \nfailure to include reform and regulatory measures along with the money \nis a fatal flaw that I believe will end up hurting our country.\n  The following are the six steps I called for including in the \nfinancial rescue plan. While there was some improvement in the plan \nalong the way, it fails to do what I think is necessary to protect both \nthe economy and taxpayers.\n  1. Restoring the stability and safety of the banking system by re-\ncreating protections of the Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited the \nmerging of banking businesses with riskier investments. That post-\nDepression Era protection served us well for seven decades before its \nrepeal.\n  2. Addressing the wildly excessive compensation on Wall Street, which \nhas incentivized reckless behavior. In recent years, Wall Street has \ndoled out more than $100 billion in bonuses to the very people who have \nsteered us into this mess, including more than $33 billion in each of \n2007 and 2006.\n  3. Developing a system of regulation that would require \naccountability for the speculative investment activities of hedge funds \nand investment banks that create and sell complex securities.\n  4. Providing for a period of forbearance on mortgages where \nhomeowners could continue to pay mortgages at a set rate.\n  5. Creating a Taxpayer Protection Task Force that would investigate \nand claw back ill-gotten gains. This would be targeted at individuals \nand firms that profited from creating and selling worthless securities \nand toxic products. Despite the fact that this practice caused the \ncurrent economic crisis, many of these individuals and firms now seek \nto benefit from a Government bailout.\n  6. Making sure that U.S. taxpayers get to share in the increased \nvalues, not just the burden of risk, of the firms they are bailing out.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our Nation's economy is in crisis, the \nlikes of which we have not seen since the 1930s. For years, we have \ntraveled a disturbing path: foreclosures and unemployment are up while \nmedian income and purchasing power are down. CEO pay has skyrocketed \nwhile regular Americans are suffering. Economic growth has slowed \nbecause tight credit has forced businesses large and small to put \ninvestments for the future on hold while they focus on making sure they \nhave capital to buy inventory or even make payroll.\n   But in just the last few weeks, we have seen something even more \nstartling appear on the horizon: our current path ends at a cliff, and \nif we do not take quick action to change the course of our economy, we \ncould go over the edge. The reasons we are at this cliff are many. The \npath we have traveled has been marked by an appalling lack of oversight \nby the regulators of the marketplace. Wall Street has run amok with \ngreed while the Bush administration and others urged them on in the \nname of deregulation. As in the runup to the Great Depression, our free \nmarkets are running wild. We have reduced capital requirements, removed \nthe authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate \nswaps, and speculators took over the majority of some commodity \ntrading, like oil. Still, echoing Roosevelt's opponents in the 1930s, \nsome opponents of government stabilization actions argue that the kind \nof rescue plan before us today--and regulation of the practices that \nbrought us here--threatens the freedom of our markets and our people.\n  The opposite is true. In a free country, we need to have stoplights \nand cops to maintain order, keep everyone safe, and give everyone fair \ntreatment and fair opportunity. The same is true of a free economy: \nwhen stoplights and cops are replaced by a drive to achieve total \nderegulation, the country is left with an absolute mess--and that is \nwhat we face today. Cops have been taken off the beat in our financial \nmarkets; stoplights to put a hold on free markets running wild have \nbeen dismantled; and now, regular Americans are suffering, and face \neven more dire consequences.\n  There is plenty of blame to go around, and the excesses that continue \nto surface as this unfolds will no doubt be shocking. In the immediate \nterm, however, the most pressing issue is how we turn our unstable \neconomic situation around to avoid an even more dire result.\n  If we fail to take action, pensions and savings could quickly be \ndecimated by a wrecked stock market, and Americans could suffer with \nsignificant job losses and less ability to buy everything from \ngroceries to a new car or house. Small businesses and even large ones \nare likely to see their access to capital further reduced, home \nmortgages could become even more difficult to acquire or refinance, \nforeclosures could further skyrocket, and auto and student loans could \nbe much more difficult to get. Construction jobs would likely \ndisappear, automakers would cut back even further on production and lay \noff workers, and retail and service jobs would be cut. Retirees who are \ncounting on a 401(k) or other type of pension would see their nest eggs \nshattered. If the stock market crashes, investments--even those made \nyears or decades ago in supposedly ``safe'' assets--would be drowned.\n  It is clear to me that we cannot allow our Nation's economy to fall \noff this cliff. We need to take action before it is too late. Doing \nnothing is not an option. But it is with reluctance that I will vote \nfor this rescue plan because it is not entirely clear that it will \nunlock enough credit and stop enough foreclosures to turn things \naround. It is also evident that this plan only includes the first steps \ntowards getting regulatory cops back on the beat to make sure our \nmarkets are not allowed to continue running wild. But there also is no \nbetter alternative at this time, so I will vote for this plan with the \nhope that allowing the Government to buy up a significant portion of \nthe troubled assets that are weighing down banks and other financial \ninstitutions will unlock enough capital to restore flexibility and \ncredit to businesses and\n\n[[Page S10258]]\n\nconsumers, before Americans suffer even greater consequences of our \ncurrent course. In addition, if done right, the Government can use this \nplan to purchase, modify, refinance, and resell mortgages that are \nbased on accurate home values, have fair, longer-term repayment terms \nthat homeowners can meet, and will return mortgage repayment rates to \ntheir historic high levels of dependability and profitability. If that \nis how this program is carried out, it can avert a disaster. Unlocking \ncredit and restructuring mortgages will also help soothe investor \nconcerns and, therefore, protect pensions, savings and investments.\n  I could not have supported the original plan sent to Congress by the \nBush administration. It did nothing to protect taxpayers or provide any \noversight. It also did nothing to address the core of the problem, \nwhich is the foreclosure crisis. I think, however, that we in Congress \nhave decided that if taxpayer dollars are used to clean up the \nfinancial mess, the administration is going to have to accept taxpayer \nsafeguards and taxpayer oversight.\n   Congress has done significant work to add in some of the needed \ntaxpayer protections, and to make sure that this plan is grounded in \nhelping regular Americans. Among other safeguards, this rescue bill \nprovides the government, and thus the taxpayers, with options to \nacquire an equity stake in companies that take advantage of the \nprogram. By doing so, the government is providing some financial \nprotection to taxpayers.\n  The bill also includes limits on executive compensation for entities \nthat take advantage of government assistance, though, like other \nprovisions, the effectiveness of these provisions will depend upon how \nwell they are implemented. The bill also imposes needed internal \ncontrols and oversight provisions to make sure this unprecedented power \nand amount of money is used responsibly. These controls include \nimmediate public reporting of the assets purchased, including the price \npaid; GAO audits of those financial reports; and Inspector General \noversight to prevent fraud, favoritism, waste of taxpayer dollars, and \nabuse of power. In addition, a special House-Senate oversight panel \nwill be established to track this program and ensure that taxpayer \ninterests are protected. These protections are important. Still more \nimportant is that Congress revamp oversight and regulation of our \nfinancial markets to prevent future financial disasters like this one.\n  There are other provisions in the bill that are particularly \nimportant that I want to mention.\n  I am pleased that this bill, in sections 109 and 110, requires the \nTreasury Department to maximize assistance for homeowners and encourage \nmortgage service providers to minimize foreclosures so as to keep \nfamilies in their homes. Rampant foreclosures are at the core of this \neconomic crisis, and a recovery can only come when the housing market \nturns around. This effort to limit foreclosures will be bolstered when \nthe Federal government holds, owns or controls mortgages or mortgage \nbacked securities. As the owner of loans that are at risk to be \nforeclosed upon, the government can consent to modifications, and can \nrework mortgages so that the homeowner can continue to make payments. \nHomeowners, communities and taxpayers generally will be better off than \nif these mortgages go into foreclosure.\n  It should be noted that foreclosure mitigation measures will become \nmuch more difficult to enforce when the government buys mortgages that \nhave been securitized and divided up into smaller parts. In these \ncases, section 109 requires Treasury to coordinate with the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve, Fannie Mae, Freddie \nMac, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other Federal \nentities that hold troubled assets to attempt to identify opportunities \nfor the acquisition of classes of troubled assets. This will enable \nTreasury to improve the loan modification and restructuring process.\n  All of the homeowner assistance and foreclosure mitigation programs \nincluded in this bill set worthy goals, but they could be stronger. \nRather than encouraging servicers to modify unaffordable loans, the \nUnited States should undertake a systematic effort to minimize \nforeclosures, and the Treasury's efforts should be built around that \nprinciple. I would also like to have seen a similar requirement in any \nmortgage-related asset that the United States resold to the private \nsector. Unfortunately, such a carry-forward provision is not included \nin the final bill.\n  I also support the bill provisions in section 108 that require \nTreasury to issue regulations or guidelines to ``manage or prohibit'' \nconflicts of interest. One conflict of interest that deserves special \nattention involves companies that service residential mortgages. These \ncompanies make a stream of revenue from servicing the loans. They may \nnot specialize in loan modifications or refinancing. If a mortgage loan \nis refinanced through FHA or otherwise, the loan servicer may lose the \nbusiness. For that reason, some loan servicers may have a conflict of \ninterest when it comes to implementing the bill's policies promoting \nloan modifications and the HOPE for Homeowners Program. Therefore, in \naddition to companies that service loans, the Treasury Department \nshould consider hiring companies who have the experience and technology \nto modify and refinance loans with and without FHA insurance. These \ncompanies need to be committed to working with borrowers to develop a \nloan that they can pay, and the companies need not be worried about \nservicing the modified or restructured loan. I am assured that the \nTreasury Department has the authority to accomplish this.\n  Another important bill provision limits purchases of troubled assets \nto ``financial institutions'' which are ``established and regulated \nunder the laws of the United States.'' We cannot afford to bail out \noffshore hedge funds, foreign banks, and sovereign wealth funds that \npurchased high risk mortgage-backed securities and other high risk \ninvestments to obtain high returns. I am relieved that we are focusing \nour efforts on U.S. institutions subject to U.S. regulation.\n  I am also pleased that many state and regional banks, auto finance \ncompanies and other off-Wall Street entities will be eligible for \nparticipation in the troubled asset relief program. These entities are \nhurting, and their financial stability has a direct impact on American \nconsumers; they should have access to this new market for otherwise \nilliquid assets. Furthermore, under this bill, the Treasury Secretary \nhas the authority to purchase troubled assets that are not mortgage-\nrelated, so long as, after consulting with the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, he or she determines that doing so would promote financial \nmarket stability.\n  While this final bill is miles ahead of the Bush administration \nproposal sent to Congress, I am disappointed that it does not contain a \nnumber of additional taxpayer protections I advocated. Those missing \nprotections included limits on the types of assets that could be \npurchased, requirements for contract competition, policies to minimize \nforeclosures, and regulation of credit default swaps.\n  One of the taxpayer safeguards I advocated, for example, was to limit \nthe bail out to purchasing troubled mortgages on ``real estate located \nin the United States.'' That limitation was not, however, included in \nthe final bill. Its absence means that, as currently written, Treasury \nis able to purchase troubled mortgages on real estate located in \nGermany, Japan, China, anywhere in the world where U.S. financial \ninstitutions bought mortgages. That doesn't make sense, and I don't \nknow why this basic limitation was left out of the bill. We can't \nafford to bail out mortgages or mortgage-backed securities on real \nestate in other countries, and I hope we won't.\n  Another problem is that the bill does not require that competition be \nused to select the contractors who will manage the hundreds of billions \nof dollars in troubled assets that will be purchased under this act. A \nprior draft version of the bill stated that the Secretary ``shall \nsolicit proposals from a broad range of qualified vendors interested in \nperforming the work.'' That language disappeared from the final bill. \nThe American taxpayer is left hoping that the Bush administration or \nthe next administration will not continue the Bush administration's \nprior record of awarding huge, no-bid contracts to a favored few.\n\n[[Page S10259]]\n\n  Finally, I am disappointed that the bailout bill does not restore the \nauthority of the United States to regulate one of the prime culprits \nresponsible for this financial disaster, credit default swaps.\n  Credit default swaps are a type of financial derivative typically \nused to insure payment of a debt obligation. Some companies, such as \nAIG, issued them to the debt holder in place of insurance policies to \nassure payment, while others used them like short sales, betting on \nwhether an unrelated company will fail to pay its debts. These bets, \ncalled credit default swaps, are primarily responsible for the Federal \nbailout of AIG, they are the focus of an ongoing SEC investigation into \nmarket manipulation, and they continue to threaten U.S. financial \nmarket stability because so many financial firms have credit default \nswaps on their books.\n  Eight years ago, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 \nprohibited the Securities and Exchange Commission from regulating all \ntypes of swap agreements, including credit default swaps. As a result, \na completely unregulated $60 trillion credit default swap market has \ndeveloped with no capital requirements like insurance companies have, \nno disclosures, no safeguards, and no oversight by any federal agency.\n  The statutory bar against regulating swaps is a prime example of the \nderegulatory policies that landed American taxpayers in this $700 \nbillion mess. It is a prime reason why financial institutions are \nafraid to lend to each other--no one knows who has how many credit \ndefault swaps outstanding, with which counterparties, involving how \nmuch money. Yet this bill fails to address this problem.\n  At a Senate hearing on September 23, SEC Chairman Christopher Cox \ntestified that the credit default swap market ``is completely lacking \nin transparency,'' ``is regulated by no one,'' and ``is ripe for fraud \nand manipulation.'' He stated that the SEC's lack of regulatory \nauthority over swaps is a ``regulatory hole that must be immediately \naddressed,'' warning that otherwise ``we will have another crisis on \nour hands.'' Chairman Cox stated: ``I urge you to provide in statute \nthe authority to regulate [credit default swap] products to enhance \ninvestor protection and ensure the operation of fair and orderly \nmarkets.''\n  Three days later, on Friday, September 26, SEC Chairman Cox repeated \nhis warning and the need for SEC regulation: ``[I]t is critical that \nCongress ensure there are no similar major gaps in our regulatory \nframework. Unfortunately, as I reported to Congress this week, a \nmassive hole remains: the approximately $60 trillion credit default \nswap market, which is regulated by no agency of government. Neither the \nSEC nor any regulator has authority even to require minimum disclosure. \nI urge Congress to take swift action to address this.''\n  Congress should have heeded that call and addressed the problem in \nthis bill. This bill should have repealed the existing statutory \nprohibition and given the SEC general authority to regulate swap \nagreements. Such a provision would have closed the swaps regulatory \nloophole, while giving regulators and Congress additional time to \ndetermine what specific regulation might be appropriate. But neither \nthis nor any other provision to regulate credit default swaps, or swaps \nin general, was included. It is a missed opportunity that we can only \nhope does not come back to haunt us. I hope the next Congress will \naddress this issue as part of an effort to strengthen regulation.\n  A final provision in the bill that was added at the last minute may \nalso come back to haunt the American public. Section 132 authorizes the \nSEC to suspend the generally accepted accounting rule that requires \npublicly traded corporations to report the fair value of their assets \nin their financial statements.\n  If it were to suspend this accounting rule, the SEC would strike a \nblow against honest accounting. Such suspension could essentially allow \ncorporations to inflate their asset values by reporting something other \nthan their fair market value--presumably allowing them to use instead \nhistorical data, mathematical models, best estimates--who knows? In a \nblink of an eye, corporations would have stronger balance sheets than \nthey do now, essentially cooking their books with the approval of the \nSEC. It is an approach that echoes the excesses of the Enron debacle.\n  The bill seems to prompt the SEC to allow this fantasy accounting at \nthe very time that financial institutions are leery of lending money to \neach other, under the mistaken impression that artificially inflated \nbalance sheets will encourage lending. But allowing inaccurate \nfinancial reporting, with inflated asset values, will not increase \nconfidence in the markets and it will not unlock credit.\n  As far as I know the SEC has never reached into the generally \naccepted accounting principles to suspend a particular rule, and I hope \nit doesn't start now. It would be a terrible precedent. And to the \nextent that including this provision in this economic stabilization \nbill was an effort to convey Congressional approval of that approach, I \nwould like to make it clear that I oppose suspension of Financial \nAccounting Standards Board Rule 157. Honest accounting, using fair \nmarket values, is essential to resolving the financial disaster that \nnow threatens our markets.\n  The financial mess we are in is the result of 8 years of inadequate \nregulation of U.S. financial markets by the Bush administration. It is \nlong past time to strengthen market oversight. The regulatory gaps are \neverywhere. Unfortunately, due to the urgency of adopting this \nlegislation, many much-needed reforms were simply not included in the \nrescue plan.\n  In 2004, the SEC voluntarily weakened the net capital rule that \nestablishes capital reserves for securities firms. We need to restore \nthe net capital rule that was weakened in 2004, and resulted in \nsecurities firms over-borrowing. Another glaring problem is the absence \nof regulation of the more than 8,000 hedge funds that use American \nmarkets. They don't even have to register with the SEC. Still another \nproblem is the weak regulation of credit rating agencies, including the \nfailure to resolve the conflicts of interest inherent in these \nagencies' rating the securities of the firms that hire them. Weak \naccounting rules that allow companies to hide their liabilities and \nover-value their assets continue to undermine investor confidence. We \nmust also take action, as I have already mentioned, to regulate credit \ndefault swaps and other derivatives that financial institutions have \nloaded up on with little or no disclosure, regulation, or oversight. \nThe collapse of credit card securities is another crisis waiting to \nhappen due to abusive practices, excessive interest rates, growing \ndebt, and the lack of credit card reform. There was talk early on of \nthis bill setting an expedited schedule for addressing these and other \nfinancial regulatory issues, but nothing was included in the bill.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has chosen to include in this \nlegislation its tax extenders bill, which the Senate passed separately \nlast week. With regard to tax incentives for advanced and alternative \nenergy technologies, the extension of many critical existing tax \nincentives--including those for wind, solar, biomass, and alternative \nfuels production and infrastructure--will facilitate the development \nand commercialization of all of these technologies. I am particularly \npleased about the inclusion of a new tax credit for plug-in hybrid and \nall-electric vehicles, which is essential not only to the development \nof these technologies but also to consumer acceptance and widespread \nuse of these vehicles. In addition to the energy tax provisions, tax \nextenders, and the adjustment to the alternative minimum tax, the \nlegislation before us now also includes the important provisions of the \nPaul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction \nEquity Act. Mental health parity is about basic fairness and equity. \nIndividuals suffering from mental health illnesses deserve access to \nadequate and appropriate health care. I have spoken previously about \nthe significance of addressing this issue, and I am glad that Congress \nis righting this wrong. I hope the House will accept this package.\n  In conclusion, I will vote for this rescue package with many qualms \nbut with the hope that it will prevent even greater harm to our economy \nand hard working American families. It is clear that a financial \nregulatory overhaul\n\n[[Page S10260]]\n\nshould be one of the first priorities of the next President and the new \nCongress.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to share my views on the \neconomic stabilization plan, as now amended by the Senate, and the \nprecarious state of our economy.\n  The instability in the housing market, the soaring energy prices, \nand, more recently, the institutional failures within our credit and \nfinancial markets have all been serious blows to our economy.\n  We must decide between the risks of doing nothing, thereby subjecting \nthe free market to the extraordinary level of unknowns of this critical \nsituation, or the value of seeking legislation in the hopes to reduce \nthe severity of serious consequences to almost every single aspect of \nour economy.\n  The bill before us contains several improvements to the House bill, \nimprovements that have strengthened the measure. And, in my view, \nwithout some form of Congressional action now, the credit markets could \nfreeze up. Without money flowing through our economy, car loans, \nstudent loans, mortgage lines of credit, could become inadequate. Job \nlosses could follow and with it an increase in the number of Americans \nwithout health insurance. I could go on and on.\n  My careful deliberations on this legislation and my understanding of \nthe economic problems facing our Nation lead me to believe that the \nconsequences of not taking this action poses an ever greater threat to \nour economy and to all Americans.\n  For this reason, Mr. President, I intend to vote aye in support of \nthe bill, as amended.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will oppose the Wall Street bailout \nplan. Though well intentioned, and certainly much improved over the \noriginal Treasury proposal, it is deeply flawed and in effect asks the \ntaxpayer to bear the burden of serious lapses of judgment by private \nfinancial institutions, their regulators, and the enablers in \nWashington who paved the way for this catastrophe by enacting measures \nremoving the safeguards that had protected consumers and the economy \nsince the Great Depression.\n  I regret Senate leadership has opted to add a number of unrelated \nmeasures to this package. Whether this was done as a sweetener to make \nthe bailout pill go down a bit more easily or as a way to dispose of \nremaining legislation in one giant package, the end result is a package \nthat is less straightforward and much more likely to spur doubts among \nvoters about the bailout portion of the package. The bailout package \nwas already a big enough question mark in the public's mind before this \ndubious maneuver was concocted.\n  I strongly support some of the unrelated measures being added to the \nbailout package. The mental health parity provisions are long overdue. \nAnd I was pleased to support the tax extenders, disaster tax relief, \nand mental health parity package when it was considered by the Senate \njust a few days ago. But that legislation could have proceeded on its \nown, without being attached to the emergency bailout bill.\n  There is one new provision being added to the bailout proposal that \nis not only relevant but makes good sense, and that is the language \nraising the cap on the size of an account that can be insured by the \nFDIC. I have supported raising FDIC insurance limits for many years. It \nshould go a long way toward helping our community banks continue to \nattract and retain the deposits so critical to their ability to provide \ncredit to consumers and Main Street businesses.\n  That brings me to the rest of the bailout measure. Though it is \nlacking in several areas, I will focus my attention on three critical \ndefects in the legislation. First, it places the financial burden \nsquarely on the average taxpayer. In fact, because it is funded through \nincreased debt, the burden is actually placed on future taxpayers. \nRegrettably, no offset was seriously considered, and as a result, our \ndebt is at risk of rising by another $700 billion. That is $700 billion \nmore that must be paid off by our children and grandchildren in the \nform of increased taxes or fewer government services.\n  A second defect of the bailout bill is its failure to adequately \naddress the housing crisis which underlies much of the financial market \ncollapse. It does not include meaningful provisions to help individual \nhomeowners stay in their homes. As foreclosures continue to increase \nthroughout the country, including in Wisconsin, we need to ensure that \nany legislation actually helps actual homeowners, not just Wall Street \nbanks and investment firms. This is not just a matter of fairness, \nthough it is surely that. It is also common sense. It is the housing \ncrisis that underlies the collapse of the credit markets. Without \naddressing those root causes, any bailout is less likely to succeed.\n  This does not mean that we should reward homeowners who took out \nbigger mortgages than they could afford to repay or who sought to flip \nhomes for investments. But for the homeowners who were misled or who \nfell prey to predatory lending, Congress should do something to ensure \nthat those homeowners have the ability to work with their servicers to \nmodify their home loans. Unfortunately, this bailout bill is too skimpy \non protections for the individual homeowner.\n  I am also disappointed that this bill does not include language that \nwould allow bankruptcy judges to alter the mortgage terms of a \nhomeowner's primary residence when that homeowner has declared \nbankruptcy. These sorts of loan modifications already can take place \nfor vacation homes and other types of personal debt. It is troubling \nthat the Bankruptcy Code would allow these modifications to take place \non different types of debt but not a family's primary residence. \nCongress should address this issue and pass legislation to reform the \nBankruptcy Code to permit loan modifications to owner-occupied primary \nresidences.\n  It is true this bailout bill contains provisions directing the \nSecretary of the Treasury to implement a plan to ``encourage'' \nservicers to take advantage of various programs to minimize \nforeclosures. But unfortunately, the legislation seems to lack real \nteeth to ensure that these servicers actually modify the terms of \nnonfederally owned mortgages in order to prevent foreclosures. As we \nhave seen with the Bush Administration's Hope Now Alliance, voluntary \nencouragement of loan modifications is not enough. While there are a \nnumber of factors contributing to the high rates of home foreclosures \naround this country, I am worried that unless Congress passes stronger \nlegislation to do more than encourage servicers to modify the terms of \nthese mortgages, we will continue to see high foreclosure rates plague \nour communities.\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this legislation fails to \ninclude steps to reform the financial markets to ensure that we will \nnot need another bailout in the future.\n  If the taxpayers are being asked to bail out Wall Street, the least \nwe can do, the very least, is to ensure it will not happen again. \nNothing in this legislation does that. Indeed, the administration has \npushed hard to keep the bill free of the kinds of regulatory reforms we \nneed to prevent this kind of financial crisis from occurring again. We \nare told that such reforms should be the focus of future legislation.\n  This is an old tactic. In my days in the Wisconsin State senate, we \nused to call that the ``trailer bill'' promise. Of course, after \npromising all would be made well in some future ``trailer bill,'' that \nmythical legislation never materialized, or if it did, it failed to \naccomplish what it was promised to do.\n  If anyone fell for the ``trailer bill'' maneuver once, I can tell you \nthat they didn't fall for it a second time, and no one should fall for \nit now.\n  The bottom line is this, Mr. President. Any regulatory reform \nlegislation considered separately will almost certainly be inadequate, \nand it might even do further damage, because of the influence of the \nfinancial industry. The last two decades have seen a string of almost \nuninterrupted victories by that industry in these halls. We have seen \nsound laws and regulations that protected consumers and the stability \nof the financial system repealed or weakened. Just 9 years ago, the \nicing was put on that deregulatory cake with the enactment of the \nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a law which tore down what was left of the \nprotective firewalls in our financial system. Little surprise, then, \nthat without those firewalls the fire has indeed spread across the \nfinancial landscape.\n\n[[Page S10261]]\n\n  We are paying the price for years of regulatory neglect, and the \nresponsibility for that neglect is truly bipartisan. Both parties \nrushed to enact those measures; both parties have worked to ensure that \nfinancial derivatives--what Warren Buffett has called financial weapons \nof mass destruction--remained largely unregulated. Both parties worked \nto prevent the inclusion of even the most modest reforms in this \nbailout package. And I am concerned that any separate reform package we \nmight consider in the next Congress will also be bipartisan in its \ninadequacies.\n  There is a chance that Members will have learned a costly lesson, and \nthat meaningful reform may yet be enacted. But I am skeptical. The \nleverage for meaningful reform was this bailout package. Once that \npasses, the financial interests that have had their way in this \nbuilding for the last two decades will be free to lobby against \nanything that may inconvenience them.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act of 2008. While this compromise does not include all \nof what I wanted, we must enact this legislation in an attempt to \nprotect our credit markets and our economy.\n  The administration has not effectively informed the public on why \nthis action is needed. The Bush administration has so little trust and \nhas been such a bad example of governance, I understand why so many \npeople are skeptical. However, this is a time, where due to instability \nand deterioration of the credit markets, we must act. In addition, I \nvalue the expertise of the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. I \nhave enjoyed working with the Chairman during his tenure. I agree with \nhis assessment that the situation is as dire as he believes.\n  Banks and investment banks have failed. Credit has become harder to \nget. Uncertainty and anxiety are high. When Chairman Bernanke and \nTreasury Secretary Paulson came to us and explained how tenuous the \ncredit markets are, I understood that we must avert further \ndeterioration. It is clear that we must try and prevent the absolute \ncollapse of the financial services industry, which would likely lead to \nan even more severe economic downturn, by enacting this bill quickly.\n  Access to credit is becoming much harder to obtain. Fewer car loans \nare being approved. Small businesses are finding credit to be much more \nexpensive and harder to obtain. The State of Hawaii recently delayed \nthe sale of bonds due to the poor market conditions.\n  Our economy cannot function without access to affordable credit. \nCredit helps families buy homes or pay for their child's college \neducation. Businesses rely on credit for operations and investments. \nState governments utilize credit to make much needed infrastructure \nimprovements.\n  Without access to affordable credit, businesses will fail, more \npeople will become unemployed, and our aging infrastructure will \ncontinue to deteriorate. We must enact this legislation to improve the \nlikelihood of a swift economic recovery and try to avert a severe \neconomic contraction.\n  The original Treasury proposal included no oversight and was not a \nwell thought out proposal. It was offensive due to its lack of \naccountability and oversight provisions. The purchase and sale of \nassets has great potential to be abused and lead to corruption. We must \nmake sure that this situation, which has been caused partially by \ngreed, will not be exploited to further enrich the individuals or \ncorporations that caused this situation.\n  By working together with the Chairman, we have included more \noversight and accountably provisions to prevent abuse, ensure proper \nmanagement, and reduce conflicts of interest. The legislation includes \nadditional reporting requirements to Congress, mandated audits of the \nprogram by the Government Accountability Office, GAO, and the creation \nof a special treasury Inspector General to oversee the Troubled Assets \nRelief Program, TARP.\n  We will have to closely monitor this program through aggressive \noversight by the Banking Committee and other relevant committees. The \nlegislation establishes a financial stability oversight board to review \nand make recommendations regarding the exercise of authority by the \nSecretary of Treasury under this act.\n  Although the Secretary is able to waive provisions of the Federal \nAcquisition Regulation, FAR, the Secretary would need to provide \nCongress justification for the determination that there are urgent and \ncompelling circumstances that make such waiver necessary. This \njustification must be reported to the Committees on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform and Financial Services of the House of \nRepresentatives and the Committees on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs and Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the \nSenate within 7 days of the request. Furthermore, if the Secretary \nwaives any provisions of the FAR pertaining to minority contracting, \nthe Secretary shall develop and implement standards and procedures to \nensure the inclusion of minority contractors.\n  Furthermore, under this act, the Secretary will be required, within 2 \nbusiness days of exercising his authority, to publicly disclose the \ndetails of any transaction. It also requires the Comptroller General of \nthe United States to conduct ongoing oversight of the activities and \nperformance of TARP, report every 60 days to Congress, and conduct an \nannual audit of TARP. It would also establish the Office of the Special \nInspector General for TARP. This office would be required to conduct, \nsupervise, and coordinate audits and investigations of the actions \nundertaken by the Secretary and would report quarterly to Congress. \nThis is very important, as we have found with the Special Inspector \nGeneral for Iraq Reconstruction, SIGIR, the SIGIR has been instrumental \nin ensuring oversight of our efforts in Iraq. Establishing a similar \noffice to oversee TARP is a critical component to monitor the actions \napproved by this act.\n  Another important aspect of this proposal is that the authorization \nfor TARP is graduated. The Secretary will be able to immediately access \nup to $250 billion. However, for an additional $100 billion, a \nPresidential certification would be needed. The final $350 billion \ncould only be accessed if the President transmits a written report to \nCongress requesting such authority. However, should Congress pass a \njoint resolution of disapproval within 15 days of this additional \nauthority, the additional authority given to the Secretary may not be \nused.\n  The Act also requires the Secretary of the Treasury to implement a \nplan to mitigate foreclosures and to encourage servicers of mortgages \nto modify loans through HOPE for Homeowners and other programs. The \nSecretary would also be required to coordinate with other Federal \nentities that hold troubled assets to identify opportunities to modify \nloans. I will continue to advocate for additional relief for homeowners \nso that people can stay in their homes.\n  Finally, we must reform the financial regulatory system to prevent \nfuture credit crises from occurring. A lack of effective regulation has \ncontributed significantly to the current crisis. This legislation \nestablishes a congressional oversight panel to review the state of the \nfinancial markets, the regulatory system, and the use of authority \nunder TARP. The panel is required to report to Congress every 30 days \nand to submit a special report on regulatory reform prior to January \n20, 2009. A comprehensive set of hearings will need to be conducted by \nthe Banking Committee during the next session to determine what \nregulator reforms will be necessary to ensure that future Federal \nintervention of this magnitude will not be necessary.\n  In closing, this is not a perfect bill, but a necessary one to \nprotect access to credit and ensure that working families can access \nmortgages and student loans. It is needed so that businesses can access \ncredit to pay their expenses and fund expansion. This act is needed to \nhelp ensure that State governments can afford to finance necessary \ninfrastructure improvements.\n  I thank Senator Dodd for his leadership in helping craft this \nproposal. I also greatly appreciate the efforts made by Senators Reid, \nSchumer, and Reed. I look forward to continuing to work with them and \nthe other members of the Banking Committee to oversee and improve the \ntroubled asset program.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is no exaggeration to say that our \neconomy is currently undergoing a period of extraordinary stress and \nvolatility.\n\n[[Page S10262]]\n\n  South Dakota has not seen the highs and lows of the housing market in \nthe same way as other areas of the country, and South Dakotans \nexercised strong personal responsibility when it came to buying their \nhomes, which is why this mess is all so frustrating.\n  It is very unfortunate that greedy, Wall Street investors brought us \nto this point, and that the regulators were asleep at the switch when \nwe needed them most.\n  There is no question that something must be done to address this \nsituation. But, throughout this process, I have made clear that while \nthis may be a necessary evil, it cannot be a gift that puts undue \nburden on the American taxpayer.\n  I have struggled with this decision, as has the entire Congress. \nThere is no question that there are reasonable people on both sides of \nthis issue, and that the package before the Senate tonight is an \nimproved version of the proposal the administration sent to Congress 2 \nweeks ago. However, despite the fact that this proposal has merits, I \ncontinue to have concerns that it lacks the necessary protections to \nfix the abuses that caused this problem, provides little direct \nassistance to American families, does not go far enough to cut the \ngolden parachutes of irresponsible CEOs, and does not do enough to \naddress American tax dollars benefiting foreign banks.\n  The inclusion of the tax extenders package, a bill which I wholly \nsupport, and increases in Federal deposit insurance are important \nadditions, but they do not address the underlying risk the $700 billion \npackage is to our taxpayers.\n  If we are to ask the American people to shoulder such a large and \nenduring burden because of the irresponsible and greedy actions of Wall \nStreet then it is important that we get it right. This is closer, but \nit is not close enough. Consequently, I will vote against this bill \ntonight.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my great concern \nabout our economy. Time is of the essence. We must usurp the \nopportunity to be proactive, instead of reactive to our financial \nsituation.\n  On Monday, my colleagues on the other side of the Capitol voiced the \nopinion of their constituents and many Americans. If we are going to \nspend up to $700 billion in taxpayer dollars, we need to reach out \nbeyond Wall Street and into Main Street. Many people fear that the \neconomy is facing a perfect storm. While this fear may be justified, we \nneed to make sure that the next step we take, is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  There have been several proposals discussed since the House rescue \nbill failed to pass. While there have been disagreements as to the type \nof plan, everyone agrees that something must be done immediately. \nEconomists, professors, and government officials all are in concert \nthat the consequences of inaction far outweigh the cost of a plan to \nstabilize the economy.\n  The Economist magazine pointed out that the current situation \n``cannot last long without causing immense damage. Companies will be \nunable to raise new money, and more importantly, refinance old loans. \nCorporate bankruptcies will soar. Consumers will also find it \ndifficult, or expensive, to borrow. The result will be a sharp downturn \nin demand that will push the economy into a deep recession.''\n  Scott Schaefer, a professor of finance at the University of Utah's \nSchool of Business, agrees that the ``idea of `do nothing' isn't \nfeasible--when banks fail they necessarily fall in the lap of the FDIC. \nSo the losses from failed banks fall on taxpayers.''\n  Kristin Forbes, an MIT professor and former member of the President \nBush Economic Counsel, has stated that while this may not be a perfect \nbill, ``the risks of not passing it are greater than passing it. If we \nwait too long, it might cost us much more.''\n  Hussan Ally, an economics professor at Ohio State University, sees \nthe failure to act as resulting in ``the whole economy being in a \ndepressed state for a long time. We're talking about the Great \nDepression all over again.''\n  I believe that one reason why the financial rescue legislation failed \nto pass in the House was because the American people are not convinced \nthat this bill would help Main Street America or them personally. Along \nwith this, I believe that many Americans fail to see the connection \nwith the current crisis with our financial markets and their own future \neconomic well being. To better illustrate how our failure to address \nthis situation could affect everyday Utahns, and Americans everywhere, \nI want to discuss three hypothetical families.\n  First is Anne Wilson, a single mother of two high schoolers whom she \nhopes will be college-bound in a few years. Anne earns $55,000 per year \nas an executive assistant. Through hard work and sacrifice, she \npurchased her own home a few years ago. However, she recently \nrefinanced with an adjustable rate loan. With the savings on her \nmonthly mortgage payment, Anne set up a 529 college savings plan to \nbegin saving for her children's education. Even though Anne knows the \ncost of education is rising rapidly, she has a plan to see that her \nchildren can go to college. With decent returns on her investment in \nher 529 account, combined with student loans and possibly scholarship \nmoney, she believes it will be possible.\n  However, our failure to provide a financial rescue plan could put \nAnne's dream of college for those kids in jeopardy. First, we can \nexpect the securities in which she has invested through the 529 plan \nwill be growing much slower or possibly not at all. In fact, there is a \ngood chance that she will lose some of the money she now has invested. \nSecond, education loans may not be available because of the credit \ncrunch, which could grow far worse without the actions of the federal \ngovernment.\n  Until the housing crisis, Anne had some equity in her home that she \nmight have tapped to help with the college costs. But that equity has \nevaporated, and even if it had not, it might be very difficult to get a \nloan. Anne will certainly have to readjust her plan, or even abandon \nthe hope of providing college for her kids altogether. Moreover, if \ninterest rates continue to increase, which is likely in the absence of \naction on a rescue plan, her mortgage payments will go up, adding to \nher anxiety.\n  Next, let us consider, John Baker, a 64-year-old sheet metal shop \nsupervisor, who hopes to retire in 2 years. For the past 25 years, John \nhas put the maximum amount of money in his company's 401(k) plan. Over \nthe years, this nest egg has grown into a tidy sum. In fact, combined \nwith the Social Security he plans to receive and the earnings from a \npart-time job, John thought he was all set. Now, however, things have \nchanged drastically. His investment portfolio in his 401(k) took a \nnosedive and is not likely to recover anytime soon.\n  Moreover, with rising unemployment, he is not as sure as he used to \nbe that he can get the good part-time job he was planning on. All in \nall, John is having serious second thoughts about retiring and is \nwondering if he needs to keep working to age 70 or maybe beyond. Now a \nnew worry is crossing John's mind. He heard his company's CEO say the \nother day that if business does not pick up, there will have to be some \nlayoffs in his shop. Given his age and relatively high pay, John is \nnervous that he might be one of the first to be let go.\n  Finally, we have Amanda and Derek Peterson, who five years ago \nstarted a small flower shop. With Amanda's business background and \nDerek's artistic imagination, the business soon took off and they now \nhave three locations and a total of 15 employees. The Peterson's had \nbeen talking of expanding the business to two more locations in a \nnearby city, but such a move would take an investment of at least \n$500,000. Based on their track record so far, getting a business \nexpansion loan would not have been a problem before the financial \ncrisis.\n  Now, however, Amanda cannot find a single bank that will extend them \na loan. Moreover, they recently have had to rely on credit card \nfinancing for running the day-to-day operations of the business. Their \nnew worry is that their credit card limit will not be reduced or that \nthe interest rate does not increase. Tragically, instead of making \nplans to expand their business, the Petersons are now talking about \nwhich employees they will have to let go if business does not soon \nimprove.\n  The families in these scenarios, as well as all Utah and American \nfamilies, have a great deal to lose if we do not\n\n[[Page S10263]]\n\nact to build confidence and ease the credit crisis. Jobs and \nlivelihoods are at stake.\n  This financial rescue is not a question of bailing out wealthy Wall \nStreet bank managers who made bad investment decisions. It is about \nstaving off a financial crisis on Main Street that threatens every one \nof us and our plans for our families, our hopes for the future, and the \ngrowth we all depend on to keep American what it is.\n  While the failed bill would have saved the banking industry, we could \nbe more proactive in jumpstarting the economy. The failed plan was only \na remedy to a crisis and not a cure for the economy. In order to cure \nthe economy, we must spur job growth and investment. The most obvious \nand substantial way to achieve this is by providing tax relief to \nAmericans. Let's put money back into the pockets of taxpayers.\n  That is why I have proposed including the tax extenders legislation \nfor several reasons. First, it is long overdue. Businesses and \nindividuals depend on these tax incentives in order to invest. \nBusinesses invest in research and technology which in turn creates \njobs. Individuals invest in retirement savings, college tuition, and \nhealth care costs.\n  Adding the AMT patch would protect 23 million additional American \nfamilies from the clutches of the alternative minimum tax for this \nyear. The research credit, which is vital to U.S. economic growth and \njob creation, and the energy tax incentives, which will also add many \nnew jobs and help us move to energy independence. It is estimated that \nthe solar and wind tax credits alone are predicted to create more than \n116,000 jobs. I have also proposed other tax incentives aimed at \nencouraging private investment of troubled mortgage-backed security \ninstruments.\n  In order to build more confidence in our banking system, I have \nsuggested increasing the FDIC insurance limit. This insurance limit has \nnot been adjusted since 1980 and increasing it will give individuals \nmuch-needed assurance that their deposited savings are secure.\n  We can do more to improve the economic situation. I do not believe \nthe answer is providing one bailout over another bailout. I do not \nbelieve we should be handing out rebate check after rebate check. I \nbelieve we need to assist in slowing the inevitable route our economy \nis heading and providing incentives for investment and job growth. That \nis why I have proposed including the tax extenders, providing \nincentives to invest in mortgage-backed securities, and raising the \nFDIC insurance limit.\n  Instead of stabilizing the economy by only injecting cash into the \nsystem, we should reverse the direction the economy is headed by laying \nthe groundwork for a strong economic future. Extending these tax \ncredits will provide for more growth, innovation and job demand into \nthe future.\n  I would like to now spend some time and drill-down into some of the \nfiner points in this legislation and address some of the broader \nconcerns raised by our current economic situation.\n  As I noted before, we should move ahead with the package to support \nthe consumers of the financial sector's services--depositors, check-\nwriters, credit card users and the merchants who rely on them, people \nwho need to transfer cash or who need to borrow working capital for \ntheir businesses--not the shareholders or managers of the institutions \nin trouble. We must unfreeze the credit markets in a manner that lets \ndepositors have the full use of their money, and that allows the check-\nwriting and payments mechanisms to function. Otherwise, perfectly \nsolvent individuals and businesses will not be able to pay bills or pay \ntheir employees, even though they have cash.\n  Toward that end, the Federal Reserve should be willing to let banks \nuse the impaired securities as collateral at the discount window, at \nsome fraction of their face value that represents a reasonable first \nguess at the real value of the assets. The banks will be responsible \nfor repaying the Federal Reserve the amount they borrowed, whether the \nbonds turn out to be worth more or less than this amount later on. This \nwill tide the financial system over until the Treasury purchase of the \ndistressed assets gets under way.\n  The proposal before us would have the Treasury arrange for the \nevaluation and unbundling of the mortgage-backed bonds. The process \nwill have to determine which of the loans are performing, and which are \nnot. As the content and status of the mortgages' underlying assets \nbecomes known, people will know what the securities are worth, and the \nmarket can then attract private capital to take them over.\n  Ultimately, banks that do not have enough capital to be able to \nfunction will either have to raise additional funds in the market, or \nthe FDIC must step in to close them or arrange a sale or merger to a \nstronger bank.\n  I support the increase in the amount of deposits covered by the FDIC. \nWhile the uncertainty over the health of the banking system continues, \nI would like to go further and extend deposit insurance temporarily to \nall checkable deposits, including money market funds. All institutions \nso protected should be charged a fee, such as the banks pay now, to \nreplace any losses the FDIC incurs.\n  The FDIC is allowed to borrow from the Treasury. That borrowing \nfacility should be reaffirmed and enlarged as needed. The limit on the \nnational debt will be increased under this bill, to enable the Treasury \nto purchase assets. If further increases are needed to allow for \nadditional borrowing by the FDIC, they should be forthcoming. However, \nexpansion of FDIC coverage might well discourage withdrawals from bank \nand money market accounts, and render the additional assistance \nunnecessary.\n  Other steps need to be taken in the short and long run. Urgent \nregulatory changes must be made to support this program. More broadly, \nCongress must insist that there be better coordination between \nregulatory, monetary, and tax policy in this country in the future.\n  We still need to come to grips with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the \nrest of the Federal agencies that intervene in the housing sector. \nRelying on the institutions that contributed to the financial chaos to \nclean it up does not strike me as the best approach.\n  Part of the current problem stems from the unfortunate interaction of \ntwo regulatory excesses: minimum capital requirements for financial \ninstitutions, coupled with a blind, rigid mark-to-market rule for \nvaluing assets on a bank's books. The SEC and the Financial Accounting \nStandards Board, the latter a private entity, are discussing changes in \nthese areas. In my view, they need to move at once to suspend mark-to-\nmarket rules and to ease capital requirements.\n  When markets malfunction, and trading in a class of securities simply \nstops, it is wrong to force institutions to pretend that assets have no \nvalue, when, in the longer term, they are clearly worth something close \nto their face amount. This is especially damaging when the forced \nwrite-downs cause the institution to fall below minimum capital \nrequirements. They must then be closed or merged, often at fire sale \nprices. This further shakes confidence in the financial system, \ndiscouraging lending among banks, lowering asset prices further, and \nmaking more institutions run afoul of the regulations.\n  Down the road, Congress needs to hold hearings to review the damage \nthat mark-to-market rules and capital requirements have done in the \npresent situation, and what changes would be advisable. We also need to \nconsider the process that generated these rules. We need to examine why \nthese difficulties were not foreseen when the regulations were written, \nand whether some alternative arrangements for input by the Treasury and \nthe Federal Reserve, as well as the business community, might produce \nbetter results in the future.\n  The rest of the economy is in urgent need of attention too. This \npackage fails to address broader economic problems. The long economic \nexpansion is aging, as the stimulus to investment and hiring enacted in \n2003 has run its course. Investment spending is slowing, which would \nlower productivity gains and wage growth. We need to keep business \nfixed investment in new plant and equipment and commercial construction \nmoving forward. That would help keep employment, productivity, and \nwages growing, and keep the rest of the economy healthy.\n  The 2008 stimulus package contained one progrowth investment \nincentive.\n\n[[Page S10264]]\n\nThat was bonus expensing, immediate write-off of one half of investment \nin equipment undertaken by the end of 2008. We should extend that \nprovision through 2010. Ideally, this reduction in the tax burden on \ncreating and operating capital in the United States should be made \npermanent, as should the 15 percent tax rates on dividends and capital \ngains. These steps would raise real returns to people doing business \nfixed investment, leading to stronger growth. It would raise returns to \nsavers and lending institutions as well, aiding in the financial \nrecovery.\n  Congress has paid too little attention to the impact of taxation and \nregulation on economy activity and expansion. We have been content in \nrecent years to dump responsibility for economic growth on the Federal \nReserve, while we have let fiscal policy run amok, letting taxes rise \nand spending the proceeds several times over. Those few recent tax \nchanges that were aimed at promoting saving, investment, and hiring are \nscheduled to expire. We need to remember that it is Federal tax and \nregulatory policies that primarily affect real economic activity. \nLowering the tax and regulatory barriers to growth helps to expand the \nprivate sector. Government spending largely displaces private activity, \nand forces higher taxes that retard growth.\n  We have tasked the Federal Reserve with maintaining stable prices and \nlow unemployment. In fact, an overly simulative monetary policy that \ngenerates inflation and weakens the dollar ultimately raises tax rates \non investment, destroys growth and jobs, and injures people on fixed \nincomes. Any initial expansion of real output quickly decays into \nspeculative bubbles in commodities, housing, or an inflation of the \ngeneral price level. The Federal Reserve can hit both targets only by \nfocusing on the goal of stable prices and a sound currency.\n  Unfortunately, beginning in the late 1990s, the Federal Reserve \nabandoned a decade of reasonably steady monetary policy, and indulged \nin a policy of go-stop-go. It eased excessively after financial \ndisturbances and the Y2K panic of the late 1990s, contributing to the \ndot.com bubble. It tightened too much in 2000, contributing to the \nrecession. It eased too much, and held short term interest rates too \nlow too long, following the recession, contributing to the commodity \nand housing bubble, and the weak dollar. Now, we have seen the \nresulting imbalances force the economy to a stop.\n  We need to have a reconsideration of the Humphrey Hawkins Act, which \ngives the Federal Reserve a congressional mandate to pursue apparently \nconflicting goals. At least, they conflict if the conventional wisdom \nof the 1930-1980 period is applied, in which printing more money and \nencouraging a little inflation is considered beneficial, rather that \ncounterproductive. We need to have a heart-to-heart discussion with the \nFederal Reserve about keeping to a stable policy, and keeping its eye \non the long-term prize.\n  The country would have been better served if the 2003 tax changes had \nbeen enacted in 2001 in place of the Federal Reserve's aggressive \neasing in the 2002-2005 period. The correct policy mix, then, now, and \nalways, is sound money, low tax rates at the margin on work, saving, \nand investment, and a sensible regulatory scheme in which the pieces do \nnot conflict and the costs are kept to a minimum. That policy mix \nrescued us from the stagflation of the 1970s. It can do the same today.\n  Unfortunately, Congress deals with these issues on a piecemeal basis. \nThe executive branch is divided into many departments and agencies that \nhave their own narrow focus and push different agendas. Differing views \non how the economy works add to the confusion. Somehow, we need to get \nsome coordination and oversight of this whole process, and make certain \nthat all the players understand the broad objective and the role that \neach must play to make it work. I intend to push for that in the year \nahead.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 1424, a \nbill whose two components represent an important investment in \nAmerica's economy and whose passage is critical for ensuring our \nNation's long-term prosperity. First, the bill includes the Emergency \nEconomic Stabilization Act of 2008, which will ``provide authority and \nfacilities that the Secretary of the Treasury can use to restore \nliquidity and stability to the financial system of the United States.'' \nSecond, the bill incorporates the Senate substitute to H.R. 6049, which \nextends tax incentives addressing our country's most pressing \nchallenges.\n  I have previously come to the floor, on several occasions, to explain \nwhy we must commit to passing the ``tax extenders'' legislation. And I \nwas glad that on September 23, this Chamber approved H.R. 6049 on a 93 \nto 2 vote. In particular, the bill contains a robust package of tax \nincentives for clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives \nthat I, and many of my colleagues, have worked for since the beginning \nof this Congress. These incentives will enable us to become a more \nenergy efficient nation, wean us off our dependence on fossil fuels, \nand reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. I continue to support the \nextenders bill, and I hope that including the extenders bill in the \npackage that will soon come before us will increase the likelihood that \nthe extenders will become law. But I will focus my remarks today on the \nEmergency Economic Stabilization Act.\n  While we can dispute the causes, there is no denying that our country \nis facing a credit crisis. Paralyzed by illiquid loans on their books, \nbanks of all sizes and in all corners of our country have demonstrated \nreluctance to make loans to businesses, individuals, and other \nfinancial institutions. The fallout has been especially apparent on \nWall Street, where we have witnessed the collapse or near-collapse of 3 \nof the 5 independent U.S. investment banks, alongside the failure or \nnear-failure of many additional institutions that play a central role \nin our Nation's financial services infrastructure. But let's be clear: \nThe pain extends far beyond Wall Street.\n  With lending frozen, Americans are challenged in obtaining financing \nfor the most important transactions they undertake. The so-called TED \nspread, which reflects lending willingness among banks, has reached its \nhighest level in 25 years. When banks charge one another high premiums, \nthose costs are ultimately borne by those who seek to borrow. And as \nmortgage lending remains tight, fewer Americans are able to purchase \nhomes. Similarly, the approval rate for auto loans has fallen from 83 \npercent last year to a mere 63 percent this year. More than 25 major \nlenders have either cut back in private lending to students or have cut \noff student lending altogether. And nearly 3 in 4 small business owners \nsay they are having trouble finding loans. Without loans, many of these \nbusinesses will be unable to expand; others will fail.\n  So, too, are our States, counties, and cities feeling the impact, as \nthey face skyrocketing costs to issue the bonds that pay for day-to-day \noperations and capital projects. And I note with great concern the \ncredit crunch's impact on the Nation's utility infrastructure. Our \npublic and private utility companies rely heavily on debt to finance \ninfrastructure enhancements, but the volume of bond issuances by \nutilities fell 50 percent in the last quarter and 25 percent year-over-\nyear. Being unable to obtain financing inhibits U.S. utility companies \nfrom providing low-cost and reliable electricity, water, and gas to the \nNation's businesses and households.\n  Like my colleagues, I have heard from many who are concerned by the \nprospect of a Government intervention in the credit markets. But I have \nalso heard from people across New Mexico about the tremendous pressures \nthey are facing because of this crisis. In Ruidoso, a rural community \nmore than 2,000 miles from Wall Street, the credit crunch left the \nmunicipal school district with just one bidder for a $3 million bond \nissue. Unable to delay the school repairs and expansions that these \nbonds will finance, the school board was forced last month to sell the \nbonds at far less than it would have received just weeks earlier. In \nCarlsbad, the Community Foundation's endowment has declined \nsignificantly with the stock market, prompting the Foundation to \nannounce that it may scale back grant awards and scholarships. In \nnorthwestern New Mexico, along our States border with Arizona, the \nNavajo Nation's Budget and Finance Committee is now meeting to identify \nwhich projects to cut because of financial losses directly tied to the \ncredit\n\n[[Page S10265]]\n\ncrisis. And in the capital city of Santa Fe, Lehman Brothers' failure \nhas forced the Transportation Department to refinance bonds for highway \nconstruction. The refinanced terms will cost our State an additional \n$78,000 annually in debt service payments.\n\n  Failing to address the lack of available credit threatens to create a \ndownward spiral that will cripple our Nation's economy. Without access \nto credit, businesses cannot stay afloat and grow. As Federal Reserve \nChairman Ben Bernanke testified last week, without a rescue plan, the \ncountry stands to lose an additional 3.5 million jobs over the next 6 \nmonths. And if we do not pass this legislation, we are sure to see \nfurther declines in our Nation's capital markets, impacting everything \nfrom families' college savings plans to workers' 401(k)s and pensions \nto university and hospital endowments. Finally, we need to act to \nprevent our entire financial services sector from suffering major \ndisruption. The sector's gross liabilities have climbed from 21 percent \nof GDP in 1980 to 116 percent last year, much of which is owed from one \nbank to another. This, says the Financial Times' Martin Wolf, means \nthat absent swift action to restore liquidity, ``collapse will \nfollow.''\n  These challenges come at a time when America is hardly in the \nposition to weather a storm. To take just a few indicators: One in \neleven mortgages is delinquent or in foreclosure; credit card defaults \nhave increased by 15 percent from 2001; the Nation has lost more than \n600,000 jobs this year; and more than half of our States have moved to \ncut spending, use reserves, or raise revenues to address funding \nshortfalls.\n  Based on this evidence, I have concluded that Congress faces an \nimperative to act. Of course, in doing so, we must be responsive and \npolitically realistic. The plan before us today does not represent the \nbest possible solution--but it is a responsive and politically \nrealistic one.\n  I did not feel the same about Secretary Paulson's initial plan, which \nhe released on September 21. I had read his 3-page proposal to suggest \nthat the Secretary was asking for what amounted to a $700 billion blank \ncheck, and I would have voted against that proposal. Fortunately, \nCongressional leaders have significantly enhanced the Secretary's 3-\npage proposal. I applaud the Chairmen of the Senate Banking and House \nFinancial Services Committee for stepping in to move us in the \ndirection of greater transparency, oversight, and protection for the \nAmerican taxpayer. And I appreciate my colleagues who led the \nnegotiations--particularly Senators Dodd and Gregg--for developing a \nbipartisan compromise that I could support.\n  First, the plan minimizes risks to taxpayers, a critical priority \ngiven our dangerously high national debt of nearly $10 trillion. As CBO \nDirector Peter Orszag has testified, the ultimate cost of the plan will \nbe far less than $700 billion, for the simple reason that the \nGovernment will be able to sell the assets it acquires. But we cannot \nbe sure the cost is zero, and that is why I have conditioned my support \non ensuring that the Treasury receive equity in firms that benefit from \nan infusion of public funds. I applaud the inclusion of such a \nprovision in this bill, as well as a requirement that the President \npropose legislation to recover any anticipated losses.\n  Second, we have added significant oversight and reporting \nrequirements, including a Congressional oversight panel; audits by the \ncomptroller general; and the appointment of an inspector general for \nthe program. I have great respect for the Treasury Secretary, but feel \nthat no single individual should ever be entrusted with such a \nherculean undertaking without oversight.\n  Third, participating companies would be required to limit executive \ncompensation. Like so many Americans, I am troubled by reports of \nexecutives who walk away from failed financial service firms with \nstratospheric paychecks. This bill begins to address that justifiable \nconcern.\n  We cannot afford to sit by idly and let this crisis take a further \ntoll on the economy. But we also must be realistic about the \nlimitations of this legislation: It is a band-aid intended to stop the \nbleeding. It will not address the inadequate regulatory framework that \nallowed this crisis to develop, and Congress must commit to enacting \ncomprehensive reforms that will ensure we never again find ourselves in \nsuch a precarious position.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, regrettably a rescue plan is needed. \nGreed on Wall Street and lax regulatory practices from this \nadministration got us into this mess. Taxpayers are angry and so am I. \nAmericans who played by the rules are being asked to pay the bills for \nthose that didn't. Now, Congress must take steps to protect taxpayers, \nprotect the economy, protect the middle class, and protect our way of \nlife. I stand ready to do my part.\n  But if I am going to vote for this rescue plan I want reform and a \nreal commitment: regulation, oversight, and strong enforcement to \nwhat's on the books not a blind eye to those who cooked the books.\n  Heart and soul I am a regulator and a reformer. Time and time again \nwe've seen the consequences of a lax regulatory culture and wimpy \nenforcement. Well I've voted over and over for more teeth and better \nregulation--to strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission, to \nget rid of lead paint in toys and lead in the bureaucracy, to make sure \nthe FDA doesn't approve dangerous drugs and stop predatory lending and \nflipping.\n  The bill that got us into this mess in the first place was Graham-\nLeach-Biley. It got rid of the distinction between investment banks and \ncommercial banks. That lowered the bar on regulation and allowed for \ncasino economics. I was one of nine Senators to vote against it. I said \nwe were going to create an environment where we were creating whales \nand sharks and the minnows would be eaten alive. Regrettably, my \nprediction proved right.\n  I was told I was old fashioned. I was told ``Get with it Barb, we're \nin a global market.'' Yes, I do believe in old fashioned values: \nhonesty and integrity.\n  We need to get back to basics. It is not only about this bill. From \ntainted dog food to toxic securities Wall Street acted like they were \nmasters of the universe but now they took us into a black hole.\n  The U.S. is in a credit crisis and that crisis affects everyone. As \nTom Friedman said today in the New York Times,\n\n       We're all connected . . . you can't save Main Street and \n     punish Wall Street anymore than you can be in a rowboat with \n     someone you hate and think that the leak in the bottom of the \n     boat at his end is not going to sink you too.\n\n  The credit crisis affects jobs, and what's going on in our economy. \nSomeone who wants a car to get to work can't get a loan to buy the car \nand that means the car dealer won't get the money to restock inventory \nand that car factories might shut down. And it means that person might \nnot be able to get to their job.\n  It is a chain reaction.\n  Even if you don't think you own stocks your pension does. Towns and \ncities use credit to build and improve schools. Local governments use \ncredit to fix intersections, and build highways and bridges.\n  That single mother who wants to go to community college uses credit \nto invest in herself. She won't be able to get help unless we act.\n  We need rescue, reform, and retribution. No blank checks and no \nchecks without balances. We also need a 21st century regulatory \nstructure to protect taxpayers, help homeowners and guarantee no golden \nparachutes for the people who got us into this mess.\n  Senators Dodd and Gregg and my other colleagues did a good job of \nimproving the Bush plan. This bill is much better than the Bush plan \nand goes to my principles. It protects taxpayers, has oversight and \ntransparency, makes sure taxpayers benefit when economy improves, and \nit says no to golden parachutes.\n  However, I am disappointed in what is in here for homeowners. This \nwas an opportunity to help homeowners, and show them whose side we were \non.\n  There is some help but not enough. More people will get out of \nsubprime mortgages and into FHA's. This bill should have said that \nfamilies could have a work out plan to save their home. But \nunfortunately bill goes all out to help Wall Street and only halfway to \nhelp homeowners.\n\n[[Page S10266]]\n\n  Many of these homeowners were hurt by predatory lending and deceptive \nadvertising. These fraudulent lenders said let the good times roll. \nWell the good times are over and it's time for heads to roll.\n  That is why I went to work getting money in the Federal checkbook for \nthe FBI to do mortgage fraud retribution.\n  The FBI's mortgage fraud workload increased 200 percent in 3 years. \nAt April 16, 2008, at my CJS hearing, I asked FBI Director Mueller, \n``How have cases increased? What do you need?'' He answered that he \nneeded more funding for agents dedicated to mortgage fraud \ninvestigations.\n  So I provided $10 million to hire at least 25 additional FBI agents \ndedicated to investigation of mortgage fraud. So I'm coming after the \nscam artists and predatory lenders and won't stop until they get what \nthey deserve.\n  I have great reservations about this legislation but I will vote for \nthis bill. I don't think it goes far enough. I wanted more help for \nhomeowners and more teeth in the oversight.\n  Is this a good bill? It is a lifeboat bill. We have no guarantees but \nit's a step we have to take. It's an immediate crisis and we have to \nrestore confidence and restore stability so we save jobs and save our \neconomy.\n  It will deal with the credit crisis. If we do not deal with the \ncredit crisis, I believe that the Main Street economy will have to pay \nthe bill for the bailout and pay the bill again in lost jobs, the \nability to get along and in shrinking retirement and pension. So I will \nvote for this bill. But I heard the taxpayers loud and clear.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the financial \ncrisis threatening our Nation. Like my fellow North Carolinians, I am \nvery concerned and angry about the circumstances that have brought our \ncountry's economy to the brink and that now necessitate the Congress to \nact. While pointing fingers is easy, the grave fact remains that we are \nfacing one of the most significant economic challenges we have ever \nconfronted--one that threatens our very way of life.\n  I have heard from thousands of hard-working citizens who have spent \ntheir entire lives acting responsibly, only buying a home that they \ncould afford, working hard to put food on the table, saving money to \nsend their kids to college, and only borrowing responsibly when \nnecessary. They are angry, and they have every right to be. I am angry, \ntoo. It is wrong and it is disgraceful that responsible, hard working \npeople of this country are now being asked to step in to fix a mess \ncaused by the irresponsible and greedy behavior of others. Much of what \ngot us to this point was not only reckless behavior on Wall Street but \nalso the fact that many people took out risky mortgages that they \nsimply could never afford. A boom of easy money has led to a bust, \nwhich has now resulted in a collapse of housing markets all over the \ncountry and a potential collapse of our system of credit--the very \nlifeblood of our economy.\n  Let me be clear--this crisis threatens the financial security of each \nand every one of us--whether you have a retirement savings account or a \npension, own a home, want to buy a home or a car, or have a savings \naccount for your child's education or want to borrow for college. The \ncurrent financial instability, if left unchecked, threatens the ability \nof small businesses and family farms to meet their payrolls, purchase \nfuel, and pay for their day-to-day business operations as their credit \nlines dry up and disappear. While many believe that this action is a \nbailout of Wall Street, the fundamental reason the Senate is compelled \nto act today is to stop an economic collapse of Main Street. Every day \nthat goes by, our financial system grinds closer to a complete halt. We \nmust act to get to the roots of this financial turmoil and get our \nfinancial system moving again.\n  As the health of our financial system has rapidly deteriorated, many \nbanks have restricted or stopped lending altogether. Families, \nbusinesses, and local governments have found it harder to borrow money, \nmoney that is needed just to keep daily operations going. Without \naccess to credit, businesses can't borrow money to buy equipment needed \nto produce their products. Cities and towns can't borrow money for \nwater and sewer systems, roads, or other critically important community \nprojects.\n  Over the past 2 weeks, I have heard from small businesses, cities, \nand towns in North Carolina that have been stranded by this economic \ncrisis--businesses that can't get their standard lines of credit to \noperate and whose loans have been called. I have heard from counties \nthroughout my State recounting how this national financial crisis is \nmaking it impossible to borrow from banks to pay for their schools and \nother critical projects. These businesses and local governments aren't \nfolks with poor credit ratings or folks who have been late on or missed \ntheir loan payments. These are folks with strong credit histories who \nare the innocent victims currently caught up by our current financial \ncrisis, and these are the honest, hard-working folks this legislation \nbefore us is meant to help by getting credit, the necessary lifeblood \nof our economy, flowing again.\n  Whether we like it or not, we now face a financial crisis that is \nunprecedented in scope, with repercussions so far-reaching that no \nAmerican would be immune. So we now face a choice. We could do nothing \nand just let our entire country--which depends on credit to function \nevery day--seize up and come to a halt. We could do that, but history \nhas painfully shown us what happens when you do nothing and credit \ndries up. America felt this during the Great Depression. The result was \na 40-percent foreclosure rate, massive unemployment, and years of \neconomic hardship for millions.\n  Like many of my Republican colleagues in Congress, I cannot stand the \nnotion of supporting something that violates my fundamental belief in \nfree enterprise, the freedom to succeed, and the freedom to fail. That \nwe have to consider this legislation at all marks a sad day in our \nNation's history. But as a public servant, and as an elected \nrepresentative of the Great State of North Carolina, I do not believe I \ncan sit by and let this country fall into the worst economic state that \nit has ever faced. The risks of just rolling the dice, doing nothing, \nand letting the chips fall where they may are, in my opinion, too high. \nA working credit system is core to a strong economy. The bipartisan \nbill before us is our best chance, and perhaps our last chance, to \navert this looming crisis.\n  While the need for this legislation is regrettable, I am heartened \nthat the plan before the Senate includes very important protections for \ntaxpayers, limits on executive compensation for Wall Street, and strong \nmeasures to ensure proper oversight and accountability. Under the \nlegislation:\n\n       Those companies that sell their bad assets to the Federal \n     Government must also provide warrants--a type of ownership \n     stake--so that taxpayers will benefit from any future \n     profits. If the program ends up making money for taxpayers, \n     that money must go toward paying down the national debt. If \n     the program loses money for taxpayers, then the President \n     will be required to submit a proposal to Congress for \n     recouping those losses from the financial institutions.\n       Corporate executives will have their golden parachutes \n     clipped and any unearned corporate bonuses must be returned. \n     In addition, companies will pay taxes on executive pay and, \n     in many cases, must limit executive pay.\n       The FBI has already begun preliminary investigations into \n     criminal wrongdoing by the management of 26 financial \n     institutions, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, AIG, and \n     Lehman Brothers. The FBI is also pursuing over 1,400 mortgage \n     fraud cases nationwide. This legislation will beef up that \n     enforcement.\n       Savings deposits will be insured up to $250,000 by the \n     Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC, up from the \n     $100,000 limit currently in place. This additional protection \n     is very important for retirees, near retirees, and small \n     businesses so that they know their savings and basic business \n     operation accounts are indeed safe.\n       An oversight board will be established to monitor the \n     Treasury's activities. In addition, a new inspector general \n     will be appointed to protect taxpayers against fraud, waste, \n     and abuse.\n       Rather than giving the Treasury all the funds at once, the \n     legislation gives the Treasury $250 billion immediately and \n     then requires the President to certify that additional funds \n     are needed. Congress will have the power to deny those funds.\n\n  After we weather this crisis, and I am confident we can, I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Congress to improve the \nregulatory structures that govern our financial system. As this crisis \nmakes abundantly clear, many of our regulations\n\n[[Page S10267]]\n\nto deal with financial markets are outdated. It is also important that \nwe prosecute any corporation or individual who broke the law and \ncontributed to this mess to the full extent possible. We must never \nfind ourselves in this situation again and never again place American \ntaxpayers and their livelihoods at risk.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the energy tax \nprovisions of Senator Dodd's amendment to the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act. These provisions were included in the tax extenders, \nH.R. 6049, passed by the Senate last week. I strongly support these \nprovisions, and I am pleased that they are included in the financial \nrescue plan we are voting on today.\n  The United States needs a balanced, comprehensive national energy \npolicy that addresses our immediate problems and future needs without \ncompromising the health of the environment. In fact, I believe we must \nembark on a national effort to achieve energy independence by 2020. \nThis effort will require a stronger commitment to renewable energy \nsources and energy efficiency and conservation.\n  Some of the best ideas about what we need to do now and over the next \n5 years to address our Nation's energy crisis are coming from people in \nmy State of Maine. A professor at the University of Maine has a plan \nfor clean, renewable offshore wind power to supply as much as 40 \npercent of the Nation's energy. Offshore wind production that is out of \nsight from land could provide an affordable source of renewable energy \ndirectly to population centers on each coast while supplying thousands \nof new jobs. In addition, it would expand Maine's electricity supply so \nthat people could transition away from using oil.\n  Maine is also well positioned to take a leading role in the \ndevelopment of this tidal power. The U.S. wave and tidal energy \nresource potential that reasonably could be harnessed is about 10 \npercent of national energy demand. In Maine, a consortium of the \nUniversity of Maine, Maine Maritime Academy, and industry is poised to \nbecome a key test bed site for tidal energy devices.\n  Maine also has a large supply of wood that could be used as an energy \nsource. These stoves dramatically reduce both indoor and outdoor air \npollution, use up to 50 percent less wood for the same amount of heat \nand utilize one of Maine's renewable resources. I am pleased that the \nenergy tax bill includes a provision I authored to provide a $300 tax \ncredit for replacing an old, inefficient wood stove with a cleanburning \nwood or wood pellet stove.\n  This credit will be an important tool to help people in my home State \nand throughout the Nation find affordable ways to heat their homes this \nwinter. This legislation provides a credit for home heating systems \nwhich have thermal efficiencies greater than 75 percent and which use \nrenewable, biomass fuels. Efficient, clean-burning biomass equipment \ncurrently is available that can achieve this thermal efficiency, and I \nbelieve that equipment should and would be eligible for tax incentives \nin this amendment.\n  Mr. President, again I am pleased that we are discussing renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency tax credits today. I look forward to \nseeing these credits signed into law soon.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words in response to \nwhat I have heard on the floor of the Senate today. Many Senators have \nstood up and spoken in favor of the Wall Street bailout bill we will be \nvoting on later tonight. That is their right, but they are only telling \none side of the story.\n  I have heard a lot about changes made to this bill in the last few \ndays, but make no mistake about it, this is the same bailout that the \nHouse of Representatives rejected Monday afternoon. The only thing that \nis different is the packaging. The failed House bill has been attached \nto a tax bill which the Senate has already passed overwhelmingly, a \nmental health parity bill which is broadly supported in the Senate, and \nan increase in FDIC insurance limits. In other words, a few sweeteners \nhave been added to buy off a few more votes. But the bailout remains \nthe same.\n  Now, let me say a few words about some of that lipstick. Though the \ntax extenders bill does not have everything I hoped for in it, I \nstrongly support it and voted for it just a few weeks ago. I also have \ncosponsored the Senate version of the mental health parity bill. I \nstill support both and want to see them become law. I am disappointed \nthat I am being put in a position of having to vote against those \nbills.\n  I have been clear since Secretary Paulson proposed his plan that I \nthought it was a bad idea and would not work. I still think so, and \napparently so does a majority of the House of Representatives. The \nHouse rightly rejected the bailout we will be voting on tonight because \nit is a bailout of Wall Street at the expense of Main Street. The \nAmerican people are outraged by this proposal, and all any Senator \nneeds to do is stand around their front office and listen to the phone \ncalls to understand that.\n  Now, about the proposal itself, I have no confidence it will work, \nand the only people I have heard that have confidence that it will work \nare the Treasury Secretary and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the \npeople who proposed it in the first place. Even Senators supporting \nthis bill say things like ``I hope this will work'' or ``we have to do \nthis because nothing is not an option.'' I say that $700 billion is a \nlot of money to gamble on hope, especially when there are other \noptions.\n  Sadly, no other options have been considered. Secretary Paulson and \nChairman Bernanke both admitted they did not consider other proposals. \nCongress certainly has not considered any other option. Why not? \nBecause we are told there is not time and we have to do something now. \nWell, here we are, 2 weeks after the initial proposal, and the sky has \nnot fallen.\n  Now, I recognize there are real problems in our financial markets and \nthose problems could hurt the overall economy and average Americans. As \nI have said on this floor as recently as last week, we have both policy \nand structural problems in our financial system that need to be \naddressed. Those problems are largely a result of bad monetary policy, \nbad governmental policies, and bad oversight by regulators. But these \nproblems cannot be fixed by just throwing money at Wall Street as we \nrun out the door to go home and campaign. They require serious thought \nand serious work.\n  While the problems in our financial markets have been a long time in \nthe making and cannot be solved overnight, the freeze in the credit \nmarkets and the panic that we are seeing now came about rather quickly. \nThat is because Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke set \nexpectations for Government intervention when they bailed out Bear \nStearns in March. The markets operated all summer with the belief that \nthe Government would step in and rescue failing firms. Then they let \nLehman Brothers fail, and the markets had to adjust to the idea that \nWall Street would have to take the losses for Wall Street's bad \ndecisions, not the taxpayers. That new uncertainty could be the most \nsignificant contributing factor to why the markets have lost \nconfidence. Even worse, to sell the public and Congress on this Wall \nStreet bailout, the President, Secretary Paulson, and Chairman Bernanke \nhave pushed the media and public to the edge of panic by telling \neveryone we are staring at the second coming of the Great Depression.\n  But this bill is not going to solve those problems. I am not alone in \nmy concerns about this bill. Last week, I entered into the Record two \nletters from nearly 300 economists who said it will not work. I have \nalso heard from many market participants that this program will not \nwork. In fact, the only way anyone has any confidence that this plan \nwill work is if the Government overpays and gives a windfall to the \nbanks and others selling their bad investments. But that is not just \ndishonest, it is also not even the most efficient way of getting funds \ninto the institutions.\n  This bill also has no requirements that the institutions take their \nnewfound cash and use it to lend to Main Street or anyone else. They \nare going to put that money to the use they think is in their best \ninterest, not in the best interest of the average American.\n  Now, I do support taking action to address the mess Government \ncreated. To restore confidence, instead of giving\n\n[[Page S10268]]\n\nthe Secretary $700 billion, we should send a signal that we are serious \nabout this and stay in Washington until we have a real solution. One \nway we could do that is to give the Secretary a far smaller amount of \nfunds to use to unfreeze the markets and take a few weeks to hold some \nhearings, meet with experts who might have different ideas, and find a \nway to fix what is broken. We certainly should not just rely on the \nopinions of the people who created this mess and stand to benefit the \nmost from this proposal.\n  There are plenty of other ideas that are worth exploring but, \nunfortunately, have been ignored. We could allow companies with \nearnings overseas to bring that money back to the United States tax \nfree if they invested it in the same troubled assets the Secretary \nwants to buy. Rather than buying toxic paper, we could create a system \nto support the top-quality, AAA-rated, debt market, which must begin \nfunctioning for the credit crunch to end. We should also immediately \nput in place policies that will encourage economic growth, such as \nenergy exploration and development and tax policies to encourage job \ncreation. We also need to address the regulatory and structural \nproblems I mentioned earlier. I am sure there are plenty of other ideas \nthat could help as well. My intent here is not to list everything that \nneeds to be done but to point out that there is a lot that should be \nconsidered and is not even being discussed.\n  Finally, I want to say that I hope for the best with this bill. I am \ngoing to vote against it, and I hope that I am wrong. Even if this bill \npasses and becomes law, I am not going to give up on looking for the \nright long-term solutions to our problems.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we are here tonight to take emergency \naction to rescue our Nation's economy. Before us is a compromise \nmeasure--the product of an intense process that Congress has entered \ninto reluctantly. It is the result of negotiations between Democrats \nand Republicans, between House and Senate, and between Congress and the \nAdministration. This evening, as we prepare to vote, Americans still \nhave many questions as to how the bill's provisions will be implemented \nand what the eventual impact will be on our economy. We remain stunned \nthat the greed of a few necessitates sacrifice from all of us. For \nthese reasons, I understand the opposition of so many Americans to the \nnews of this bill, one of whose goals is to restore stability to the \nmarkets. I have heard from many Marylanders who have expressed to me \ntheir anger, a sentiment that I share.\n  This vote is one of the most unpleasant I will have taken during my \n22 years in Congress, and I come to the floor with anger and sadness, \nbut also with determination to do what is right for this country.\n  This is not the bill that I would have written, but it represents our \ncollective deliberations. Our economy is in dire straits, and our time \nis limited. Not because of a pre-determined adjournment date, but \nbecause markets across the world are looking to the United States hour \nby hour for action that will restore the world's confidence in our \neconomy, and every day that we delay diminishes that confidence.\n  This crisis was created in large part by the Bush administration's \nhands-off approach to financial institutions. Over the last 8 years, we \nhave seen unemployment rise, real wages and property values plummet, \nbudget and trade deficits soar, and a burgeoning dependence on foreign \ncapital and foreign energy.\n  At the start of 2001, we had projected surpluses of $5.6 trillion \nover the next decade. But in the last 8 years, the administration's \neconomic policies have squandered those surpluses and produced annual \ndeficits that now near $500 billion. But what was occurring out of the \nview of most Americans created the tipping point. Deregulation of Wall \nStreet led to a new paradigm in which greed was rewarded. Financial \ninstitutions were incentivized to create complex financial shell games \nthat enriched the few while hiding the true cost to this Nation of too-\neasy credit and ill-advised mortgages. And so, today, the first day of \nfiscal year 2009, we are faced with a catastrophic economic situation--\ntightening credit, shrinking 401(k) plans and money market accounts, a \nwildly lurching stock market, a drastic restructuring of major American \ncorporations, banks that will not lend to other banks, and the lowest \nlevels of consumer confidence in our Nation's history.\n  Nearly 2 years ago, I took the oath of office for the U.S. Senate. It \nreads in part, ``I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic.'' In the closing days of this administration, our enemy \npresents in the form of a severe crisis of confidence in the American \neconomy--one of the gravest that our Nation has ever faced. No nation \ncan continue to thrive without solid economic footing, and so it is \nimperative that we act in the best interest of the United States and do \nour best to resolve this crisis. This measure, crafted under the \nleadership of Majority Leader Reid, Senators Dodd and Gregg, and many \nothers in this body, as well as our colleagues in the House, is the \nresult of that effort. I believe it is an honest and responsible \nattempt to bring near-term stability to our situation.\n  If we do not act, we are jeopardizing far more than the future of the \nfinancial district. This is not about the balance sheets of a New York \nbrokerage house or even a few national banks. Rather, it is about the \nbalance sheet of every American family. If we do not act, we will \nendanger Americans' ability to secure an affordable car loan, mortgage, \nor college loan. We will jeopardize the retirement savings accounts of \nnear-retirees who hope to leave the workforce in the next few years, \nand families trying to build a secure future for the years to come. \nMore than 50 percent of families have a stake in the markets--either \nthrough mutual funds, 401(k) plans, TSPs for Federal employees, or \nstocks.\n  If we do not act, we will place at risk our small and large \nbusinesses--access to loans is critical to their ability to survive and \nthrive, and if credit is unavailable, these businesses will be unable \nto make payroll, stock their shelves, or keep their doors open. With \nthat in mind, many Members, including myself, awaited the \nadministration's proposal, which they submitted to Congress on Saturday \nmorning, September 20. In that three-page proposal, President Bush \nasked Congress and the American taxpayers to follow him into uncharted \nterritory and restructure our entire financial system. The Treasury \nDepartment proposal asked Congress for unprecedented authority to spend \n$700 billion over the next 2 years to purchase distressed mortgage-\nrelated assets to provide stability to financial markets and our \nbanking system. The proposal sought authority, ``without limitation,'' \nto enter into contracts, to designate financial institutions as \nfinancial agents of the Government, and to establish ``vehicles'' for \npurchasing mortgage-related assets and issuing obligations, among other \nthings. Further, the proposal stipulated that any actions the Secretary \ntakes ``may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative \nagency.''\n  Brevity may indeed be the soul of wit, as Shakespeare wrote in \nHamlet. But it shouldn't be the ``soul'' of a legislative proposal--or \nthe sole legislative proposal--to shore up a badly faltering economy.\n  According to the administration, the role for Congress--a coequal \nbranch of Government--was to authorize the enterprise and then wait for \nsemi-annual status reports from the Treasury Department. We were also \ntold to pass it right away, without amendment, because each day we \ndelayed, the markets would continue to crumble.\n  The administration wanted a bill to bail out Wall Street; Congress is \npoised to pass a bipartisan bill that will protect the American \neconomy, begin to reform financial practices, and require the strong \noversight that has been so lacking during this administration.\n  It is our duty to protect the taxpayer, ensure transparency and \naccountability in our financial systems, and to make improvements in \ntheir interactions with American taxpayers and the Federal Government.\n  This bill will provide up to $700 billion to the Secretary of the \nTreasury to buy mortgages and other assets that are crippling financial \ninstitutions across the Nation. EESA also establishes a program that \nwould allow companies to insure their troubled assets.\n  EESA requires the Treasury to modify troubled loans--many the result \nof\n\n[[Page S10269]]\n\npredatory lending practices--wherever possible to help American \nfamilies keep their homes. It also directs other Federal agencies to \nmodify loans that they own or control. Finally, it improves the HOPE \nfor Homeowners program by expanding eligibility and increasing the \ntools available to the Department of Housing and Urban Development to \nhelp more families keep their homes. I am pleased that this evening \nChairman Dodd and I were able to clarify the authority for Treasury to \npurchase low income housing tax credits under this legislation. This \nauthority will allow Treasury to keep liquidity in the market for these \ncritical tax credits and thus provide for the continued development of \naffordable housing nationwide, at little or no additional cost to \ntaxpayers. However, I am disappointed that in negotiations, the \nPresident rejected our efforts to provide more extensive help for \nhomeowners through the bankruptcy courts. With default rates and \nforeclosures at the highest levels in our history, I look forward to \nthe next Congress during which we must do more to protect Americans' \nhomes.\n  This bill also requires companies whose assets are purchased by the \ngovernment to provide warrants so that taxpayers will benefit from any \nfuture growth these companies may experience as a result of \nparticipation in this program. The legislation also requires the \nPresident to submit legislation that would cover taxpayer losses \nresulting from this program by charging a broad-based fee on all \nfinancial institutions. I am disappointed that requirement for the \nfinancial institutions responsible for these losses to pay was not \nincluded in this legislation.\n  This bill does include provisions to limit executive compensation. \nExecutives who made catastrophic decisions should not be allowed to \nunload their toxic assets on working American families and still make \nhigh salaries and bonuses. Under this bill, some companies will lose \ncertain tax benefits for salaries in excess of $500,000 and their \nbonuses and so called ``golden parachutes'' will be prohibited for \ntheir top five executives. The bill also requires recovery of bonuses \nthat are paid based on statements of earnings and gains that are later \nproven to be ``materially inaccurate.''\n  Rather than giving the Treasury all the funds at once, as the \noriginal Bush plan stipulated, this legislation gives the Treasury the \nauthority to spend $250 billion immediately, and requires the President \nto certify that additional funds are needed--$100 billion, then $350 \nbillion subject to Congressional disapproval. The Treasury must report \non the use of the funds and the progress made in addressing the crisis.\n  I joined Finance Committee Chairman Baucus' push for the creation of \na special inspector general to oversee this effort. The magnitude of \nboth this bill's pricetag and the task assigned to the Treasury \nDepartment are such that rigorous, independent efforts are necessary to \nprevent waste, fraud and abuse. This provision is a necessary element \nof the bill, and it will lead to a better, more responsibly executed \nprogram.\n  Over the past week, as anxiety about our economy has heightened and \nbanks have collapsed, Americans have begun to openly consider the so-\ncalled ``Serta Option'' for hiding their cash. That's why I am \nsupportive of the provision added this week to increase temporarily the \nFDIC limits from $100,000 to $250,000. It is more important than ever, \nduring these times of uncertainty, to instill confidence in every \nAmerican who has a savings account that their hard-earned deposits are \nsecure.\n  As I said at the outset, Americans are angry that we are in this \nposition. The vast majority of Americans acknowledge that something \nmust be done. They want action from this Congress, and by last Tuesday \nmorning, after the largest 1-day point drop ever in the Dow Jones \naverage, most recognized that our inaction is not an option.\n  I will vote for this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nanswering the call for urgent action. In three short months, the 111th \nCongress will convene. I will continue to push for the types of \nreassurances that America's communities are looking for, not just those \nthat our financial markets seek. This is a time of crisis for our \ncountry, but it is also a time of opportunity; an opportunity to ensure \nthat we never again leave our Nation's families vulnerable to economic \nmeltdown while corporate executives walk away with millions of dollars; \nan opportunity to protect working Americans' investments in their homes \nand communities; an opportunity to ensure that small businesses can \naccess the credit they need to prosper and expand. I ask my colleagues \nto join me tonight in this vote, and in January, when we take on the \nlonger and even more challenging task of getting our country back on \ntrack.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, although long overdue, I am very pleased \nthat the Senate has incorporated a bipartisan agreement to renew \nexpiring tax provisions in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of \n2008. These tax provisions are critical to families across America, and \nprovide incentives for the production of clean energy and conservation \nthat could create 100,000 new jobs. As working families are struggling \nto put food on the table and gas in their cars, I am especially \ngrateful that the package assists the least fortunate among us by \nincluding a proposal to lower the income threshold for the refundable \nchild tax credit that Senator Lincoln and I have championed.\n  I would especially like to thank Senators Baucus and Grassley as well \nas their staffs for working days, nights, and weekends in forging this \nagreement. These two leaders exemplify the bipartisan tradition of the \nSenate and how this body can get its work done if Members are willing \nto reach across the aisle to find the middle ground.\n  Unfortunately, partisan gridlock too often ties the hands of even \nthese Senate stalwarts. I find it hard to fathom that, in what could \npotentially be the closing hours of this Congress, we are only now \nmoving a step closer to enacting this legislation. At a time when \nrenewable energy projects are being mothballed because of this \nuncertainty and Americans are demanding action on energy policy, I \ncannot believe that we have been abrogating our duty to serve the \nAmerican people by our inaction on this time-sensitive issue. It seems \nto me that these tax extensions should have been the low-hanging fruit \nthat we could have done much sooner.\n  We could have unleashed sooner renewable energy projects creating \njobs, provided targeted tax relief to low-income working families \nstruggling to pay the high cost of food and fuel, encourage an infusion \nof capital into rural and urban communities, provide tax incentives for \nretail businesses looking to grow their business, and help keep the \njobs associated with film production within our borders.\n  This is occurring at a time when our economy teeters on the brink of \nrecession; when we have seen the collapse of a banking institution \nfounded in 1850, when the U.S. government has seen no other way but to \ntake over major financial institutions; when unemployment surged to 6.1 \npercent last month--the highest rate since 2003; when gasoline at the \npump is near $4 a gallon; when oil costs remain at $100 per barrel; and \nwhen foreclosures have hit historic levels, do we really want to say \nthat we can't extend a renewable energy tax credit that caused 45 \npercent growth in wind energy production last year and that we can't \nadopt energy efficiency tax credits that create necessary incentives to \nreduce energy demand?\n  Consider the economic impact of inaction. Dr. Mark Cooper of the \nConsumer Federation of America estimates that from 2002 to 2008 annual \nhousehold expenditures on energy increased from about $2,600 to an \nastonishing $5,300! In my state of Maine, where 80 percent of \nhouseholds use heating oil to get through winter, it's going to be even \nworse.\n  Last year at this time, heating oil prices were at a challenging \n$2.70 per gallon--for a Mainer who on average uses 850 gallons of oil, \nthat is $2,295. With current prices at $3.80 per gallon, the cost per \nMainer to stay warm will be at least $3,230, and that is not even \nconsidering gasoline costs. That is the difference between a burden and \na crisis.\n  Now is not the time to allow energy efficiency tax incentives and the \nrenewable production tax credit to expire. But that is what we are \ndoing unless we pass this bipartisan package\n\n[[Page S10270]]\n\ntoday. Energy efficiency is by far the most effective investment that \nour country can make to address the calamity of an absent energy \npolicy. Jerry Howard with the National Association of Home Builders \nstates:\n\n       Our members build homes that are significantly more energy \n     efficient than those of a generation ago. But in today's \n     economic climate, home builders need incentives to spur them \n     to even more action.\n\n  It constitutes a dereliction of duty if Congress allows energy \nefficiency tax credits to expire. In fact, some tax credits already \nhave expired, and as a result, there are currently no incentives to \npurchase efficient furnaces. At a time when Americans are worried about \npaying heating bills this winter, we must provide the assistance to \nencourage investment in energy-efficient products that will reduce our \ncollective demand for energy, and save Americans money.\n  Yet we have jettisoned a $300 tax credit to purchase high-efficiency \noil furnaces, which would produce more than $430 in annual savings for \nan average home--according to calculations based on Department of \nEnergy data and recent home heating prices. We have sidelined an \nextension of a tax credit for highly efficient natural gas furnaces \nthat would save an individual $100 per year. However, this tax credit \nended at the beginning of this year--when oil prices began their \nhistoric rise.\n  That is why it is so critical that the extenders package that earlier \npassed the Senate included a significant portion of my EXTEND Act, \nwhich I have championed with Senator Feinstein. This legislation, \nsupported by a sizeable group of businesses and environmental \nadvocates, would revolutionize our building infrastructure and save our \ncountry expensive energy. My legislation included a long-term extension \nfor energy-efficient commercial buildings, as well as an extension for \nenergy-efficient residential buildings and new homes, investments that \nwill reduce energy consumption for generations. This legislation would \nsave our country $25 billion annually in utility bills by 2018.\n\n  I also wish to highlight the important provision that provides a tax \ncredit for biomass stoves, a proposal initially introduced by Senator \nSununu. When the costs of other heating sources are excessively high we \nshould be providing options to consumers. I look forward to publicizing \nthis tax credit to ensure that it can be utilized by homeowners this \nwinter.\n  And for businesses that are competing against countries that \nsubsidize oil, the situation is untenable. Earlier this summer, \nKatahdin Paper Company in my State announced that the cost of oil used \nto operate its boilers has caused the company to consider closing the \nmill's doors. Talks are underway to find alternative solutions to \nrestart the mill's operations and revive its 208 jobs, but it is \nundeniable that these jobs hang in the balance because of unprecedented \nenergy costs.\n  One remedy would be to create more renewable energy jobs that would \nhelp right a listless economy and boost investment in a secure energy \nfuture. Indeed, more than 100,000 Americans could have been put to work \nthis year if clean energy production tax credits had been extended. We \nearlier could have unleashed renewable energy projects creating jobs, \nbut instead, projects currently underway may soon be mothballed. Rhone \nResch, president of the Solar Industries Association, says ``It is \nscaring away investment, just as our industry is beginning to get a \ntoehold.'' Can you believe that? We are actually ``scaring away \ninvestment'' during these unprecedented economic times. Gregory \nWetstone of the American Wind Energy Association said recently:\n\n       If Congress fails to act, it's a real blow to renewable \n     energy. It means that fewer wind turbines will be used to \n     generate pollution-free power in the United States.\n\n  Clean energy incentives for energy-efficient buildings, appliances, \nand other technologies, as well as additional funding for weatherizing \nhomes, would similarly serve to stimulate economic activity, reduce \nresidential energy costs, and generate new manufacturing and \nconstruction jobs. It is irresponsible to allow a bright spot in our \neconomy, the renewable energy industry and energy efficiency \nindustries, to falter when the output of these industries is so \nessential to the future of this country.\n  Extending these expiring clean energy tax credits will ensure a \nstronger, more stable environment for new investments and ensure \ncontinued robust growth in a bright spot in an otherwise slowing \neconomy. I am encouraged by the bipartisan agreement that is before us \ntoday. We must not lose yet another opportunity to raise the bar for \nfuture domestic energy systems and energy efficiencies, benefiting our \neconomy, our health, our environment, and our national security. I hope \nthat the House of Representatives will quickly take up and pass this \npackage.\n  Some may argue this is an election year and we must lower our \nexpectations for getting things accomplished. I could not disagree \nmore. And I met a remarkable woman from Maine earlier this year who \ncould not disagree more--because time is quickly running out on this \nCongress to take necessary steps to help Americans like her. She told \nme she had three jobs--the first to pay for the mortgage, the second to \npay for heating oil, and the third to pay for gas to be able to drive \nto her other two jobs--and this was back in April.\n  Solving this crisis is not about party labels. It is not about \nRepublicans or Democrats--or red States or blue States. It is about \nwhat is good for America, and what unites us as Americans under the \nred, white, and blue. We must move in that direction as a country.\n  But, there is much more in this package beyond energy tax incentives. \nThe legislation before us will extend the New Markets Tax Credit \nthrough 2009. Based on the New Markets Tax Credit Extension Act of \n2007, which I introduced with Senator Rockefeller, this provision will \nhelp to ensure that investment dollars continue to flow to underserved \ncommunities.\n  Additionally, the tax extenders package will enable retailers who own \ntheir properties to depreciate over 15 years, instead of 39 years, \nimprovements to those structures. Based on my legislation, this Main \nStreet-friendly provision levels the playing field between owner-\noccupied and leased retail space and will help to generate additional \nconstruction and renovations to stores nationwide by lowering the cost \nof capital in a tightening credit market.\n  Also included is a provision that will allow companies to claim \naccelerated depreciation for the purchase of recycling equipment. This \nprovision is based on my Recycling Investment Saves Energy, RISE, Act \nand will save energy, create jobs, strengthen local recycling programs, \nand improve the quantity and quality of recycled materials.\n  So as you can see, this package is more than just extending expiring \ntax provisions. This legislation will create jobs, move us closer to \nenergy independence, encourage investment in low-income communities, \nand provide much-needed relief to low-income families struggling to \nmeet basic needs. For these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues in \nthe House to swiftly take up this legislation and finally send it to \nthe President for his signature.\n  I hope that when the Second Session of the 110th Congress adjourns, \nwe can say we extended this critical tax package. I would also hope \nthat at the beginning of next year, when a new Congress is sworn in, we \nwill commit ourselves to serving those who have entrusted us with their \nvotes, where reaching across the aisle is the norm, not the exception--\nwhere looking for consensus is viewed as the answer, not an aberration.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with respect to the \nunprecedented financial rescue legislation that is before us in the \nU.S. Senate. And let me begin by first applauding Senator Dodd, Senator \nGregg, Senator Bennett and Senator Corker for their perseverance in \nnegotiating and developing a package, as well as the Republican and \nDemocratic leaders' bipartisan work in what are most assuredly the most \ndifficult of circumstances.\n  Where we stand today is at the precipice of a financial crisis, the \nmagnitude of which is already of historic proportions--threatening \nfuture economic growth, jobs for hardworking American families, \nretirement savings for our seniors, and the ability of Americans \nthroughout the country from all walks of life to access credit for \nattending college, purchasing a\n\n[[Page S10271]]\n\nhouse or automobile, and running their small businesses. Indeed, the \nvery underpinnings of our economy are imperiled.\n  This is where we are. The options we face looking forward are not \nones that any of us here would choose--far from it. The American people \nare angry--and I share that anger. Indisputably, the dimensions of \ngreed that precipitated this crisis are unconscionable and outrageous--\nand there should be no debate whatsoever that those responsible must be \nheld fully accountable.\n  The question before us now is, Should the Federal Government \nintervene in our financial institutions? Does the current situation's \ngravity necessitate an action that would, under almost any other \ncircumstance, run counter to our fundamental economic tenets? Or do we \nallow this current crisis of confidence, liquidity and solvency to \ncontinue, with the attendant fear it perpetuates, undermining the \nfunctional future of our economy? What would be the consequences if we \nfailed to attempt to stem the financial hemorrhaging when we had the \nopportunity to do so, before the sequence of corrosive events truly \nbecomes unstoppable and irreversible?\n  So, it is little wonder that people in my home State of Maine and in \nevery State in the Union are rightly asking, How could this have \nhappened? How could some possess such a voracious appetite for wealth \ncombined with a stunning lack of moral fiber that they would so \ncavalierly allow their wanton financial wagers to cripple our economy--\nto the extent that every American family is now steeped in anxiety and \nfear about our future?\n  And how exactly could nearly $3 trillion worth of toxic financial \nsecurities that were previously rarely used and little known have been \nswapped around like betting parlor wagers--with no transparency, no \noversight, and no questions being asked by those who should have an \nobligation to do so?\n  We have already witnessed the dramatic beginnings of the dangerous \ntailspin this investment shell game has produced. The recent bankruptcy \nof the 158 year old institution Lehman Brothers, the Federal takeovers \nof American International Group and Bear Stearns, the implosion of \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their entry into Federal \nconservatorship, the $557 billion in losses and write-downs on subprime \ninvestment worldwide, the single largest bank failure in the history of \nthe United States with Washington Mutual following the collapse of \nIndyMac, the firesale of nearly insolvent Wachovia--the fourth largest \nbank in the country--to Citigroup all demonstrate the expansive reach \nof the crisis. They illustrate at the very least a catastrophic failure \nto accurately calculate the risk of these investments and the \nresulting, paralyzing lack of confidence and solvency currently \ncrippling our financial system.\n  According to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, this is the first time \nwe have ever had the failure of AAA-rated bonds--the most highly rated \nbonds outside of Treasury bonds. This is unheard of, and has sent \nshockwaves throughout the markets, leading everyone from large \ncorporations to the retirees living on their interest payments to ask, \nwhat can they trust if they can't trust AAA-rated bonds? But we now \nknow that many of those bundled, subprime securities were passed-off as \nhigh, investment grade securities when in fact they were anything but. \nSo we must ask where were the rating agencies in fulfilling their vital \nrole in accurately identifying these risks?\n  Moreover, as the instability and loss of value in mortgage securities \nhas become crushingly apparent, investment firms have now ceased \nextending short-term loans to investment banks--which sounded the \nultimate death knell for those firms that have already gone under. And \nbecause subprime assets can no longer be valued or sold, banks continue \nto carry these nonperforming loans on their books--and therefore they \ncannot move forward in generating the credit that is the lifeblood of \nour economic growth.\n  Small firms--which have generated 60 to 80 percent of net new jobs \nannually over the last decade, are finding it difficult to access \ncredit as existing credit lines are shut down and loans canceled. One \nowner of a small firm had his business credit card limit severely \nreduced the day before payday. This reduction may force him to \ntemporarily close his business, leaves him unable to pay his workers, \nand in arrears to the IRS for $20,000. Further, the National Small \nBusiness Association just released their findings that, this past \nFebruary, 55 percent of small business owners believed their business \nhad been affected by the credit crunch--and as of August, that number \nhad jumped to 67 percent.\n  The crunch is even affecting the ability of States to implement \ntransportation projects that enhance economic competitiveness and \ncreate jobs--at a time when America is already suffering under a 6.1 \npercent unemployment rate, with 605,000 jobs so far this year and \nanother 100,000 estimated lost in September. Last week, incredibly, my \nhome State of Maine was unable to sell a $50 million, AA-rated \ntransportation bond because frozen credit left officials with no market \nfor these bonds. And I am told that when Maine is finally able to issue \nthe bond, the liquidity crunch will have driven up rates compelling \nMaine taxpayers to pay millions of dollars in extra interest payments \non these necessary road projects.\n\n  As further evidence our capital markets are clogged, one need look no \nfurther than the London interbank offered rate, LIBOR, which is the \nbenchmark rate at which banks will loan unsecured funds to one another. \nPrior to yesterday, the LIBOR had reached 3.93 percent--near an 8-month \nhigh. Then in the last 24 hours, the LIBOR surged more than four \npercentage points to 6.9 percent--to the highest level ever! This is \nmore than three times the percentage that would prevail under normal \nmarket conditions and means that financial firms are reluctant to lend \nto one another under reasonable terms.\n  Moreover, community banks play an especially important role in \nproviding credit and capital to small businesses; 48 percent of small \nbusinesses are customers at banks with less than $1 billion in assets. \nIf the nonperforming loans remain with the community banks, it could \ndecrease the banking system's lending capacity by as much as $450 \nbillion.\n  Given what we have already experienced this September--that regular \ninvestors pulled $335 billion out of money market funds, that the cost \nof overnight lending between banks jumped 116 percent, that capital has \nevaporated, that major banks have failed, that small firms--as well as \nlarge--have been suddenly denied access to existing credit lines, never \nmind new loans--that on this Monday alone the U.S. stock markets lost \n$1.2 trillion, it is difficult to conclude there won't be serious and \nsystemic consequences for our economy--for household finances, for \nAmerican jobs--when the full impact of this meltdown truly manifests \nitself and we face the imminent threat of a severe recession.\n  And so we return to the original and central question--are \ncircumstances compelling enough to warrant government intervention? \nRegrettably, given this travesty of unfathomable proportions for \nAmerican taypayers and families, they are. In the words of Treasury \nSecretary Paulson:\n\n       These illiquid assets are clogging up our financial system, \n     and undermining the strength of our otherwise sound financial \n     institutions. As a result, Americans' personal savings are \n     threatened, and the ability of consumers and businesses to \n     borrow and finance spending, investment, and job creation has \n     been disrupted. To restore confidence in our markets and our \n     financial institutions, so they can fuel continued growth and \n     prosperity, we must address the underlying problem.\n\n  And Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has warned:\n\n       This is the most significant financial crisis of the \n     postwar period.\n\n  When our government's financial leadership employs words such as \n``undermining,'' ``threatening,'' ``most significant financial \ncrisis,'' it must be considered with the utmost seriousness that it is \ntime to move from the ad hoc approach of assisting companies only at \nthe point they are failing and act prescriptively, now, to stem the \ntide of a looming financial meltdown.\n  I well recall the savings and loans crisis, from when I served in the \nU.S. House of Representatives. During that time, 747 savings and loan \ninstitutions went bankrupt, leading to the loss of $160.1 billion in \ndepositor assets. Yet it was only after these failures that Congress \nfinally established, in 1989, the\n\n[[Page S10272]]\n\nResolution Trust Corporation to sell off assets of these already failed \nfinancial institutions. Today, it is imperative we act before a similar \nbut far more pervasive cascade of financial failures paralyses our \nmarkets and destroys the value of $5.6 trillion in retirement and \nprivate pension investments that are imperiled by this ongoing market \nturmoil.\n  Again, I commend the tireless work of Senators Dodd and Gregg for \ncrafting legislation that ensures that this rescue process will not be \nopen-ended, ambiguous, or unfettered for placing taxpayers front and \ncenter for repayment and building in strong taxpayer protections \nthroughout the proposal, for clamping down on executive compensation \nwith tough restrictions that will prevent corporate managers from \nprofiting on the backs of taxpayers for providing necessary, timely, \nand crucial mortgage relief to families facing foreclosure, for calming \nbanks and depositors by increasing deposit insurance to $250,000, and \nby including the extension of critical tax incentives and a patch for \nthe alternative minimum tax to ensure millions of middle-class American \ntaxpayers do not fall victim to this onerous levy.\n  With the passage of this legislation comes the forceful \nresponsibility to recover all of the costs of this program for \ntaxpayers. To fulfill this mandate taxpayers are given an ownership \nstake in participating companies which ensures they will be first to \nprofit when these companies recover. If, after 5 years, taxpayers have \nnot been made whole, for the costs of this rescue, the President is \nrequired to act to recoup any shortfall from the companies which \nbenefited from the Treasury's actions.\n  Importantly, in addition to provisions limiting executive \ncompensation, are measures addressing so-called retirement ``golden \nparachutes,'' payments that are often extremely generous and \ndisconnected from performance. Under this bill, for participating \nfinancial institutions, the Secretary of the Treasury would be \nempowered to set compensation standards to exclude incentives for \nexcessive risk taking, recover bonuses paid based on inaccurate \nearnings statements; and prohibit future golden parachute payments. For \ncompanies selling more than $300 million of the toxic securities to the \ngovernment, tax deductible executive compensation would be limited.\n  To guarantee strong and comprehensive oversight, I supported \nprovisions championed by Senators Baucus and Grassley to establish an \nindependent inspector general that will focus solely on the Treasury's \npurchase and sale of illiquid assets. I also championed the inclusion \nof provisions that require Federal agencies to cooperate with the \nFederal Bureau of Investigations to investigate fraud, \nmisrepresentation, and malfeasance with respect to development, \nadvertising, and sale of the financial products which created this \nsystemic crisis. This became section 127 of the bill.\n  Passing this legislation--to stabilize markets and restore American's \nconfidence in their financial firms in order to return to the \nnormalcy necessary for credit and commercial activity to revive--must \nbe the first phase of our action to restore the system for American \ntaxpayers, but it can by no means be the last.\n\n  The second phase of our obligation is for Congress to demand \naccountability for the massive malfeasance that has been perpetrated on \nthe American people. The congressional pursuit--through hearings that \nSenator Dodd has indicated he will hold--must occur in tandem with the \nlegal investigation and prosecution of those responsible for this \nmeltdown. Both must receive the same rigorous attention we have applied \nto this rescue package--and not subsumed by the routine of day-to-day \nlegislative process moving forward.\n  Therefore, I will introduce legislation to form a dedicated office \nwithin the Justice Department whose sole mission is to ferret out the \nrout causes of this catastrophe and bring to account those who are \ncriminally responsible for bringing our financial system to its knees. \nIt would be inconceivable to me to devote anything less than 100 \npercent of our resources to investigating those responsible for this \ncrisis. No one should reap rewards from this colossal failure. And \nfrankly, any Wall Street individual who is found criminally responsible \nmust follow the Enron executives to prison!\n  Finally, as the third phase of congressional action, as we have an \niron-clad obligation to ensure that this calamity is never repeated, we \nare required to reform and rebuild our financial regulatory structure. \nCongress must demand the restoration of accountability and transparency \nfrom all of our financial products, including complex securities such \nas mortgage backed investments or credit default swaps, whose risk \ncharacteristics largely have been black boxes in the past. It is \nessential that people must know--and the federal government is aware \nof--the level of financial risks that companies are taking. We must \nunderstand whether firms are creating systemic risks that could \nundermine the foundations of our financial system.\n  It is essential we must utilize the remainder of this year to develop \nthe fundamental reforms necessary to fix this systemic problem. Again, \nSenator Dodd has announced hearings over the next couple of months to \nexamine the root causes of this catastrophe. Congress must also \nconsider all proposals for reform, such as the ``Blueprint for a \nModernized Regulatory Structure'' that Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson \nput forward in March. As Secretary Paulson's plan concludes, ``the \nexisting functional regulatory framework no longer provides efficient \nand effective safeguards against poor prudential behaviour of financial \nservices firms.''\n  Indeed, as we have unmistakably learned, the current regulatory \nstructure, which has been largely knitted together over the past 75 \nyears, can not protect us from the type of systemic risks that are \nravaging our financial markets and economy. Financial institutions have \ndeveloped products and complex risk-hedging strategies that today's \nregulatory structure has failed to properly evaluate and oversee--with \ndisastrous results. We can never again allow the U.S. financial \nindustry to act with impunity, and make the highly speculative \ninvestments that have today put in jeopardy the health, stability, and \ngrowth of our economy.\n  The bottom line is that we do not have a moment to lose in developing \na regulatory oversight structure that keeps pace with whatever new \nfinancial instruments may be developed in the future. We can never \nagain find ourselves in the position of having to vote for another \nfinancial rescue package. Instead, we must take the weeks ahead to \ndraft bipartisan and bicameral legislation to eliminate systemic risk \nin financial markets and protect our economy over the long term.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this Congress is on the cusp of making \nan extremely difficult decision that will not only affect our financial \nmarkets in the near term, but it will also leave a lasting footprint on \nthe direction of the our economy for years to come.\n  We face an unprecedented economic challenge--failing banks, declining \ncredit, rising unemployment, and a likely recession. These problems \nhave led us to the point of placing hundreds of billions of taxpayer \ndollars at risk to purchase risky subprime mortgages in an effort to \navoid, or lessen the impact of these looming problems. Allow me to \ndiscuss a few of the factors that led us to where we are today.\n  In response to the high-tech, dot-com bust in 2000, the Federal \nReserve began a series of interest rate cuts reducing the Fed Funds \nrate from 6.5 percent to 1.0 percent. The rate averaged 1.4 percent \nfrom 2002 through 2004.\n  As cheap credit flooded the markets, financial institutions borrowed \nmoney at low short-term rates and invested at higher long-term rates--\nplaying the spread. They adopted reckless lending practices under the \npolitical banner of increasing homeownership. These practices included \n``liar loans,'' i.e. no credit check, no-money down, interest-only, \nnegative amortization, i.e. missed payments are added to the principal, \nadjustable-rates, and balloon payments.\n  As these risky loans were extended to marginal borrowers who could \nnot afford their overpriced homes, the financial wizards on Wall Street \ndevised schemes to theoretically insure themselves against default. \nThese so called ``credit default swaps'' allowed investors who \npurchased mortgage-backed securities to pay fees to underwriters, like \nAIG, in exchange for a promise to cover any losses. However, the \nunderwriters often failed to acquire and\n\n[[Page S10273]]\n\nmaintain adequate reserves to cover such losses.\n  There is plenty of blame to go around for getting us into this mess. \nBut the financial problems we face are much bigger and more fundamental \nthan the home mortgage market itself.\n  Our financial system is based on the fundamentally unstable practice \nof maturity transformation--more commonly known as borrowing short and \nlending long.\n  The consequences of this practice are illustrated in the classic \nmovie ``It's a Wonderful Life.'' In this movie, Jimmy Stewart plays the \nowner of the Bailey Building and Loan Association. In the wake of the \nGreat Depression, the citizens of Bedford Falls panic and begin a run \non his bank. Stewart's character explains that he does not have their \nmoney, but rather it has been used to build their homes. He asks them \nto be patient, and they will eventually get their money back. But they \npersist. He ultimately stops the run by convincing them to take only \nwhat they need right away. He uses his own money that he was saving for \nhis honeymoon to repay his customers.\n  The scene from this movie illustrates the fundamental instability of \nour current financial system. We operate under the illusion that we can \ndeposit our money in a bank and then withdraw it anytime we choose. But \nat the same time we expect the bank to pay us interest on our deposits.\n  However, the interest we receive can only be achieved by giving our \nmoney to someone else to invest for weeks, or months, or years.\n  Maturity transformation works only as long as people have confidence \nin our banking system. Federal deposit insurance was created to instill \nthis confidence. By having the Government stand behind our banks ready \nto provide the cash necessary to repay our deposits, there is no reason \nto have a run on a bank. Moreover, if there is a run, banking \nregulators can swiftly close down the failed bank, or orchestrate a \ntakeover by a healthier bank, and promptly resolve the problem.\n  Deposit insurance is not a perfect system, as we learned from the \nsavings & loan fiasco in the late 80s and early 90s. Deposit insurance \ncreates moral hazard. Because depositors are protected from their \nbank's failure, they have no incentive to question the reckless lending \npractices of their bank. Without adequate oversight, risk-based \npremiums, and adequate capital requirements, deposit insurance is \nunsustainable in the long run.\n  The current home mortgage mess is merely an extension of the maturity \ntransformation and moral hazard problem. But in this case, instead of \ndepositors and deposit insurance, we have overnight loans and too-big-\nto-fail institutions.\n  Essentially what happened is Wall Street created an alternate banking \nsystem in which participants loaned each other money overnight and \ninvested in mortgage backed securities. They treated their overnight \nloans as deposits, and they relied on the widely-held belief that once \ntheir activities reached critical mass, they would be too-big-to-fail \nand the Government would bail them all out if anything went wrong.\n  This financial house of cards collapsed as home prices began to fall \nand default rates began to rise. At that point, investors became \nunwilling to rollover their overnight loans. Participants began to \nsuggest there was not enough liquidity. That is a fancy way of saying \ninvestors were no longer willing to lend money overnight to buy long-\nterm assets that were declining in value.\n  So what is the solution?\n  Last week, the President asked Congress to enact legislation to \naddress this problem. The original plan proposed by Treasury Secretary \nPaulson would have authorized the Government to buy $700 billion in \nmortgage-related assets. By taking these troubled assets off the books \nof financial institutions, it was hoped the government could stabilize \nfalling asset prices and restore investor confidence. Since this plan \nwas first proposed, improvements have been made.\n  The bill we are considering isn't perfect. Like my constituents, I am \noutraged that we are in this position today. But the fact is, we are \nfacing a global economic meltdown. Irresponsible lenders and greedy \ninvestors have put small businesses, farmers, and families at risk. \nWhile many in Iowa may not yet see the effects, our inaction will lead \nthem to understand how dire this problem truly is. We must unfreeze the \nfinancial markets as soon as we can, and this is the only solution on \nthe table that will come close to working. We can't guarantee to the \ntaxpayers that this solution will work. What we can say is that we are \ndoing the best we can, representing our constituents the best we can, \nand trying to solve the problem before the American people really have \nto suffer the consequences.\n  What I have come to learn is that the credit crunch doesn't just \nimpact Wall Street. Our economy depends on America's small businesses. \nWe are nine meals away from a revolution, making the farmer an integral \npart of our country's survival. But farmers and businesses are at risk. \nParents who are hoping to send their children to college may not get \nthe loans they need. Individuals that need loans to purchase autos or \nhomes may be left without a ride to their workplace or a roof over \ntheir head. There is a trickle-down effect that is sure to be felt if \nCongress sidelines this bill today.\n\n  Since Congress was urged to act, I have stated--in public and private \nsessions--that there are core principles that must be addressed before \nI would vote for the bill. I wanted to see strong oversight of the \nprogram, including an independent inspector general. I wanted strict \nexecutive compensation restrictions for CEOs that got us in this mess. \nI wanted those who are responsible to give up their pin-striped suits \nfor orange jump suits and to be held accountable. I wanted assurances \nthat the Government would take equity in the firms we bail out. The \nbill, unlike the original Treasury proposal, includes the core \nprinciples I wanted to see. This bill is an improvement from the \nTreasury plan because there is transparency, oversight, and more \nprotections for taxpayers.\n  One of the duties I take most seriously as a U.S. Senator is \noverseeing the policies and activities of the Federal Government. \nGovernment must have its checks and balances in place to prevent waste, \nfraud, and abuse by bureaucrats in Washington. I have been the chief \nsupporter of inspectors general at Federal agencies, and making sure \nthey remain independent overseers of taxpayer dollars. The proposal \nbrought forward by the Secretary of the Treasury failed to include any \noversight. Because the emergency plan is sure to be one of the most \ncomplex and difficult tasks ever undertaken, I pushed the leaders in \nthe House and Senate to include a special inspector general to monitor \nthe activities of the Treasury Department and its contractors. Timely, \ncomprehensive and truly independent reporting is critical to these \noversight efforts.\n  I am glad oversight was included in this bill. Not only will there be \na special inspector general, but we will also have a financial \nstability oversight board responsible for reviewing the exercise of \nauthority under the program, including the review of policies and \nmaking recommendations to the Secretary. Additionally, there is \nestablished a congressional oversight panel to review the current state \nof the financial markets and the regulatory system. This panel will be \nindependent, tasked with reviewing the administration of the program. \nThey will also study the effectiveness of foreclosure mitigation \nefforts and the effectiveness of the program from the standpoint of \nminimizing long-term costs to the taxpayers.\n  Despite these oversight boards and panels, you can be sure that I \nwill not let up on my efforts to reign in fraud, abuse and misconduct. \nI will not tolerate bureaucrats taking advantage of taxpayer money, and \nwill do my best to make sure heads roll if conflicts of interests by \nthose who run the program are suspected.\n  Like all Iowans, I am concerned about the risk that this plan places \non hard working and responsible taxpayers. Since we began discussing \nthis plan, using taxpayer dollars responsibly has been the top \npriority. That's why many taxpayer protections were added to the bill.\n  Treasury's proposal had minimal oversight to protect taxpayer \ndollars. Like I said earlier, this compromise enhances the oversight \nstructure by creating a financial stability oversight\n\n[[Page S10274]]\n\nboard, a special inspector general, and a congressional oversight \npanel. It also requires the Secretary to develop regulations and \nguidelines necessary to prohibit or, in specific cases, manage any \nconflicts of interest with respect to contractors, advisors, and asset \nmanagers.\n  The Secretary also has to take steps to prevent ``unjust \nenrichment''--or paying more for a troubled asset than what the seller \npaid to purchase it. The Secretary--in considering the purchase of \ntroubled assets--must take into account the ``long term viability'' of \nthe financial institution. The bill requires Treasury to take an equity \nstake in the companies from which it purchases troubled assets. And it \nrequires the Treasury Department to be transparent when they buy and \nsell. In fact, they must post, within 2 days, the purchases, amounts, \nand pricing of assets acquired. These provisions will help shield \ntaxpayers from losses and may provide taxpayers with potential future \nbenefits.\n\n  Should taxpayers lose out, the bill allows the government to go back \nafter 5 years to recoup losses from financial companies. The Office of \nManagement and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office will report \non the net amount lost in the TARP after 5 years. The Government can \nassess a fee on companies that use TARP to make sure taxpayers don't \nlose out in the long run.\n  I am also glad that the final bill does not siphon profits from the \nprogram for an existing housing trust fund, as was proposed by the \nother side of the aisle. I firmly believe that all proceeds of sales \nmust go to the Treasury and back to the taxpayers.\n  Taxpayers are protected because the final bill doesn't provide $700 \nbillion upfront. The Administration originally wanted the authority to \nhave it all at once, but this bill provides for the program to be \nimplemented in stages. Only $250 billion will be provided immediately, \nand another $100 billion will be provided upon a written certification \nof need by the President. Finally, the remaining $350 billion will be \nprovided unless Congress acts. Let's be clear. Congress can act anytime \nto revoke the Treasury's authority. They will be watched, and they will \nbe questioned. And if Congress doesn't like what it sees, we can repeal \nthis economic stabilization plan.\n  Finally, this bill provides for an increase in the deposit insurance \ncap through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The last time we \nincreased the level was in 1980. The provision temporarily increases \nfrom $100,000 to $250,000 the amount of deposit coverage for banks and \nshare coverage for credit unions. The coverage amount reverts back to \n$100,000 after December 31, 2009. The bill that was voted on by the \nHouse did not include this provision, which is an added protection for \nAmerican families and businesses.\n  I am supportive of a provision in the bill to modify the tax \ntreatment for banks holding preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac. The proposal would allow banks to treat gains and losses on Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac preferred stock as ordinary, instead of as capital, \nfor tax purposes.\n  I have heard this relief is important for a number of Iowa community \nbanks. These banks were permitted and even encouraged to hold these \ninvestments. These investments were believed to be safe. They had the \nbacking of the Federal Government and provided reliable revenue streams \nthrough quarterly dividends.\n  In the wake of Treasury's acquisition of close to 80 percent of \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, these preferred shares became virtually \nworthless. These small banks generally don't have capital gains. \nAccordingly, without this provision, they would not be able to \nrecognize a tax deduction for their losses. This provision will help \ncommunity banks satisfy their regulatory capital standards in order to \ncontinue to lend and support economic activity and growth in their \nlocal communities.\n  This legislation includes limits on executive compensation. I will be \nhonest: I wish the executive compensation limitations were stronger. \nHowever, the limitations included in the bill are a step in the right \ndirection. Why? Because those executives that got us into this mess \nshould not be able to walk away from the institution that they ran with \noodles of money. Not only should they be prohibited from walking away \nwith oodles of money, they should go before the board of directors--\nbefore the public--and before the stockholders and bow deeply and \napologize for their mismanagement. Like the Japanese do. But I will say \nthis--I will take what I can get, and I will look forward to taking a \ncloser look at excessive executive compensation in the next Congress.\n\n  Despite my reluctant support for this bill, I remain concerned about \nthe lack of provisions that will bring about long-term changes to our \nfinancial health. I would have liked to see language to address the \nunderlying problems that led us to this emergency relief bill. However, \nI realize this situation calls for an emergency reaction, and we must \ntemporarily forego consideration of provisions that would beef up the \nsecurities markets, and toughen regulations for companies that do \nbusiness on Wall Street.\n  Take hedge funds, for example. Two years ago, I started conducting \noversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission in response to a \nwhistleblower who came to my office complaining that SEC supervisors \nwere pulling their punches in their investigation of a major hedge \nfund. Nearly a year and a half ago, I came to this floor to introduce \nan important piece of legislation based on what I learned from my \noversight. The bill was aimed at closing a loophole in our securities \nlaws. In light of the current instability in our financial system, I \nthink it is critical that Senators take another look at this bill. It \nis S. 1402 the The Hedge Fund Registration Act. It is pretty simple, \nonly two pages long. All it does is clarify that the Securities and \nExchange Commission has the authority to require hedge funds to \nregister, so the Government knows who they are and what they're doing.\n  Given the SEC's current attempts to halt manipulative short selling \nand other transactions by hedge funds that threaten the stability of \nour markets, I am disappointed that the Senate did not adopt this \nlegislation long ago. If it had, then the SEC might have more of the \ntools it needs now in these nervous markets.\n  One major cause of the current crisis is a lack of transparency. \nMarkets need a free flow of information to function properly. \nTransparency was the focus of our system of securities regulations \nadopted in the 1930's. Unfortunately, over time, the wizards on Wall \nStreet figured out a million clever ways to avoid transparency. The \nresult is the confusion and uncertainty fueling the crisis we see \ntoday. This bill would have been one important step toward greater \ntransparency on Wall Street, but so far it has been a lonely effort on \nmy part.\n  Another problem in bringing about transparency in the market is the \nnotion of suspending mark-to-market Rules. Mark-to-market accounting \nrequires entities to calculate fair market value by estimating the \nprice that would be received for that asset in an orderly transaction \noccurring on a specific date, i.e. willing buyer-willing seller. \nContrary to public perception, the mark-to-market rule is not new. \nOther existing accounting standards have and continue to require \ncertain assets to be written down if the asset value falls below cost. \nThis is often referred to ``lower of cost or market''. Under mark-to-\nmarket, assets are required to reflect fair market value so they are \nmeasured above cost or below cost depending on market conditions. \nAccording to the Center for Audit Quality, an autonomous public policy \norganization affiliated with the American Institute of Certified Public \nAccountants, AICPA,``suspending mark-to-market accounting would throw \nfinancial accounting back to a time of less comparability, less \nconsistency and less transparency''. This position is supported by the \nCouncil of Institutional Investors and the CFA Institute. The chairman \nof the Financial Accounting Standards Board said it best when he said \n``the harsh reality is that we can't just suspend or modify the \nfinancial reporting rules when there is bad news.''\n\n  I hope Congress will consider these key statutory changes that are \nneeded when we return early next year.\n  Aside from the economic stabilization plan that we are voting on \ntoday,\n\n[[Page S10275]]\n\nwe are again discussing legislation designed in part to deal with time-\nsensitive tax matters. I strongly support this part of the package.\n  These identical AMT relief, disaster tax relief, and individual, \nbusiness, and energy tax extender provisions were passed by the Senate \nby an overwhelming vote of 93-2 just last week. There are five \ncategories of tax relief provided in the bill. The first one is the AMT \npatch. It expired on December 31 of last year. If we don't act, 24 \nmillion families will face an average tax increase of at least $2,000 \neach.\n  The second category of tax relief includes several tax benefits \navailable to middle income taxpayers. They expired on December 31 of \nlast year.\n  Included are deductions for out-of-pocket expenses for teachers, \nsales tax, and college tuition. Millions of taxpaying families would \nface an unexpected tax increase.\n  The third category consists of many valuable business incentives, \nlike the research and development tax credit, that likewise expired.\n  In this time of high oil prices and instability in the energy \nmarkets, Congress should send a clear signal in support of alternative \nenergy and conservation. This is the fourth category. We will not let \nthe wide assortment of tax incentives for alternative energy and \nconservation expire this year.\n  The fifth and final category deals with disasters that have ravaged \nthe Nation's heartland and the gulf coast. We need to respond to the \nfolks in those regions, including my home State of Iowa.\n  This is must-do business. Congress cannot dawdle any longer. With a \nsense of urgency, Senators Reid and McConnell have devised a path for \nthe Senate to complete action on these provisions. I would have rather \nprocessed this time-sensitive business several months ago, but better \nlate than never.\n  Our leaders provided Chairman Baucus and me with the authority to \nmake the deal. That was the critical step. I pulled out my notepad and \nresharpened my pencil. Chairman Baucus did the same thing. We have a \nbipartisan deal evidenced by our 93-2 vote last week.\n  Last year, I laid out the principles Senate Republicans would follow \nwhen it came to revenue raisers. The first principle would be whether \nthe proposal is good tax policy. If the proposal is good tax policy, \nthen we would support and vice-versa. This compromise meets that \nprinciple.\n  The crackdown on offshore deferred compensation plans is appropriate \ntax policy. I am pleased that we made it tougher on hedge fund managers \nby removing a charitable loophole. Likewise, the offsets in the energy \nportion of the bill are appropriate policy.\n  The second principle deals with how revenue raisers are accounted \nfor. This is where the parties differ. How do they differ? Republicans \ndon't want to go down the slippery slope of building in a bias towards \ntax increases and against current law tax relief. This is especially \ncompelling when appropriations are wholly outside the Democratic \nversion of pay-go. Likewise, $1.2 trillion of expiring entitlement \nspending does not figure into pay-go. The Democratic version of pay-go \nsets us down an irreversible path of higher taxes and higher spending.\n\n  If expiring tax relief and expiring spending and appropriations were \ntreated similarly, maybe the deficit reduction rationale behind pay-go \nwould be somewhat credible. As it exists now, it only reinforces an \nideology of higher taxes and spending. The rejection of Senator \nMcConnell's deficit neutral offer on AMT and extenders proves my point.\n  In any event, we found ourselves at an impasse. Democrats insisted on \noffsetting current law tax relief and Republicans resisted more tax and \nspend. Republicans were willing to use revenue raisers for new policy \nand for long-term or permanent tax policy. Republicans did not want to \nuse revenue raisers for new spending.\n  We came to a compromise by looking at this impasse as a kind of \nprism. A prism breaks one beam of light into several different shades. \nEach side can look at the different shades of the prism from their own \nviewpoint and see that their principles were upheld.\n  At the end of the day, we will have an AMT patch, extenders, energy, \nand disaster relief package that is a compromise. Republicans will see \nthat the compromise meets their principles. The offsets are good \npolicy. From a Republicans standpoint, there is enough new policy in \nthe energy part of the deal to tie the non-energy offsets. Otherwise, \nenergy incentives are reformed. Republicans can see that the biggest \nitem in the bill, the AMT patch is not offset. That preserves our point \nthat the unfair AMT should not be a reason to raise taxes on other \ntaxpayers. Likewise, there is enough new and modified policy to tie to \nthe offshore deferred compensation revenue. Bottom line is that the \nleaders were able to secure a longer term extension of current policy \nas well with the revenue.\n  Democrats are able to see the offset policy from their standpoint. \nDemocrats wanted significant revenue raisers and they got them. Both \nsides wanted the underlying revenue losing extensions and new policy.\n  Most prisms are delicate and transitory. This one is no different. \nOur friends in the House need to see that. They can break this fragile \nprism. The shards will cut millions of taxpaying families.\n  This deal defers the very vital debate between Republicans and \nDemocrats on whether we tax our way out of this fiscal situation, the \nDemocratic view. Or do we restrain spending, the Republican view.\n  That important debate, which has held us up for so long, is deferred \nto another day.\n  Each side holds to its principles. Each side does the Peoples \nBusiness. I thank Chairman Baucus and the leaders on both sides.\n  The tax provisions of this bill present the opportunity to preserve \ntax relief for millions of middle income families.\n  I would like to end by saying that I reluctantly support this bill. \nAgain, I am outraged that Congress is in this position to relieve Wall \nStreet and our financial industry. But, unfortunately, this is the hand \nwe have been dealt and the options we have are limited.\n  I know people in Iowa are opposed to this bill. They would rather see \ncompanies fail than to have their dollars used to bail them out of this \nmess. My vote for this bill is not easy because I respect those \nconcerns, and I agree with them. At the same time, this legislation is \nthe best opportunity we have today to avoid a credit crunch that might \ncripple our economy. No doubt credit will be tighter with or without \nthis bill as the system becomes more cautious after acting too fast and \nloose for too long. The argument for this bill is that by unplugging \nthe pipeline that is clogged up with bad debt, good credit can flow. \nThe U.S. Treasury can hold all that bad debt until its value returns \nwith the goal of having the taxpayers recover some of the money, and \npossibly a great deal of the money, that's being committed with this \nlegislation.\n  I have to vote in favor of this plan because I want to protect the \npeople back home from what is coming their way if we don't act. I hope \nmy constituents will understand why I feel the need to support this \nbill.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nanger and frustration, and the downright outrage of many of my \nconstituents, about the legislation the Senate is about to consider. \nThe average American taxpayers did nothing to create this crisis, yet \nthey will be asked to bear the heavy expense of government intervention \nto avoid further harm to our financial system. The recklessness, greed, \nand lack of foresight on Wall Street have brought us to the brink of a \ncrisis that threatens our entire economy. The outpouring of opposition \nto this legislation that I have received over the past week in my \noffice is genuine, and it is justified.\n  However, as elected leaders, we must not lose sight of the dire \nsituation we face as a nation, regardless of how we feel about it. Many \nof my constituents oppose a ``bailout'' of Wall Street, and rightfully \nso. But this legislation is more than that. I am not sympathetic to \nWall Street. If the financial crisis we are facing ended with them, I \nwould say ``write off your losses, you deserve it.'' But unfortunately, \nour economy lies at the intersection of Main Street and Wall Street. We \ndepend on a free flow of credit to keep our businesses running, to \nreverse rising unemployment, and repair our economy so it can once \nagain work for the middle class. Wall Street's mismanagement now \nthreatens the availability of credit on every Main Street throughout \nour country.\n\n[[Page S10276]]\n\n  Among the many letters I received during this crisis, some have stood \nout and articulated far better than I can the reasons why the Senate \nmust act, even though many of us would rather not. For example, Joe \nMasek, who runs a small business in Gering, NE--the Masek Golf Car \nCompany--recently wrote to me. Masek's employs 32 people and needs to \nhave credit to pay the employees and finance materials from the time \nthey manufacture their product to when the products are sold.\n  Here are Mr. Masek's concerns, in his own words:\n\n       If I go to the bank to draw on that line, and they are \n     forced to tell me that funds are not available because the \n     credit markets are not working, then I have to cancel two \n     contracts with two Colorado golf courses that are depending \n     on me to do what I committed to do. I can see that it would \n     then not take long for our business to collapse. We are now \n     up to employing 32 people, all of whom are paying mortgages \n     and rent and taxes, and putting money aside for retirement in \n     the 401k, etc. Our collapse and thousands of companies like \n     us would ``really'' collapse the entire economy . . . . all \n     for the lack of credit availability which should not be a \n     problem. Yes there are flaws in the ``big bailout'' but we \n     would rather live with some flaws than go out of business. \n     You need to get this one fixed, and not wait until the \n     election to do it.\n\n  Credit is crucial to our families, businesses, local governments, and \nother institutions such as hospitals and schools. We need credit to buy \nhomes, receive student loans, to continue using credit cards for \neveryday purchases, for small businesses to obtain operating loans to \ncarry them from one season to the next, for farmers to get all of the \nfertilizer, seed and other materials needed to plant crops, and for \ncities and towns to meet payroll.\n  For the reasons above, and for all the Joe Maseks in Nebraska and \naround the country, I intend to cast my vote for the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act. But I want to be very clear that I would have been \nthe first in line to oppose the administration's initial ``blank check \nproposal.''\n  I wish to thank my colleague, Chairman Dodd, for leading the effort \nto address major flaws in the administration's proposal. Nine days ago, \nafter first reviewing the administration's initial proposal, I wrote to \nChairman Dodd to outline the changes that I demanded if I were to be \nexpected to support this bill. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the full text of my letter following these remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. To briefly summarize, I said that the \ntaxpayer should come first, and all the proceeds of this program be \nused to retire the public debt. I said there could be no free rides for \nthese institutions--that CEO compensation must be addressed to \neliminate taxpayer-subsidized golden parachutes, and that participation \nin the program should require an equity or debt stake so the taxpayer \ncan share in future profits of the firms that benefit. I said there \nshould be shared responsibility with the rest of the world, and shared \nbenefit between the holders of securities and the borrowers struggling \nto stay out of foreclosure. I demanded full congressional and legal \noversight of the program. These changes were included in the proposal \nbefore the Senate today. I am still not eager to support this \nlegislation, but these essential provisions were necessary steps to \nprotect the American taxpayer's interests.\n  In addition, I called for, and this bill adopts, an incremental \napproach to the authority to purchase troubled assets. This approach is \nnecessary so that Congress, as we conduct oversight and monitor every \naction the Treasury department takes with the authority granted them \nunder this legislation, can further protect the taxpayer by cutting off \nthe funds for this program, either if it is not working as we intended, \nor if the problem can be solved with fewer funds than the total \nauthorized.\n  When Congress passes this bill, responsibility will fall first to the \nTreasury Department to make it work. Wise and careful judgment must be \nexercised by the Treasury Department to try to earn back every taxpayer \ndollar extended in the effort to shore up our financial system. The \nburden is on them.\n  Furthermore, when the Congress passes this bill, our work will not be \nfinished. No, our work is just beginning because not only do we need to \nconduct vigorous oversight of the unprecedented authority we are \ngranting the Treasury, we need to take a comprehensive approach to \nrewriting the regulations of our financial sector to insure that we \nnever face this choice again.\n  If we can move ahead to protect our economy, the next President must \nchange the way Government keeps an eye on Wall Street--for consumer \nprotection. For years, this administration gambled that ``look the \nother way'' regulation would lead to prosperity, and we see where that \ngot us--mired in a global economic crisis. Having been both a regulator \nand someone who worked in the industry I used to regulate, I know \nfirst-hand the importance of regulation. And I know first-hand that the \nfree market can function prosperously in an appropriately regulated \nenvironment.\n  The next President must end the ``culture of complacency'' allowed to \ngrow in recent years. Obviously, better regulation needs to be imposed. \nThat may take additional legislation, but it is certainly going to mean \nthat the regulations that are already in place are enforced, and that \nthe Federal regulators must get off the sidelines and do a better job. \nThe bottom line is that this financial crisis was avoidable. I hope the \nnext President, whoever he is, will take corrective action to reform \nthese Federal agencies so we can avoid future crises.\n  In conclusion, I will reluctantly cast my vote for this legislation. \nI do not do this for Wall Street, but rather for Main Street because of \nthe fundamental truth that the fate of our financial system and the \nfate of our hometown economic prosperity are inexorably linked. I will \nsupport the administration's proposal, with the improvements made by \nCongress. Only time will tell whether this can avert the crisis we all \nfear, but the risk of inaction is too great. The people of Nebraska \nsent me here to make difficult choices, and this is among the most \ndifficult I have made or will make. I want them to know that I share \ntheir frustration and anger, but when the day is done, I have to do \nwhat I feel is necessary to protect and promote the prosperity of the \nAmerican economy, from McCook to Madison Avenue, and back again.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               September 22, 2008.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs;\n\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n         Affairs.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby: As the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs responds to \n     the legislative proposal by the U.S. Department of the \n     Treasury for a bailout plan, I write to voice my serious \n     concerns, as well as those of my constituents. The American \n     taxpayers did nothing to create this crisis, yet they will be \n     asked to bear the heavy expense of government intervention. \n     While my Nebraska constituents understand that the cost of \n     inaction may well be greater than the cost of this $700 \n     billion proposal, they rightfully demand strong protection of \n     the taxpayers' investment, together with accountability, \n     shared responsibility and benefit, and strong oversight.\n       The initial proposal delivered by Treasury raises some \n     serious questions, as it amounts to a ``blank check'' for the \n     largest ever government intervention in the private markets. \n     If my constituents are to be expected to finance this \n     program, significant changes should be made to this \n     legislation and to regulation and oversight of Wall Street, \n     so that this chapter of history never repeats itself. On \n     behalf of Nebraska taxpayers, I urge you to consider the \n     following as you draft this historic legislation.\n       First, it is the responsibility of Congress to ensure that \n     the federal government's actions reflect the taxpayers' best \n     interests. If taxpayers are to be expected to finance this \n     bailout effort, changes should be considered to protect that \n     investment and to ensure that all profits of this program are \n     returned to the taxpayer. Net proceeds of this program should \n     accrue foremost to retirement of the public debt.\n       Second, this cannot be a free ride for reckless financial \n     institutions; the assistance offered to troubled firms should \n     operate as much like a loan as possible while still achieving \n     the necessary effect of calming the crisis. The program \n     should require participating firms to issue ownership shares \n     or collateral to the U.S. Treasury in exchange for \n     assistance. Our responsibility to the taxpayer demands as \n     much. Future generations\n\n[[Page S10277]]\n\n     should not bear the cost of Wall Street's failures, and the \n     cost of this program should be shared with those who \n     participate in it. There should be no golden parachutes for \n     the executives who presided over these distressed firms, and \n     any plan should include limits on executive compensation.\n       Furthermore, the benefit of this program should not accrue \n     solely to the holders of distressed assets. The legislation \n     should reflect that the root cause of this crisis is rising \n     foreclosures and dropping home values; and to the extent that \n     assets owned or held by the government can be increased in \n     value by assistance to homeowners, that approach should be \n     accommodated by this legislation. In other words, we should \n     not rescue Wall Street from itself without a strong \n     commitment to America's Main Streets, in my home state of \n     Nebraska and throughout our great nation.\n       Third, there should be shared responsibility with other \n     countries, particularly regarding foreign financial interest. \n     The U.S. government's actions are intended to control a \n     deepening global financial crisis, yet the cost will all be \n     borne at home by American taxpayers. Other nations should \n     share in this effort if their financial institutions hope to \n     benefit from this program.\n       Finally, Congressional and legal oversight of this asset \n     purchase program must be strengthened. Reports to Congress \n     should come more frequently than twice yearly, and the \n     reporting requirement should stand for as long as any \n     mortgage-related assets remain in the Treasury Department's \n     possession. The Government Accountability Office should have \n     full and unfettered access to all aspects of the program, \n     because taxpayers demand transparency and accountability if \n     they are to be expected to finance this program.\n       Congress faces unattractive options for addressing this \n     unprecedented problem. If we are to ask American taxpayers to \n     bear this heavy burden, we must craft a responsible solution \n     to this crisis, one worthy of the taxpayer's investment. I \n     ask you to address the principles I outlined above to ensure \n     that Main Street is not forgotten in any bailout of Wall \n     Street.\n       Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to working \n     with you and our colleagues in the Senate to address this \n     crisis.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               E. Benjamin Nelson,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this financial crisis is rooted in material \nactions involving executive greed and ineptitude, flawed economic \npolicies, and the incompetence of on-the-scene regulatory agencies. And \nwe are dealing with this crisis at the unfortunate intersection of two \ntoxic trends: the loss of confidence in our financial system, and the \npublic's loss of confidence in the Bush administration. Many have come \nto agree with those of us who have long felt that ``trust me'' is not \nenough when this White House asks for sweeping new powers.\n  As this crisis spreads, threatening to harm our families, businesses \nand communities, the clock has been running out on the Federal \nGovernment's opportunity to try to staunch the damage. I opposed the \noriginal Bush plan, which was fatally flawed on several counts. Since \nthen I have worked in good faith to fix its shortcomings, and by now \nseveral constructive changes have been made. After many fits and starts \nand long negotiations that have run through many nights, the clock is \nclose to running out. As the Senate has prepared to vote on this \nrevised plan, I have weighed its flaws and its improvements against the \nneed for action to avert a wider credit crisis and the harm that would \nbring to Vermont and the Nation. I decided that this national emergency \ntips the balance in favor of this revised plan.\n  Vermonters are divided on this, and I know that many Vermonters feel \nstrongly that this is the wrong answer. But with credit conditions for \nbusinesses, public institutions, States, localities, and average \nAmericans deteriorating every day, I believe that acting now to help \nput our economy on an even keel has become an urgent priority.\n  The bill that the Senate is voting on tonight has changed \nsignificantly since President Bush first proposed a $700 billion blank \ncheck last week. It provides greater checks and balances on the \nGovernment's authority and preserves the rights of people affected by \nthe conduct of financial institutions that participate in the \nGovernment's plan. Any actions taken by the Treasury Secretary should \nbe approved by an oversight board, supervised by an inspector general, \nreviewed under the Administrative Procedures Act, and examined by the \ncourts if there is a question of fraud or abuse. I fought and won in \nadding the check and balance of judicial review.\n  It increases the Government's insurance of consumers' and business's \nbank deposits from $100,000 to $250,000. This would safeguard the \nsavings deposits of families and businesses and farmers in Vermont and \nprotect the checking accounts of businesses that continually need to \nbuy materials, sell their products and make payroll.\n  This plan now also tightens the restrictions on executive pay and \nbanning golden parachutes for firms participating in the program. Under \ncurrent law, there are no restrictions on the amount of executive \ncompensation that Wall Street CEOs can be paid. With these people \nhaving their hand out for a Federal bailout, we should limit executive \npay and prohibit greedy executives from walking away from the mess they \ncreated with millions while regular American investors lose their \nsavings and retirement funds.\n  Senator Obama spoke eloquently and persuasively on this tonight. His \nargument weighed heavily with me. My decision to support this remedy \ndid not come easily, but the worsening crisis has made the choice \nincreasingly clear and the stakes of doing nothing, significantly \nhigher.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am supporting this Federal economic aid \nlegislation because the failure of Congress to take some decisive, \nsubstantial, action would run the risk of dire consequences to U.S. and \nworld markets. The 777 point plunge in the Dow plunge on Tuesday, in \nthe wake of the House's rejection of this legislation, demonstrates the \npotential for even greater problems if Congress does nothing.\n  My affirmative vote is made with substantial misgivings. It is a very \nunpopular vote, evidenced by constituents' calls and letters and \npersonal contacts overwhelmingly against the plan. It is understandable \nthat the American taxpayers are opposed to footing the bill for unwise \nspeculation on Wall Street and federal officials who failed in the \nregulatory process. Congress should follow the teachings of Edmund \nBurke, the greatest philosopher, who said in 1774 that, in a \nrepresentative democracy, elected officials should consider their \nconstituents' views, but in the final analysis they owe their \nconstituents their independent judgment as to what should be done.\n  From the outset, I cautioned against Congress's rushing to judgment. \nWhen the initial proposal was made, I wrote to Majority Leader Harry \nReid and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell by letter dated September \n21, 2008, urging we take the time necessary to get the legislation \nright. By letter dated September 23, 2008, I wrote to Treasury \nSecretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke \nasking a series of questions which have not yet been answered. Then by \nletter dated September 27, 2008, accompanied by a floor statement, I \nmade a series of suggestions to the executive and legislative \nnegotiators. Again, there has been insufficient time for a reply.\n  The rush to judgment began in mid-September when Treasury Secretary \nHenry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke warned of an \nimminent meltdown in financial markets which would threaten retirement \nfunds, jeopardize the jobs of millions of Americans, and subject \nhomeowners to more evictions. A few days later Secretary Paulson issued \na three page economic rescue plan which has since grown to a 112-page \nbill before additional provisions were added.\n  Whenever we deviate from regular order which has been developed \nduring more than 200 years of serving our country very well, we are on \nthin ice. On regular order, the legislative process customarily begins \nwith a bill which members of Congress can study and analyze. Here, we \nwere presented with a bill which Congress was asked to act upon within \nhours after completion. Customarily, after the legislation\n\n[[Page S10278]]\n\nis in hand, there are hearings with proponents and opponents of the \nbill and an opportunity for members to examine, really cross examine, \nto get to the heart of the issues and alternatives. There have been \nlimited hearings with executive branch officials, but not in the \ncontext of analyzing the finished bill or an opportunity for opponents \nor advocates of alternatives.\n  After the hearings, regular order calls for a markup in the committee \nof jurisdiction going over the language line by line with an \nopportunity to make changes with votes on those proposed modifications. \nThen the committee files a report which is reviewed by members in \nadvance of floor action where amendments can be offered and debate \noccurs. The action by each house is then subjected to further \nrefinement by a conference committee which makes the presentment to the \npresident for yet another line of review.\n  The current process drastically shortcuts regular order. For example, \nthere was no opportunity for members to offer amendments to substitute \nloans or a governmental insurance policy for the plan to authorize the \nTreasury Secretary to buy toxic securities which is problemsome because \nthere is no market which establishes value. So the government, and then \nthe taxpayers, may well be overpaying. If loans were made like the AIG \nmodel with senior secured provisions, the government might well pay \nless, as I suggested in my letter dated September 27. In that letter I \nfurther suggested that consideration be given to government insurance \nwhich would have eliminated the uncertain values in purchases and would \nhave limited the government obligation to being an insurer of the \nspecific commercial transactions which require governmental aid.\n  In my letter of September 27 I further raised the issue of exercising \ncare to avoid running afoul of the Supreme Court decision in INS v. \nChadha. It is uncertain whether the stipulation giving Congress the \nauthority to reject the last installment of $350 billion would satisfy \nthe Chadha standard.\n  In addition there has not yet been an adequate showing as to how the \noverall figure of $700 billion was determined. In my letter of \nSeptember 27, I called for a detailed explanation for Congress as to \nhow that figure was arrived at and the necessity for such a large sum. \nSimilarly I sought justification for an initial expenditure of $250 \nbillion.\n  We have been working against a backdrop that unless immediate or very \nprompt action is taken, there is an enormous risk of an economic \ncollapse. In my letters, I expressed my judgment that this would not \noccur as long as it was seen that the Congress was determined to do \nsomething significant and was working as promptly as practicable to \ncome up with remedial legislation. In fact, the market rose on \nSeptember 25 and 26, when the Congress appeared to be moving toward a \nlegislative solution. The Dow then dropped on September 29 when the \nHouse rejected the proposed legislation. Had the House not taken that \nnegative vote when the vote count was not solid, there may well have \nbeen enough time to improve the bill without causing the market's \ncollapse.\n  Even now, there has been a limited time for deliberation and Members \nhave not had an opportunity to debate and vote on alternatives.\n  It is true that the proposed legislation is enormously improved over \nthe first Paulson proposal, but it still grants enormous authority to \nthe Treasury Secretary. The $700 billion is not to be authorized \nimmediately, but instead there are installments of $250 billion, $100 \nbillion at the request of the President and $350 billion more subject \nto congressional objection, although the latter phase may be \nunconstitutional under Chadha. For protection of the taxpayers, the \nproposal contains a provision that if the government does not regain \nits money after 5 years, the President would be required to submit a \nplan for compensating the Treasury ``from entities benefiting from the \nprograms.'' While that provision is a far way from a guarantee or even \nassurances that such recovery legislation would be enacted, it gives \nsome important comfort to the taxpayers' position.\n  There are also provisions for multiple layers of oversight including \na Financial Stability Oversight Board comprised of the Chairman of the \nFed, the Treasury Secretary, the Director of the Federal Home Finance \nAgency, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, \nand the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, that will meet \nmonthly to oversee the program. The Secretary will be required to \nreport to Congress on a regular basis on the actions taken, along with \na detailed financial statement. These reports will include information \non each of the agreements made, insurance contracts entered into, and \nthe nature of the asset purchased and projected costs and liabilities. \nAdditional oversight will be provided by the Comptroller General--\nreports to Congress--a new inspector general--audits and quarterly \nreports--a congressionally appointed oversight panel--market and \nregulatory review, and reports to Congress on the program and the \neffectiveness of foreclosure mitigation efforts--and by OMB and CBO--\ncost estimates. A report will be required from the Secretary of the \nTreasury with an analysis of the current financial regulatory framework \nand recommendations for improvements.\n\n  There are substantial limitations on having benefits for entities \nwhich created the problem and limitations on executive pay. The \nexecutive compensation and corporate governance provisions provide that \nTreasury Department would have to promulgate executive compensation \nrules governing financial institutions that sell its troubled assets.\n  In cases where financial institutions sell troubled assets directly \nto the government with no competitive bidding and where the government \nreceives a meaningful equity position, the legislation states that, \nuntil that equity stake is sold, executives would not get incentives \n``to take unnecessary and excessive risks'' and would have to give up \nor repay bonuses or other incentives based on financial statements that \n``are later proven to be materially inaccurate.'' The bill also would \nprohibit ``any golden parachute payment to senior executives.''\n  The legislation is less stringent in provisions for financial \ninstitutions that sell their assets to the government through an \nauction. Such provisions would apply only to companies that sell more \nthan $300 million in assets and would subject companies and employees \nto extra taxes. Corporations would not be able to deduct any salary or \ndeferred compensation of more than $500,000, and top executives would \nface a 20 percent excise tax on golden parachute payments if they left \nfor any reason other than retirement. In evaluating limitations on \nexecutive salaries, it is relevant to note that the Institute for \nPublic Studies found that chief executives of large U.S. companies made \nan average of $10.5 million last year. That is more than 300 times the \npay of the average worker.\n  The final proposal does provide for debt insurance, but leaves it to \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to utilize that approach so it seems \nunlikely that it will be implemented in light of the fact that \nSecretary Paulson has bluntly stated his disagreement with it. Had \nthere been floor amendments, Congress could have structured standards \nfor utilization of debt insurance.\n  Had we followed regular order with an opportunity to propose \namendments, consideration could have been given to my proposal, S. \n2133, which would have authorized the bankruptcy courts to restructure \ninterest and scheduling of payments. The so-called variable rate \nmortgages have confronted many homeowners with the surprise that \noriginal payments, illustratively, of $1,200 a month were soon raised \nto $2,000 which resulted in defaults. Individualized examination by the \nbankruptcy courts might show misrepresentation or even fraud to justify \nrevising the interest payments and rearranging the payment schedule. Or \nconsideration could have been given to Senator Durbin's proposed \nlegislation, S. 2136, which would have authorized the bankruptcy courts \nto reset the principal balance depending on the value of the home. I \nopposed that bill because I thought it would discourage future lending \nand in the long run raise the cost to homebuyers. But at least, \nfollowing regular order, there would have been an opportunity to \nconsider Senator Durbin's proposal as well as my suggested legislation.\n\n[[Page S10279]]\n\n  The legislation contains authority for the Treasury Secretary to \ncompensate foreign central banks under some conditions. It provides \nthat troubled assets held by foreign financial authorities and banks \nare eligible for the TARP program if the banks hold such assets as a \nresult of having extended financing to financial institutions that have \nfailed or defaulted. Had there been an opportunity for floor debate, \nthat provision might have been sufficiently unpopular to be rejected or \nat least sharply circumscribed with conditions.\n\n  As a step to help keep borrowers in their homes, I proposed language \nfound in Section 119(b) of the bill to address the concern that some \nloan servicers have been reluctant to modify home mortgage loan terms \nbecause they fear litigation from investors who hold securities or \nother vehicles backed by the mortgage in question. The loan servicers \nhave a legal duty to the investors to maximize the return on their \ninvestments. In testimony on December 6, 2007, before the House \nCommittee on Financial Services, Mark Pearce, speaking on behalf of the \nconference of State Bank supervisors, discussed a meeting with the top \n20 subprime servicers. He explained that ``many of them brought up fear \nof investor lawsuits'' as a hurdle to voluntary loan modification \nefforts. Because the rescue legislation encourages the government to \nseek voluntary loan modifications, it is important to remove any \nimpediments to such modifications. To that end, the language provides a \nlegal safe harbor for mortgage servicers making loan modifications, if \nthe loan modifiers take reasonable mitigation steps, including \naccepting partial payments from homeowners.\n  On reforms to prevent a recurrence of this crisis, we need to \nquestion whether the rating agencies adequately analyzed mortgage-\nbacked securities before issuing investment-grade ratings. They appear \nto have failed, in July of 2007, when it became apparent that ratings \nissued by the big three rating agencies--Moody's, S and Fitch--could \nnot be relied upon, I urged the relevant committees to look into the \nratings that those agencies issued in recent years regarding mortgage-\nbacked securities.\n  Financial institutions that issue asset-backed securities obtain \nratings for such securities. The failure to issue reliable ratings \nmisrepresented the facts and fed the ability of financial institutions \nto tout the value of securities even though their value was declining. \nCongress and the regulators need to take up the rating agencies issue, \nand consider whether ratings agencies that have utterly failed to \ndetect and reflect the risks associated with the securities they were \nrating should be accorded any reliance or role in our financial system. \nSome have suggested they should be regulated and we may need to \nconsider that.\n  In addition, Congress and the regulators should review ``off-balance \nsheet'' transactions and leveraging. There should be a close \nexamination on whether banks are sufficiently transparent and providing \naccurate accounting that truly reflects risk and leverage.\n  Similarly there should be a review on credit default swaps, CDS, \nwhich are privately traded derivatives contracts that have ballooned to \nmake up what is a $2 trillion market according to the Bank of \nInternational Settlements. They are a fast-growing major type of \nfinancial derivative. Many experts assert that they have played a \ncritical role in this financial crisis as various financial players \nbelieved that they were safe because they thought CDS fully insured or \nprotected them, but the CDS market is unregulated and no one really \nknows what exposure everyone else has from the CDS contracts. \nConsideration should be given to subjecting all over-the-counter \nderivatives onto a regulated exchange similar to that used by listed \noptions in the equity markets.\n  Excessive overleveraging has been a contributing factor in the \nturmoil that now threatens our financial institutions. We have seen a \nmassive expansion of the practice of leveraged financial institutions--\nbanks, investment banks, and hedge funds--making investments with \nborrowed money. In turn, they borrow more money by using the assets \nthey just purchased as collateral. This sequence is continued again and \nagain. The financial system, in its efforts to deleverage, is \ncontracting credit. They must guard against future losses by holding \nmore capital. Deleveraging is leading to difficulty on Main Street for \nindividuals seeking to get a mortgage or buy a car. If a financial \ninstitution is able to unload its toxic assets onto the government, it \nwill again be able to resume its lending activities that are crucial \nfor economic growth in the United States. Unfortunately, much of the \nfinancial crisis has arisen from miscalculations of the risks involved \nwith purchasing large amounts of securities backed by subprime \nmortgages and other toxic assets. We now see a situation where we are \nnot just talking about a handful of firms. This is a widespread problem \nthat should be addressed by this package and in future reforms of our \nfinancial regulatory structure.\n  In addition, the package crafted by Senate leaders includes two \nnotable changes from the version that was rejected by the House on \nMonday. It will include a tax package that was previously passed in the \nSenate by a vote of 93-2 on September 23, 2008, but has since been \nrejected by the House in a dispute over revenue offsets. It includes \ntax incentives for wind, solar, biomass, and other alternative energy \ntechnologies. It also includes critically important relief from the \nalternative minimum tax, which threatens to raise the tax liability of \nover 22 million unintended filers in 2008 if no action is taken. \nFinally, the package includes a host of provisions that either expired \nin 2007 or are set to expire in 2008, including the research and \ndevelopment tax credit, rail line improvement incentives, and quicker \nrestaurant and retail depreciation schedules. I supported the Senate-\npassed tax extenders bill because it struck a responsible balance on \nthe issue of revenue raising offsets.\n  The package also includes a provision to temporarily increase the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC, insurance limit to \n$250,000. Currently, the FDIC provides deposit insurance which \nguarantees the safety of checking and savings deposits in member banks, \nup to $100,000 per depositor per bank. Member banks pay a fee to \nparticipate. The current $100,000 limit has been unchanged since 1980 \ndespite inflation. This approach is supported by both Senator McCain \nand Senator Obama, by House Republicans, and by the FDIC Chairman \nSheila Bair, who sent a request for this change to Congress on Tuesday. \nRaising the cap could stem a potential run on deposits by bank \ncustomers, particularly businesses, who fear losing their money. Such \nfears contributed to the collapse of Washington Mutual and Wachovia \nBank in the past week. However, some economists warn that raising this \nlimit creates a ``moral hazard'' where banks have less incentive to \nprotect assets when there is a government backstop. The coverage amount \nreverts back to $100,000 after December 31, 2009.\n  Congress is now called upon to make the best of a very bad situation. \nWe must pledge to our constituent taxpayers that we will learn from the \nmistakes which led to the brink and take corrective, vigilant, action \nto prevent a recurrence.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, responding to the national economic crisis \nhas been the focus of our efforts here in the Senate for over a week. I \nhave been consulted by Senator Christopher Dodd, chairman of the \nBanking Committee, on the financial bailout proposal. I thank him for \nall of his hard work to address this complex problem. As chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, I wish to inform all my fellow Senators \nabout the intent with which the judicial review provisions were \ndrafted. I believe it is especially important for Senators to have this \nunderstanding before Members of the Senate vote on this legislation.\n  From the very moment I received the administration's proposal, I have \nobjected to any measure that strips the courts from playing their \nindispensible role as a check on executive power. I have insisted at \nevery stage in the negotiations that the traditional Administrative \nProcedures Act review apply to the Secretary of Treasury's actions, as \nwell as any constitutional review that our courts are charged with in \nour democracy.\n\n[[Page S10280]]\n\n  It was of utmost importance to me to see that judicial review has \nbeen maintained in the version that we will be considering in light of \nthe authority this legislation will give to the Treasury Secretary. \nThis review is primarily based on traditional court review under the \nAdministrative Procedures Act. In that section, the word ``law'' means \nany State or Federal law or common law interpreting such State and \nFederal laws. This is a crucial distinction, and it is not the intent \nof the drafters of these provisions to allow the Secretary of the \nTreasury to vitiate any private right of action on behalf of \nshareholders based on Federal statute or judicial interpretation of a \nFederal statute. With this legislation, Congress does not intend to \nallow any financial institution that participates in this plan to gain \nimmunity from suit, nor permit the Secretary to confer such immunity on \nany participant.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, my other top priority \nfor this legislation has been that the Secretary not be able to \ninterfere with or impair the claims or defenses available to any other \nperson. Americans harmed by corruption on Wall Street should not have \ntheir causes of action affected by the Secretary in any way. Truth in \nLending Act claims should be allowed to proceed in due course. \nShareholders who have been injured by the misconduct of corporate board \nmembers or executives should be able to file and continue their claims \nagainst those corporations. It is my understanding and intention that \nnone of these causes of action should be harmed or otherwise affected \nby our bailout legislation. This is why we included a savings clause to \nmake this explicit.\n  We heard repeatedly from the administration that they were concerned \nthat rogue judges would award injunctions and thwart the emergency \nactions needed for the Secretary to calm the financial crisis. By \nagreeing to the administration's request on injunctions, we intend for \ndamages actions to be the avenue of relief for any misconduct, should \nit occur, on the part of the Secretary. We were assured that existing \nwaivers of sovereign immunity under the Tucker Act, the Contracts \nDispute Act, the Little Tucker Act, the Federal Tort Claims Act and \nrelevant civil rights laws would apply to the Treasury Department's new \nresponsibilities, just as these laws have applied to the Treasury \nDepartment's actions prior to the bailout measure.\n  We have also insisted on protection for consumers who are parties to \nmortgage agreements by including a provision to make sure that any \nrights or claims held by a consumer in relation to those loans, whether \nunder the terms of the mortgage or Federal or State law, are preserved \nin the event those loans are transferred to the Federal Government. It \nis not the intent of Congress to deprive homeowners of recourse against \nthose lenders who, through greed, irresponsible lending, or outright \nfraud, led people into taking out unadvisable loan products and who \nwere responsible for contributing to those homeowners' current mortgage \nstruggles. Once again, it is imperative that the extraordinary \nauthority Congress has given to the Treasury Secretary not be at the \nexpense of the rights of American citizens to enforce the terms of \ntheir contracts or to rely upon State and Federal laws that protect \nagainst fraudulent lending practices or other deceptive behavior.\n  Even in emergencies, it is important that the Federal Government \nexercise its authority consistent with the rule of law. Congressional \nnegotiators were aware of the administration's call for immediate \nreaction, but I believe we acted responsibly by taking the time to \nensure that adequate legal protections were provided in the \nlegislation. The courts play a fundamental role in our democratic \nsystem of government and will be especially important in ensuring that \nthese new authorities are used responsibly.\n  Americans must have the confidence that those harmed by the conduct \nof any financial institution can access their courts for redress, \ndespite this legislation. The Congress is aware of civil litigation \nbrought by shareholders or by or on behalf of financial institutions \nthat purchased troubled assets, against officers, directors, and in \nsome cases counterparties whose alleged misconduct caused or \ncontributed to their losses. The Congress is also aware of media \nreports of criminal investigations. These matters are for the justice \nsystem to resolve on an individual basis, but the Secretary and the \nexecutive branch should generally cooperate with public and private \nefforts to recover losses from wrongdoers in the financial markets, \nwhether brought by a governmental entity, securities purchasers, the \ncorporation itself, or asserted on behalf of the corporation \nderivatively. Nothing in this act is meant to detract from any rights \nor recovery against private parties to redress wrongdoing that exist \nunder Federal or State law.\n  I thank the leadership for consulting me during the drafting and \nredrafting process and for incorporating my language into the \nprovisions providing for judicial review.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the historic \nvote that will occur today on the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act \nof 2008. Members of Congress and the U.S. Treasury Department have \nspent the last two weeks debating a response to the declining U.S. \ncredit markets and a plan to get America's economic machine running \nagain. The final product is a far cry from the Treasury's initial 3-\npage proposal. However, I am still not convinced that this is the best \nsolution for our country.\n  Throughout this debate, I have listened to arguments from both sides. \nI studied this legislative proposal line by line, and tried to measure \nthe benefit this legislation would bring to our financial markets \nagainst its enormous cost to our taxpayers. Ultimately, I do not \nbelieve this is the best solution for our economy or the taxpayer. Has \nCongress been rushed? Have we decided to do something, anything, even \nif it's wrong because of the dire warnings of an economic apocalypse? \nYes, but in this case the wrong proposal is just too costly for our \ncountry in terms of dollars and in terms of our economic future. \nSomething does need to be done to save our economy, but this package is \njust a very costly band-aide for big banks that will do very little to \nhelp patients who need major surgery.\n  Had Congress been able to use the regular committee process to craft \na bipartisan and comprehensive legislation, the resulting bill may have \ngained my support. Unfortunately, Congress has been pressured into \npassing this bill in two weeks by Treasury and Wall Street. A rescue \nplan of this scale requires a clear plan of action with a substantial \nchance of success. This plan has neither.\n  When Treasury Secretary Paulson and FED Chairman Bernanke first came \nto the Hill to ask for help, my colleagues on the Senate Banking \nCommittee and I told him that even his dire warnings of a global \neconomic meltdown would not allow us to give him a blank check. Since \nthat time, the markets have soared and plunged on each new development \nout of Washington. But the warnings about global collapse have not been \nrealized yet, and I pray that they won't. By passing this legislation \nare we vastly underestimating the resilience of our markets and \noverestimating the need for this legislation? This does not provide us \nwith any measurable goals for success.\n  This plan inadequately addresses the root cause of our market crisis, \nhome foreclosure. Without addressing the root of our economic problem, \nI have little confidence that it will be successful. I cannot vote for \na bill to authorize $700 billion in taxpayer money without a \nsubstantial chance of success.\n  What I was hoping for was a solution that would get closer to the \nreal problem and to the people. The housing crisis accelerated the \nfinancial problem. The response was to bailout banks and investment \nfirms and forget the hurting homeowner. That is still what we are doing \nwhile claiming to make the credit market more liquid using taxpayer \nmoney. The public still sees it as a big bank bailout.\n\n  In addition, this plan offers no clear plan to solve our market \ncrisis. I questioned Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke about the \nasset purchase program last Sunday, and again during the Senate Banking \nCommittee hearing last Tuesday. I did not receive satisfactory answers, \nand many doubts about this program still remain. The primary purpose of \nthis program is to find the true value of these mortgage assets through \na Treasury purchase\n\n[[Page S10281]]\n\nprogram. Yet this legislation provides no details on how that process \nworks, who will participate, and how these assets will be priced.\n  I understand why many of my colleagues voted for this bill and why \nsome of my constituents encouraged me to do the same. This was one of \nthe hardest decisions I've ever had to make as a senator. I hope that, \nif this bill ultimately passes, that it does help. I really do. I know \nthis economic hole is dark and there is a real risk of many Wyoming \npeople suffering, but I believe there are other steps that we could try \nbefore jumping off a cliff $700 billion high.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues to craft comprehensive, \naccountable, and common-sense reforms to our financial markets. We must \nconsider reforming the fair value accounting method when there is no \nmarket. The current rules prevent banks from understanding the true \nprice of their assets in the long term. We need to enact reforms that \nmake federal financial regulation more efficient, vigorous, and \ntransparent. The role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also needs to be \nre-evaluated in order to restructure the mortgage market from the \nbottom up. Finally, we should consider changes to our tax code, \nincluding capital gains and mortgage interest deduction, which will \nencourage liquidity in the marketplace. Another idea would be to expand \nthe tax credit to those buying up foreclosed homes or homes on the \nmarket over 180 days.\n  The best way to solve this problem was to never get in the situation \nin the first place, but at this point that is not an option. Further \ndisruption of our free market system by rewarding bad decisions with \ntaxpayer money will only make this problem worse. That is why I oppose \nthis legislation. We've got a lot more work to do and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to reform our financial markets to ensure \nthis situation never happens again.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the economic crisis \nthat is gripping our country and the bipartisan economic rescue package \ncurrently before the Senate.\n  These are troubling times for the American people. We are facing a \ndevastating credit freeze and the possibility of a catastrophic \neconomic collapse. The problems that started with the excesses and \n``anything goes'' attitude on Wall Street, are, unfortunately, not \ncontained to Wall Street. The news from Colorado over the last few days \nhas been grim.\n  Small businesses are worrying that their credit will dry up and they \nwon't be able to make payroll.\n  Workers are seeing their pensions and retirement savings hanging in \nthe balance. Young families are worrying they won't be able to borrow \nmoney for their first home. Students fear that their bank won't extend \ntheir college loans.\n  Farmers and ranchers worry that credit will not be available and \ninterest rates will skyrocket, making it more difficult to buy seed, \nfuel, and fertilizer.\n  And construction projects in Colorado are grinding to a halt. \nBorrowing money is getting too expensive.\n  To be sure, the economic pain inflicted by the financial credit \ncrunch is not new to middle-class families in Colorado and across the \nNation.\n  Over the last 8 years, middle-class families have seen their incomes \ndrop, while the cost of energy and health care and education have \nskyrocketed. Gas is still near $4 a gallon. Meanwhile, in the last 2 \nyears, millions of families have been forced into foreclosure or have \nseen the value of their homes plummet.\n  For these families on Main Street who have been playing by the rules \nbut who have been left behind by the failed economic policies of the \nlast 8 years, it is entirely legitimate to ask who was ``minding the \nstore'' on Wall Street over the past 8 years.\n  While ordinary Americans were struggling to pay the bills and fill \nthe tank, and while many of my colleagues and I were calling for \naction, the administration was twiddling its thumbs.\n  We heard over and over that the fundamentals of our economy were \nstrong.\n  In March, we heard that the credit crisis would be contained if the \nFederal Reserve came to the rescue of Bear Stearns. Then we heard the \nsame thing when the administration asked for the authority to back up \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when it was forced to use that authority, \nand when the Fed loaned $85 billion to AIG.\n  I can understand why Americans are angry and frustrated. I am angry \nand frustrated.\n  But today, we must do our very best to concentrate on the task at \nhand.\n  The question before this body is whether the proposal that has been \nnegotiated by congressional leaders in both parties and the \nadministration can unfreeze the credit markets that are so vital to \nhealthy economic activity, prevent future financial failures, and \nprevent economic paralysis. Millions of jobs are at stake. American \nprosperity is at stake. The economic security of middle-class families \nis at stake.\n  With that in mind, the Senate today is considering an economic rescue \npackage that aims to protect middle-class Americans from the Nation's \nfinancial crisis. The package would create the Troubled Assets Relief \nProgram, or TARP. The goal of the program is to inject liquidity into a \ncash-strapped market and restore the confidence of investors, lenders, \nand borrowers.\n  I strongly support this goal.\n  But let me be clear: I am glad that Congress has overhauled the \nadministration's original proposal and not handed the Secretary of the \nTreasury a blank check. The proposal before us contains a number of \nprovisions that will ensure strong, independent oversight of the \nprogram; better protect the taxpayer; impose limitations on executive \ncompensation for participating companies; and increase foreclosure \nmitigation assistance to distressed homeowners.\n  First, I am especially pleased that the money will be provided in \ninstallments: $250 billion of the $700 billion requested will be made \navailable at the outset. The President would have to certi the need for \nan added $100 billion, and the final $350 billion would be contingent \non congressional approval. I believe this structure provides an \nimportant safeguard in the event that the program does not achieve its \nintended objectives.\n  Second, the proposal before us requires the Treasury Department and \nother Federal agencies to try and work out the mortgages it purchases \nor controls in an effort to keep families in their homes. It also \nexpands eligibility for the Home for Homeowners program, which was \ncreated as part of the housing stimulus bill earlier this year, and \nwhich would offer FHA-insured refinancing to distressed homeowners.\n  Third, in order to provide as much protection for taxpayer dollars as \npossible, the bill requires companies that sell some of their bad \nassets to the Government to provide warrants so that taxpayers will \nbenefit from any future growth these companies may experience as a \nresult of participation in the program. It also requires the President \nto submit legislation that would cover any losses to taxpayers \nresulting from this program.\n  Fourth, the proposal contains a number of provisions designed to \nlimit executive compensation for participating companies, including the \nelimination or limitation of certain tax benefits and, in some cases, \ncaps on compensation. In addition, the bill limits or penalizes the \nexcessive severance packages for departing executives frequently \nreferred to as ``golden parachutes.''\n\n  Finally, the legislation includes strong oversight mechanisms and \nreporting requirements to ensure that Congress and the American public \nhave timely and relevant information about the program and its \nactivities every step of the way. Specifically, the bill requires the \nTreasury Secretary to report regularly on the use of funds and the \nprogress made in addressing the crisis, and establishes two independent \noversight mechanisms: a bipartisan oversight board and a special \ninspector general for the program.\n  Each of these provisions represents a vast improvement over the bill \nthat Secretary Paulson and President Bush submitted to Congress, and I \njoined many of my colleagues in urging their inclusion through the \ncourse of the negotiations.\n  I am also pleased that after the first attempt to pass the economic \nrescue package in the House of Representatives earlier this week, \nadditional improvements were made to the bill to\n\n[[Page S10282]]\n\nprovide greater protection to middle-class Americans whose savings are \nat risk.\n  Importantly, this bill increases the FDIC limits from $100,000 to \n$250,000. This will better protect the savings of ordinary Americans \nand helps ease concerns that I had with the initial compromise.\n  In addition, I am extremely pleased that, in passing this economy \nrecovery package, we will extend a wide range of important tax relief \nprovisions for middle-class families, including protection from the \nAlternative minimum tax for 23 million Americans and deductions for \ncollege tuition and teachers' out-of-pocket classroom expenses.\n  This package would also create jobs through a new set of tax \nincentives to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. These tax \nprovisions are vital to setting our economy back on the track to \nprosperity by spurring investment in a new generation of clean energy \ntechnologies. In the 3 years between 2004 and 2007, renewable energy \nsector jobs in the Denver metro area surged from 5,760 to 13,940 and \nthe number of renewable energy companies in the 9 counties surrounding \nDenver rose from 104 to 1,010. Extending and expanding these tax \nincentives will be critical to enabling the continued growth of this \nindustry in my State and across the Nation.\n  Having said all of that, despite these modifications to the \nadministration's original proposal, I believe there are a number of \nadditional areas that need to be addressed and important questions that \nneed to be answered.\n  For example, as we consider whether and how to protect the American \npublic from the consequences of the failures of our financial sector, \nwe must take steps to ensure this situation does not occur again in the \nfuture: That means stronger oversight and regulation of our financial \nindustry.\n  While I understand that we must act quickly and that the proposal \nmust be focused, I urge my colleagues to join ale in pledging to enact \na strong and effective regulatory structure within the next 6 months.\n  In addition, there are legitimate questions about how the \nadministration settled on $700 billion, why Congress was asked to \nundertake this large and wide-ranging proposal on an extremely \nabbreviated timetable with limited opportunity to conduct hearings, and \nwhat, exactly, the TARP program will look like--what kinds of assets it \nwill buy and how much it will pay for them.\n  Should this legislation become law, I am committed to forcefully \nexercising the congressional oversight authority that it provides to \nget answers to these and other questions, and to hold the \nadministration accountable for its actions.\n  This proposal is far from perfect. And I respect the positions of my \ncolleagues who have expressed principled opposition to this bill. Their \nvoices have been important to this debate.\n  However, after devoting considerable time and thought to the severity \nof our current financial crisis and to the consequences of inaction for \nbusiness, families, and farmers in Colorado and across the Nation, I \nhave concluded that I must support this proposal and work diligently to \nensure its effective implementation.\n  We are in the midst of an extraordinarily serious financial crisis. \nDespite legitimate concerns over the circumstances that brought us to \nthis juncture, we have an obligation--today and always--to act in the \nbest interest of the people we were elected to represent.\n  This proposal has serious shortcomings, but I believe it is firmly in \nour constituents' best interests that we act now to protect Main Street \nfrom the failures of Wall Street; to ensure that small businesses, \nfarms, and ranches can continue to access the credit they need to \nsurvive and ultimately thrive; and to secure the ability of families to \nsave for retirement, find good jobs, and provide for their children's \nfuture.\n  None of us can be sure exactly where our economy will be in 6 months \nor a year. But what I do know is that the economic security of all \nAmericans is at risk today. I am angry with how we got here, and I am \nnot fully satisfied with this proposal, but given a fighting chance, \nthe American people have always risen to the challenges before them. \nThis bill will give American families that chance by protecting them \nfrom the failures of Wall Street and rescuing Main Street from the \nperils of a devastating credit crunch.\n   I am confident that our best days are still ahead. We will soon turn \nthe page on the failed economic policies of the last 8 years, right our \neconomic ship, put our Nation back on a path to prosperity, and restore \nour economy to its rightful place as the envy of the world.\n  Mr. DODD. I wish comment on certain parts of the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act of 2008.\n  Section 132 reauthorizes the Securities and Exchange Commission to \nsuspend Financial Accounting Standard 157 if it ``is necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest and is consistent with the \nprotection of investors.'' That is a very high standard. I do not \nexpect or encourage the Commission to take action in this regard.\n  Vital to the health of U.S. capital markets is financial information \nthat is reliable. Accounting rules should produce financial data that \nfaithfully depicts economic reality and is neutral, not favoring either \nthe supplier or user of capital, either the buyer or seller of \nsecurities. The formulation of accounting standards is best left to the \naccounting experts. Congress should not be in the business of setting \naccounting standards.\n  Furthermore, it is critically important that we respect the \nindependence of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, so that they \ncan observe a fair and open process and arrive at the most appropriate \naccounting standards. Congress should not chill or override that \nindependence and does not do so in this legislation.\n  With respect to mark to market, I understand concerns that have been \nraised. However, many experts object to the suggestion of suspending \nit. For example, the Council of Institutional Investors, the Center for \nAudit Quality, and the CFA Institute have said they ``are united in \nopposing any suspension of `mark to market' or `fair value' \naccounting.'' They stated: [Suspending fair value accounting during \nthese challenging economic times would deprive investors of critical \nfinancial information when it is needed most. Fair value accounting \nwith robust disclosures provides more accurate, timely, and comparable \ninformation to investors than amounts that would be reported under \nother alternative accounting approaches. Investors have a right to know \nthe current value of an investment, even if the investment is falling \nshort of past or future expectations.]\n  Section 133 directs the Commission to conduct a study on mark-to-\nmarket accounting. The study is to be completed within 3 months, which \nwill necessarily limit its scope and depth. Within these limits, I will \nbe particularly interested in the findings on the impact of such \nstandards on the quality of financial information available to \ninvestors and on the fairness of the standard setting process.\n  Section 118, ``Funding,'' states that the purposes for which \nsecurities may be issued include actions authorized by this act, \nincluding the payment of administrative expenses. This would include \nsuch reasonable expenses as are incurred in the preparation of reports, \nsuch as the study mandated by section 133.\n  Section 3 states that the term, ``financial institution,'' ``means \nany institution, including, but not limited to, any bank, savings \nassociation'' or other specific types of institutions. The latitude of \nthe definition is intended to include the parent holding companies of \none of the identified types of institutions that are established and \nregulated under the laws of the jurisdictions set forth in the \ndefinition. Thus, for example, if a wholly owned securities subsidiary \nof a public-traded financial holding company sells assets to the \nTreasury Department, it would be subject pursuant to section 113 to \nproviding a warrant to the Secretary to receive stock in such holding \ncompany.\n  With respect to section 119, I want to associate myself with the \nremarks of Senator Leahy on the savings clause.\n  Section 101 of the legislation gives broad authority for the Treasury \nSecretary, in consultation with other agencies, to purchase and to make \nand fund commitments to purchase troubled assets from eligible \nfinancial institutions on terms and conditions that he determines. This \nlegislation does\n\n[[Page S10283]]\n\nnot limit the Secretary to specific actions, such as direct purchases \nor reverse auctions but could include other actions, such as a more \ndirect recapitalization of the financial system or other alternatives \nthat the Secretary deems are in the taxpayers' best interest and that \nof the Nation's economy.\n  Section 129 requires the Federal Reserve to submit regular written \nreports to the Senate Banking and House Financial Services Committees \nwhenever it uses its authority under section 13(3) of the Federal \nReserve Act. The periodic updates to the reports are meant to keep the \ncommittees informed of the specific details of any loans or the \naggregate details concerning programs the Federal Reserve establishes \nthat are covered by this requirement.\n  Section 131 requires the Treasury to reimburse the Exchange \nStabilization Fund, ESF, for any losses that result from the temporary \nguaranty program that they recently established. It is the intent of \nthe Treasury that the temporary guaranty program that they recently \nestablished will not last longer than 1 year, and while the final \nversion of the act does not mention this time-frame, it was because the \nTreasury Department has publicly stated that this temporary program \nwill last no longer than 1 year, which is consistent with the intent of \nthis legislation. Further, the act forbids the Secretary from using the \nESF for the establishment of any similar fund in the future. The ESF \nhas never been used for loans or guarantees for domestic purposes, and \nit is important that the money in the fund continue to be available for \nthe ESF's stated purpose.\n  Section 136 provides a temporary increase in the coverage limit for \nnonretirement accounts in insured depository institutions. It is the \nintention of the legislation that this increase be temporary and this \nincrease is not a statement of any intent for changes in the permanent \ndeposit insurance level.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nTreasury Department be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I first thank my colleagues for their \ngenerous comments. This has been an incredible 2 weeks. It began \nexactly 2 weeks ago tomorrow night when the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve and the Secretary of the Treasury, in words that were as \nchilling as any I have heard in 28 years here, describing the condition \nof our economy.\n  We heard the words ``credit crunch.'' I was educated in high school \nby Jesuits, and the word ``credit,'' the derivative, comes from the \nLatin word ``to believe.'' What is more important to me at this moment \nthan any financial loss that Wall Street suffers or other institutions \nor shareholders, as much as I am concerned about it, but the biggest \nloss we run the risk of is Americans believing in their country, that \nsense of confidence and optimism that has been at the base of our \nsuccess for more than two centuries.\n  I say to my colleagues who are wondering whether at this moment we \nought to embrace this plan to move us to the right footing, this is the \nmoment which we must take this opportunity to get back our economy, and \nsimultaneously, more important than anything else we achieve, to \nrestore Americans' confidence, their optimism, and their belief that \nthis country can provide a better day for their children and their \ngrandchildren than the one in which they were raised.\n  Nothing less than that, in my view, is at stake in the vote we will \ntake in a matter of minutes; maybe the most important vote any one of \nus will ever cast in this body. It will determine the future and the \nwell being of our country. I beseech my colleagues, not as Democrats or \nas Republicans, but as Americans, and as Members of this remarkable \ninstitution, to cast a vote for the future believability in our economy \nand our country.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2008.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, I am writing regarding the Emergency \n     Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.\n       It is the intention of the Department of the Treasury that \n     all mortgages or mortgage-related assets purchased in the \n     Troubled Asset Relief Program will be based on or related to \n     properties in the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kevin I.

The Senate will now resume consideration of \nthe House message on H.R. 2095, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Message from the House of Representatives to accompany H.R. \n     2095, entitled an Act to amend title 49, United States Code, \n     to prevent railroad fatalities, injuries, and hazardous \n     materials releases, to authorize the Federal Railroad Safety \n     Administration, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 5677 (to the motion to concur in the \n     amendment of the House of Representatives to the amendment of \n     the Senate to the bill), to establish the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 5678 (to amendment No. 5677), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 15 minutes for the majority and \n15 minutes for the minority.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wanted to make sure everyone knows \nwe have 30 minutes allocated for Amtrak, and then the majority leader, \nSenator Reid, also intends to go back, before the vote starts, and use \nhis leader time at his discretion.\n  I rise to talk about the Amtrak reauthorization bill which will be \nthe first vote tonight. I start out by thanking my colleague, Senator \nSmith from Oregon, for all of the good work he has done on the rail \nsafety portion of this bill; also Senator Lautenberg, the majority \nmember who has worked so hard on the Amtrak portion; and Senators \nInouye and Senator Stevens, the chairman and ranking member of our \ncommittee during most of the negotiations on this big, very important \nbill.\n  I think we have come to a very good position on Amtrak and on rail \nsafety, and the legislation before us combines these two important \nbills that were written with separate subcommittees. I have worked on \nrail safety since I came to the Senate in 2004 when Union Pacific was \ngoing through a rash of accidents. The Department of Transportation \ninitiated a compliance review at the request of myself and all the \nmembers of the Texas Congressional delegation.\n  The rail safety component of this legislation will reduce driver \nfatigue by ensuring that train employees receive adequate rest between \nshifts. The recent accident in California has led many to call for the \nimplementation of new safety technologies on trains. Our legislation \nrequires the Department of Transportation to develop a plan for \nimplementation of positive train control systems on trains by the end \nof 2015.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this very important \nbipartisan legislation.\n\n\n                           Financial Bailout\n\n  Mr. President, the later votes we will take tonight are on another \nmajor piece of legislation. We have been hearing the debate on it all \nafternoon, really for the last 2 weeks. I want to start by saying that \nstabilizing our economy is the most important responsibility our \nCongress has right now. I did not vote for the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac \nbailout. I did not. I did not vote for that because I did not think \nthere was enough taxpayer protection, nor were there limits on \nexecutive compensation packages.\n  When Secretary Paulson came before us last week and said he wanted to \nhave the power to spend up to $700 billion, I would not have supported \nthat package, because, again, there were not enough taxpayer \nprotections, there were not enough limits on executive compensation, \nand there was not enough oversight.\n  But in my 15 years in the Senate, I have never seen a more bipartisan \neffort in Congress to sit down and come to a real conclusion for the \ngood of our country, putting Republican and Democratic labels aside, to \nsay: We know it is our responsibility to save the financial integrity \nof our country for every person who has a pension\n\n[[Page S10284]]\n\nfund, for every person who has a lifetime savings in a bank, for every \nperson who has worked hard all their lives to buy their homes, and to \nwant to be able to own that home and pay off their mortgage.\n  I am speaking for every person who has gone to the bank for a loan in \nthe last 4 days, because they are being told there is no ability to \nloan right now. I am talking about a State that goes to the markets for \nmunicipal funding and does not get one bid despite a triple A rating. \nDo we have the option of sitting here and seeing this happen in our \ncountry and saying: You know, I do not like this part of that bill or \nthat part of that bill, so I am going to vote no?\n  I do not say that any person voting no is not doing it because of \ntheir own convictions, but I am saying that from my standpoint, the \npeople who have elected me to represent them in the Senate, I have \nworked in every way I could to get the taxpayer protections, to get the \noversight of Congress, to have the board that would make a difference \nin maybe what could be done by the Treasury, the way they put together \nthese packages, to make sure there is an upside for the taxpayer, which \nthere is in this bill, that the taxpayers will have an ownership stake \nif there is an upside, and that it will pay down debt. It is not going \nanywhere else but paying down debt to start getting our fiscal house in \norder. Then the House put in a provision that I thought was very sound. \nAfter 5 years, if the Government is facing a loss in the program, the \nPresident will be required to submit a plan to determine how we recoup \nfrom the financial companies that have been benefited, whatever the \nloss might be to the taxpayer.\n  This legislation also increases the FDIC limits to protect those \npeople who have their life savings in a bank, so they will not worry \nthey might be wiped out when it is announced, when they wake up in the \nmorning, that their bank has gone under.\n  There is very important tax policy in this bill that was added since \nthe House turned down the bill, that was agreed to by the bipartisan \nworking group, very important tax policies. It will give relief of the \nAMT to 23 million more low- and middle-income taxpayers in our country. \nAMT is eating up the ability for families to be able to save for their \ncollege education for their children.\n  It also extends the tax incentives that will spur energy production \nand innovation, wind energy, production tax credit, research and \ndevelopment tax credits, sales tax deductions for States that do not \nhave an income tax.\n  It also includes help for our disaster areas, to give tax credits to \ndevelopers who will help build low-income housing in the 29 Texas \ncounties that still have not even been able to clean up their streets \nyet from Hurricane Ike.\n  We have added much to this bill from the original proposal. I agree \nwith something the Senator from California said a few minutes ago: \nPeople think this is the same proffer that was made a week ago that had \nno oversight, no taxpayer protections, no upside for the taxpayer, no \nlimits on executive compensation. That is not what we are talking up \ntonight. What we are talking up tonight does have improvements made by \nCongress, doing everything we can, that if this is passed and it is run \nright, the taxpayers will actually benefit, and we will start paying \ndown the debt of our country.\n  Senators Reid and McConnell, Senators Dodd and Judd Gregg, Speaker \nPelosi, Congressman Frank, Congressman Boehner, Congressman Blunt, have \nbeen a bipartisan working group with the President of the United States \nand the Secretary of the Treasury, to attempt to do all that we laid \nout to the Secretary that we wanted to see in the legislation that was \nnot there when he first came forward. He has bent over backwards to try \nto make sure that we have those protections in place. I urge my \ncolleagues to remember they have been elected by the people of their \nState to make the tough decisions. They have been elected not to go on \nwhat would be their preference for one part of the bill that might not \nhave gotten in. None of us would have written this exactly the way it \nis written. But we all did have the basic standards of taxpayer \nprotection, giving the taxpayers an upside, of limiting executive \ncompensation when somebody has run a financial institution into the \nground, increasing the FDIC limits so that people who have their life \nsavings in a bank will be able to know that is safe.\n  If anything, the Government of the United States of America ought to \nbe able to stabilize its financial markets to show the world that we \nare the most stable and leading democracy in the world, and that we can \nget our house in order. I hope every one of us will think carefully \nabout a tough vote, yes, but a vote that is right for the long term of \nour country.\n  If the program is done correctly, it provides every possibility for \ntaxpayers to have an upside. It also provides every possibility that \nthere will be the oversight that will make sure everything is done with \ntransparency.\n  This isn't a $700 billion package. This is a $250 billion package \nwith contingencies and strings, if we have to go beyond that, strings \nthe President would have to agree to, strings Congress would have to \nagree to. That is a much more measured and responsible approach than \nwhat was presented by the Secretary early on--a $700 billion bailout. \nIt is not that anymore. It is a responsible, bipartisan effort to stand \nup for the economy of the United States and for every banker and every \nsmall investor and every saver and every working person who depends on \nthat stability and depends on their elected officials to do the right \nthing in the toughest of times. That is what we promised when every one \nof us ran for election. I hope we will deliver it tonight.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are about to take up a vote that is \ngoing to decide whether our country is committed to a 21st-century \ntransportation system. This is a vote that was considered under the \ncloture process earlier this week. This is a decision that is going to \ngive a real option to travelers from frustrating lines at the airport, \nhigh gas prices at the pump, one that is going to make trains safer for \nrail passengers and rail workers, and a decision that will expand \nenergy-efficient train travel to more of our cities.\n  Much of the industrialized world has already made such a commitment. \nFrance, China, Japan, Spain, Germany, and Korea are all focused on \nconnecting major cities of 500 miles or less by fast and efficient \ntrains. A 210-mile trip from Brussels, Belgium, to Paris, France, takes \nonly 85 minutes--an hour and 25 minutes--compared to our 3 hours from \nNew York to Washington, DC. The question is, Why can't we have \nsomething comparable to that in this country? Even now, more people \ntake the trains between Washington and New York on a regular basis than \nthose who fly. It is time to bring reliable, fast train service to \nother regions of the country as well. The American public wants this \noption.\n  Yesterday, the Secretary of Transportation announced that Americans \nare driving less and taking trains more frequently. In fact, according \nto Amtrak, the fiscal year that ended yesterday carried over 28 million \nriders. That is a record for the sixth straight year.\n  Our bill provides $13 billion over 5 years for Amtrak and various \nStates so they can explore their corridor opportunities. This is over a \n5-year period for Amtrak and those States, so we can modernize and \nexpand our network of trains, tracks, and stations.\n  With all the demand for rail travel, one thing we also have to make \nsure of is that trains are safe. Unfortunately, we have been reminded \nrecently of the acute need for safety improvements.\n  Last month, America experienced the worst train collision in 15 \nyears. This took place at Chatsworth, CA, on September 12 of this year. \nTwenty-five people died and over 130 were injured when two trains \ncollided in Chatsworth. What made this dreadful crash all the more \ntragic was that it might have been avoided had the necessary \ninvestments in technology been made. As we mourn the victims of the \nChatsworth crash, our vote today will demonstrate the seriousness of \nour being here, about making sure this can't happen again.\n  The State of South Carolina, for instance, not very long ago, in \nGraniteville, saw the rail catastrophe shown here. In 2005, this \ncollision resulted in the release of chlorine gas\n\n[[Page S10285]]\n\nthat killed 9 people, and over 5,400 people were evacuated from the \nsurroundings that day.\n  In Luther, OK, in August, the community witnessed this massive \nfireball after a train derailed and caused ethanol tank cars to \nexplode. We can't even see the train because it was so engulfed by \nflames.\n  One of the major reasons for train crashes is human error. Our bill \naddresses that problem with vital improvements.\n  Thanks in part to Senators Feinstein and Boxer, our bill mandates \nthat major railroads use positive train control or PTC systems. This \ntechnology is available today to keep two trains from colliding, to \nstop a train if the train is passing a red light, as we saw in \nChatsworth.\n  Secondly, our legislation limits the daily number of workhours per \nrailroad employee. Laws now allow them to work 100 hours each and every \nweek. It is wrong. Our bill is going to change those laws so that \npeople who operate and maintain our trains get enough rest between \nshifts and remain alert on the job.\n  Third, our bill is going to give inspectors the tools they need to \nbetter oversee the railroad industry's safety practices. The FRA--the \nFederal Railroad Administration--could punish infractions with fines of \nup to $100,000 when railroad companies disobey our safety laws.\n  As I mentioned on Monday, this bill is long overdue. Since we last \npassed rail safety legislation in 1994, more than 9,000 people have \nbeen killed and more than 100,000 have been injured in train-related \nincidents. Since we last passed Amtrak legislation in 1997, gas prices \nhave tripled. Congestion has grown substantially on the highways. We \nhave suffered two of the worst years ever for flight delays, and \neveryone knows it is time to modernize our Nation's underfunded and \noutdated passenger rail system. In doing so, we will help solve many of \ntoday's challenges, such as energy independence, overcrowded highways, \nrunways that are overcrowded, and global warming. To prevent tragedies \nlike the Chatsworth crash from ever happening again, we must complete \nthis bipartisan legislation today and send it to the President for his \nsignature.\n  The Senate has already passed our bills on Amtrak and railroad safety \nwith overwhelming majorities. On this past Monday, 69 of us voted for \ncloture for this package, obviously meaning that debate was to be cut \noff and get on with business. I urge my colleagues to finish the job \nand support this landmark legislation for the sake of America's \ntravelers.\n  How much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I wish to thank some of my colleagues for their vital \nsupport for this critical legislation. This is truly a bipartisan bill. \nI wish to take a minute and thank those who worked so hard to put this \npackage together. First and foremost, I thank Senate majority leader \nHarry Reid for his leadership. I also thank a former colleague, Senator \nTrent Lott, for his hard work and longstanding commitment to passenger \nrail service. From the Commerce Committee, I thank chairman Dan Inouye \nand ranking member Kay Bailey Hutchison. I thank her for her \ncooperation. It has been terrific working with Senator Hutchison. I \nthank Senator Stevens as well, and my subcommittee ranking member, \nSenator Smith, and all of our cosponsors, particularly Senators Carper, \nFeinstein, Clinton, Menendez, Specter, Schumer, and Warner, for their \ndedication and commitment to improving travel in America.\n  To our partners in the House Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure, I thank Committee Chairman Oberstar, Ranking Member \nMica, Railroads Subcommittee leaders Chairman Brown and Ranking Member \nShuster. These people in the House were all exceptional champions, and \nwe thank them.\n  Everybody I mentioned and many more legislative staff and experts \ncontributed to this bill. We look forward to it becoming law and making \na difference for our rail industry and travelers everywhere. I note \nthat it has been several years that this Senator has been working on \nthis. I am so pleased to see that we will have an opportunity to pass \nit.\n  I thank again my dear friend and colleague, whom we will all miss. He \nleaves with our admiration and affection--Senator John Warner. He and I \neach served in the war. I don't want to tell which war. It goes back a \nlong way. But we did serve in the war together, not in the same theater \nbut we served. He will be missed.\n  At this point, I yield the floor to the Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to begin by thanking Senator \nLautenberg and Senator Hutchison for their work on this bill. It is \nvery a good bill. I am very proud of it. I am proud of them. I hope all \nMembers will support it.\n  This bill does much to benefit rail. I deeply believe that rail has a \nfuture. My own State, California, has a $10 billion bond issue on the \nballot this November to begin the funding of a high-speed rail down the \ncenter of California. So rail can be very important in the future.\n  The bill has many good points. I want to concentrate on just one \nthing and what I just learned from the National Transportation and \nSafety Board. That one thing is that this bill would give the rail \nadministration the ability to prohibit cell phone use.\n  I would like the chairman and the ranking member to know what I just \nlearned through an NTSB press conference. The engineer on the Metrolink \ntrain, the day of the accident, from about a quarter of 7 to a quarter \nof 9 in the morning, as he was an engineer on the train, sent and \nreceived 45 text messages on his cell phone in a little more than an \nhour. In the afternoon, when he was on duty from 2 p.m. to about 3:30, \nhe sent and received 12 messages on his cell phone. One of them was 22 \nseconds before the accident. With this kind of cell phone use while an \nactive engineer on a Metrolink train right around the time of an \naccident, you can see the kind of problem it is. There is no second set \nof eyes on this train. So this National Transportation Safety Board \npress release this afternoon is a revelation.\n  This cannot be happening on other trains. A great deal of our track \nin California is single track. It has both freight and passenger rail \non it, sometimes in opposite directions. To have an engineer in an hour \nand 15 minutes sending or being part of 45 text messages on a cell \nphone is not what an operating engineer should be doing on a train.\n  I thank the chairman. He has done a great job. My pal Senator \nHutchison has done a great job. This is a bill that will stand the test \nof time. It is an important bill for Amtrak, for the rail \nadministration, and for rail safety and positive train controls.\n  I thank them all for their work and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, is there time left on the majority \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A minute and a half on the majority side.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, again, I rise to reiterate the fact \nthat this is a chance to make a huge difference in the way we travel in \nthis country. We know you cannot get there from here if you get on the \nroads, whether they be major highways or streets. Airplanes are ever \nmore delinquent in their ability to deliver service on time. So this is \na chance for everybody to step up and declare we are going to have a \nrefined, up-to-date, modern system that enables us to carry the \npassenger load that is available for us.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote for this legislation and hope we will see \nits passage very shortly.\n  Mr. President, I yield any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to reiterate something the \nSenator from California mentioned, and that is, the rail safety part of \nthis bill is actually a bill that was negotiated separately from the \nAmtrak bill. We put them together because time was of the essence. \nAfter that terrible crash in California, I think it spurred us to be\n\n[[Page S10286]]\n\nable to put these together and go forward. The positive train control \nthat will be required for every rail carrier by the year 2015 is going \nto also have a major impact on safety and stop the crashes that are \npreventable that we have seen in the past. So I think there are a \nnumber of rail safety issues that are so important here that can make a \ndifference.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I wish to yield up to 2 minutes to the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague from \nTexas. And I thank my good friend, the senior Senator from New Jersey, \nfor his gracious remarks. I also commend the cooperation of both of \nthese managers, together with Senators Webb, Cardin, and Mikulski, in \nbringing together in this bill the lifeline of the Metro system in the \nNation's Capital. We are a region, and we speak for the District of \nColumbia, as spokesmen tonight, and for the States of Maryland and \nVirginia, all of which are essential partners in this system which \nsupports this institution, the Congress.\n\n\n                            RAILROAD SAFETY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to address the railroad \nsafety legislation, H. Res. 1492 providing for agreement by the House \nof Representatives to the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 2095, with \nan amendment. First, I must emphasize the importance of strengthening \nour safeguards for railroads, to protect the lives and safety of our \ncitizens. We have just been reminded of how critical it is for us to \npay attention to this issue by the tragedy in my home State of \nCalifornia on September 12, 2008. On that day, a Metrolink train \ncrashed head on into a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth, \nnorthwest of downtown Los Angeles, killing 25 people and injuring at \nleast 135 in the most deadly commuter rail accident in modern \nCalifornia history, and one of the worst rail accidents in recent U.S. \nhistory. The families of all of those killed or injured in that \naccident are in our thoughts and our prayers.\n  I also would like to enter into a colloquy one aspect in this \nlegislation, the provisions entitled the ``Clean Railroads Act of \n2008,'' with my good friend, Senator Lautenberg, the distinguished \nchairman of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee's \nSubcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine \nInfrastructure, Safety, and Security, and the lead author of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, this legislation makes clear that any solid waste rail \ntransfer facility must comply with all applicable Federal and State \nrequirements, both substantive and procedural, including judicial and \nadministrative orders and fines, respecting the prevention and \nabatement of pollution, the protection and restoration of the \nenvironment, and the protection of public health and safety, including \nlaws governing solid waste, to the same extent as required for any \nsimilar solid waste management facility, as defined under the Solid \nWaste Disposal Act, or SWDA, that is not owned or operated by or on \nbehalf of a rail carrier. There is an exception in section 604 of this \nbill, which creates a new section 10909 of title 49 of the United \nStates Code allowing the Surface Transportation Board to issue a land-\nuse exemption for a solid waste rail transfer facility operated by or \non behalf of a rail carrier if the Board finds that a State, local, or \nmunicipal requirement affecting the siting of such facility meets \ncertain specific criteria.\n  For these purposes, the bill defines several terms, including \n``commercial and retail waste,'' ``construction and demolition \ndebris,'' ``household waste,'' ``industrial waste,'' ``institutional \nwaste,'' ``municipal solid waste,'' and ``solid waste.'' The bill \nexplicitly excludes hazardous waste regulated under subtitle C of the \nSWDA, mining or oil and gas waste from being covered under this law and \nleaves in place the structure under which these substances are \ncurrently regulated.\n  Mr. Chairman, is my understanding correct that, by clarifying that \nany solid waste rail transfer facility must comply with all applicable \nFederal and State requirements, both substantive and procedural, in the \nsame manner as any other solid waste management facility as defined \nunder the SWDA, and by expressly excluding such hazardous waste, and \nmining or oil and gas waste, from this law, that this legislation \nensures that the Environmental Protection Agency's and States' \nauthorities dealing with hazardous waste, mining or oil and gas wastes \nare not impacted by this law or by the jurisdiction of the Surface \nTransportation Board?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the distinguished Chairman of the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, and my colleague as a senior \nmember of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, is \ncorrect. This legislation ensures that solid waste rail transfer \nfacilities must fully comply with the substantive and procedural \nrequirements in State and Federal environmental and public health and \nsafety laws, including all permitting requirements, and generally \nallows the Surface Transportation Board to issue land-use exemptions so \nthat the Board may continue to be the single agency to guide our \ncountry's policies concerning the placement of railroad facilities, \nwhich enables a unified national rail system and promotes energy-\nefficient interstate rail transportation. In addition, the \ndistinguished chairman is correct that the legislation does not \ndiminish the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency or the \nStates with respect to hazardous wastes, mining or oil and gas wastes. \nThis legislation also does not affect in any way the application of the \nstatutory definition of solid waste under the SWDA. This legislation \nalso does not intend to affect any preexisting authority to respond to \nimminent hazards under Sections 7002 and 7003 of the RCRA. Lastly, this \nbill ensures that solid waste rail transfer facilities, as defined in \nthis legislation, obtain the State permits that any other similar solid \nwaste management facility is required to obtain and comply in full with \nState law, as described in Sections 603 and 604 of Division A of the \nbill, and this bill affirms the States' traditional police powers to \nrequire rail carriers to comply with State and local environmental, \npublic health, and public safety standards as described in Section 605 \nof Division A.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support H.R. 2095, the Amtrak \nreauthorization bill, which was passed by the House of Representatives \nand is expected to pass the Senate today. I believe the economic \nstrength of our Nation and the State of Michigan is dependent on our \ntransportation infrastructure. Reliable passenger rail service is an \nimportant component of that infrastructure.\n  I have been a strong supporter of Amtrak and have voted repeatedly to \ngive Amtrak the funds it needs to continue to operate safely and \neffectively. I am a cosponsor of the Passenger Rail Investment & \nImprovement Act which reauthorizes and increases funding for Amtrak, \nthe national passenger rail system. A version of that bill is included \nin the package we are voting on today.\n  Also included in this legislation are important railroad safety \nimprovements designed to avoid tragic rail crashes such as the recent \nhorrible collision between a commuter train and a freight train that \nkilled 25 people in California. Federal investigators have said that a \ncollision warning system could have prevented that crash. This \nlegislation would require that new technology to prevent crashes be \ninstalled in high-risk tracks. In addition, it would limit the amount \nof hours train crews can work each month. Both the funding and the \nsafety components of this bill are urgently needed to ensure the \nviability of our nation's passenger rail transportation system in the \nyears to come.\n  A healthy and adequately funded Amtrak benefits Michigan and the \nnation as a whole. Amtrak service in Michigan includes the Pere \nMarquette which provides daily service between Grand Rapids and \nChicago, the Wolverine which provides daily service between Pontiac/\nDetroit and Chicago, and the Blue Water which provides daily service \nbetween Port Huron and Chicago. Amtrak gives travelers and commuters \nmore transportation options, relieves crowding on highways and in \nairports, and reduces oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. \nThis legislation would strengthen Amtrak by authorizing $13 billion for \nAmtrak over 5 years and require oversight, management, and accounting \nimprovements.\n\n[[Page S10287]]\n\n  This legislation is long overdue as Congress has not passed Amtrak \nlegislation since 1997. Unfortunately, in 2005, bipartisan attempts by \nthe Senate to improve and modernize Amtrak's operations were blocked by \nRepublican leadership in the House of Representatives. That same year, \nPresident Bush actually proposed sending the railroad into bankruptcy, \nand in other years he has proposed killing off Amtrak service by \nunderfunding the railroad. In the interim, Amtrak has been muddling \nthrough with barely enough funds to keep operating and certainly not \nenough funding to significantly improve service or expand into new \ntowns and cities. This bill would address past neglect and improve our \nNation's passenger rail system.\n  An improved national passenger rail system means people who are \naccustomed to commuting in their cars will be able to rely on train \nservice, reducing congestion and stress for those who choose to \ncontinue to drive and offering an alternative for those who would \nprefer to take the train. Those who take the train will be able to \nrelax while someone else does the driving. Improved Amtrak service also \nprovides people who do not drive or do not have access to cars with a \nviable transportation alternative, especially for medium-distance \ntrips. Rather than relying on friends and family to drive them from \nplace to place, these people will be able to depend on Amtrak for their \nmiddle-distance transportation needs. This is especially important for \nelderly individuals who were once accustomed to driving but, because of \nage or illness, have become unable to drive safely. For example, two \ngrandparents who live in Michigan and who no longer drive will be able \nto more easily visit their grandchildren in Chicago because of Amtrak's \nimproved service in Michigan. Amtrak's train service is important to \nthe cities and communities of Michigan because it reduces congestion on \nthe roads, reduces pollution and commuting stress, and because it \nimproves middle-distance transportation alternatives for the citizens \nof Michigan.\n  Also important for Michigan and other States, this legislation \nestablishes a $1.5 billion grant program for the construction of high-\nspeed rail projects in any of the 11 designated high-speed rail \ncorridors, one of which is the Midwest High-Speed Rail Corridor, also \nknown as the Chicago hub corridor. This grant program would assist \nMichigan in the development of its portion of the Midwest Regional Rail \nInitiative which includes making investments in high-speed rail \ncapabilities in the Chicago-Detroit corridor.\n  I support this bill because it provides a much needed boost to Amtrak \nand makes and important commitment to preserving and strengthening our \nnational passenger rail system.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, this bill represents years of hard work \nand partnership between Members of Congress from both sides of the \naisle and across the country. I am so pleased that we will finally be \nable to send it to the President for his signature.\n  Amtrak has enjoyed a huge resurgence in recent years. Infrastructure \nhas been repaired, ontime performance has surpassed the airlines, and \npeople are coming back to the train.\n  When the final numbers for fiscal year 2008, which ended yesterday, \nare calculated, ridership is expected to reach over 28.7 million \npassengers and revenues over $1.7 billion for the year. That represents \nan increase of almost 3 million riders and $200 million in revenues \nover the previous year.\n  Passing this bill today will capitalize on this enthusiasm for \npassenger rail and will show that Congress hears the demand for more.\n  Today, Amtrak operates approximately 44 routes over 22,000 miles of \ntrack, 97 percent of which is owned by freight rail companies. Those \nfreight tracks are increasingly congested and not built with modern \npassenger rail in mind. Where the Federal Government does own the \ntracks, we have failed to maintain them as we should.\n  Amtrak was created in 1970 after the freight railroads asked the \nFederal Government to take over passenger rail service because they \nwere losing so much money.\n  Some in the Nixon administration believed they were temporary \ncaretakers for a railroad that would be dead within a few years. So \nthere was little effort to repair the rails or cars or to create a true \nmodern passenger rail system.\n  But Amtrak limped along for decades. In spite of the lack of \ncommitment at the Federal level, the American people were unwilling to \ngive up on rail. Amtrak was a lifeline for people in remote rural \ncommunities that were not served by airports and for business and other \ntravelers in the Northeast corridor.\n  Then, starting in the late 1990s, interest in rail began to grow. \nPeople got tired of sitting in traffic or waiting at airports for \ndelayed flights. Local governments realized rail stations often \nincreased property values and attracted people to their community.\n  New leadership at Amtrak put the focus on repairing old cars and \nrail, leading to smoother, ontime travel.\n  Still, Washington was slow to catch on. President Bush proposed no \nfunding for Amtrak for years and even suggested putting the railroad \ninto bankruptcy and letting a judge determine what to do with it. He \nalso failed to make bipartisan appointments to the Amtrak Board, \nleaving it without a quorum for a time.\n  Congress, however, recognized the importance of investing in age rail \ninfrastructure and joined with Presidents David Gunn and, later, Alex \nKummant to increase the Federal investment.\n  But without an authorization, like the bill we will pass soon, there \nwas no clear, consistent direction. Amtrak had to wait for the yearly \nspending bills to get funding and a sense of where Congress wanted that \ninvestment to go.\n  Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act--this legislation \nchanges that. It authorizes Amtrak through 2013. It also represents a \nfundamental shift away from the Federal Government providing operating \nsupport more toward providing capital investment in rail.\n  The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act creates a funding \nmodel for new rail infrastructure much like the one we have used so \nsuccessfully for highways and airports.\n  Right now, State and local governments have to shoulder all the costs \nif they want to build or expand passenger rail within their boundaries.\n  When I was Governor of Delaware, we might consider several approaches \nto relieving congestion along a corridor. We would quickly realize that \nif we built or expanded a roadway, the Federal Government would pay 80 \npercent of the cost. If we built a transit line, we could secure around \n50 percent of the cost from the Federal Government.\n  But if we chose to invest in intercity passenger rail--even if it was \nthe most effective, cheapest option--the Federal Government would \nprovide no support at all. I have to imagine that this policy has led \nmore than one State to choose the wrong project.\n  Under the new model in the legislation before us today, the Federal \nGovernment could fund up to 80 percent of the cost of new passenger \nrail service. With this increased Federal commitment comes a \nrequirement for renewed State commitment.\n  The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act establishes \nadvisory commissions for the Northeast corridor and State-supported \nroutes with representatives from Amtrak, the States along the route, \nand the Federal Railroad Commission.\n  These commissions will provide advice and oversight of the corridor \nand determine the proper costs and access fees for the routes they \noversee.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues expressed some criticism for \nAmtrak on Monday. Just like them, I would like to see Amtrak perform \nbetter. That is why I am happy that this bill includes so many reforms, \nwhich I will get into in a minute. But the criticisms issued on Monday \ndeserve some attention.\n  It is important to recognize that we have spent more than a \ngeneration watching passenger rail infrastructure fall into disrepair \nand reducing or canceling train service across the Nation.\n  Some are happy to utilize this neglect, and the inevitable reduction \nin the quality of train service, against the railroad. That very \nneglect becomes an excuse for some elected officials to further neglect \nand eventually abandon passenger rail altogether.\n  At the same time, I have always found it interesting how many of our \nconstituents are willing to put up with\n\n[[Page S10288]]\n\ntrains that come infrequently, at inconvenient times, and move slowly. \nIt shows that even a train that sometimes doesn't run as well as it \nshould is needed in an era of extreme traffic congestion and high oil \nprices.\n  The junior Senator from Alabama spoke against this bill on Monday, \nindicating that he did not think Amtrak would ever work in his State. \nHe mentioned that the train from Birmingham to Washington, DC, came but \nonce a day, moved slowly, and cost $440 round trip. The Crescent train \ndoes, in fact, come infrequently and move more slowly than it should. \nAnd there are parts of this bill that will address both issues--from \nthe Federal-State partnership to invest in new rail corridors to the \nreevaluation of the route system to the language ensuring that \npassenger trains can move faster on freight tracks.\n  But I asked a member of my staff to look into the cost of this train \nand found two interesting pieces of information. First, if you buy a \nticket with a week's notice, a round-trip ticket from Birmingham to DC \nis not $440 but $286. And with 2 week's notice, it goes down to $228. \nThe second interesting fact that I learned about the train from \nBirmingham to Washington was today's train is sold out.\n  My colleague also mentioned that his constituents are spending a \nlarger percentage of their income on gasoline than other Americans. The \nhigh cost of gasoline is a burden we are all facing and one that \ndeserves our utmost attention and focus. But walking away from Amtrak \nand other alternatives to driving will only make the situation worse.\n  A report called ``Driven to Spend,'' written by the Surface \nTransportation Policy Project and the Center for Neighborhood \nTechnology in 2006, found that metropolitan areas with fewer \ntransportation options tended to impose higher transportation costs on \ntheir residents.\n  For example, at a time when gas was around $2.50 per gallon, the \naverage family in the Wilmington-Philadelphia area spent $3,381 less \nper year--or 5 percent less of their income--than a family in Houston.\n  We should work together to offer all of our constituents more \nconvenient, cheaper transportation options that includes roads, \npassenger rail, and transit.\n  As I alluded to earlier, the Passenger Rail Investment and \nImprovement Act includes several reforms aimed at reducing Amtrak's \noperating costs and creating a more efficient system.\n  Amtrak's long-distance trains would be subject to a review process \nbased on new standards for financial performance, ontime performance, \nand customer satisfaction, laid out by the Federal Railroad \nAdministration. Based on those standards, Amtrak will be required to \ncreate and implement performance improvement plans for the 5 long-\ndistance routes with the worst performance.\n  In future years, the remaining 10 long-distance routes would undergo \nthe same restructuring process.\n  Additionally, this legislation would look at the cause of poor ontime \nperformance outside of the Northeast corridor. If it is found that the \nproblem is caused by a freight railroad, the Surface Transportation \nBoard is given new authority to address the issue.\n  The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act also allows the \nFederal Government to explore competition for providing passenger rail \nservice in a responsible way. One provision in the bill permits freight \nrailroads to bid to operate some passenger trains that run on their \ntracks.\n  Another provision allows a private entity to bid to provide service \non a corridor, though Congress would have to act again before that bid \ncould be acted on.\n  Moreover, States wishing to use operators other than Amtrak for \nState-supported services would be permitted to do so and would have \naccess to Amtrak facilities and equipment for that particular route.\n  This important bill has been combined with another very important \nbill, the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008. This is the first major \nreform of the rail safety program since the Federal Railroad Safety \nAuthorization Act expired in 1998.\n  This bill requires railroads to install positive train control \nsystems by 2015. These systems are designed to prevent train \nderailments and collisions, like the one that occurred in southern \nCalifornia last month, taking the lives of 25 people.\n  The package would also limit the amount that certain rail employees, \nsuch as locomotive engineers, can work to 276 hours a month. Current \nlaw allows railroads to require more than 400 hours of work per month, \nor approximately 13 hours every single day.\n  This package--the Amtrak reauthorization and rail safety bill--is \ntruly bipartisan and shows that Congress is catching up to our \nconstituents. Americans have been pleading for more rail service for \nyears, and their need only increased with the recent spike in oil \nprices.\n  A recent study by Reconnecting America finds that 30 percent of those \nliving within half a mile of a rail station use it regularly. \nUnfortunately, only 1 in 20 people lives that close to a rail station.\n  With the passage of this bill, Congress is showing that we understand \nthe need for convenient, reliable passenger rail service across this \ncountry, and we are renewing our commitment to giving Americans \naffordable alternatives to driving.\n  With a modern passenger rail system, we can get people out of \ntraffic, prevent a few trips to the gas station and reduce the amount \nof pollution in our air. Not bad for one bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Rail Safety--\nAmtrak package under consideration today.\n  Of highest importance to me though is a much-needed authorization for \nthe Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, WMATA, the metro \nsystem that probably brought a majority of our staffers to work this \nmorning.\n  I thank the many Members with whom I worked to obtain passage of this \nauthorization legislation, leading with my area colleagues, Senators \nWebb, Cardin, and Mikulski. I also thank the Commerce Committee \nleadership of Senators Lautenberg and Hutchison and the leadership of \nthe Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, Senators \nLieberman and Collins.\n  WMATA has been one of the greater metropolitan area's most successful \npartnerships with the Federal Government.\n  In 1960, President Eisenhower signed legislation to provide for the \ndevelopment of a regional rail system for the Nation's Capital and to \nsupport the Federal Government. Since 1960, Congress has continually \nreaffirmed the Federal Government's commitment to Metro by passing \nperiodic reauthorizing bills.\n  Over 50 Federal agencies in the National Capital region are located \nadjacent to Metro stations. Federal agencies rely on WMATA to get their \nemployees to and from the workplace year-round, in all types of \nweather.\n  Based on Metro's 2007 rail ridership survey, approximately 40 percent \nof respondents identified themselves as Federal workers who ride \nMetrorail to work.\n  We are talking about thousands of cars taken off the major roadways \neach day because of our area's metro system.\n  The Railway Safety--Amtrak bill includes funding over 10 years for \ncapital and preventative maintenance projects for WMATA. This language \nwas added by voice vote to the Amtrak bill by Congressman Tom Davis \nduring the House's Amtrak debate this summer.\n  This critical investment will help provide for much-needed \nimprovements to this stressed transit system. Projects such as station \nand facility rehabilitation, tunnel repairs, and addition of new rail \ncars and buses will help ease congestion during peak hours.\n  This legislation, which would authorize much-needed Federal funding, \ncontingent on State and local dedicated matches, recognizes how vital \nMetro is to the region and the Federal Government. Let me repeat: these \ndollars will be matched by the Commonwealth of Virginia, Washington, \nDC, and the State of Maryland.\n  Such legislation is integral to the well being of the area's \ntransportation system, as we struggle to address traffic congestion, \nskyrocketing gas prices, global climate change, and the local quality \nof life concerns.\n\n[[Page S10289]]\n\n  From its inception, the Federal Government has played a significant \nrole in funding the construction and operation of the Metrorail system. \nI hope this Congress will continue to show that support.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Federal \nRailroad Safety Improvement Act. This bill is long overdue. It \nauthorizes funding for Amtrak and improves rail safety. It also \nincludes the National Capital Transportation Amendments Act, which \nauthorizes funding for the Washington Metro system--America's Metro.\n  More funding for America's Metro is important for several reasons. \nFirst, Federal employees, visitors to our Nation's Capital, and \nresidents all depend on Metro. Mr. President, I don't know how your \nstaff gets to work, but more than half of mine take Metro. In fact, \nFederal employees make up over 40 percent of commuters and nearly half \nof all Metro stations are located at Federal facilities. If you \nremember, Metro also evacuated everyone during September 11. Metro \nmakes it easier for visitors from across the country to learn about our \nNation's history and be a part of history. During Presidential \ninaugurations, funerals, celebrations, and demonstrations on the \nNational Mall, Metro extends its hours. Metro also helps working \nfamilies eliminate costly bills at the gas pump. During this period of \nhigh gas prices, my constituents are choosing Metro and leaving their \ncars at home. Because of this, Metro has seen recordbreaking ridership.\n  Second, the Washington metro area must expand its transportation \ninfrastructure to handle base realignment and closure, BRAC, growth. In \nMaryland, we are planning for 40,000 new jobs. I know Virginia is \nplanning for BRAC growth too. The Metro funding in this bill will BRAC-\nready our region's largest transit system.\n  Third, it is estimated that Metro needs $11 million for capital \nimprovements over 10 years. The authorized and dedicated funding in \nthis bill will help Metro meet these needs. Metro will be able to grow \nas the region grows instead of cutting service.\n  Fourth, Metro is safe for the commuter and environmentally sound. We \nall know commuting in the region has become increasingly difficult. I \nhave been commuting to Washington from Baltimore for 31 years. I have \nto budget an hour and a half to 2 hours to get to work. There always \nseems to be some tie-up on the highway and increasing levels of road \nrage. Driving a car in the National Capital Region is serious business \nwhether you are on the Capital Beltway, Route 50, or Central Avenue. \nYet I see many drivers multitasking at high speeds. Drivers are talking \non cell phones, sending text messages, and putting on makeup. This \nMetro funding will make our lives a little safer and saner and help the \nenvironment by reducing air pollution.\n  Metro means more than just transportation. It means residents and \nvisitors to our Nation's Capital can live, work, worship, and play \nwithout ever getting in a car. It means more jobs and access to jobs \nand improved neighborhoods and economic development.\n  I commend Senator Cardin for his hard work and leadership on this \nMetro bill. I thank Senators Warner and Webb for partnering with \nSenator Cardin and me to get this done. Senator Warner and I have been \nregional allies for many years. I am going to miss working with him. I \nthank Majority Leader Reid and Senator Lautenberg for helping us bring \nthe Metro bill to the Senate floor and their hard work on the \nunderlying bill. I urge all my colleagues to get on board and vote for \nthis bill.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in what has become a frequent occurrence in \nthis Congress, the majority has unnecessarily combined two bills--one \nthat I support and one that I don't--in order to ensure quick passage \nof both bills. As a result, I must weigh the two bills together. Of \ncourse, I want to improve rail safety. However, I cannot support a rail \nsafety bill when it is combined with a bill that is essentially a $13.1 \nbillion taxpayer subsidy to Amtrak.\n  The need for rail safety was recently highlighted after the tragic \nrail accident in California on September 12 that killed 25 people. \nClearly, we need to ensure that Americans are safe traveling to work \nand moving the Nation's freight. This bill does augment rail safety by \nrevamping the Federal Railroad Administration and providing over $1.6 \nbillion for rail safety programs. It also mandates many much needed \nsafety changes, including: installing positive train controls; amending \nthe hours of service requirements so operators are not overworked; \nrequiring a risk reduction program, which includes a technology \nimplementation and fatigue management for all Class I and rail carriers \nwith poor safety records; requiring certain mandatory training; and \nmaking changes to grade crossing safety management practices. A similar \nversion of the rail safety legislation passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent on August 1. I suspect that if the majority were to allow a \nvote on final passage of the rail safety bill, it would easily pass the \nSenate.\n  The majority, however, decided to take a different route. Instead of \nquickly passing the final version of the rail safety legislation by \nunanimous consent, it attached the bill to a more controversial piece \nof legislation--the Amtrak reauthorization bill. This maneuver was \nobviously done so that the Amtrak reauthorization bill would pass. \nUnfortunately, the Amtrak reauthorization bill is riddled with bad \npolicy. Since its inception in 1971, Amtrak has required over $30 \nbillion in taxpayer subsidies. According to the Congressional Research \nService, Amtrak runs over a billion dollar deficit each year, and \nrequires Federal assistance to cover operating losses and capital \ninvestment. Without a yearly Federal grant to cover operating losses, \nAmtrak would not survive as currently configured. This bill extends \nAmtrak's dependency on the Federal Government by authorizing $13.1 \nbillion for Amtrak through fiscal year 2013, more than double the \namount authorized in the previous Amtrak bill that expired in 2002. \nRather than keep Amtrak dependent on taxpayer support, I believe the \nrail carrier should modify its financial strategy to become self-\nsufficient and profitable.\n  This bill also includes five new provisions that expand the Davis-\nBacon Act requirements. These provisions would force Amtrak to ensure \nthat laborers and mechanics employed by contractors and subcontractors \nin construction work financed under this bill are paid wages no less \nthan the prevailing wages on similar construction projects. The Davis-\nBacon requirement seems harmless enough, but in practice, forcing \ncontractors to pay their laborers a wage standard, which many argue is \nset on a flawed wage determination, only raises construction costs for \nthat locality. Why would American taxpayers want to set a floor on the \ncost of construction if it can be done more efficiently and \ninexpensively? Again, this is just bad policy.\n  It is with regret that I will be forced to register a ``no'' vote on \nthis bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I regrettably do not support H.R. 2095. The \nbill we have before us packages together three bills into one vote with \nno amendments dealing with Rail Safety, Amtrak, and capital and \npreventive maintenance grants for the Washington Metropolitan Area \nTransit Authority, WMATA.\n  The Rail Safety provisions of the package by themselves would have \nhad my support. I fully support efforts to address hours of service \nrequirements for train operators and positive train control for our \nfreight and passenger railroads. However, I remain concerned about both \nAmtrak provisions and the WMATA portion of the full package that we are \nvoting on tonight. The majority leader has filled the amendment tree so \nthat no amendments can be offered on this package, and we are faced \nwith an up or down vote on some very key funding areas under the \njurisdiction of Transportation Appropriations.\n  This extra spending will place a strain in excess of what our current \nbudget allows. I understand the need to have passenger rail service as \nan alternative mode of transportation. However, I feel strongly that \nAmtrak should undertake the reforms necessary to be worthy of taxpayer \ndollars by tying funding to certain expectations and benchmarks.\n  As the Appropriations Subcommittee ranking member for the \nTransportation and Housing and Urban Development, THUD, I am not given \nenough of an allocation to meet all of our funding needs. This \nauthorization package provides levels of appropriations that can\n\n[[Page S10290]]\n\nnot be realized, including both Amtrak and WMATA, and will further \nstrain our subcommittee funding decisions.\n  Regrettably, the Amtrak provision in this bill offers none of the key \nreforms in Amtrak's governance or operations that link resource \nallocation to consumer demand. With no reforms and an authorization \nlevel of $13.3 billion over the next 5 years, I find it hard to support \nthese levels when the money will not be there.\n  With regard to funding for WMATA, the bill includes an authorization \nlevel of $1.5 billion over 10 years for capital and maintenance \nprojects. These grants would be over and above the grants for which \nWMATA is otherwise eligible. The authorized grants would not be \navailable to any other jurisdiction. Although WMATA should be \nencouraged to make necessary reforms in its governance and financing, \nsuch encouragement should not require the creation of an entirely new \nFederal funding program which excludes other jurisdictions which have \nlong since taken such prudent steps to upgrade and maintain their \nexisting capital.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I fully support passage of H.R. 2095, a \nbill that will help move America's railroads into the 21st century. The \nreauthorizations of the Federal rail safety programs and Amtrak are \nlong overdue and this bill will give direction to Amtrak and the \nFederal Railroad Administration, FRA, to help them both better \naccomplish their missions. Given the higher price of oil, continuing \nclimate change concerns, and our challenging economic times, it is more \nimportant than ever that we ensure that our Nation's passenger and \nfreight rail systems are adequately prepared to safely accommodate our \ntransportation needs.\n  Safety is a key element if we are to continue to expand our Nation's \nuse of trains. H.R. 2095 will improve railroad safety and provide the \nresources we need to develop our rail network into the first-class \nsystem our Nation deserves. Key improvements include reforming the \nhours of service requirements for train and signal workers, requiring \nrisk-based safety programs for large railroad companies, mandating the \ninstallation of positive train control systems and other safety \ntechnology, and encouraging and funding grade crossing and pedestrian \nsafety and trespasser prevention programs.\n  This bill will also encourage the further development of passenger \nrail corridors, provide incentives for Amtrak to operate more \nefficiently, and strengthen the relationship between Amtrak and the \nStates in which it operates. These improvements will help Amtrak \nfurther increase its ridership, which has reached record levels this \nyear and last, and will allow Amtrak to better serve its customers. I \nbelieve this bill will further fortify Amtrak as an important, \nnecessary, and viable option in our nation's transportation landscape.\n  I congratulate Senator Lautenberg for crafting his railroad safety \nand Amtrak bills, working hard to move them through the Senate, and \ndeveloping this bipartisan compromise with the House. I call on my \ncolleagues in the Senate to pass H.R. 2095 as soon as possible and send \nit to the President for his signature.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to express my \ngratitude to Chairman Inouye and Senator Lautenberg for their support \nand efforts in working to pass this important piece of rail safety \nlegislation, the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act.\n  As many of my colleagues know, southern California and the community \nof Chatsworth suffered the worst train collision in California's modern \nhistory last month when a Union Pacific freight train and a Metrolink \ncommuter train collided head on during rush hour.\n  This tragedy claimed 25 lives, and injured 135 people, many of whom \nhave sustained lifelong injuries.\n  Last month's deadly Metrolink accident made clear the urgent need to \nfix our rail system and ensure the safety of passengers.\n  While Senator Feinstein and I will continue to push for the rapid \ndeployment of positive train control technology, this legislation \nincludes important safety provisions that will immediately help improve \nrail safety and help prevent accidents.\n  I am pleased this legislation included grant funding for positive \ntrain control systems, anti-fatigue measures for train crews, increased \npenalties for violators, and grant funding for grade crossings.\n  In addition to these safety measures, this bill also provides much \nneeded funding for Amtrak and authorizes more than $1.5 billion in \ngrants to States to fund the construction of high-speed rail projects \nin designated corridors, including a California corridor.\n  This is an important piece of legislation and I thank my colleagues \nfor their support. I urge the President to take action immediately to \nsign this bill into law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the amendment I and Senator Bingaman have \noffered is to the India nuclear agreement. We both feel it is a flawed \nagreement that would result in the production of additional nuclear \nweapons on this planet, exactly the last thing we need. But I \nunderstand--and I think Senator Bingaman understands--that this Senate \nwill likely approve this agreement by a wide margin this evening.\n  Our amendment is relatively simple. It says that if India tests \nnuclear weapons, this agreement is nullified and we work to try to shut \noff supplies from the other supplier groups. The last thing we ought to \nallow is to have India begin testing nuclear weapons without \nconsequence to the agreement that has been negotiated with India. Once \nagain, let me point out that this agreement, I believe, will result in \nthe production of additional nuclear weapons on this planet--the last \nthing we need.\n  Our amendment is a very important amendment dealing with the \nprohibition of nuclear testing, and we hope our colleagues will be \nsupportive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank Senator \nRichard Lugar and Senator Joseph Biden. Joe Biden is the chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee and he and Senator Lugar have worked on \nthis for a long time. We have had five congressional hearings on that \ncommittee on the subject matter.\n  I greatly respect my colleagues, Senator Dorgan and Senator Bingaman. \nHowever, I would point out to my colleagues that on this particular \namendment they offer, the Atomic Energy Act, the Arms Support Control \nAct, the Hyde amendment, and this bill all have provisions in them that \nwould allow us to respond should India decide to detonate a nuclear \nweapon.\n  No one anywhere wants to see a further proliferation of nuclear \nweapons. India and the United States are the two largest democracies in \nthe world. India is in a very tough and fragile neighborhood. It is \nimportant we develop and improve that relationship that has been a \ntense one since 1974.\n  This agreement began with the work of President Clinton and was \nconcluded by President Bush. We think it is an agreement worth \nsupporting, and we urge our colleagues to do so and respectfully reject \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5683) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nequally divided prior to a vote on passage of the bill.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask all Senators to participate in a \nhistoric moment. This is an opportunity for the United States and India \nto come together in a way that historically is important for the world.\n  India is a very important country for us, and this relationship is \nsealed in a very significant way by this agreement. We have tested it \nin the Foreign Relations Committee for 3 years, back and forth on the \nnonproliferation qualities. We had great testimony from our Secretary \nof State, strong advocacy from our President.\n  We ask Senators to vote on this historic moment for a partnership \nthat will be enduring, in my judgment, and will make a big difference \nin the history of the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have spoken. This is a very worthwhile \nbill. I commend Senator Lugar and Senator Biden for the tremendous work \nthey have done on this legislation over an extended period of time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays and urge the adoption of the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to the Sanders amendment No. 5687.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this bailout, caused by Wall Street's \ngreed and irresponsibility, may cost as much as $700 billion. The \nsimple question is: Who is going to be paying for it?\n  Today, in America, the top 1 percent earn more income than the bottom \n50 percent. The top 1 percent have more wealth than the bottom 90 \npercent. Since President Bush has been in office, the middle class has \nseen a significant decline in their standard of living while the top \n400 individuals have seen a $670 billion increase in their wealth.\n  What this amendment does is impose a 10-percent surtax on a household \nthat makes $1 million a year, which raises over $300 billion in 5 \nyears. Under this amendment, the bottom 99.7 percent of Americans will \nnot pay 1 penny for this bailout.\n  The middle class has had nothing to do with causing this crisis. They \nshould not have to pay for it, and I ask for a ``yes'' vote on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this agreement was reached after \nconsiderable effort and negotiation by a lot of different parties--\nSenate Democrats and Senate Republicans; House Democrats and House \nRepublicans. It is a good agreement. It is basically an agreement \nwhich, hopefully, will cost the taxpayers virtually no money. It \nprotects the taxpayers, it protects mortgagees, it is directed at \nmaking sure there are no golden parachutes or undue benefits to the \npeople who run these companies, and it has aggressive regulation.\n  It is a balanced approach which was reached through a lot of effort, \nand it is absolutely necessary that we pass it now in order to help \nMain Street, which is about to be crushed by the\n\n[[Page S10292]]\n\npresent economic downturn driven by the lack of credit.\n  Unfortunately, the Senator from Vermont is introducing a brand-new \nidea into this effort. It is an idea which is extremely controversial. \nBeing from New Hampshire, we are not in favor of any taxes, so from my \nstandpoint, this would be a major mistake and undo an agreement which \nis very bold and aggressive in its attempt to help Main Street America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5687) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                        Tribute to David Tinsley\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is the waning days of this Congress--the \nwaning hours--and we depend so much on our staffs, our individual, \npersonal staffs and the people who are in the Senate. I am going to \ndirect some attention to David Tinsley, whom all of us know, the \ngentleman with glasses up here and who is here all the time. But in \nspeaking about him, I am speaking about all these people who work these \nunbelievable hours. After we leave, they are still here. Before we get \nhere, they are here. They make this place operate. We are the greatest \nlegislative body in the history of the world, but it is not because of \nindividual Senators, in my opinion. It is because of the support staff, \nsuch as David Tinsley.\n  David is going to leave the Senate after 31 years of service. He will \nretire within a couple months. He is a native of the Commonwealth of \nVirginia. He earned his undergraduate degree at Virginia Tech and \ncompleted his graduate studies at the University of Maryland. He came \nto the Office of the Secretary of the Senate in 1977, first, as a staff \nand reference assistant, and 4 years later, because of who he is and \nthe tremendously nice person he is and his talent, generally, he was \npromoted to the job of assistant executive clerk.\n  In 1987, David started his floor work as assistant journal clerk. \nThis doesn't mean much to most people, but it is one of the most \nimportant jobs we have here. From there, he moved to the other side of \nthe desk as assistant legislative clerk, and in February of 1999, \nearned the role of legislative clerk, which is where he now sits.\n  What many of those who watch our proceedings on television or read \nabout them in the newspaper may not see the tremendous amount of \ndedicated work that happens largely, as I have said, behind the scenes. \nFor 31 years, David has been a critical part of everything we have been \nable to do in the Senate. David is part of our Senate family and has \nbeen for 31 years, and I have witnessed, especially in the last few \nyears, with the job I have had, the good times in his life and the bad \ntimes. And unfortunately, he has had some very difficult times \npersonally.\n  He is a wonderful human being, a caring person. His wife Jane, and \nthe children, Joe, Dan, and Katie, are treasured members of our Senate \nfamily because it is an extended family.\n  So, David Tinsley, on behalf of all the Senators who are here \ntonight, who have been here during your tenure these 31 years, I send \nto you a very belated but heartfelt thanks for all you have done for us \nas Senators.\n  (Applause.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. After that well-deserved applause you have received, \nDave, from everyone in the Senate, I think it is appropriate to note \nthat given the fact that Dave is quite visible on C-SPAN, his face \nrecognition is probably a good deal greater in America than many of us. \nNot that they know your name, Dave, but they do know your face.\n  I wished to join my good friend, the majority leader, in thanking you \nfor your 31 years of service. We deeply appreciate your fine work, and \nwe wish you well in your retirement. Thank you so much.\n  (Applause.)\n\n\n                        Dodd Amendment No. 5685\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto the vote on the Dodd amendment, No. 5685.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as soon as we hear from the 2 minutes and 2 \nminutes, Senator McConnell is going to speak using leader time, and I \nwill follow that, and then following my remarks, we will vote.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to take a minute and highlight \na critically important component of the amendment I am offering today. \nAnd that is the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity \nand Addiction Equity Act of 2008.\n  The vehicle being used for my amendment, H.R. 1424, is a stand-alone \nmental health parity bill that the House passed last March before \nmonths' long negotiations between the House and Senate on a compromise \nmental health parity bill.\n  But the actual mental health parity language in my amendment is \nidentical, word-for-word, to the language the Senate passed last week \nas part of the tax extenders package. The substance of the language is \nthe language that was agreed upon between the Senate and the House last \nsummer.\n  The Senate passed the tax extender package including the mental \nhealth parity language in my amendment by a vote of 93 to 2.\n  Last week I spoke at length about the many individuals and \norganizations who are responsible for championing mental health parity \nlegislation and I won't go through them all again on the floor today.\n  But I will, once again, thank and congratulate Senators Kennedy and \nDomenici as well as the late Senator Paul Wellstone for their \nleadership on mental health parity. In the other body, Representatives \nPatrick Kennedy and Jim Ramstad should be extremely proud of their \nefforts which have helped get us where we are today.\n  It has taken us more than 10 years, but today we stand at the \nprecipice of hopefully passing one of the most important health care \ninitiatives of the 110th Congress.\n  In fact, if my amendment passes, it will mark the third time the \nSenate has passed mental health parity legislation in this Congress \nalone. The first time it passed unanimously and the second time it \npassed overwhelmingly, as I previously mentioned, by a vote of 93 to 2\n  We have come too far and worked too hard not to have mental health \nparity legislation signed into law this year.\n  Today, one in five American families are affected by mental illness. \nEvery American knows a friend, a relative, a neighbor, or a coworker \nwhose life has been touched by mental illness in some way.\n  With this legislation, we are saying that mental illness will no \nlonger take a backseat to physical illness. With this legislation, we \nare taking an important step toward tearing down the stigma people with \nmental illness face every day.\n  The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and \nAddiction Equity Act will end health insurance discrimination between \nmental health and substance use disorders and medical and surgical \nconditions. Upon passage of this bill, health insurers will no longer \nbe permitted to charge higher copays or limit the frequency of \ntreatment for people with mental illness than what they would do for a \nmedical or surgical condition.\n  I join with the more than 250 national organizations representing \nconsumers, family members, advocates, professionals and providers who \nare urging the Senate and the House to put aside their differences and \npass this legislation before the end of the year.\n  I thank my colleagues and urge them to support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the C-SPAN viewers of America rarely \nhave seen the Senate in applause such as they saw it a few minutes ago, \nbut also it illustrates how well we have worked together on a \nbipartisan basis to try to address the significant crisis confronting \nour country's financial system.\n  We have seen, over the last 2 weeks, a coming together. Both of the \ncandidates for President of the United States are here tonight. We had \nunprecedented cooperation between the majority leader and the \nRepublican leader and our designees, Senator Gregg and Senator Dodd, \nwho did a superb job bringing both sides together to craft a package we \ncould proudly pass\n\n[[Page S10293]]\n\ntonight for the American people on a bipartisan basis.\n  This is a big moment in the Senate. This is the kind of vote we were \nsent by our people to cast, and I wish to express my pride and my \ngratitude to Members, my pride in the institution, and my gratitude for \nMembers who wrestled with this very difficult challenge and who have \nhelped us come together with a package we believe will address the Main \nStreet problems facing America as a result of the credit crunch.\n  Right in the middle of the heat of a Presidential election, we have \nbeen able to put that aside and come together and do something \nimportant for our country. I think it is one of the finest moments in \nthe history of the Senate. I congratulate all Members of the Senate for \nparticipating in this, and I obviously urge that it be supported.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, similar to all Senators, my office has been \nflooded in recent days with calls and letters from constituents who are \ndeeply and rightfully concerned with the state of our economy and the \nsecurity of their savings. Here is one such letter I received from a \nman in Henderson, NV, the second largest city in the State of Nevada. \nHe wrote:\n\n       I am a homeowner and have a wife and two kids. I have been \n     employed in Nevada for 5-plus years as a salesman in the \n     southern Nevada area. This area has been hit like no other, \n     it seems. My salary has dropped nearly 35 percent and does \n     not look good for the next couple of years. My family and I \n     are fighting to stay afloat in this cutthroat market. We have \n     done and redone our budget and seem to have made additional \n     cuts every month just to keep up with my declining income.\n       Please keep everybody in mind when passing a bailout bill \n     for Wall Street. My home is down more than $100,000 from the \n     time I purchased it in August 2006. I am fighting to stay \n     current. I don't want to see the big corporations take the \n     bailout and move on with the middle class left to fight for \n     themselves. We need a real solution that is in the American \n     citizens' interests and not straight out of the pockets of \n     Wall Street.\n       Thanks, and my family and I look forward to seeing an end \n     to this economic tragedy here in Las Vegas and the United \n     States.\n\n  The rescue package we are on the verge of passing is not for the \ntitans of Wall Street. It is not for those whose greed got us here, who \nchose this greed over prudence. It is not for the CEOs who failed their \nemployees, then left town with multimillion-dollar golden parachutes. \nThis plan is for the man from Henderson whose letter I read. It is for \nfamilies in Las Vegas, Reno, Winnemucca, and Sparks, not statistics but \nreal people with problems they did not cause and cannot solve \nthemselves. It is for families across Nevada and across America who are \nstruggling every day to keep their jobs, their homes, and find a way to \nmake one paycheck last until another one.\n  Some Members in both Chambers of Congress ask how they can explain a \nvote in favor of this legislation to their constituents. Here is how: \nnot with any sense of glee or satisfaction but with a sense of \nconfidence that when called upon to choose between what is easy and \nwhat is right, we rejected the easy and chose the right.\n  There is not a Member of Congress who wouldn't rather use this money \nto reduce our record debt, to invest in roads, schools, hospitals, \nbridges, health care, education, or to provide our troops and veterans \nwith the care they deserve. But given this situation, supporting this \nlegislation is the only way to make the best of a crisis and return our \ncountry to a path of economic stability, prosperity, and growth.\n  If we do not act responsibly tonight, we risk the crisis in which \nsenior citizens across America will lose their retirement savings, \nsmall businesses won't make payroll, students won't be able to obtain \nloans to go to college, and families won't be able to obtain mortgages \nfor their homes or loans for their cars.\n  In the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson:\n\n       Thought is the blossom; language the bud; action the fruit \n     behind it.\n\n  My friends, it is time for action.\n  Last week, President Bush and Secretary Paulson sent to Congress a \nproposal that the Democrats and Republicans agreed was not the answer. \nWe proceeded to put politics aside and, after long hours and sleepless \nnights, have come to a solution that the White House, the Treasury \nDepartment, and the leaders from both parties on Capitol Hill all \nbelieve will resolve this crisis by protecting taxpayers first.\n  On a bipartisan basis, we added oversight to safeguard any public \nfunds spent. On a bipartisan basis, we stopped CEOs from receiving \ngolden parachutes at our expense, taxpayers' expense. On a bipartisan \nbasis, we made sure this taxpayer money would be an investment, not a \ngiveaway, and that any future returns would go not to the corporations \nbut to the taxpayers. On a bipartisan basis, we ensured that homeowners \nfacing foreclosure would receive much needed help. And on a bipartisan \nbasis, we added a provision to increase Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation insurance for bank deposits from $100,000 to $250,000 to \nrenew the American people's confidence that the money they put in local \nbanks will be protected.\n  In addition to these critical improvements, Democrats and Republicans \non a bipartisan basis decided to include other important components \nthat will lower taxes and create jobs. By fixing the alternative \nminimum tax, this legislation will save the middle class $60 billion in \ntheir taxes. That is what we are going to do tonight.\n  With new incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are \ndeveloping and producing clean, homegrown alternative energy from the \nSun, the wind, the Earth--geothermal--we will create hundreds of \nthousands of new jobs. With tax breaks for small businesses and big \nbusinesses, we will encourage new investment in growth and new jobs.\n  In this bill is something called payment in lieu of taxes. The State \nof Nevada is 87 percent owned by the Federal Government. You can't fly \nover 40 percent of the State of Nevada; it is restricted military \nairspace. States that have Federal land, such as the State of Nevada--\nno State has it like the State of Nevada--but States that have large \nFederal landholdings were told long ago that because the tax base was \nrestricted because of these Federal land holdings, the Congress would \nprovide money for these States to make up for the tax losses because of \nthe Federal landholdings. That is what payment in lieu of taxes is all \nabout. It has been in existence for decades, but we have never gotten \nthe amount of money we should. This bill does it. For every State west \nof the Mississippi, this is big time stuff. This will allow especially \nrural America and the West to be able to take care of their schools, to \ndo things that are so important.\n  There are so many good things in this bill. I was speaking earlier to \nthe Senator from Texas. Texas does not have an income tax, but they \nhave a large sales tax. This legislation will allow people in Texas and \nNevada and other places who pay sales tax but no income tax to get the \nsame benefit from States that have an income tax.\n  This is a fine piece of legislation, and we are finally on the verge \nof passing a bill that Senators Kennedy and Domenici and the late \nSenator Wellstone worked on for a long time to ensure those who suffer \nfrom mental illness have access to health care equal to those who \nsuffer from physical illness. It would be a fitting tribute to Senator \nPete Domenici if we are able to pass this legislation into law in honor \nof his 3\\1/2\\ decades of Senate service. That would be important, that \nwe do that.\n  We, the Senate--each Senator--are facing this evening a critical test \nof leadership. So I ask all my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, \nto send a clear and resounding message to America--to the homeowners, \nlaborers, middle-class families, students, senior citizens who are \nstruggling and really suffering--a clear, resounding message that we \nhear them and that help is on the way.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator McConnell, I would appreciate it if \nSenators would vote from their chairs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators will vote from their chairs.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n\n[[Page S10294]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 74, nays 25, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 212 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--74\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n\n                                NAYS--25\n\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Cantwell\n     Cochran\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Landrieu\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Roberts\n     Sanders\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kennedy\n       \n  The amendment (No. 5685) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is my \nunderstanding that there is a request for a rollcall vote. If that is, \nin fact, the case, we will do that. But people need not sit at their \nchairs because people, after they vote, can depart the Chamber.\n  We will be in session tomorrow. There will be minor business \ntransacted. We will be in morning business. We will try to clear some \nbills if we can. We will see Friday--we will see what the House does. \nThey are coming back in session tomorrow. So we are going to have to be \nin session until a decision is made when the House can take up the \nlegislation.\n  Everyone should understand, the week of November 17 we are going to \nhave an organizational meeting. We will be in session several days \nduring that period of time. We will tell everyone all about this. One \nthing we are going to move to is a land package. We have talked to \neverybody about this. It is something that Senator Bingaman and Senator \nSalazar have talked to many of you about.\n  But to see what business will be conducted, we will wait and see \nwhat, if anything, the House does. If they do not do anything, we \ncannot do anything. So we will see what they do. So Members should keep \nthat time open.\n  Senator McConnell said, and I want to parrot what he said, I so \nappreciate the cooperation we have had from everybody these past \nseveral weeks. This has been a very difficult time for our country, a \ndifficult time for those of us who are elected to office. But I am very \nhappy with this vote tonight. I think it shows that when we work \ntogether, we can accomplish good things. I think it speaks volumes.\n  Both of our Presidential candidates are here and voting and both \nsupporting this legislation. So I say to everyone, thank you very much. \nThis is a good vote we send to the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think the majority leader has made it clear that we \nwill be back for a few days in November. I wish everybody well during \nthis recess. This is a fine accomplishment for the Senate.

Pursuant to the previous order, the bill \nhaving attained 60 votes in the affirmative, the bill, as amended, is \npassed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to briefly discuss the economic \nstabilization bill which the Senate passed and is sending to the \nPresident.\n  This economic crisis has been building over the past decade, fueled \nby risky investments, deregulation, and human nature. It is hard to \npinpoint the exact reason for our current financial situation; instead \nit is a tangled mess involving large investment banks and individual \nhomeowners. Homebuyers over extended themselves, mortgage lenders \noffered more complicated and exotic loans and the government sponsored \nenterprises and investment firms purchased bundled mortgages without \nfully understanding the value of what they were purchasing.\n  Homeowners are losing their homes, communities are losing tax revenue \nas foreclosures rise, banks are rapidly losing money, and our credit \nmarkets are freezing up. Wall Street and Main Street have been tied \ntogether, and the Federal Government is being forced to intervene to \nhelp our economy and communities get back on track.\n  The provisions of this bailout are intended to restore liquidity and \nconfidence in our financial markets, provide relief for troubled \nhomeowners, hold Wall Street executives accountable, and ensure that \ntaxpayer dollars are being protected. The legislation creates the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program in the Treasury Department, which will \nallow the government to purchase impaired assets from financial \ninstitutions, restructure or modify, then resell for a profit. The \nTreasury Department is authorized to use $250 billion immediately and \nupon written request from the President, can use up to $700 billion to \nmaintain TARP.\n  One significant improvement from the administration's original plan \nis the creation of an oversight board over the newly created program. \nThe board will make recommendations to the\n\n[[Page S10295]]\n\nTreasury Department and also hold the Department to the principals and \nguidelines laid out in the bill. Additionally, the Federal Government \nis enabled to acquire stocks in the financial institutions which \nparticipate in the program, allowing the government to recoup some of \nthe lost money and benefit from any future profits from the \ninstitution.\n  One particular area of concern I have, and I share with many of my \ncolleagues, is how Wall Street executives acted irresponsibly and \nallowed greed to control the management of their companies. In most \ncompanies, managers and executives are held accountable for its \nperformance; however, on Wall Street, management, was given large \nbonuses and compensation, as their companies lost money or even failed. \nThose same executives who put our entire economic stability at risk, \nwho have asked us for help, complained when Congress decided they \nneeded to be held accountable for their actions. I am pleased to say \nthat Congress ignored their objections and included limitations on \nexecutive compensation for those firms which sell their troubled assets \nto the Federal Government. However, I would still like those who have \nbeen most involved in this crisis on Wall Street explain to the public \nwhat role they played in this mess.\n  This is not an easy vote for any legislator. There are provisions in \nthe bill which I believe could have been written stronger and some \nother ideas which should have been included. I believe that we should \nhave included additional financial regulations to restore the public's \nconfidence in Wall Street and make sure this never happens again. I am \nalso disappointed that this bill does not address the root of the \ncrisis and do more to directly help homeowners facing foreclosure. This \nbill also puts too much power in the hands of one man the Secretary of \nTreasury. Nevertheless, we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the \ngood. Given the urgency and magnitude of this matter, I voted in favor \nof the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the title \namendment, which is at the desk, be considered and agreed to, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5686) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n               (Purpose: To amend the title of the bill)\n\n       Amend the title so as to read:\n       ``To provide authority for the Federal Government to \n     purchase and insure certain types of troubled assets for the \n     purposes of providing stability to and preventing disruption \n     in the economy and financial system and protecting taxpayers, \n     to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \n     incentives for energy production and conservation, to extend \n     certain expiring provisions, to provide individual income tax \n     relief, and for other purposes''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10295-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to pay \ntribute to Pete Domenici, one of the finest Senators I have known and \none who represents the Senate at its best. Senator Domenici is someone \nwhom I respect greatly and whose counsel I have very much appreciated \nover the years. I will miss him very much when he retires at the end of \nthis session.\n  Senator Domenici and I share many interests, but one above all is our \ndeep and abiding interest in the fiscal affairs of our Nation. In the \nworld of budgeting, Senator Domenici is a giant. He is, of course, one \nof the pioneers on the Budget Committee. He joined the committee in \n1975, literally a few months after it was created in July 1974. So he \nwas there at the beginning, helping to shape and guide this new \ncommittee.\n  He rose to become chairman in 1981, and he served in that capacity \nthrough 1987 and then again between 1995 and 2001. In 2001, we faced \nthe unique circumstance in a closely divided Senate, as he and I traded \noff being chairman and ranking member in that year. In total, Senator \nDomenici has served 34 years on the committee, 12 years as chairman and \n10 years as ranking member--the most distinguished record of any \nMember.\n  His impact on the Federal budget and the budget process has been \nunprecedented. He authored many of the Senate's budget rules that we \nuse today to protect taxpayers. He also helped author major deficit-\nreduction plans during the 1980s and 1990s, as well as the Federal \nCredit Reform Act of 1990 and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.\n  But Senator Domenici will be remembered for more than his service on \nthe Budget Committee. He has been a strong and important voice on the \nneed to diversify our Nation's energy sources. As chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, he helped enact the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005. He has been a passionate advocate on the issue of \nmental health and has been a leader in pushing for mental health parity \nlegislation. Senator Domenici was also one of the architects of the \nHuman Genome Project, which I believe people will look back on as one \nof the greatest accomplishments of all time.\n  And, of course, Senator Domenici has been a tireless advocate on \nbehalf of the citizens of the beautiful State of New Mexico. Born in \nAlbuquerque, he is that State's longest serving Senator. As a young \nman, Pete Domenici had many options. At one time, he pitched for the \nAlbuquerque Dukes, a farm team for the Brooklyn Dodgers, and may have \nhad aspirations of going to the major leagues. But I am sure that the \ncitizens of New Mexico--and, indeed, all of us--are happy that he chose \nthe path of public service.\n  Let me conclude by saying, and I know that I speak for all of my \ncolleagues, how much we respect, admire, and appreciate his service. \nFor me personally, it has been an absolute honor to serve along with \nhim on the Budget Committee. He has made an extraordinary contribution \nto the work of the Budget Committee, to the Congress, and to the \ncountry. We will miss him greatly.\n\n\n                              JOHN WARNER\n\n  Mr. President, it is with real sadness that I bid farewell to one of \nthe most distinguished public servants I have known. Over the 22 years \nI have spent in the Senate, I have respected and admired the work of \nthe senior Senator from Virginia, John Warner.\n  As a veteran of two wars and an unfailingly gracious man, he \nunderstands the needs of our men and women in uniform and has worked \ndiligently to meet them. During his 6 years as the chairman of the \nArmed Services committee, he was always helpful in my efforts to \nimprove the quality of life for those serving at military installations \nin my State of North Dakota. I thank him for that.\n  In the five decades since Arthur Vandenberg reminded us that partisan \npolitics should stop at the water's edge, it has not always been \npossible to live up to that ideal. In a day when there are huge \ndisagreements about the best course for our Nation, we cannot always \npresent a unified face to the rest of the world. But perhaps more than \nanyone else in the Senate today, John Warner has epitomized that ideal. \nHis partnership with the Senator from Michigan, Carl Levin, in their \nleadership of the Armed Services Committee has been an example to all \nof us.\n  John has been a tremendous leader in the Senate on military affairs, \nbut I have also been proud to work with him on a number of bipartisan \ninitiatives. On big issues, Senator Warner always puts country before \nparty or ideology. Most recently, he has been a valued member of our \ngang of 20 working on a bipartisan, new era energy bill. I regret that \nwe will not be able to finish it before he leaves the Senate, but we \nare proud to count him as part of our current group.\n  After 30 years in the Senate, 2 years as Secretary of the Navy, and \nhonorable wartime service in both the Navy and Marine Corps, our Nation \nowes a big debt of gratitude to John Warner. He has my great respect \nand my thanks.\n\n\n                              CHUCK HAGEL\n\n  Mr. President, as this Congress comes to a close we bid a fond \nfarewell to our colleague Chuck Hagel.\n\n[[Page S10296]]\n\nAs a Member of this body, Chuck is completing 12 years of outstanding \nservice to the people of Nebraska and to the country. But I expect that \nhe will find new ways to contribute to the mission we all share: making \nthe United States stronger, safer, and more prosperous.\n  Chuck's first legislative service was as a U.S. Senator. I like to \nthink that those of us who were not seasoned legislators when we \narrived here draw on a diverse set of experiences as we find our way to \nbecome effective lawmakers. Chuck Hagel's background was probably more \nvaried than most--decorated war veteran, businessman, broadcaster, and \ndeputy administrator of the Veterans' Administration, just to mention a \nfew of the areas in which he has distinguished himself. His successes \nin these many disciplines undoubtedly helped him develop the \nindependent voice that we grew accustomed to hearing over his dozen \nyears in our midst.\n  For several years, we served together on the Budget Committee, a \nlegislative environment in which bipartisanship isn't always easy. \nChuck was always forthright and honest in our sometimes contentious \ndeliberations and was never afraid to go where the facts led him--even \nif it meant irritating a colleague on his own side of the aisle.\n  We will miss him as a friend and as a fellow Senator, but I expect \nthe Nation will hear from Chuck Hagel again. We wish him the best as he \nlooks for new challenges.\n\n\n                              Wayne Allard\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague Senator \nWayne Allard. Senator Allard is retiring to honor a commitment he made \nto the people of the State of Colorado to serve only two terms. I have \ncome to know Senator Allard best as a fellow member of the Budget \nCommittee. Even though we often disagreed, I always found him to be a \ntrue gentleman.\n  Born and raised in Colorado, Senator Allard has always been true to \nhis roots and has fought to represent the best interests of his State. \nHis entry into public service came in 1982 when he was elected to the \nColorado State senate. While serving in the state legislature, he \nmaintained a successful veterinary practice he built with his wife \nJoan.\n  Senator Allard's public service has spanned more than two decades. \nAfter serving in the State legislature, he was elected to the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives and subsequently the U.S. Senate. During his \ntime in the Senate, there are accomplishments that stand out. He \nspearheaded legislation creating the country's 56th national park, the \nGreat Sand Dunes National Park. He also took on the extraordinary task \nof overseeing the Capitol Visitors Center as chair of the Legislative \nBranch Appropriations Subcommittee. Finally, he has been a steward of \nthe taxpayer and has led by example, returning unspent funds from his \noffice account to the U.S. Treasury.\n  I wish Senator Allard and his family many happy years ahead and thank \nhim for his years of public service.\n\n\n                              Wayne Allard\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. Presdient, President Ronald Reagan once said,''Let us \nbe sure that those who come after will say of us in our time, that in \nour time we did everything that could be done. We finished the race; we \nkept them free; we kept the faith.''\n  There can be no question that Senator Wayne Allard's time in public \noffice will be remembered by these words both here in this Chamber and \nin his State of Colorado. Wayne will end his career in the U.S. Senate \nbecause of a self-imposed term limit. He has never once wavered in his \nbelief that legislators are citizens first and lawmakers second.\n  As one of only two veterinarians in the Senate, I know the void the \nSenate will feel. Leaving a veterinary practice to fight for what is \nright in the U.S. Senate isn't exactly the norm. Wayne and I each made \nthis choice and we have stood shoulder to shoulder in legislating for \nthe humane treatment of animals. The legislation we put forth against \nanimal fighting has become law and has helped law enforcement put away \nindividuals who abuse animals. I am sad to see that our small, very \nsmall, veterinary caucus will leave with Wayne.\n  Wayne's commitment to country and freedom is unshakeable, but his \ndedication to fiscal conservatism has made him a hero for taxpayers \nacross the country, especially in his State of Colorado. Throughout his \ntime here, he has fought to pay down the debt by eliminating programs, \nstaying true to the belief that government should steer clear of a \nwasteful spending black hole.\n  His efforts on the Appropriations Committee have been committed to \nsteering our country toward fiscal responsibility, and his voice will \nbe missed.\n  I hope this Chamber remembers the role Wayne played in fighting \nagainst a bloated Federal Government and giving States the rights they \ndeserve to manage their own affairs. Let's not let his voice for \ngovernment responsibility fall on deaf ears. The burden of the taxpayer \nrests on our shoulders, and that is even more so now with Wayne's \ndeparture.\n  Wayne has been a voice and a crusader for Colorado, preferring the \nscenery there to that of Washington. He has worked hard to ensure that \nhis constituents are as familiar with his face as they are with his \nname. Colorado has greatly benefitted from his leadership, as has this \ncountry.\n  It is with sadness, that I lose my friend here. But I know the impact \nhe has had on this body, his State, and our country. I wish him great \nsuccess in his future endeavors. I know he will continue to be an \nadvocate for life, liberty, and freedom.\n  We will continue to fight for the ideals Wayne came to this body \nhoping to achieve, that ``Government of the people, by the people, for \nthe people, shall not perish from the Earth.''\n\n\n                              JOHN WARNER\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to speak today about my \ngood friend and colleague, John Warner, who it has been an honor to \nserve with in the Senate for almost 25 years.\n  At age 17, John enlisted in the Navy to serve our country during \nWorld War II. After that, he attended Washington and Lee University on \nthe GI bill and went on to study law at the University of Virginia. In \n1950, he interrupted his legal education to deploy to Korea as a \nmarine, eventually attaining the rank of captain before receiving his \nlaw degree in 1953. Sixteen years later, John was appointed Under \nSecretary of the Navy, and in 1972 rose to become Secretary of the \nNavy. In 1978, the people of Virginia elected him their Senator, and he \nhas represented them and the rest of our country with courage and \ndedication for over 30 years.\n  In particular, John has fought relentlessly for our men and women in \nuniform in his leadership role as chairman and ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee. He has always had a special place in his \nheart for our country's veterans. His background as a sailor, marine, \nand Navy Secretary gave him the experience and insight needed to \naddress extraordinarily complicated and wide-ranging issues of vital \nimportance to our country's defense. Today he is recognized by all as \none of our country's foremost experts on national security matters, and \nsomeone whose record of bipartisanship is simply unmatched.\n  That is a legend's biography, and through it courses the public \nvirtues of service, patriotism, grace and high-mindedness in a way few \nhave seen, but I know many will read about.\n  On a personal note, one of my fondest memories of John was of a \ndebate between us that occurred on the Senate floor. It was late one \nnight in June 2006, and I had proposed a resolution setting a deadline \non our combat presence in Iraq that wasn't a popular position at that \ntime. I was clearly outnumbered, and the debate became heated and \npersonal. In fact, my plan received only 13 votes, and Senator Warner \nwasn't one of them.\n  But even in times of disagreement, John had no trouble rising above \npartisan bickering in service of a higher purpose. In the best \ntraditions and practices of the Senate, he rose to speak and engaged me \nin a respectful and substantive dialogue on a controversial issue that \ncalmed the Senate chamber and I hope informed the American public.\n  I want to close by saying that I, the people of Virginia and this \ncountry are grateful for John's distinguished service and will miss him \ndearly. I wish him and his family my very best and look forward to \ncontinuing to receive his wise counsel in the years ahead.\n\n[[Page S10297]]\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  Mr. President, for the past 12 years, I have had the privilege of \nserving in the Senate with my friend Chuck Hagel. Upon his retirement \nfrom the Senate, I wanted to take a moment to tell him how much he will \nbe dearly missed. Chuck Hagel will be missed not just by his colleagues \nin the Senate, but also by those Americans for whom he is dedicated his \ncareer to fight while serving in Washington, DC.\n  Although we sit on opposite sides of the aisle, I have found myself \nstanding with Senator Hagel on numerous occasions. Just in the past \ncouple of years, we have fought for increased pay for our troops, \nestablishing a center dedicated to the rehabilitation, treatment, and \nresearch of servicemembers blinded in combat, and advocating for \nadditional mental health care resources for servicemembers returning \nfrom combat.\n  Because of Senator Hagel's dedication to stand up for those who have \nfought for our country, we have a modernized GI bill. We have a GI bill \nthat more accurately reflects the sacrifices that our men and women in \nuniform are making. A modernized benefits package that will cover the \nmajority of tuition costs for our returning servicemembers, and I was \nproud to stand with him in that effort as well.\n  His service to our country has been truly admirable. Senator Hagel \nhas had a truly remarkable career representing the State of Nebraska. I \nthank him for his service to our country. I wish him the best in his \nfuture endeavors.\n\n\n                              John Warner\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, my friend John Warner, the very \ndistinguished gentleman from Virginia, has decided to retire from the \nSenate after 30 years of exemplary service.\n  John and I were sworn in as Senators on the same day. While our paths \nhad crossed a few times before becoming Members of this body, we became \ngood friends and neighbors as well as competitors on the tennis courts.\n  Before John was elected to the Senate, he had achieved national \nprominence as the Administrator of the American Revolution Bicentennial \nAdministration. He also had served as Secretary of the Navy.\n  As a Senator, John has served prominently as chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee where he worked effectively on shipbuilding issues \nthat were important to both of our States.\n  John Warner has served with great distinction in the Senate. He has \nearned the respect of all Senators because of his stewardship and his \nsense of responsibility for our national security interests, which he \nhas done so much to protect.\n  The Senate, the State of Virginia, and the Nation will greatly miss \nhaving the benefit of John Warner's steady hand at the helm.\n\n\n                              Wayne Allard\n\n  Mr. President, it has been a genuine pleasure to serve in this body \nwith the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Wayne Allard. He has made \nsignificant contributions through his thoughtful and effective \nleadership for the betterment of our country.\n  He has brought to the challenge of public service a seriousness of \npurpose and sense of responsibility to do this job well, not for \npersonal aggrandizement but for the improvement of our national \nsecurity and our Nation's economy.\n  In the process, he has reflected credit on his State of Colorado and \nhis family. His personal qualities of humility and trustworthiness have \naided him as he has worked to contribute to the quality of this \nlegislation we have enacted.\n  Wayne Allard is one of the most respected Members of this body. He is \nalso one of the best like Senators. We are certainly going to miss \nhaving the benefit of his leadership.\n  We wish him well in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10297-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MARTIN AND SEIBERT L.C.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate one of the most upstanding and intellectually accomplished \nlaw firms in the country on its historic 100 years in practice. Yes, \nthis year marks the 100th anniversary of the premier regional law firm \nof Martin and Seibert L.C., which has offices in Martinsburg and \nCharleston, WV, Winchester, VA, and Hagerstown, MD. The firm, founded \nin 1908, offers an extraordinarily high level of professional, \ncompetent, and courteous service. Nestled in the eastern panhandle of \nWest Virginia and surrounding environs, it is respected throughout the \narea. I would like to ask my esteemed colleague, Senator Rockefeller, \nif he shares my appreciation of the unique history and many \naccomplishments of this exemplary firm?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Let me assure the Senator that I am very well aware \nof the numerous and considerable contributions that have been made by \nthe law firm of Martin and Seibert L.C. over the past century. The \ngrandfather of one of the firm's current top partners, Clarence E. \nMartin III, was an American original. The first Clarence E. Martin was \nwhat one might call ``the real deal.'' Not only an astonishing legal \nmind, he was also a pioneer, a leader, and was knighted by two Popes \nfor his service to the church and community, a tradition that has been \ncarried on by subsequent members of the firm. Clarence E. Martin not \nonly founded Martin and Seibert L.C., but was one of only two West \nVirginians, and the only practicing West Virginia lawyer ever, to serve \nas president of the American Bar Association, ABA, from 1932 to 1933.\n  Martin and Seibert L.C. has grown surely and steadily over the past \ncentury. Clarence Martin founded the firm along with Cleveland M. \nSeibert. These two men brought national attention to West Virginia, and \nthe solid foundation they built for Martin & Seibert, L.C. remains \nevident today. The firm constantly strives to provide both the best \npossible service for its clients, and responsible leadership for its \ncommunity.\n  Mr. BYRD. I know that my esteemed colleague, Senator Rockefeller, \njoins me in taking this opportunity to congratulate Martin and Seibert \nL.C. on the 100th anniversary of the establishment of their firm. May \nGod grant them many more years of success and service to the people of \nWest Virginia and surrounding localities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10297-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10297-S10298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      private Jordan P. Thibeault\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to PVT Jordan P. \nThibeault of South Jordan, UT, who recently lost his life in Iraq while \nserving with the 1st Armored Division.\n  I believe it is my solemn duty to learn about the lives of those Utah \nservicemembers who have fallen in the defense of our Nation.\n  Looking back on the 7 years of this conflict, I have always been \nstuck by theses remarkable men and women. Such is the case with PVT \nJordan Thibeault.\n  He is remembered by the Utah community as a young man who grew up \nloving to ride bikes, act in plays, and known as a helpful and hard-\nworking young man.\n  I was struck by the words of his family who released a statement on \ntheir son's passing. So I will take this opportunity to share with the \nSenate the moving words from the Thibeault family:\n\n       Mankind today is faced with terrible calamities. Only a \n     select few are willing to forgo comforts of home, indeed the \n     very promise of a brighter future, to place themselves \n     between the forces of hate and oppression and the human \n     spirit yearning for peace and safety . . . [Jordan \n     Thibeault's] passing should give hope to all that there are \n     still those among us who are willing to give the ultimate \n     sacrifice to keep mankind safe and free.\n\n  Mr. President, no truer words have been spoken on the floor of the \nSenate. Those eloquent words are not only a wonderful tribute but firm \nevidence of the quality of the family that raised such a fine man.\n\n\n                    MAJOR GENERAL RANDALL D. MOSLEY\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nTester, to recognize MG Randall D. Mosley, Adjutant General for the \ngreat state of Montana. MG Randall D. Mosley has served our Nation and \nthe State of Montana for over 38 years and has recently retired. The \nMontana Guard was established in 1889. Since then, few adjutant \ngenerals have faced as many challenges as Major General Mosley. We \nMontanans were so lucky to have such a great citizen soldier at the \nhelm of our National Guard. I want to take a few moments to recount the \ncareer of this great Montanan.\n\n[[Page S10298]]\n\n  General Mosley's career is a model of public service and serves an \nexample for all those in the military. He never backed down to any \nchallenging issue, of which he had many. During his tenure, duty called \nseveral thousand Montana National Guard members to Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The deployments put great strains on the soldiers and \nairmen that answered the call, as well as the families of the soldiers \nthat stayed at home. General Mosley worked tirelessly before, during, \nand after each deployment to support his troops and their families.\n  General Mosley understood that troops returning home from overseas \nneed the support of the whole community. General Mosley worked to \nimprove community awareness of the challenges troops face upon \nreturning from combat. As it became clear that the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan were creating new forms of injuries, he led an overhaul of \nMontana's postdeployment health reassessment program. General Mosley \nput together a task force with community leaders from around the state. \nThe task force developed better ways to care for his troops as they \nreturned home.\n  Thanks to General Mosley's leadership, the Montana National Guard has \none of the best yellow-ribbon programs in the country. It is a model \nfor the rest of the nation to follow. Improved mental health care is \nnow available to Montana's guardsmen and their families. The Guard \noffers training workshops to help troops transition back to everyday \nlife. Montanans are truly grateful to General Mosley for his leadership \non this critical issue.\n  I now yield to my colleague from Montana, Senator Tester.\n  Mr. TESTER. Thank you, Senator Baucus. General Mosley really does \nembody what the National Guard is all about--the citizen soldier. For \n35 years he wore the uniform of his country with great pride and honor. \nBut he also takes tremendous pride in being from the State of Montana.\n  General Mosley's leadership also has been recognized well beyond \nMontana's borders. He worked with United States Central Command for \nover 14 years to develop Montana's partnership with the country of \nKyrgyzstan. The partnership has blossomed. Leaders in Kyrgyzstan have \nlearned many of the skills and knowledge they need to secure their \ncountry's democratic future. General Mosley also worked to help the \nKyrgyzstan military develop a noncommissioned officer cadre. These \nleaders will help Kyrgyzstan train and lead their soldiers now and in \nthe future. Montana's partnership with Kyrgyzstan helped their leaders \nimprove the cooperation between military and civilian authorities. In \nlarge measure because of General Mosley's efforts, Kyrgyzstan's \nmilitary has developed strong ties with our military and has rapidly \nadvanced to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\n  General Mosley's career reminds us all of the value of public \nservice. We Montanans are deeply indebted to him. He is an outstanding \nambassador for the citizens of Montana and the men and women of the \nMontana National Guard. He will be deeply missed, but we wish him well \nin retirement and we thank him for a lifetime of service to our State \nand our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10298-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DEFICIT IMPACTS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have additional information to include \nin the Record that helps illustrate a point I made at the end of my \nspeech yesterday regarding the comparative deficit impacts of the \nMcCain and Obama tax and spending plans.\n  I noted that Senator Obama proposes to increase the national debt by \na staggering $1.31 trillion more than Senator McCain over the next 10 \nyears. This table illustrates that Senator Obama's combined annual tax \nand spending plan increases the deficit more than Senator McCain's on a \ncumulative basis beginning in 2009 and continuing each year thereafter \nover 10 years.\n  Once again, this data raises the question whether Senator Obama is \nserious about reducing our national debt by returning to responsible \nfiscal policies. Senator McCain will need to expand on this point as \nwell.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this table be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           TOTAL DEFICIT IMPACT OF OBAMA AND MCCAIN TAX AND SPENDING PROPOSALS\n                                                                [In billions of dollars]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    2009       2010       2011       2012       2013       2014       2015       2016       2017       2018     2009-18\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nObama Deficit Impact\n    Revenue....................        $10        $84       $230       $309       $333       $352       $372       $394       $418       $445     $2,948\n    Spending...................        293        293        293        293        293        293        293        293        293        293      2,930\n    Additional Revenue Loss....         71         71         71         71         71         71         71         71         71         71        705\n                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total....................        374        448        594        673        696        715        735        758        782        808      6,582\n      Cumulative...............  .........        822      1,415      2,088      2,784      3,499      4,234      4,992      5,774      6,582  .........\nMcCain Deficit Impact\n    Revenue....................        109        152        326        439        452        403        487        547        601        655      4,170\n    Spending...................         92         92         92         92         92         92         92         92         92         92        924\n    Additional Revenue Loss....         15         15         15         15         15         15         15         15         15         15        145\n                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total....................        215        259        433        546        558        510        594        654        708        762      5,240\n      Cumulative...............  .........        475        908      1,454      2,012      2,522      3,116      3,770      4,478      5,240  .........\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                                                                                                                               \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10298-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         ACCESSION OF ALBANIA AND CROATIA TO THE NATO ALLIANCE\n\n  Mr. OBAMA.

JACOBSEN\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to SGT Timothy \nJ. Jacobsen, a soldier from my home State of California who paid the \nultimate price in service to our country in Vietnam.\n  On September 23, 2008--more than 33 years since the end of the \nVietnam war--the Department of Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office \nannounced that the remains of SGT Jacobsen had been identified and \nwould be returned to his family.\n  SGT Jacobsen grew up on a dairy ranch in Ferndale, CA--the fifth of \neight children born to Margie and Kermit Jacobsen. When his father \nstarted his own cattle ranch, SGT Jacobsen spent much of his free time \nworking alongside him. He also started riding bulls at an early age, \nand by the time he was 18, he had become Humboldt County's top-rated \nbull rider.\n  In 1967 SGT Jacobsen's older brother Skip was drafted by the Army and \nsent to Vietnam. Not long after Skip returned, SGT Jacobsen was drafted \nand left his family to serve as a doorgunner in the 101st Airborne \nDivision of the United States Army.\n  On May 16, 1971, SGT Jacobsen was one of four United States soldiers \nand an unknown number of Republic of Vietnam marines aboard a \nhelicopter on a combat assault mission near Hue, South Vietnam. As the \nhelicopter touched down at the landing zone, it\n\n[[Page S10299]]\n\ncame under heavy enemy ground fire. The pilot tried to lift off, but \nthe damaged aircraft struck a tree line and exploded.\n  The remains of the four U.S. soldiers on board were not recovered at \nthat time, and a year later, SGT Jacobsen was declared killed in \naction.\n  In 1994, recovery efforts were renewed when a joint U.S.-Socialist \nRepublic of Vietnam team surveyed the crash site. Unfortunately, \nexcavation of the site in 1995 did not uncover remains of the U.S. \nsoldiers aboard the helicopter. However, in 2006, two re-burial sites \nassociated with the incident were excavated, leading to the recovery of \nSGT Jacobsen's remains.\n  SGT Jacobsen was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart, commemorating \nhis courage and extraordinary sacrifice in service to our country.\n  He will be buried on October 4 in Ferndale, CA. The Army offered SGT \nJacobsen full burial honors in Arlington National Cemetery, but his \nfamily chose his final resting place close to home. Nothing can fully \naccount for the loss suffered by SGT Jacobsen's family, and all those \nwho loved him. But I hope this finally brings a sense of closure and \npeace.\n  As we remember SGT Jacobsen and honor his service to the United \nStates we are also reminded of the nearly 1,800 service members who \nremain unaccounted for from the Vietnam war.\n  Men and women like Timothy J. Jacobsen from towns and cities across \nCalifornia, and across America, went off to fight in Vietnam. Many of \nthem never came back. We will never forget the lives they led and the \nsacrifices they made. And we will never rest in our effort to bring \neach and every American who gave their life home to a Nation that \nhonors their service, and a community that has never forgotten them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10299-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10299-S10300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SECRETARY WAYNE CLOUGH\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on July 1, G. Wayne Clough became the new \nSecretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Last week, the New York Times \nwrote a profile on Dr. Clough that highlights his markedly different \nleadership and style. This style is a welcome one to me.\n  As a member of the Smithsonian Board of Regents, I look forward to \nworking with Secretary Clough on the many challenges that face the \nSmithsonian. So all Senators and their staff can see that he is off to \na solid beginning, I ask unanimous consent that the article in the New \nYork Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the the New York Times, Sept. 15, 2008]\n\n            Smithsonian Chief Hopes To Institute Big Reforms\n\n                          (By Robin Pogrebin)\n\n       It is hard to picture G. Wayne Clough dropping $14,000 of \n     the Smithsonian Institution's money to charter a Learjet, or \n     $724 to put his family up at the Four Seasons for a night. \n     Part of his mandate, after all, is to guard against the \n     abuses that brought the ouster of his high-spending \n     predecessor, Lawrence M. Small.\n       But Dr. Clough, the new secretary of the Smithsonian--its \n     chief executive--is expected to do far more than set a good \n     example. He is charged with nothing less than transforming a \n     162-year-old bear of an institution--with 19 museums and \n     galleries, a zoo, 9 research centers, and an operating budget \n     of $1 billion--into an ethical, tightly run organization. ``I \n     go to work every day a little bit nervous,'' he said in an \n     interview last week in New York.\n       The Smithsonian has been through the wringer over the last \n     two years, with disclosures of improper spending and sharp \n     criticism from Congressional committees about sloppy \n     governance.\n       So after taking over on July 1, Dr. Clough, 66, a widely \n     respected former president of the Georgia Institute of \n     Technology, spent much of his first two months calling on \n     members of Congress. Winning back the good will of lawmakers \n     will be crucial, since the federal government provides 70 \n     percent of the Smithsonian's operating budget.\n       Dr. Clough (pronounced cluff) said he had assured \n     legislators that reforms were already under way to guard \n     against future misconduct.\n       The Smithsonian's museum directors must now have their \n     travel approved by an undersecretary of the institution, Dr. \n     Clough said. Every new executive must undergo a thorough \n     background check, and ethics is a regular topic of discussion \n     among the Smithsonian's management.\n       Dr. Clough's own travel must now be approved by the \n     Smithsonian's chief financial officer. Dr. Clough has also \n     resigned from his salaried positions on three corporate \n     boards. From 2000 to 2006 his predecessor, Mr. Small, spent \n     64 business days serving on corporate boards that paid him a \n     total of $5.7 million.\n       Mr. Small's salary was $916,000 in 2007, but the \n     Smithsonian is paying Dr. Clough $490,000. He pays his own \n     rent on a town house near the fish market in southeast \n     Washington; Mr. Small used a Smithsonian housing allowance \n     for his town house in an affluent neighborhood in northwest \n     Washington. Dr. Clough's home is about a quarter-mile from \n     the Smithsonian museums, so he can walk to work; Mr. Small \n     used a chauffeur.\n       While he is earning less than he did at Georgia Tech, where \n     his salary package was worth $551,186, Dr. Clough said he \n     hadn't looked back. ``This is something I wanted to do,'' he \n     said.\n       He said he was excited by the idea of collaborations \n     between art and science at the Smithsonian, by the depth of \n     expertise to be found at its various museums and research \n     centers and by the Smithsonian's potential to be an education \n     resource for the country.\n       And he seems to be having a good time. He cited some \n     serendipitous encounters, like happening upon a photographer \n     at the National Museum of Natural History who had completed a \n     folio of rare plants with the help of Smithsonian biologists. \n     He observed researchers examining endangered languages at the \n     National Anthropological Archives of the Smithsonian in \n     Suitland, Md. And he watched the wing of a German World War \n     II plane being readied at the Paul E. Garber facility, also \n     in Suitland, for the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy \n     Center near Dulles International Airport, an extension of the \n     National Air and Space Museum.\n       ``I'm thrilled by these little pleasures,'' he said.\n       On his visit to New York, Dr. Clough spent four hours on \n     Thursday at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, another \n     Smithsonian museum, meeting the director, Paul Thompson, and \n     curators; viewing its collections; and talking with the \n     textile artist Sheila Hicks, who happened to be there. \n     ``During all of these discussions, his interest in and \n     knowledge of design was very apparent,'' Mr. Thompson said.\n       It is clear that Dr. Clough will set a different tone. Mr. \n     Small came from the corporate corridors of Fannie Mae, but \n     Dr. Clough has spent his career on college campuses in the \n     unglamorous field of engineering.\n       Born in Douglas, Ga., Dr. Clough exudes a low-key Southern \n     charm. He is plain-spoken, unvarnished and sometimes a little \n     corny.\n       Asked about the tension at the Smithsonian between art and \n     science, he said: ``I love the arts. I love beauty. Every day \n     I try to notice something beautiful. It could be a flower, it \n     could be a painting, it could be a sculpture, it could be a \n     piece of music.''\n       As for setting the Smithsonian back on course, some changes \n     in governance were adopted before he arrived by the board of \n     regents, the organization's governing body, and by Cristian \n     Samper, who was appointed acting secretary after Mr. Small \n     resigned in March 2007. (Mr. Samper has returned to his post \n     as director of the natural history museum.)\n       The board now meets four times a year, not three. The \n     Smithsonian's inspector general, who conducts audits and \n     prevents waste, now reports directly to the board chairman, \n     not the secretary.\n       Dr. Clough said he planned to decentralize the institution, \n     to reduce the number of undersecretaries from four to three \n     and to give them more decision-making authority. ``I don't \n     want to have everything come to me if it doesn't need \n     to,'' he said. ``We have got to be an agile institution.''\n       ``My feeling on organizations is they should be as little \n     top-heavy as possible,'' he added. ``Let's take the money we \n     might be spending on the superstructure and give it to the \n     museums.''\n       He said he also hoped to improve coordination. The \n     Smithsonian has about a dozen educational centers, for \n     example, he said, ``but no pan-institutional concept'' for \n     education.\n       While he said he believed the federal government should \n     maintain its financial support, Dr. Clough said he embraced \n     Congress's message that the Smithsonian should raise more of \n     its own money to cover expenses. ``We need to get more self-\n     reliant,'' he said.\n       That means a major capital campaign of $1 billion over five \n     to seven years, a first for the institution, which will start \n     next year.\n       Dr. Clough said he would devote considerable effort to \n     cultivating donors. ``If we're going to get facilities gifts, \n     we need to have opportunities for people that they can \n     emotionally attach to,'' he said, like particular \n     exhibitions. ``You've got to work with donor intent.''\n       At the same time, he said, he recognized the perils of \n     giving contributors too much of a say in how their money is \n     spent, a challenge with which the Smithsonian is already \n     familiar. Last year some regents questioned the \n     appropriateness of a $5 million gift from the American \n     Petroleum Institute for the Ocean Initiative exhibition hall \n     of the natural history museum. The gift was rescinded.\n       ``A donor might want programming input there is always \n     going to be that element of nuance there,'' Dr. Clough said. \n     ``You have to understand the dangers and the possibilities.''\n       He said he also hoped to compete for federal money beyond \n     the direct annual appropriation. If the Smithsonian set out \n     to develop a school science and technology curriculum, for \n     example, Dr. Clough said, ``we\n\n[[Page S10300]]\n\n     might go to the Department of Education and get that funded, \n     as opposed to sitting back and hoping that money comes to \n     us.''\n       Other ideas include appealing to foundations and seeking \n     revenue-generating activity on the Web, making the \n     Smithsonian's extensive photography collection available for \n     commercial purposes, for instance. ``We're not looking to \n     make a profit,'' he said. ``We're just looking to recover our \n     costs.''\n       During his nearly 14 years as president of Georgia Tech, \n     Dr. Clough oversaw two capital campaigns that raised nearly \n     $1.5 billion in private gifts. Annual research expenditures \n     increased to $425 million from $212 million and enrollment to \n     more than 18,000 from 13,000. Georgia Tech has consistently \n     ranked among the nation's Top 10 public research \n     universities.\n       At the Smithsonian, Dr. Clough said he planned to spend the \n     next year developing a strategic plan ``to help us get a fix \n     on where we are'' and to set fund-raising priorities. He said \n     he wanted to consult people across the institution, with the \n     added dividend that it ``will help restore some of the \n     morale.''\n       The Smithsonian needs to be lean, but it must maintain the \n     basic levels of staffing that, for instance, allow the zoo to \n     keep feeding the animals, Dr. Clough said. The institution's \n     employment levels have shrunk in recent years, declining by \n     nearly 600 employees since fiscal year 1993 to the current \n     level of 5,960.\n       ``We have to stabilize it,'' Dr. Clough said. ``We can't be \n     the institution we hope to be if we sit around and let that \n     happen.''\n       At the same time he understands Congress's concerns and \n     says he is ready to be grilled when the time arrives, perhaps \n     next spring, when appropriations hearings are usually held.\n       ``It's O.K. for us to be asked our relevance and what we're \n     doing for the country,'' he said. ``I think we can make that \n     case.''\n       This article has been revised to reflect the following \n     correction: An article on Monday about plans for the \n     Smithsonian Institution outlined by G. Wayne Clough, its new \n     chief executive, misstated the goal of the institution's \n     capital campaign. It is to raise more than $1 billion over \n     five to seven years, not $5 million to $7 million.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10300-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                KIDS ACT\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to address a pressing issue \nthat deserves our immediate attention: the improved protection of \nchildren on the Internet. That is why, at the beginning of this \nCongress, I authored and introduced S. 431, the Keeping the Internet \nDevoid of Sexual Predators, or KIDS, Act.\n  The increasing popularity of social networking Web sites and their \nready availability to children has made these sites potential hotbeds \nfor sexual predators, who can easily camouflage themselves amidst the \nthrong of users on these sites, while furtively pursuing their own \ndespicable designs. In the 21st century, just as we protect children in \nour physical neighborhoods, we must protect them in our online \ncommunities as well. The KIDS Act, S. 431, is a bipartisan bill that \ndoes just that.\n  The KIDS Act requires convicted sex offenders to register their e-\nmail addresses, instant message names, and all other Internet \nidentifiers with the National Sex Offender Registry. The Department of \nJustice, DOJ, would then make this information, on a qualified basis, \navailable to social networking sites to compare the catalogued \nidentifiers with those of their users. And it will do so in a way that \ncarefully preserves the privacy of the users of any such Web site.\n  The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, SORNA, passed as \npart of the Adam Walsh Act, granted the Attorney General the authority \nto require the registration of certain identifying information, 42 \nU.S.C. 16914(a). While DOJ recently exercised its authority to collect \n``other information required'' to issue final rules concerning the \ncollection and release of Internet identifiers, this legislation \npermanently mandates that certain Internet identifier information be \nrequired in the registration process.\n  The amended bill continues to exempt Internet identifiers from public \ndisclosure by States or DOJ.\n  The amended legislation requires the Attorney General to ensure that \nthere are procedures in place to notify sex offenders of changes in \nrequirements.\n  The legislation clarifies the definition of ``social networking \nsite'' to assure that access to Internet identifiers is targeted to the \nbill's purpose of protecting children from solicitation by sex \noffenders on social networking sites. Sites may obtain information from \nDOJ only if they are focused on social interaction and their users \ninclude a significant number of minors. A ``significant number'' of \nminors, of course, clearly does not mean that the majority of users, or \neven a substantial minority, must be minors to qualify a Web site to \nparticipate, nor does it mean any particular quantity. The intent here \nis simply to permit the participation of any Web site that draws many \nminors; otherwise the law's purpose and effectiveness would be \nundermined.\n  As amended, the bill further allows social networking sites to employ \ncontractors to assist with the checking process, but intends that these \ncontractors will be subject to the same requirements that protect \nprivacy interests.\n  The legislation still sets out a system for checking Internet \nidentifiers and includes more robust privacy protections. Web sites may \nobtain a list of offenders' Internet identifiers from DOJ but only in a \nprotected and secure form. Only after making a match can the Web site \nview the Internet identifier in unprotected form and request specific \nadditional items of personal information about the registered sex \noffender. Web sites will require this additional information in order \nto ensure that people who are not registered offenders are not wrongly \nblocked from using their Web sites.\n  Moreover, as a qualification for the use of the checking system, \nsocial networking Web sites must provide the Attorney General a \ndescription of policies and procedures for protecting all shared \ninformation and policies for allowing users the ability to challenge \ntheir denial of access. This mechanism seeks to ensure a process to \nidentify and remove false positives from sex offender registries. If a \nWeb site discovers incorrect information, the Web site is required to \ninform DOJ and the State registry so that they can correct the \ninformation.\n  There is now a new section modifying minimum standards required for \nelectronic monitoring units used in the sexual offender monitoring \npilot program established under the Adam Walsh Act. DOJ agrees that \nthis change is needed. This will open up program participation to many \nmore States and companies.\n  The legislation no longer includes the stand-alone criminal offense \nfor knowing failure to register an Internet identifier. That provision \nwas deemed unnecessary because existing law clearly criminalizes the \nfailure to register information that the Attorney General requires \nconvicted sex offenders to register under SORNA. The KIDS Act, relying \non section 114(a)(7) of SORNA, specifically mandates that this required \ninformation include Internet identifiers. Thus, under the existing \nSORNA framework, as enhanced by the KIDS Act, failure to register \nInternet identifiers as required will be treated as any other \nregistration violation punishable under 18 USC Sec. 2250(a)(3).\n  This bill represents a vital step toward giving both law enforcement \nand businesses the tools they need to protect children from online \nsexual predators and toward making the Internet a safer place for \nchildren to communicate with their peers.\n  The use of the Internet as a communications tool will continue to \nexpand, and it is important that we put safeguards in place, so that \nour children can continue to benefit from advances in communications \ntechnology without putting them in harm's way.\n  I thank the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, \nNCMEC, MySpace, Facebook, Enough is Enough, RAINN, the American Family \nAssociation, the National Association of School Resource Officers, and \nthe American Association of Christian Schools for endorsing the KIDS \nAct. I thank my colleagues for their support of this important bill and \nurge the President to sign it quickly into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10300-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10300-S10302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TORTURE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, since 2001, top officials in the Bush \nadministration have secretly authorized the use of abusive \ninterrogation techniques that in some cases have risen to the level of \ntorture. In doing so, they have shown flagrant disregard for statutes, \nfor treaties ratified by the United States, and for our own \nConstitution. They have misled the American people, undermined our \nvalues, and damaged our efforts to defeat al-Qaida.\n  There are some who downplay the abusive treatment of detainees that\n\n[[Page S10301]]\n\nhas been uncovered at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere as \nisolated incidents, conducted by a handful of rogue low-level \ninterrogators. But the facts indicate where the true responsibility \nlies: with an administration that gave the green light to torture and a \nJustice Department that said anything goes.\n  Make no mistake, torture is against the law. The United States is a \nparty to the Convention Against Torture, the Geneva Conventions, and \nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The United \nStates Code criminalizes any act ``specifically intended to inflict \nsevere physical or mental pain or suffering.'' And in 2005, Congress \nreiterated in the Detainee Treatment Act that cruel, inhumane or \ndegrading treatment of detainees in U.S. custody is not permitted, no \nmatter where those detainees are held.\n  Notwithstanding these obligations, top administration officials have \ncontinuously sought and found ways to disregard the legal and ethical \nboundaries on acceptable detainee treatment. On January 25, 2002, \nAlberto Gonzales, in his capacity as counsel to the President, signed a \nmemo arguing that Taliban and al-Qaida detainees were not protected by \nthe Third Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. He \nstated that ``[i]n my judgment, this new paradigm renders obsolete \nGeneva's strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and \nrenders quaint some of its provisions . . .''\n  On February 2, 2002, the President issued an order determining that \nal-Qaida and Taliban detainees were entitled to neither prisoner of war \nprotections under the Geneva Conventions nor the protections of Common \nArticle Three. Gonzales also solicited from the Department of Justice \nOffice of Legal Counsel, the now infamous ``Bybee memo,'' issued in \nAugust 2002, which in the context of the criminal prohibition on \ntorture defined torture narrowly as the infliction of ``intense pain or \nsuffering of the kind that is equivalent to the pain that would be \nassociated with serious physical injury so severe that death, organ \nfailure, or permanent damage resulting in a loss of significant bodily \nfunction will likely result.'' The memo also contained the extreme--and \ndangerous--legal theory that the President, as commander in chief, \ncould disregard any congressional enactment that interfered with his \nability to interrogate enemy combatants. These positions were \nreiterated in March 2003, when another OLC memo was sent to William J. \nHaynes, general counsel of the Department of Defense.\n  And the OLC did not stop at general guidance. In a hearing this year \nbefore a House subcommittee, Steven Bradbury, Principal Deputy \nAssistant Attorney General at OLC, confirmed that his office had \nadvised the CIA that the regulated use of waterboarding did not \nconstitute torture for purposes of the criminal prohibition against \ntorture.\n  High-level administration officials also have not hesitated to issue \npolicies permitting abusive treatment of detainees. On November 27, \n2002, Haynes sent a memo to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld that \nasked him to approve 15 interrogation techniques for use at Guantanamo \nBay, including hooding, 20-hour interrogations, isolation, sensory \ndeprivation, forced nudity, threatening detainees with dogs, and \nputting detainees in ``stress positions'' for up to four hours. \nRumsfeld not only approved the techniques, he added a hand-written \nnote: ``I stand for 8-10 hours a day. Why is standing limited to 4 \nhours?''\n  Rumsfeld later rescinded the authorization of some of these \ntechniques for use at Guantanamo, and reauthorized the use of others. \nBut the consequences of these high-level approvals were far-reaching. A \nrecent report by the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector \nGeneral revealed that techniques authorized by Rumsfeld were used on \ndetainees at Guantanamo Bay, both during the period they were \nauthorized and after they had been rescinded. And such behavior was not \nlimited to Guantanamo Bay. According to the 2004 ``Review of Department \nof Defense Detention Operations and Detainee Interrogation \nTechniques,'' known as the Church Report, the Combined Joint Task Force \nin Afghanistan also developed, authorized and implemented interrogation \nprocedures similar to those Rumsfeld had approved in 2002. The Church \nReport and the ``Final Report of the Independent Panel to Review DOD \nDetention Operations,'' known as the Schlesinger Report, also document \nhow, in August 2003, MG Geoffrey Miller was sent from Guantanamo Bay to \nIraq, and brought with him Guantanamo policies allowing the use of \nharsher interrogation techniques. Shortly thereafter, LTG Ricardo A. \nSanchez, the top military official in Iraq, formally adopted techniques \nheavily influenced by those in use at Guantanamo, such as stress \npositions, forced sleep adjustment, and the use of dogs, although some \nof these were later rescinded.\n  While OLC was issuing memos effectively saying there were no legal \nrestrictions on interrogations and high-level officials were \nauthorizing abusive techniques, there is evidence to suggest that \ninterrogators on the ground were given very little information about \nexactly what was and was not permitted. During a Judiciary Committee \nhearing on interrogation policy in June, I asked Department of Justice \ninspector general Glenn Fine whether he thought that military \ninterrogators had clear guidance on what techniques were permissible, \ngiven the administration's shifting policies. He responded that changes \nin policy ``didn't always get down to the level of the interrogators'' \nand that, at times, ``they weren't sure or aware of what exactly was \nauthorized.'' Likewise, the Schlesinger Report stated that ``[t]he \nexistence of confusing and inconsistent interrogation technique \npolicies contributed to the belief that additional interrogation \ntechniques were condoned.'' In light of all this, the administration's \ninsistence that low-level interrogators are solely to blame for \nincidents of detainee abuse simply is not plausible.\n  Many individuals who were aware of what was happening raised \nconcerns. Secretary of State Colin Powell wrote a January 2002 memo \nthat weighed the costs and benefits of trying to evade the Geneva \nConventions, noting that to do so would ``reverse over a century of \nU.S. policy and practice in supporting the Geneva Conventions and \nundermine the protections of the rule of law for our troops.'' Others \nraised concerns as well. According to the DOJ inspector general's \nreport on the involvement of the FBI in military interrogations, \nseveral FBI agents ``became deeply concerned not only about the \nefficacy of these techniques but also about their legality.'' In 2002, \nthe FBI Director decided unequivocally that FBI agents would not \nparticipate in interrogations that used abusive techniques. In a \nNovember 7, 2002, memorandum for the Office of the Army General \nCounsel, Army COL John Ley stated that he believed that some of the \ntechniques that the Pentagon was considering for use at Guantanamo Bay \nand that were later approved by Rumsfeld--could violate both the \nFederal criminal prohibition on torture and the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice. He expressed concern not only about the legality of \nthe interrogation techniques, but also about eroding public support and \nlosing the moral high ground. And in a hearing before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee in June, RADM Jane Dalton, who served as legal \nadviser to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from June of 2000 \nuntil June of 2003, testified that all four of the Armed Services were \nconcerned about authorizing new interrogation techniques.\n  Fortunately, in 2006 after the Detainee Treatment Act became law, the \nDepartment of Defense finally agreed it would no longer authorize the \nuse of harsh interrogation techniques by military personnel, and \nordered that all personnel follow the interrogation policies laid out \nin the Army Field Manual. I have strongly supported proposals to \nrequire all intelligence agencies--specifically the CIA--to do the \nsame. For far too long, this administration has failed to abide by the \nlaw and to protect our values. The use of abusive interrogation \ntechniques is unsupportable on moral, legal or national security \ngrounds. It does not represent who we are as a nation, and it does not \nmake America safer.\n  The responsibility for the use of immoral, illegal and counter-\nproductive interrogation techniques does not stop with the \ninterrogators who employed them. It extends to those in the highest \nechelons of the Bush administration that sought to encourage these\n\n[[Page S10302]]\n\ntechniques, who confused interrogators with constantly shifting \npolicies, and that ignored the many voices who told them that what they \nwere doing was unlawful and that it was not the American way. And it \nextends to the President himself, who has acknowledged publicly that in \n2003 he approved meetings of his most senior national security \nofficials to consider and sign off on so-called enhanced interrogation \ntechniques. The abuses that have occurred under this administration's \nwatch have constituted one of the darkest episodes in this Nation's \nrecent history. They have fed growing anger at and opposition to U.S. \npolicies, and in the process have undermined our efforts to combat al-\nQaida and associated extremist groups. The next administration will \nhave to work long and hard to undo the damage that has been done to our \ncountry's reputation and national security and to restore the rule of \nlaw.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10302-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RESOURCE FAMILY RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for \nthe Resource Family Recruitment and Retention Act of 2008, which was \nintroduced on September 16, 2008, by my good friend Senator Blanche \nLincoln of Arkansas. This is an important piece of legislation, and I \nam proud to be an original cosponsor.\n  I have long been a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption \nand worked in a bipartisan manner to support adoptive and foster \nparents and children. In 1997, I strongly advocated for the passage of \nthe Adoption and Safe Families Act which has made a significant \ndifference in the lives of vulnerable children. Since the \nimplementation of the Adoption and Safe Families Act, the number of \nchildren adopted out of foster care has more than doubled. In West \nVirginia alone, more than 3,600 children have been adopted out of the \nWest Virginia foster care system. This is a real victory for these \nchildren who deserve the love and comfort of a safe, permanent home.\n  However, with more than 500,000 children still in foster care, it is \nclear that more needs to be done. This is why I was so pleased when the \nSenate passed the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing \nAdoptions Act by unanimous consent. This legislation will provide \nadditional support for grandparents and other relatives who provide a \nsafe home for children in foster care. Additionally, this legislation \nwill allow states to continue to assist older foster children, those \nwho are 18, 19, 20, or 21 years old, so that these children aging out \nof the system do not have to choose between pursuing an education or \nworking to prevent becoming homeless. I believe that this legislation \nis another step towards the ultimate goal of each child having a safe, \npermanent home.\n  Senator Lincoln's legislation would also help bring us closer to this \ngoal. A study conducted in 2005 by the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services found that one in five foster homes leaves the system \neach year. One-fifth of the foster parent population provides 60 to 80 \npercent of all foster care. Foster parents sacrifice in tremendous ways \nto provide a home for vulnerable children. The Resource Family \nRecruitment and Retention Act would support their efforts by awarding \ngrants to States to improve the leadership, support, training, \nrecruitment, and retention of foster care, kinship care, and adoptive \nparents.\n  It is my hope that organizations and individuals such as Mr. Dennis \nSutton of the Children's Home Society of West Virginia, who has worked \ntirelessly in his effort to secure a home for all of West Virginia's \nvulnerable children, will have the financial support to find and retain \nenough foster parents to make this goal a reality. Foster and adoptive \nparents will greatly benefit from the Resource Family Recruitment and \nRetention Act, but the big winners will be the children who are placed \nloving homes. We need to invest and focus on these families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10302-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10302-S10303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                AFRICOM\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today marks the full operational launch \nof the U.S. Africa Command, known as AFRICOM. I have long supported the \nidea of a unified regional combatant command for Africa that recognizes \nthe continent's growing strategic importance for U.S. security and that \nis coordinated with other U.S. agencies. As I have discussed many times \non the Senate floor, we can not pretend that weak and failing states, \nprotracted violent conflicts, maritime insecurity, narcotics and \nweapons trafficking, large-scale corruption, and the misappropriation \nand exploitation of natural resources are not relevant to our long-term \ninterests. At the same time, there are exciting economic and social \ndevelopments underway across Africa that provide openings for the \nUnited States to help save lives, strengthen governance institutions, \nand build long-term partnerships. It is not a question of whether the \nUnited States needs to work proactively and collaboratively with \nAfrican nations in these areas but a question of how we should do so to \nmaximize our efficacy while minimizing potential backlash.\n  Toward that end, the standup of AFRICOM presents both opportunities \nand risks. Indisputably, our Nation's military strength is one of our \ngreatest assets and may be necessary to deal with some of the emerging \nnational and transnational threats, such as narcotics trafficking, \npiracy, and terrorism. Military training, equipping, and logistical \nsupport are essential to develop strong, disciplined national \nmilitaries and also strengthen regional peacekeeping, especially with \nAfrican Union missions currently operating in Somalia and Sudan. \nFurthermore, in many postconflict societies, such as Liberia, our \nmilitary expertise can assist in demobilization, disarmament, and \nreintegration while also helping to rebuild that country's army.\n  However, while militaries make important contributions in these \nareas, they are insufficient to address the underlying causes of \nviolence and instability in Africa. Lasting security requires \nreconciling political grievances, improving governance, strengthening \nthe rule of law, and promoting economic development: tasks for which \nour military, or any military for that matter, cannot be the lead. To \nadvance and support those tasks, the United States needs to continue to \ninvest in our diplomatic, economic, humanitarian, and development \ncapacities on the continent. We need a unified interagency approach to \nthese challenges in which AFRICOM is supporting, not eclipsing, the \nwork of our diplomats, our aid workers, and other key partners.\n  I am concerned that the opposite is happening. Despite initial \nambitions to have 25 percent of AFRICOM's headquarters' positions \nfilled by nonmilitary staff, that number has been severely reduced \nbecause of resource and staffing limitations in civilian agencies. \nFurthermore, a report by the Government Accountability Office published \nthis July stated that concerns persist among civilian agencies and \nnongovernmental organizations that the military is becoming the lead \nfor U.S. policy in Africa. Even as Pentagon officials claim this is not \ntheir intention, it is hard to argue with the numbers. While civilian \nagencies operating abroad continue to face resource constraints, more \nand more resources are being invested in military relationships and \nassistance in Africa.\n  Given this context, it is not surprising that some are casting \nAFRICOM's emergence as a signal of further militarization of U.S. \nAfrica policy. Such perceptions of militarization are dangerous and \nrisk undermining our ability to engage local populations. As I have \nsaid many times, the military has a critical role to play in helping \nAfricans address their security challenges, but we must be careful that \nit does not outweigh or overshadow other forms of engagement. This is \nespecially true in cases where local security forces are engaging in \nrepressive tactics or committing serious human rights abuses, such as \nin Chad or Ethiopia. In these cases, we run a very real risk that U.S. \nmilitary engagement could be seen by local populations as complicit in \nthose abuses and become a target of resulting grievances. Before we \njump at short-term opportunities to exert military influence, we need \nto consider seriously the long-term risks to U.S. stature and \ninterests.\n  Mr. President, this is not to say that AFRICOM is not capable of such \nnuanced strategic planning and interagency coordination. I have met \nwith\n\n[[Page S10303]]\n\nGeneral Ward and know that he is aware of both the opportunities and \nrisks as AFRICOM stands up. I still believe that a unified regional \ncombatant command can contribute to broader U.S. Government efforts to \nconfront the many security challenges in Africa and can provide \nadditional tools to pursue coherent and strategic objectives across the \ncontinent. But to fulfill that potential, AFRICOM must demonstrate in \nits inaugural months and years that it recognizes the unique political \nrealities throughout Africa, concentrates on its defined mandate, and \ntakes its lead from our diplomats. Simultaneously, we in Congress must \nact to ensure that our diplomats have the resources they need to take \nthat lead in formulating and implementing comprehensive U.S. strategies \nin Africa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10303-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10303-S10304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of National \nAdoption Day and National Adoption Month. Senator Coleman and I \nunderstand that the Senate passed our resolution recognizing National \nAdoption Day and National Adoption Month. I stand before you today and \nchallenge every Member of Congress to take this opportunity to be the \nvoice for children who do not necessarily have someone to speak for \nthem.\n  As chair of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I strongly \nbelieve that ``there is no such thing as an unwanted child, just \nunfound families.'' The Hague Convention recognizes ``that the child, \nfor the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, \nshould grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, \nlove and understanding.'' Unfortunately, not all children have a family \nof their own, but through adoption our children have the opportunity to \nfind their ``forever family.''\n  Nearly half of all Americans have been touched by adoption, and last \nyear more than 4,200 children became members of permanent loving \nfamilies through adoption celebrations that were held in all 50 States, \nthe District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. I commend every State for \nits efforts, but we still have miles to go.\n  Between 2002 and 2007, approximately 4.8 million children were \nserviced by the U.S. foster care system, and only 310,000 of them were \nadopted by ``forever families.'' Children in foster care are some of \nthe most vulnerable members of our society, and we must do everything \nin our power to make sure they have the necessary tools to live a \nnormal healthy life. As Members of Congress we have taken a stance in \nhelping children move from foster care to permanent, adoptive homes by \npassing the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions \nAct of 2008. However, National Adoption Day gives us the chance to \nexperience firsthand the joys that adoption brings to the lives of our \nchildren and their families.\n  President Bush has recognized the importance of adoption to children \nand our Nation. That is why he declares November to be National \nAdoption Month. This year National Adoption Day occurs on November 15 \nas a part of National Adoption Month. National Adoption Day is an event \nto raise awareness of the 129,000 children in foster care who are \nwaiting for permanent families. Since the first National Adoption Day \nin 2000, nearly 20,000 children have joined ``forever families'' on \nthis special day. This year we hope to have events in all 50 States, \nthe District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n  I want you to picture what happens on this fall day, children \nrunning, laughing, and playing with their new parent. Think about a \ngirl or boy planning their special outfit and joyously awaiting the \nfamily celebration. Imagine the excitement welling up inside of a child \nas she looks into her new parent's eyes and knows she is finally part \nof a family. She will never dread the sound of a car coming to take her \naway again or wonder where she will lay her head or which school she \nwill be moved to.\n  Now picture the other dramatically different reality. There are \napproximately 513,000 current foster care children in the United \nStates, and 114,000 of them are waiting for adoption. Since 1987, the \nnumber of children in foster care has nearly doubled, and the average \ntime a child remains in foster care has lengthened to nearly 3 years. \nEach year, approximately 24,000 children in foster care will age out of \nthe system without ever being placed with a permanent family.\n  According to a survey by the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, \nmany potential adoptive parents have considered foster care adoption, \nbut ``a majority of Americans hold misperceptions about the foster care \nadoption process and the children who are eligible for adoption.'' For \nexample, ``two-thirds of those considering foster care adoption are \nunnecessarily concerned that biological parents can return to claim \ntheir children and nearly half of all Americans mistakenly believe that \nfoster care adoption is expensive, when in reality adopting from foster \ncare is without substantial cost.''\n  Most foster children entered into State custody because their parents \nwere either unable or unwilling to care for them. Not only are children \nseparated from parents, but in many cases, siblings are separated when \nthey are placed in foster care. Over half the children in foster care \nare 10 years of age or older and have more difficulty being adopted. \nThese children are just waiting to flourish with the right parent's \nguidance.\n  In Louisiana there are 4,541 children in foster care and 1,162 of \nthem are waiting to be adopted. I would like to share with you how \nfoster care and adoption has affected some of our children in \nLouisiana.\n  Ian is 15 years old and first entered foster care at the age of 5 due \nto physical abuse and lack of supervision by his mother. Ian's mother \nsurrendered her parental rights, and he and his three sisters were \nplaced for adoption. Ian's younger sisters were adopted by their foster \nparents.\n  In November 2006, Ian was placed in a specialized foster home after \ncompleting a facility program. This family has worked very closely with \nIan in learning to trust others, making appropriate choices, on \nbecoming part of a family unit, and being able to ``attach'' to others \nin preparation of an adoptive family. Ian is working very hard to \nadjust to a ``traditional family lifestyle'' and is progressing well in \nthis family setting. Ian states he wants an adoptive family that says, \n``You are our child and we will not turn you away.''\n  Ian is very personable and is looking for acceptance in life. He is \npolite, affectionate, and very adventurous. Ian enjoys playing \nbasketball, riding bikes, reading Harry Potter books, and playing video \ngames. Numerous recruitment efforts for an adoptive home have been made \nsince Ian was placed in the specialized foster home, but an adoptive \nfamily has not been found to date. One of the greatest barriers to \nadoption is a lack of resources of prospective adoptive families \nwilling to adopt older children.\n  While Ian is still desperately searching for someone to love and care \nfor him, Christopher, through all of his struggles, has found that \nsense of permanency. Christopher is 12 years old and first entered \nfoster care at the age of 2 months. He was subject to abuse by his \nbiological father that resulted in a skull fracture, subdural hematoma, \nbruises, bites, and burns. Christopher had many developmental delays \nand problematic behaviors requiring placement in specialized foster \nhomes. Christopher's removal was requested by several foster placements \nbecause of behavioral issues. In June 2006, a foster parent who had \nprovided respite for Christopher was asked to consider the fostering of \nChristopher as the child had formed a very strong bond to this foster \nparent and her children during his respite visits. Upon placement in \nthis home, drastic improvements were noted in Christopher's behavior, \nsocialization, academic achievements, and physical health. In all \nappearances, Christopher was now functioning in the normal range for \nhis age and with minimal evidence of neurological impairment. \nChristopher's neurologist continued to marvel at Christopher's \nfunctioning considering the extensive injuries he had suffered as an \ninfant.\n  One day while the adoption social worker was visiting with \nChristopher and his foster mother, Christopher said he wanted to change \nhis name to ``Kantrell.'' The social worker responded ``Kantrell (and \nChristopher's last name), that does sound nice.'' Christopher replied \nno, ``Kantrell'' and the last name of his foster mother. The\n\n[[Page S10304]]\n\nsocial worker stated that she immediately noted a glistening in the eye \nof the foster mother who replied, ``Is that really what you want, \nChristopher?'' Christopher responded that was very much his desire. The \nadoption of Christopher was finalized in January 2008 with Christopher \nchanging his name to ``Kantrell.'' Kantrell has continued to thrive in \nhis adoptive home and is a delight to all who know him.\n  Each year, 79,000 children and youth who exit foster care leave \nwithout a permanent home or belonging to a family. I could stand here \nevery day for the next month and talk about each child who needs to be \nadopted out of foster care. The bottom line is that each of these \nchildren, from 1 day old to 22 years old, needs permanency. They all \nneed a loving, nurturing family that will help them to grow, bring out \ntheir unique personalities, and transform them into confident and happy \nadults.\n  On National Adoption Day, I have faith that we can be the catalyst to \nsecuring a permanent loving family for every child. The miracle of \nadoption cannot be explained, but the loving parents who are holding \ntheir children for the first time today are living examples of how \ndreams can be realized. As an adoptive mother myself, I find that words \ncannot adequately explain the miracle of adoption. I can only take a \nmoment to offer my most humble thanks, gratitude, and appreciation to \nall those across the Nation who have given their Saturday to help find \nwaiting children safe and loving homes.\n  Let us continue to remember that when National Adoption Month and Day \nend there are still thousands of children who need that sense of \npermanency. I challenge Congress to make these children their first \npriority and not another statistic to be studied. Please join us in \nsupporting National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month by \nparticipating in events held across the country celebrating this most \njoyous, hopeful act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10304-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HIGHER EDUCATION LOANS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this past August the President signed \ninto law the Higher Education Opportunity Act which reauthorized \nprograms for postsecondary and higher education. Contained within the \nreauthorization is the Education Disaster and Emergency Relief Loan \nProgram. The bill established a loan program within the U.S. Department \nof Education to provide critically needed low-interest guaranteed loans \nto institutions in the event of catastrophic natural or manmade \ndisasters.\n  The colleges and universities in Louisiana, particularly those in the \nNew Orleans area, remain in many ways financially crippled by Hurricane \nKatrina. Three years after Katrina and Rita devastated Louisiana and \nMississippi these institutions still have nearly $700 million in \nunrecovered losses. The estimates for Gustav and Ike are still not \nfinalized, but at this stage the damage is purported to be at least $46 \nmillion to State colleges and universities alone.\n  Before Katrina, the 11 colleges and universities in the New Orleans \narea educated 70,000 students. Today, that number is only 50,000, but \nit continues to slowly rebound. This growth comes despite the fact that \nour institutions of higher education experienced more than $1 billion \nin physical damages and operational losses due to the 2005 hurricanes \nand have recovered less than half of those losses. Higher education \ninstitutions are the largest employers in New Orleans both before and \nafter Katrina. The higher education industry in New Orleans continues \nto attract millions of research dollars and supports industries as \ndiverse as biotechnology, aerospace, and medicine. The work of each \ninstitution in the city can be seen in every aspect of the region's \nrecovery, from the redesign of the city's troubled public schools to \ncoastal restoration and hurricane protection to the provision of health \ncare across the region. They engage in this important work even as they \ncontinue to struggle with mounting revenue losses, buildings that \nremain in disrepair due to flooding, and the loss of key faculty and \nstaff.\n  I call today on the Secretary of Education to make the Education \nDisaster Loan Program a top regulatory priority. It is my understanding \nthat some Department of Education officials have said that they will \nnot promulgate regulations on any newly created programs in the Higher \nEducation Act until funds are appropriated. This simply is not \nacceptable. This issue has become a major roadblock in the current \ndisaster funding process, and it is my hope that the Secretary and the \nDepartment will move expeditiously to establish regulations so that the \nprogram may provide crucial assistance to the colleges and universities \nimpacted by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike, and the Midwest \nfloods.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10304-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PRIVACY PROTECTIONS--S. 2321\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that, today, after \nseveral discussions, the Bush administration and lead sponsors of the \nE-Government Reauthorization Act of 2008, S. 2321, have accepted an \namendment I have drafted to ensure that Americans' privacy comes first \nwhen the Government purchases and uses their most sensitive personal \ninformation. My amendment requires that Federal agencies must conduct \nprivacy impact assessments before employing outside contractors that \nuse and market Americans' sensitive personal data.\n  The addition of privacy protections to the E-Government \nReauthorization Act will help to better protect all Americans from the \ngrowing threats of data breaches, identity theft, and other cyber \ncrimes. I am particularly pleased about the compromise reached today \nbecause I am a proud supporter of this bill. In 2002, I was an original \ncosponsor of E-Government Act, and in the intervening years, I have \nworked to promote and strengthen this law.\n  The E-Government Reauthorization Act is a good bill that will now be \neven better because of the privacy protections added by my amendment. \nRecently, the Government Accountability Office released a report on \nlessons learned about the Government data breaches at the Veterans' \nAdministration and elsewhere. That report found that Government \ncontractor responsibilities for preventing and responding to data \nbreaches should be clearly defined. My amendment takes a small but \nimportant step toward addressing the growing problem of lax data \nsecurity by Government contractors by making sure that Americans' \nprivacy rights are not compromised when they entrust their sensitive \npersonal information to our Government.\n  I thank the lead sponsors of this bill for working with me on \ncompromise privacy language for this bill. I also thank the many \nstakeholders who support this bill and my privacy amendment, including \nthe Center for Democracy and Technology, Symantec, and the Cyber \nSecurity Industry Alliance.\n  I urge all Senators to support and pass this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10304-3", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10304-S10305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING MARYLAND'S OLYMPIANS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to honor and congratulate \nMaryland's Olympic athletes for their performance in the 2008 Beijing \nSummer Olympic Games. These dedicated, disciplined, and accomplished \nathletes are a source of great pride to Maryland and the country. \nTherefore, it is with great enthusiasm that I commend:\n  Freddy Adu of Montgomery County, 2008 men's soccer team; Carmel \nAnthony of Baltimore, 2008 men's basketball team; David Banks of \nPotomac, 2008 men's Olympic rowing team; Maurice Edu of College Park, \n2008 men's soccer team; Jun Gao of Montgomery County, 2008 women's \ntable-tennis team; Georgia Gould of Baltimore, 2008 women's cycling \nteam; Kathryn Hoff of Towson, 2008 women's Olympic swimming team; Gao \nJun of Gaithersburg, 2008 men's Olympic table tennis team; Bobby Lea of \nTalbot County, 2008 men's Olympic cycling team; Mechelle Lewis of \nPrince George's County, 2008 women's track & field team; Jessica Long \nof Baltimore, 2008 Paralympics swimming team; Khan Bob Malaythong of \nRockville, 2008 men's Olympic badminton team; Tatyana McFadden of \nHoward County, 2008 Paralympic wheelchair racing; Scott Parsons of \nMontgomery County, 2008 men's canoe and kayak team; Michael Phelps II \nof Baltimore, 2008 men's Olympic swimming team; Lauren Powley of the \nUniversity of Maryland, 2008 women's field hockey team; Dina Rizzo of \nthe University of Maryland, 2008 women's field\n\n[[Page S10305]]\n\nhockey team; Robbie Rogers of the University of Maryland, 2008 men's \nsoccer team; Gary Russell of Prince George's County, 2008 men's boxing \nteam; Jamie Schroeder of Johns Hopkins University Medical School, 2008 \nmen's rowing team; Phil Scholz of Loyola College, 2008 Paralympic men's \nswimming team; Chris Seitz of the University of Maryland, 2008 men's \nsoccer team; Keli Smith of the University of Maryland, 2008 women's \nfield hockey team; Scott Steele of Baltimore County, 2008 men's \nwrestling team; Natalie Woolfolk of Arnold, Maryland, 2008 women's \nweightlifting team.\n  It is with special pride that I recognize the historical \naccomplishments of Baltimore's own Michael Phelps. Michael Phelps has \ngone where no Olympian has gone before. In this year's Olympic Games he \nwon a recordbreaking eight Gold Medals. That is a Gold Medal for every \nrace he swam in.\n  Before Michael Phelps shattered the record, the most Gold Medals ever \nwon by an individual at a single Olympics was seven. That feat was \naccomplished by another American swimmer, Mark Spitz. And when Spitz \ncaptured his seven Gold Medals in the 1972 Olympic Games, everyone said \nit couldn't be topped.\n  Everyone, that is, except for Michael Phelps.\n  The intrepid Michael Phelps didn't just break world records at this \nyear's Olympic Games; he smashed them. He didn't simply win Gold Medals \nin every race he swam; he also set seven new Olympic world records \nalong the way.\n  Like so many proud Marylanders and proud Americans, I watched Michael \nPhelps win race after race. And leave it to Michael Phelps to leave \nsome of the best racing for last. What a race he swam August 16th. What \na race; what a nailbiter. Michael Phelps, on his quest to win his \nseventh consecutive Gold Medal--this one in the men's 100 meter \nbutterfly--trailing behind, and then he came roaring back from seventh \nplace at the turn to edge Serbia's Milorad Cavic by one one-hundredth \nof a second. What a race. What an epic race.\n  I will also never forget Phelps' last race of this year's Olympic \nGames. It was the race that would determine whether Phelps would become \nthe first Olympic athlete to win eight Gold Medals during a single \nOlympic Games. It was the race that if won would mark Phelps as the \ngreatest swimmer and, perhaps, the greatest Olympian of all time.\n  I watched that historic race, as did so many Americans, with a racing \nheart. It was the men's 4 x 100 medley. When the race was finished--\ngiving Phelps his eighth Gold Medal of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games--\nI heard a great eruption.\n  It was an eruption of pride and joy. It wafted out from apartments \nand houses that left their windows open on that warm summer night. It \ncame from the streets below, where people spilled on sidewalks hugging \nand hollering. It came from cars that tooted their horns in solemn \npride. It was in the air and all around that night.\n  Michael Phelps, born and raised in Rodgers Forge, MD, has gone where \nno Olympic athlete has gone before. His performance at this year's \nOlympic Games has placed him in the pantheon of the greatest athletes \nof all time. And he has accomplished all this with great grace and \nhumility.\n  Throughout his exceptional swimming career, Phelps has always been \nquick to praise those who have helped him along the way. He shows \nspecial reverence to his mother Debbie, who, as a single mom juggling \nkids and multiple jobs, taught him the values of perseverance and \ncourage in the face of obstacles.\n  As a young swimmer at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club, Phelps \narrived day after day and gave his maximum effort. His work ethic is a \ntestament to his strong, value-driven Baltimore upbringing. And he is \nliving proof that if you can dream it, you can achieve it.\n  I am so proud to welcome Michael Phelps back to Baltimore. He could \nhave gone on to any city. Instead, he came back to his family and to \nhis community. He came back to the city where he first learned the \nvalues of hard work and perseverance.\n  So welcome home, Michael. And welcome home to all the Olympic \nathletes who served Maryland--and our country--so proud at this year's \nOlympic Games.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10305-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10305-S10307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting \nevery e-mail sent to me through an address set up specifically for this \npurpose to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will be \neasily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious \nattention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only \ndetail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The company I work for has just closed the doors to the \n     center I have worked in for eight years and offered us jobs \n     in a center over 50 miles away. Because I am three miles \n     short of qualifying for a moving package, I (and 64 of my co-\n     workers) will be forced to commute over 50 miles each way \n     every day. We live in a rural area so public transportation \n     is not an option. To get a new job would cut my wages more \n     than half, so I must follow my job. I have three small \n     children (ages 2, 4 and 6), so I cannot stay away during the \n     week and go home only on weekends.\n       I do not know what I will do if the cost of gas continues \n     to rise. I, along with others that I know, could actually \n     lose everything we have worked so hard to achieve. For the \n     first time, I am really afraid of what is happening to my \n     country.\n       Please do something now.\n       The rising price of gasoline is hurting nearly every family \n     in America. We are tired of Congress doing nothing but bowing \n     down to the environmentalists.\n       It is time for Congress to develop a program which allows \n     the exploration of America's energy sources without \n     materially affecting our environment. Congress should put our \n     families first, ahead of the environmentalists!\n     Yalon, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       In response to your request on the impact of high gas \n     prices, here is my story:\n       To help reduce the impact of higher fuel prices, I am \n     taking personal responsibility of my own actions. It is \n     actually really easy. I have made a habit of driving much \n     less by riding a bike, walking, combining trips and cutting \n     out unnecessary trips. The net impact has been less money \n     spent at the pump (conservation) and I am in better health \n     because of it.\n       As I ride around town, not a day goes by that I come across \n     people letting their vehicle run idle in a parking lot while \n     they do their errands. This includes sheriff's vehicles that \n     idle outside the nearby office. This lack of overall \n     awareness regarding high oil prices tells me we are not even \n     close to changing the wasteful consumption habits Americans \n     have adopted over many years. In the meantime, we learned \n     nothing from the 70s. Since then, our politicians have failed \n     to adopt a viable, self reliant energy policy. Instead, we \n     drive bigger vehicles and have become even more reliant on \n     mid-east oil. The money that is being sent overseas is \n     what allows the bad guys to fund the terrorist efforts. \n     One in which we are fighting at the cost of over 4,000 \n     deaths, many more permanent injuries and billions of \n     borrowed taxpayer dollars. At this point, there is \n     absolutely no end in sight for the war that most \n     politicians will still not admit is all about the oil. \n     After five years of false promises, we now have record oil \n     prices and, what I believe is, over an eight trillion \n     dollar deficit.\n       What this all has meant for me is, I woke up. I now realize \n     how terribly screwed up things are in Washington. We are \n     running out of oil! And the rest of the world wants the same \n     standard of living we have! And the lack of resources and the \n     environment cannot allow things to stay the same way, period!\n       In summary, your e-mail tells me you are not looking at the \n     big picture. We cannot drill our way out of this. At best, it \n     would only be a band-aid. I fear too many people still \n     believe the same career politicians that are to blame for \n     getting us into the mess we are in. They will say whatever it \n     takes to fool voters that they have the right answers, even \n     though history proves otherwise. What a shame.\n       Although I know I am fooling myself to think otherwise, I \n     hope you have the guts to include this during your \n     presentation to the Senate. Thanks for your time.\n     Steve.\n                                  ____\n\n       The one theme missing from so much of the concern over the \n     rising price of energy in our country is searching/\n     researching for alternatives! To continue to open up every \n     potential oil source in our own country is so short-sighted \n     since petroleum is a finite resource and does not solve the \n     real problem.\n\n[[Page S10306]]\n\n     Our leaders like you need to provide leadership to help our \n     nation find through research and development alternative \n     energy resources and stop this nonsense of giving the oil \n     companies access to every square inch of natural landscape to \n     extract oil. If our nation had had the guts to deal with the \n     need to diversify our nation's appetite for petroleum energy \n     back in the 1970s instead of letting the oil and auto lobbies \n     keep us dependent on their services, we would not be in \n     today's mess.\n       What concerns me is I hear you falling in step with the \n     international oil corporations [and other groups] that feel \n     threatened by the US being weaned off of oil products. \n     [Dynamic leadership that leads us to alternative energy \n     sources is most important.]\n     Catherine, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       Per your request, I am sending information concerning my \n     concerns about the high fuel prices.\n       The population [of my town] is less than 1,000 in town with \n     less than 2,500 total in the entire county. The closest large \n     city is Blackfoot with Idaho Falls being the next closest. \n     Idaho Falls is larger, and it contains most of the trade \n     support that we need. For example, pet supplies and food for \n     us. It now means, thanks to the higher fuel prices, we can \n     only travel to Idaho Falls once a month. It takes over $120 \n     to fuel my truck with diesel. With a round trip mileage of \n     close to 150 miles and making only 16 miles-per-gallon, I am \n     using close to \\1/2\\ a tank of fuel. I am retired and with \n     fixed income. This affects me in a big way. My wife and I \n     have a small vehicle for when driving is necessary within the \n     local area. Still with both vehicles, we are spending close \n     to $200 to $250 during a good month. These higher prices, in \n     our area, means we must cut on other items, such as dinner \n     out.\n       Arco currently is paying $4.19.9 for the lowest grade of \n     gasoline and $4.89.9 for diesel. The prices north of Mackay \n     are even higher; however, in Idaho Falls, unleaded regular is \n     still under $4 per gallon with diesel just under $4.30. We in \n     Arco cannot afford to travel to Idaho Falls or even Blackfoot \n     for the lower prices due to the mileage roundtrip.\n       In my opinion, this economy is very deep in recession and \n     very soon will be deep in a depression. The higher costs of \n     energy, food and other necessities are definitely making it \n     very difficult for us on fixed incomes to survive well. I can \n     remember a portion of the depression, and if another occurs, \n     the last one will be a ``cake walk''.\n     Guy, Arco.\n                                  ____\n\n       Happy to see that you are starting to see the reality of \n     the things that I have been sending e-mails about over the \n     past year! I am glad that you are soliciting opinions from \n     your constituents. Here are my thoughts (again):\n       1. It is the housing bubble bursting that has precipitated \n     the collapse of the dollar. If you look at something stable \n     like gold or silver, you will see that it takes the same \n     amount of gold to buy a gallon of oil now as it has \n     throughout recent years. The dollar has lost tremendous value \n     due primarily from the Fed lowering interest rates and adding \n     liquidity to save (bail-out) banks and Wall Street.\n       2. There is no truth in bank balance sheets. They cook the \n     numbers constantly and no one seems to care that they \n     misrepresent earnings in order to sustain stock price and the \n     Dow. This in tern gets dumped onto ``we the people'' since it \n     creates a false sense of stability. Although this also is not \n     sustainable, it does provide these large institutions time to \n     try to manipulate the markets and make (steal) money from \n     unsuspecting investors. This has got to stop immediately. \n     Loosing 401K value by purchasing stock that is going to get \n     pounded when the truth of the sub-prime exposure eventually \n     gets reckoned. Let us stop this now. Let the banks take their \n     lumps and let the people have a chance to invest in properly \n     valued institutions.\n       3. Recent discovery of programs like ``Friends of Mozillo'' \n     where housing committee leaders get preferred rates from \n     banks.\n       4. Environmental lobbies insisting that we do not go after \n     much needed oil. So, if the oil companies were to fund a few \n     lobbyists, could they really get their way and prevent us \n     from drilling? Should we allow this to continue? Should we \n     insist that it is essential to save our country and just get \n     the oil? I am told that the reserves in Alaska and Florida \n     alone hold enough oil that we would never need another drop \n     of Saudi oil? What are we waiting for?\n       5. Looking at the farming incentives for growing corn to \n     make ethanol is not financially sound. Spending more to farm \n     and wasting oil in the process makes no sense. Stop the \n     subsidies to farming corn. It really will not help and will \n     effect (negatively) the inflation we are already \n     experiencing. You say alternate energy. Let us get some tax \n     incentives for R and D here in Idaho. Attract business and \n     grow our economy by encouraging these types of businesses.\n       6. Initiatives to help grow American manufacturing. Giving \n     away all of our manufacturing jobs due to our short sighted \n     attitudes by American companies succeed will only lead to \n     higher unemployment, lower wages and declining property \n     values. Idaho for one should be doing everything they can to \n     encourage growth. Reducing tax obligations for corporations \n     and providing cash incentives for companies wanting to move \n     here would certainly help. If wages were substantially higher \n     then we could better afford the increases at the pump and \n     elsewhere.\n       7. Someone ask some tough questions of the Fed and its \n     polices. I mean reducing interest rates has only increased \n     the problem. Actually fixed 30-year rates have increased due \n     to lack of confidence. Restore confidence, get the rates of \n     short term debt back to sure up the dollar. It is sad that \n     the Fed is owned by the banks, allowing them to continue \n     unchallenged by Congress is ridiculous.\n     R.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a sole provider of a family of four. I have been \n     struggling to pay mortgage, insurance, food, electricity, and \n     clothing bills as well as paying the high cost of gasoline \n     for my vehicle to get to work. I feel as though I will need \n     to get an additional job to cover the expenses. I was \n     thinking about getting a loan to help with consolidating some \n     bills; however, that is only a bandage to my problem. The \n     problem is, that this year my employer only granted cost of \n     living increases at a 1.5%. That does not even help since the \n     true cost of living is far greater. I was grateful for the \n     increase; however, it does not help feed my family. I now \n     have to pay more than extra at the pump and now my vehicle \n     needs an oil change and that is more costs added on to my \n     transportation. I need the car for work in order to have \n     money to take care of my family. There has to be a better \n     solution to this problem.\n     Jan.\n                                  ____\n\n       The point that must be stressed is that the economy of this \n     nation and, particularly in the West and more particularly in \n     wide open states like Idaho, is based on inexpensive personal \n     modes of transportation. We have no other options to get from \n     one place to another. (Neither horse and buggy nor any form \n     of mass transportation is available.) In my particular \n     situation, my wife and I are both retired and attempting to \n     live on a fixed retirement income. We both have health \n     conditions which require substantial travel to specialists \n     ranging from Idaho Falls on the north to Salt Lake City on \n     the south. (You must realize that Malad's medical facilities, \n     while greatly appreciated, are, relatively speaking. very \n     limited. We have only two general practitioners and for more \n     serious conditions are routinely referred to specialists in \n     the larger populated areas, again, typically ranging anywhere \n     from Idaho Falls to Salt Lake City.)\n       We have church commitments, requiring regular trips to Salt \n     Lake. Also, we have seven families scattered around southern \n     Idaho and northern Utah. We have had long continued \n     intercommunicative relationships with these families. Now, \n     with gas refills requiring anywhere from $50 to $100 and a \n     still limited budget, obviously, something has to give. \n     Windmills, solar panels and changing light bulbs will not cut \n     it. Quality of life has to fall, and, in the case of required \n     medical attention, can have serious consequences.\n       Additionally, we have two divorced daughters who have legal \n     requirements for child custody visits. In one case, the \n     intervening distance is over 300 miles; in the other case, \n     over 100. Transporting children over these distances \n     regularly and frequently, obviously, becomes extremely \n     onerous!\n       Also. I have a son, living in Pocatello, who has numerous \n     clients, and makes a substantial portion of his income, in \n     and around the Salt Lake-Provo area. Needless to say, with \n     $100 gas tanks, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep \n     these contacts economically viable, and has a serious impact \n     on his ability to earn an income.\n       And, of course, this does not even take into account \n     strictly pleasure trips to the mountains or to a lake for \n     relaxation. Or to one of the nearby cities for entertainment \n     opportunities not available in Malad. We basically become \n     prisoners in our own home! Again, our economy, our way of \n     life, is predicated on the ability to take advantage of \n     assets, attractions and opportunities not available in our \n     immediate locale, but readily available in the surrounding \n     areas. Our ability to make a living and contribute to the \n     economy, as well as enjoy what the economy has to offer us, \n     in economic, social, charitable and pleasure situations, \n     requires affordable transportation. We do not have that \n     ability now and that is solely the result of \n     shortsighted, faulty energy policy.\n       Finally, I truly resent the suggestion that this nation is \n     too rich and must be brought down to size. Choking off energy \n     will certainly bring us down, but unfortunately, not only \n     will it result in economically disastrous conditions here in \n     this country, but in the entire world also. I am still \n     looking for some responsible leadership out of Washington to \n     rectify this insane energy policy. I certainly hope you can \n     provide it.\n     J. Wesley.\n                                  ____\n\n       This is a great idea! Thanks for the opportunity to share \n     my thoughts on energy with you.\n       I made some changes in my life three years ago that have \n     allowed me to reduce my gasoline costs substantially. I \n     started my own business and I now work from home thanks to \n     the wonder of the internet. I have been able to maintain my \n     (still somewhat minimal) salary but have eliminated an 80-\n     mile round-trip commute saving me hundreds of dollars a year \n     in fuel costs.\n       We are also planning on augmenting our propane heating \n     system with solar collectors. This will have a high upfront \n     cost, but we are doing it to reduce our carbon emissions.\n\n[[Page S10307]]\n\n       Here is my energy wish list for Congress:\n       Give larger and more consistent economic incentives for \n     private and commercial solar and wind installation. Germany \n     did this with solar and it is a run-away success.\n       Please support solar thermal for commercial electric \n     production!! Idaho would be a great spot for solar thermal \n     farms. We could be a leader!\n       Improve the nation's high tension power grid so power can \n     be better distributed from new sources like solar thermal \n     farms.\n       Give incentives to car-makers to bring the price down on \n     electric plug-in cars. (See solar farms above for the power \n     source.)\n       Stop the coal-bed methane production in Wyoming and \n     Colorado. It is ruining the environment and endangering the \n     pronghorn, sage grouse, air quality and water supplies. It is \n     sad to watch this happening.\n       Please do not support nuclear energy. I lived through \n     Chernobyl in Europe in 1986. It was not fun. No one has \n     solved the nuclear waste problem and no one really wants the \n     stuff stored for centuries in their backyard.\n       More light rail systems in Idaho. I would use it if it was \n     available.\n       Thanks for listening--and for all your hard work in \n     Congress!\n     Linda, Driggs.\n                                  ____\n\n       My daughter drives from Caldwell every day to her job as a \n     paralegal in Boise. She is divorced, and her husband pays \n     $100 per month child support. She has one minor child at home \n     and one child is 18 years old. The 18-year-old drives to \n     Boise to clean houses despite a continuing terrible case of \n     eczema. She married a young Marine in May. He is stationed in \n     Okinawa as a Private First Class. My daughter is on a very \n     limited budget and is having great difficulty continuing to \n     buy food for her children and pay for her gasoline to \n     continue working. I am trying to help, but am widowed and on \n     a limited income. My husband was a World War II hero, whose \n     honors included, among over 50 medals, two Purple Hearts and \n     the Legion of Merit. We are trying to do our best to hang on \n     but it gets harder every day. I paid $50 to fill my gas tank \n     yesterday at a discount station. If the situation continues \n     to decline, I do not know how we will continue to be able to \n     drive to work or the grocery store. As of now, I am only \n     driving when necessary, and am limiting my spending in every \n     way.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a Nevada couple who \nhave spent their lives contributing to the community, committing to \ntheir family, and serving as an example to us all.\n  Lloyd and LaPrele George have shared more than 50 years together. \nDuring that half century, Lloyd served as a fighter pilot in the U.S. \nAir Force, graduated from Brigham Young University, and earned his \njuris doctorate from the University of California at Berkley. Since \n1974 and an appointment to the Federal Bankruptcy Court, he has been \nknown fondly in Nevada as Judge George. He was appointed as a U.S. \ndistrict court judge in 1984, served 5 years as the chief U.S. district \njudge, and assumed senior judge status in 1997.\n  I am reminded of Judge George every time I go to my southern Nevada \noffice, as the newest Federal building in Las Vegas proudly bears his \nname. Judge George is a fixture in the Nevada legal community, but his \nreputation extends beyond the walls of his courthouse and beyond the \nborders of the United States. He has lectured on legal topics \nnationally and internationally and often serves as an ambassador, \nshowing foreign dignitaries around the courthouse and introducing them \nto southern Nevada.\n  While his name may be known by jurists around the world, his own \nworld has always revolved around his wife LaPrele, their 4 children, \nand 13 grandchildren. In November, Opportunity Village, one of the most \nrespected local organizations in Las Vegas, will honor the George \nFamily with the ``Order of the Village.'' The Georges will be \nrecognized for their tireless advocacy on behalf of people with \nintellectual disabilities.\n  Lloyd and LaPrele's oldest son Doug sparked their involvement in the \nspecial needs community. At a time when it was expected that children \nwith intellectual disabilities would be sent to institutions, the \nGeorges instead embraced their son and became champions for those with \nintellectual disabilities and an inspiration for their families. They \nwere involved in the early days of the Clark County Association of \nRetarded Children, even cosigning the mortgage on the group's first \nbuilding. Over time, it evolved into Opportunity Village, Nevada's \nlargest private, not-for-profit community rehabilitation program. \nServing more than 3,000 people a year, Opportunity Village offers \nNevadans, like Doug George, a chance to earn a paycheck and feel a \nsense of independence.\n  The Georges have shined the light of their service on southern Nevada \nfor many years. We have been blessed by their heartfelt involvement and \nloving leadership. Judge George and LaPrele, thank you for your \ncommitment to your family and to our community. There is hope and \nopportunity for many Nevadans because of you. May God continue to bless \nyou and your family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10307-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO FALLEN WILDLAND FIREFIGHTERS\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have a favorite quote about \nfirefighters: ``All men are created equal, then a few become firemen.''\n  Firefighters are indeed a rare breed--selfless and brave. It is a \ntragedy when even one is lost. On September 1, Montana and America lost \nnot one but three firefighters in an airplane crash as they rushed to \nquell the flames of a fire in California. Gene Wahlstrom, Greg \nGonsioroski, and Zachary VanderGriend may be gone from this Earth, but \nthey will never be forgotten. Their sacrifice and unwavering dedication \nto the lives of others stand as an example for all Americans. These \nbrave men were based in Missoula, MT, and though they hailed from \nWashington and Utah in addition to the Big Sky State, I am proud to \ncall them all Montanans.\n  Gene Wahlstrom began his 35-year flying career as a crop duster and \nrose to the position of chief pilot for Neptune Aviation. Gene was a \nVietnam veteran and a natural leader and mentor. Folks who knew Gene \nsay he was a kind, genuine, accomplished, and loyal friend.\n  Most folks who knew Greg Gonsioroski just called him ``Gonzo.'' He \nbegan his career as an airplane mechanic but decided to take to the \nskies himself. Greg was a native of Baker, MT. A family man first, \nfather to Gabriel, Grady, and Gracelyn, and doting husband to Kim, he \nwill be remembered as a gentle giant and a loving and patient father, \nhusband, and friend.\n  Zachary VanderGriend was a new employee with Neptune Aviation but not \nnew to flying--he had dreamed of being a pilot since he was 2 years \nold. Zachary got his pilot's license when he was 17 and spent much of \nhis time in volunteer programs such as the Young Eagles. As noted in \nhis eulogy, Zachary was a devoted Christian who loved to fly ``because \nit was there he felt closest to God.''\n  I believe service is one of the most honorable things a person can \ndo. Whether it is service to ones community, State, or country, service \nis the most noble of all human endeavors.\n  In Montana and indeed across much of the West, fires are an almost \nconstant threat. It is the price we pay for living in one of the most \nbeautiful places on earth. So every year we place our belongings, our \nhomes and our lives in the hands of firefighters--too often without a \nsecond thought.\n  The loss of Gene, Greg, and Zachary gives us pause. As a Montanan and \nan American, I feel tremendous sadness in their passing but also \ntremendous gratitude for the time we were graced with their \npresence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10307-3", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10307-S10308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING NATHAN WEXLER\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the State of Delaware lost one of \nits most remarkable citizens on September 10, with the passing of \nNathan Wexler at the age of 97.\n  I first met Nate many years ago during one of my early campaigns, \nwhen he showed up in my campaign headquarters offering to volunteer. \nFrom that day forward, though he had retired from his dry cleaning \nbusiness and was at an age when most folks are ready to slow down, Nate \nwas one of our most active volunteers.\n  A talented artist, Nate began a second career as a professional sign \npainter. Indeed, one of the staples of our campaign's offices was a \nlarge sign that he painted many years ago. I have had several \ncampaigns, and several\n\n[[Page S10308]]\n\ncampaign headquarters, but Nate's sign remains, a reminder of his \ncommitment as well as his friendship.\n  But for all of Nate's artistic talent, his most enduring \ncharacteristic was his love of people, and his ability to inspire \nloyalty and affection from everyone he came in contact with.\n  Many of the volunteers on my campaigns have been young people, full \nof idealism and eager to learn. They have often been young enough to be \nNate's grandchildren or even great-grandchildren. But Nate always \nrelished their idealism. He tried to see people and events through \ntheir eyes and learn from that point of view, and he gently shared his \nexperience and wisdom. It was remarkable to see the affection and \nrespect he engendered in those idealistic kids.\n  My family and I were privileged to spend time with Nate in settings \naway from the political arena, and those occasions were simply a \ndelight. They were times rich with humor and wit, as well as wisdom. \nOur conversations were filled with insight, not just into the past and \npresent, but looking far into the future at the challenges our Nation \nand world will face. Nate knew that he would never face those \nchallenges, but that his great grandchildren and great-great-\ngrandchildren would.\n  Nate Wexler leaves behind a large family and friends of all ages and \nfrom all walks of life. He will be missed tremendously, but he lives on \nin all of us who were fortunate enough to know and to learn from \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10308-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING CALIFORNIA'S LOST FIREFIGHTERS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the lives of Shawn Blazer, Scott Charlson, Edrik Gomez, \nMatthew Hammer, Dan Packer, Andrew Jackson Palmer, Jim Ramage, Steven \nRenno, Bryan Rich, Roark Schwanenberg, and David Steele. These brave \nmen lost their lives while working to protect Californians from \ndevastating forest fires.\n  On August 5, 2008, seven firefighters and two helicopter pilots were \ntragically killed in a helicopter accident while bravely fighting the \nIron Complex Fire in Trinity County. I would like to say a few words \nabout each of these men:\n  Shawn Blazer of Medford, OR, had been working as a firefighter for 1 \nyear and told his family and friends that he had ``discovered his \ncalling.'' Shawn was dedicated to his family and had been caring for \nhis mother when he died. He had a passion for photography, computer \ngames and playing sports. He is remembered for his dedication and love \nfor his friends and family.\n  Scott Charlson of Phoenix, OR, was a student at Southern Oregon \nUniversity and worked as a firefighter during the summer to put himself \nthrough college. He had a passion for journalism, especially covering \nsporting events. His classmates recalled his ethics, excellence in \nreporting and kind and caring nature.\n  Edrik Gomez of Ashland, OR, was a student at Southern Oregon \nUniversity, double majoring in communications and political science and \nwas in his first year as a firefighter. Gomez was known as a leader \nwith great compassion and for his lighthearted spirit, interest in \npolitics and close bond with his family and friends.\n  Matthew Hammer of Grants Pass, OR, was a recent graduate from Corban \nCollege with a degree in business. He married his college sweetheart \nthis summer and had planned on making 2008 his last fire season as a \nfirefighter. He is remembered as an athletic, friendly, fun-loving \nperson who excelled under pressure.\n  Jim Ramage of Redding, CA, was a helicopter pilot who served in the \nU.S. Army during the Vietnam war and had a distinguished career with \nthe U.S. Forest Service and CAL Fire. Friends and family remember Jim's \npassion for aviation and protecting public safety. He is remembered for \nthe bonds he created with his friends and the great love he had for his \nfamily.\n  Steven ``Caleb'' Renno of Cave Junction, OR, was a track and field \ncoach for his alma mater, Illinois Valley High School, where he \nexcelled in both track and cross country. After high school he attended \nSouthern Oregon University and worked as a firefighter during summers. \nHe will be remembered for his talent as a runner and as an avid \ntraveler.\n\n  Bryan Rich of Central Point, OR, was a talented framing carpenter who \nrecently began a career in firefighting. He loved spending time \noutdoors, playing sports and is remembered for his dedication to his \nfamily.\n  Roark Schwanenberg of Lostine, OR, was a U.S. Army trained helicopter \npilot, who many of his colleagues consider one of the best helicopter \npilots, with whom they have worked. He is remembered for his humor, \ngreat skill as a pilot, and love for his family and friends.\n  David Steele of Bend, OR, was a student at Central Oregon Community \nCollege and worked as a firefighter during the summer to pay for his \neducation. He planned on becoming a career firefighter after graduating \nfrom both Fire Fighting and Emergency Medical Technician school. \nFriends and family remember his strong work ethic, love of his family \nand big heart.\n  We also mourn the loss of two other brave firefighters from the State \nof Washington who lost their lives battling California wildfires this \nsummer:\n  Dan Packer of Sumner, WA, was the Chief of the East Piece Fire \nDepartment and past president of the Washington State Fire Chiefs. He \nhad a passion for public safety and was known for his ability to relate \nto anyone. Chief Packer is remembered for his strong leadership \nabilities and dedication to his family. Chief Packer lost his life \nwhile battling the Panther Fire in Siskiyou County on July 26, 2008.\n  Andrew Jackson Palmer of Port Townsend, WA, was a 2008 graduate of \nPort Townsend High School where he was a standout athlete on the \nfootball team. Andy enjoyed playing a variety of sports and spending \ntime with his friends and family. Andy's loved ones recall his kind \nheart, honesty and integrity. Andy tragically died while fighting the \nIron Complex Fire in Trinity County on July 25, 2008.\n  These brave firefighters and pilots, like all those who fight fires \nacross California, put their lives on the line to protect our \ncommunities. My heart goes out to their families and loved ones and my \nthoughts and prayers are with them. We are forever indebted to them for \ntheir courage, service and sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10308-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JO PRICE CRAVEN\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

At \nthe age of 10, she presented her work at the 2005 Community College \nConference for Student Research in Madisonville, KY, and this year, she\n\n[[Page S10309]]\n\nparticipated in a summer internship program at the National Institutes \nof Health in Maryland. At an age when many children look to hangout at \na local mall, Kelsey has already built a resume that mirrors those \nstudents who were born more than a decade before her.\n  In addition to her academic activities, Kelsey is involved in \ncommunity life. She is presently the youngest account holder at the \nCommunity Foundation of West Kentucky where she raises money for \nmedical and research based charitable organizations. She is a regular \nat the local Salvation Army and makes time to volunteer at a local \nchildren's hospital in Lexington, KY.\n  After earning a bachelor's degree in biology at the University of \nKentucky next spring, Kelsey will begin her postbaccalaureate position \nat the National Institutes of Health and then hopes to attend medical \nschool.

I look \nforward to seeing all they will accomplish in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10309-3", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BOISE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

In a category that included 112 other facilities nationwide, \nthe BOI ATCT scored higher than the others on safety metrics, employee \nfocus, innovation and customer service. I congratulate Gordon Stewart, \nBOI ATCT manager and his staff for their teamwork, positive, winning \nattitudes and overall excellence. As Gordon noted recently, he and his \nteam are ``ever cognizant of the public trust bestowed upon our \nprofession, and with that knowledge we constantly strive to move the \nbar of excellence higher. . . . The greatest tool at our disposal is \ncommunication.'' This award comes on the heels of a regional award that \nthe BOI ATCT team won for fiscal year 2006.\n  I wish BOI ATCT continued success in its service and its highly \neffective partnerships with the Boise Airport, Idaho Air and Army \nNational Guard, National Interagency Fire Center, passenger and cargo \nairlines and corporate and general aviation. It is good to know that an \nairport that I frequently use abides by such high standards of safety \nand service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10309-4", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10309-S10310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ATLANTIC COMMUNITY EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

In many cases, this Federal \nfunding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it \noften has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.\n  The Greene Community School District received a 2001 Harkin grant \ntotaling $266,699 which it used to help build an addition to the high \nschool. This school is a modern, state-of-the-art facility that befits \nthe educational ambitions and excellence of this school district. \nIndeed, it is the kind of school\n\n[[Page S10313]]\n\nfacility that every child in America deserves. The district also \nreceived three fire safety grants totaling $75,000 to install new hoods \nin the kitchens at the elementary and high schools, to install fire \nalarms and door closures and make other repairs.\n  Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. \nThey are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a \ntremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned \ncitizens. I salute the entire staff, administration, and governance in \nthe Greene Community School District. In particular, I would like to \nrecognize the leadership of the board of education--Gary Hatcher, Laura \nSchafer, Troy Feldman, Barbara Brinkman and John Moellers and former \nboard members Sara Trepp, Stanley Cousins, Robb Holtz, Jeff Lindell and \nWarren Van Dyke. I would also like to recognize superintendent Steve \nWard and John Backer for his leadership of the citizens' committee \nwhich supported the bond referendum for the project.\n  As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin School Grant program in \nIowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings \nand facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation \nor replacement. In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, \nsome 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The \nharsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United \nStates is nearly 50 years.\n  Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming \nsports arenas on weekends but during the week go to school in rundown \nor antiquated facilities.

Mr. President, in Iowa and across the United \nStates, a new school year has begun. As you know, Iowa public schools \nhave an excellent reputation nationwide, and Iowa students' test scores \nare among the highest in the Nation.\n  I would like to take just a few minutes today to salute the dedicated \nteachers, administrators, and school board members in the Waterloo \nCommunity School District and to report on their participation in a \nunique Federal partnership to repair and modernize school facilities.\n  This fall marks the 10th year of the Iowa Demonstration Construction \nGrant Program. That is its formal name, but it is better known among \neducators in Iowa as the program of Harkin grants for Iowa public \nschools. Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 \nmillion for the State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school \ndistricts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools or renovating existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal \nfunding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it \noften has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.\n  The Waterloo Community School District received 15 Harkin grants \ntotaling $5,434,952 which it used to help modernize and make safety \nimprovements throughout the district. The Waterloo Community School \nDistrict received seven construction grants totaling $3,786,616 which \nhave helped the district build Walter Cunningham School of Excellence, \nIrving Elementary School, Lincoln Elementary School, and Poyner \nElementary School. The grants have also helped with a classroom \naddition and renovations at Lowell Elementary School and with \nrenovation projects at East High School, West High School and Kingsley \nElementary School. These schools are the modern, state-of-the-art \nfacilities that befit the educational ambitions and excellence of this \nschool district. Indeed, they are the kind of schools that every child \nin America deserves.\n  The district also received eight fire safety grants totaling \n$1,648,336 to install fire alarm systems and make other repairs at East \nHigh School, Central Middle School, Hoover Middle School, Logan Middle \nSchool, Bunger Middle School, McKinstry Elementary School, and Kingsley \nElementary School. The Federal grants have made it possible for the \ndistrict to provide quality and safe schools for their students.\n  Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. \nThey are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a \ntremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned \ncitizens. I salute the entire staff, administration, and governance in \nthe Waterloo Community School District. In particular, I would like to \nrecognize the leadership of the board of education--President Bernice \nRichard, Vice President Barb Opheim, Pam Miller, Lyle Schmitt, Michael \nKindschi, Judy Fossell and Mike Young, and former board members Doug \nFaas, Don Hanson, Craig Holdiman, Lance Dunn, Bob Heaton, Robert \nKrause, Robert Smith, and Dave Juon. I would also like to recognize \nsuperintendent Dr. Gary Norris, former superintendents Dr. Dewitt Jones \nand Dr. Arlis Swartzendruber, director of buildings and grounds Marty \nMetcalf, former director of buildings and grounds Jack Fitzgerald, \nboard secretary Sharon Miller, along with a number of building \nprincipals including Mary Meier, Bob Tyson, Martin Van Roekel, Dr. Gail \nMoon, Elizabeth Crowley, Vicky Smith, Dr. Mary Jo Wagner, Kari \nGunderson, Bob Wright, Dr. Loleta Montgomery, Brian Ortman, Phillip \nAnderson, Jennifer Hartman, Marla Padget, and Pam Zeigler.\n  As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin school grant program in \nIowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings \nand facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation \nor replacement.

LAUTENBACHER, JR.\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, although many Americans may never \nhave heard of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, \nthe agency plays a significant role in the daily lives of Americans, \nwhether it is providing daily weather forecasts, supporting marine \ncommerce, or monitoring our climate.\n  For nearly 7 years, NOAA has been guided by the leadership of VADM \nConrad C. Lautenbacher. When he retires on October 31, Admiral \nLautenbacher will leave a lasting legacy at NOAA that has helped \nstrengthen our knowledge and understanding of our oceans and \natmosphere.\n  Life on Earth relies on the ocean. Our oceans regulate our planet's \nclimate, support global commerce, and provide food. The livelihoods of \nmillions of Americans rely on our oceans. Yet, we know little about \nwhat lies beneath the surface of our oceans. Ninety-five percent of our \noceans are unexplored. Working with the Senate Commerce Committee, \nAdmiral Lautenbacher commissioned America's first ship for ocean \nexploration, the Okeanos Explorer. The ship's missions will include \nreconnaissance to search unknown areas and map the deep seafloor. \nThrough telepresence, the\n\n[[Page S10317]]\n\nship and its discoveries will be connected to live audiences so they \ncan see what lies beneath the waters and help inspire a new generation \nof ``aquanauts.''\n  Under Admiral Lautenbacher's leadership, the National Weather Service \nhas improved its severe weather warnings. Seconds make a difference \nduring flash floods, tornados, tsunami, and severe thunderstorms. With \nimproved scientific knowledge, NOAA is providing storm-based warnings \nthat give the public more geographically specific information about \nsevere weather. These storm-specific warnings allow first responders \nand those in harm's way to take the necessary actions to protect lives \nand property.\n  An important part of NOAA's mission is to understand and predict \nchanges in the Earth's environment. Admiral Lautenbacher has led U.S. \nefforts working with more than 60 countries and the European Commission \nto develop the Global Earth Observation System of Systems, GEOSS. Earth \nobservations are critical to our understanding of complex climate and \nocean systems. With improved data about the interconnectedness of Earth \nsystems, we will be better equipped to help emergency managers make \nevacuation decisions, to aid State and local decisionmakers in \nprotecting coastal communities and improving infrastructure \ndevelopment, and to more accurately predict weather and climate changes \nthat affect our economy.\n  Admiral Lautenbacher also worked closely with Senator Stevens and me \nto reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management \nAct. This act marks a natural evolution in fisheries management because \nit recognizes not only the need to carefully manage fish populations, \nbut the ocean ecosystems our fisheries occupy.\n  Given the size of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone in the Pacific and \nthe reliance of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands on the oceans, NOAA's \nprograms are of critical importance to the Pacific. More than lending \ntechnical assistance, Admiral Lautenbacher matched word to deed by \ngrowing NOAA's capacity in the Pacific region--from establishing a new \nNational Marine Fisheries Service regional office and lab, to breaking \nground on a NOAA Pacific Regional Facility, to developing the data and \nenvironmental monitoring infrastructure needed to support science-based \nmanagement.\n  Admiral Lautenbacher has my gratitude and deserves our Nation's \ngratitude for his dedication to public service. I wish him well as he \nmoves into the next chapter of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10317-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BOB DeMERSSEMAN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Bob DeMersseman of Rapid City, SD, for over 22 years of \nservice with the Rapid City Economic Development Partnership.\n  Mr. DeMersseman is retiring this December after an impressive career \nof service with the Economic Development Partnership. For 19 of the 22 \nyears, Bob served as president of the organization. During his tenure, \nBob and his staff and the city's economic development groups have \ncreated and expanded two industrial parks, set up the low-interest \nRapid Fund loan fund, developed the Western Research Alliance to \npromote a growing technology community and created the Black Hills \nBusiness Development Center, an incubator to help researchers, \ninventors and entrepreneurs turn their ideas into commercial ventures.\n  Bob has been instrumental in forging vital and important \nrelationships and partnerships with area Chambers of Commerce, economic \ndevelopment organizations, universities and community officials. There \nwas a time when local communities didn't foster such working \nrelationships and with the guidance and advice of leaders like Bob, \nthis improved tremendously. Today, when one Black Hills community \nattracts or expands a business, other communities realize that they \nalso benefit.\n  While developing partnerships and relationships between communities \nand their leaders, Bob has also realized that economic development and \nattracting businesses and industries to the local area has become \nincreasingly competitive. Bob along with other Rapid City and Black \nHills leaders have done a commendable job in creating and developing \nmore tools for the tool box to promote Rapid City and the Black Hills \nto national and international prospects. He has helped to acquire and \nexpand land tracts for business and industrial parks, worked hard to \npromote and market Rapid City and the Black Hills communities and \nprovided valuable guidance on issues impacting the future promotion and \ngrowth of Rapid City and the Black Hills region. He has worked hard to \nexpand Rapid City's economic base.\n  Here is what a few of Bob's peers say about his impact on economic \ndevelopment in the Rapid City area. ``In my opinion, Bob has been at \nthe front end of developing a very diversified economic development \nprogram for Rapid City, and he will be remembered for putting a lot of \ngreat things in place,'' said Mark Merchen, chairman of Black Hills \nVision, a group working to create a regional technology corridor.\n  ``Bob has been such a key part of our team effort to create economic \ndevelopment in Rapid City,'' said Pat Burchill, chairman of the Rapid \nCity Economic Development Foundation, the partnership's real estate \narm. ``Our success has a lot to do with Bob's efforts.''\n  I commend Bob for his passionate dedication and tireless work to \nexpand and enhance Rapid City's economic potential as well as helping \nto develop and promote that same potential in the Black Hills region. I \nwish him all the best in his retirement and know that he will bring a \nhigh level of enthusiasm, energy, dedication and commitment to his \nretirement endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10317-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10317-S10318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING MICHAEL PROCTOR SMITH\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the \nlife of Michael Proctor Smith, who passed away at his home in New \nOrleans on Friday, September 26, 2008. He was 71. Michael, a native of \nNew Orleans, was an award-winning professional freelance photographer \nwho chronicled the music, culture, and folklife of New Orleans and the \nState of Louisiana for over 40 years.\n  Michael was well known for documenting New Orleans social club \nparades and jazz funerals, neighborhood traditions, Mardi Gras Indians, \nspiritual church ceremonies, and many of the city and State's renowned \njazz, blues, rhythm and blues, and gospel musicians. He was a fixture \nat every New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival since it began in 1970 \nuntil his retirement in 2005. His works are internationally recognized \nand are permanent collections at a number of museums including the \nBibliothque National in Paris, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the \nSmithsonian Institution, the Historic New Orleans Collection, the New \nOrleans Museum of Art, the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, and the \nLouisiana State Museum.\n  In the last few years, Michael had been honored with numerous awards \ncelebrating his work. He received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the \nLouisiana Endowment for the Humanities in 2002 and was named Music \nPhotographer of the Year by Offbeat magazine. In 2004 he received a \nMayor's Arts Award from the Arts Council of New Orleans and a Clarence \nJohn Laughlin Lifetime Achievement Award from the New Orleans/Gulf \nSouth chapter of the American Society of Media Photographers. In 2005, \nhe received the Delgado Society award from the New Orleans Museum of \nArt, the first photographer to be so honored. The recipient of two \nPhotographer's Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, \nMichael's prints have toured worldwide through the U.S. Information \nAgency.\n  Michael's photographs grace the covers of many CDs and record albums, \nillustrate numerous books and magazine articles published in America \nand Europe, and are a staple of documentary films on the rich cultural \nhistory of New Orleans and Louisiana.\n  He was also an original owner and founder of Tipitina's, an iconic \nmusic club located at the corner of Napoleon Avenue and Tchoupitoulas \nStreet in uptown New Orleans.\n  Michael is survived by his partner Karen Louise Snyder; his brother \nJoseph Byrd Hatchitt Smith; two daughters, Jan Lamberton Smith and \nLeslie Blackshear Smith; and three grandchildren, Chance King Doyle, \nLeslie\n\n[[Page S10318]]\n\nElizabeth Doyle, and Francis Brandon Arant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10318-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO LOUISIANA WWII VETERANS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud to honor a group of 88 \nWorld War II veterans from every region of Louisiana who are traveling \nto Washington, DC, this weekend to visit the various memorials and \nmonuments that recognize the sacrifices of our Nation's invaluable \nservice members.\n  Louisiana HonorAir, a group based in Lafayette, LA, is sponsoring \nthis Saturday's trip to the Nation's Capital. The organization is \nhonoring each surviving World War II Louisiana veteran by giving them \nan opportunity to see the memorials dedicated to their service. On this \ntrip, the veterans will visit the World War II, Korea, Vietnam and Iwo \nJima memorials. They will also travel to Arlington National Cemetery to \nlay a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknowns.\n  This is the first of four flights Louisiana HonorAir will make to \nWashington, DC, this fall.\n  World War II was one of America's greatest triumphs, but was also a \nconflict rife with individual sacrifice and tragedy. More than 60 \nmillion people worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, \nand more than 400,000 American service members were slain during the \nlong war. The ultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in \nEurope is a testament to the valor of American soldiers, sailors, \nairmen and marines. The years 1941 to 1945 also witnessed an \nunprecedented mobilization of domestic industry, which supplied our \nmilitary on two distant fronts.\n  In Louisiana, there remain today more than 33,000 living WWII \nveterans, and each one has a heroic tale of achieving the noble victory \nof freedom over tyranny. The oldest in this HonorAir group was born in \n1913. Two of these veterans began their service in the Louisiana \nNational Guard as early as 1936, and were activated for Federal service \nin 1941.\n  This group served in every branch of the military, including 29 in \nthe U.S. Army, 14 in the U.S. Army Air Corps, 23 in the U.S. Navy, 8 in \nthe U.S. Marine Corps, 2 in the U.S. Merchant Marines, one in the U.S. \nCoast Guard and one in the Women's Reserve of the U.S. Naval Reserve. \nOur heroes served across the globe, participating in major invasions \nsuch as the Battle of the Bulge, the Battle of Huertgen Forest, and the \nbattles of Tunisia, Naples-Foggia, Rome, Anzio, Po Valley and North \nApennines. They served in Europe, North Africa and the Pacific Theater. \nOne was wounded in Germany, and another was captured as a prisoner of \nwar.\n  Many of these veterans earned Purple Hearts, including one with three \nBattle Stars. One of our veterans went on to serve in both Korea and \nVietnam, retiring in 1967.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in honoring these 88 veterans, all \nLouisiana heroes, who we welcome to Washington this weekend and \nLouisiana HonorAir for making these trips a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10318-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROBERT ROTH\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to \nacknowledge the life and work of a very ordinary, yet extraordinary, \nAmerican named Bob Roth of Bristow, VA. Bob died of cancer earlier this \nyear, at the young age of 44, leaving behind a wife of 19 years and \nfive young children. His was one of far too many vibrant young lives \ncut short by this terrible disease. As was his way in life, Bob fought \ncancer to the very end attacking the disease as ferociously as it \nattacked him.\n  Recent developments in the FBI anthrax case had brought the case back \ninto the media in the last month. I want to pause and recognize that \nthe recent breaks in the case were built upon the hard work of Special \nAgent Roth and his team. Many of us remember what it was like on \nCapitol Hill in October of 2001 when an anthrax-laced letter appeared \nin Senator Daschle's office and another in Senator Leahy's office. \nSpores were found at the U.S. Supreme Court, and postal workers who \nhandled the letters died from inhalation. No one felt entirely safe \nfrom one of the most deadly germs known to man.\n  The FBI was immediately on the case, and a September 2003 Washington \nPost article explained their approach in the following manner:\n\n       To run the anthrax case day to day, Assistant FBI director \n     Van Harp turned to veteran FBI agent Bob Roth whose \n     meticulous style mirrored his own. Roth sometimes referred to \n     himself as a cops-and-robbers kind of guy, best suited to \n     pursuing the mobsters, embezzlers and kidnappers who had \n     always been the FBI's bread and butter. But this case posed \n     an entirely new set of challenges, and Roth was willing to \n     try almost anything to solve it .  .  . the FBI's \n     frustrations with the case were palpable. At one meeting at \n     the Washington field office, agents talked candidly about the \n     toll the long hours were exacting on their families. Roth \n     vented, too, groaning to no one in particular, ``Get me out \n     of this.''\n\n  But he never asked to get out. Long after the media lost interest, \nAgent Roth worked tirelessly. As the FBI slogged through one of the \nmost complicated, high-profile cases it ever faced, Agent Bob Roth \nserved his country as a pioneer in the efforts to fight domestic \nterrorism and weapons of mass destruction. He literally risked his life \ninvestigating scenes and evidence from the anthrax case. He was later \nhonored by being promoted to Assistant Section Chief of the Bureau's \nnewly created Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate. It was a role he \nhad little time to address because he spent the last year of his life \nfighting against his own personal WMD: multiple myeloma, an aggressive \nbone cancer.\n  Bob was an exemplary father, devoted husband, committed Christian, \ncommunity leader, and Government servant. He served 16 years for the \nFBI and was highly commended and decorated for his exceptional life and \nunfailing integrity, for his leadership and excellence in his \nprofession for his inspiring example as a devoted husband and loving \nfather to five beautiful children for his character and long service to \nour country, and for his pioneering efforts in fighting against weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  I ask that the Congressional Record reflect the impressive \ncontributions made by Special Agent Robert Roth to his country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10318-3", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10318-S10319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARY KEATING\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I celebrate the life of \nMary Keating, who, until she passed away last October, was a proud \nresident of the city and great State of New York for nearly 78 years. \nMary first came to America at the young age of 17, far from her home \nand her family in Derry, Kilshanny, County Clare, Ireland. Not long \nafter she arrived, she met and married Martin Keating, who also hailed \nfrom County Clare. She and Martin shared many passions, most notably \ntheir love for their family, their friends, and their deep, abiding \nfaith in God. While neither of them were musicians, they relished the \nIrish country sets of their native Clare and carried them with them to \nthis country, eventually to meet and dance them on the Rockaway Beach \nboardwalks, which as far as they were concerned was simply the last \nparish in Clare. As one of her youngest grandchildren, Ronan, observed, \nif you visited their home you would find a layer of dust on the top of \nthe knob on their radio because it had not been moved from its resting \nspot on the Irish music station in decades.\n  Music was not the only way that Mary celebrated her Irish heritage. \nIt also could be found in her love to entertain friends and family. It \nwas well known in their neighborhood and beyond that there was always \nan extra spot at the dinner table in the Keating home. As Mary would \nsay, ``what is one extra potato in the pot?'' One could never visit her \nhome without enjoying at least a cup of tea and an assortment of food. \nThree generations of Keatings grew up savoring her specialties such \nIrish soda bread, turnips, and leg of lamb. Much to their chagrin, her \ndaughters and granddaughters have never been able to make a soda bread \nhalf as delicious as Mary's, simply because the ``recipe'' was all done \nby taste and memory. As her granddaughter Kristin noted, the only one \nof Mary's dishes her grandchildren will not miss is her ``lumpy'' \nmashed potatoes, especially since Martin was a firm believer in the \nnotion that children should finish everything they are served.\n  Mary will be remembered by all who knew her as a strong and caring \nwoman\n\n[[Page S10319]]\n\nwho lived a life guided by her faith and values. Long before recycling \nbecame the politically correct thing to do, Mary Keating saved and \nreused every bread bag, rubber band, piece of tinfoil, and jar she ever \nbrought into the house. Old jelly jars were magically transformed into \nmilk glasses and bread bags were used to store everything from school \nlunch to sea shells from Rockaway Beach.\n  Even though Mary has left this world, her legacy will continue \nthrough the lives and work of her 8 children, 20 grandchildren, and 24 \ngreat-grandchildren. I know this because her granddaughter, Kathleen \nKeating Strottman, served as my staff for over 7 years and I saw many \nof these traits in her. In honor of Mary's Irish heritage, I would like \nto close my remarks with the refrain of an Irish ballad, ``The Lovely \nRose of Clare'':\n\n       Oh my lovely rose of Clare, you're the sweetest girl I \n     know, You're the queen of all the roses, the pretty flowers \n     that grow, You are the sunshine of my life, so beautiful and \n     fair, And I will always love you, my lovely rose of \n     Clare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10319-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10319-S10320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING HUSSON COLLEGE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I honor one of the jewels of \nMaine higher education, Husson College, in Bangor, ME, which will \nofficially make its much-anticipated transition to Husson University on \nOctober 11, 2008.\n  I know I join with countless Husson students and alumni from \npractically every town in Maine, as well as from around the country and \nthe world, in expressing my deep-seated pride in what Husson College \nhas accomplished since its founding in 1898 by Chesley Husson, and for \nwhat it will achieve in the years ahead as Husson University. Although \nthe name has changed, the longstanding hallmarks of Husson which have \nserved its students so exceptionally well for 110 years will not only \nremain the same, but will also be strengthened more than ever. A \nbroader-based institution than it was just 20 years ago, Husson--at \nthis watershed moment of becoming a university--secures an even greater \npresence on the educational landscape, offering multiple degrees \nthrough various schools and bolstering its overall capacity to bring to \nits students a wide range of dynamic and diverse programs, especially \nat the graduate level.\n  From the dawn of the 20th century to the beginning of the 21st, \nHusson has, at its core, strived to prepare its graduates for success \nin life and in professional careers, by cultivating a learning \ndiscipline, regimen, and environment tailored to each student that \nultimately facilitates individual growth and progress. Ushering Husson \nCollege--now Husson University--into the 21st century is, fittingly, \nits 21st president, Dr. Bill Beardsley, who, since 1987, has been \ncontinually drawing from Husson's rich past, while simultaneously \nfocusing on what lies just over the horizon.\n  With Bill's unsurpassed vision, Husson is still--and will forever \nbe--an institution focused on teaching rather than research--a place \nfor imparting and acquiring knowledge that both fosters student \ndevelopment and equips its graduates with the educational tools to be \nvalued civic and business leaders. Furthermore, because of Bill's \nunparalleled reputation and ingenuity as an innovator, Husson has also \nbeen at the forefront of developing a cutting-edge curriculum that \ntakes into account marketplace changes, demographic shifts, and \neconomic trends. So, it is little wonder that under Bill's vibrant and \neffective leadership, Husson has more than tripled its matriculation of \nfreshman students, more than doubled its number of tradition-\nal undergraduates--when considering those attending the New England \nSchool of Communications--and has undergone a stunning expansion on its \ncampus to accommodate new schools and programs, not to mention more \nalumni.\n  Nothing speaks more to Husson's tradition of commitment to the \nstudent--and the primacy of a hands-on education that is accessible and \naffordable--than a student-to-teacher ratio that is an exceptional 19 \nto 1, 70 faculty members dedicated only to teaching in the classroom, \nand tuition costs that are purposely kept from skyrocketing, and where \nnearly 90 percent of Husson students qualify to receive Federal, State, \ncommunity, or campus-based financial aid.\n  Additionally, as Husson espouses a teaching emphasis emblematic of a \ncollege, it offers curriculum possibilities that integrate liberal arts \nand sciences, professional and technical studies, and learning outside \nthe classroom that are indicative of its status as a university. Many \nschools may offer degrees in business, but at Husson, that area of \nstudy can be specialized to include not only financial management, but \nalso hospitality management, small/family business management, and \nsports management--compelling and rigorous pathways of learning that \ncan be significantly attractive to highly-motivated, professionally-\ncentered students.\n  As Chair and now ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreurship, I can tell you firsthand that this \napproach to business education that creates greater personalization \nyields benefits in an increasingly competitive marketplace for \nemployers and prospective employees alike. And those rewards extend \nbeyond the boundaries of business classes.\n  For example, how many schools nationwide have a chemistry major that \ncontains a prepharmacy track or paralegal studies or boatbuilding \ntechnology program or graduate programs in nursing, physical therapy, \noccupational therapy, and a graduate course of study in pharmacy being \ndeveloped? And how many institutions would have responded to a medical \nshortage in underserved, rural areas that could not afford a doctor \nwith the vision of producing nurse practitioners? But that is precisely \nwhat Husson did in 1981 when it partnered with Eastern Maine Medical \nCenter to establish the Husson College/Eastern Maine Medical Center \nBaccalaureate School of Nursing.\n  Husson is continually assessing and examining ways to be of greater \nvalue both to its students and the communities Husson serves. Husson's \ndesire to address real-world challenges by innovatively calibrating \nfields of discipline is in part what makes Husson stand out--and \nfrankly unique--in the pantheon of small universities.\n  And just as Husson looks to meet its students more than halfway in \ndeveloping their academic, individualized pursuits, Husson also \nendeavors to make receiving a Husson education more achievable for more \nMaine students with its education centers in South Portland, Presque \nIsle, and just recently, The Boat School in Eastport, ME, as well as \nUnobskey College, located in Calais, ME.\n  And as much as Husson provides to its students, its graduates return \nthe favor with an allegiance and a desire to give back to their alma \nmater that is awe inspiring. There is a story that Bill Beardsley \nrecounted recently in a Bangor Metro article about a young man, the \nfirst of his family to attend college and a Husson student, who is able \nto attend Husson because of a gift from his grandfather. But the young \nman came to Bill because that money was running out and to explain his \nsituation. Dr. Beardsley knew he was a good student and a credit to the \nHusson community.\n  Between the two of them, they were determined to find a solution. \nBill offered, among other items, a small loan. Together, they made it \nwork, which is truly the Husson way, treating every student personally \nand as an individual, whether it is considering one's major to arriving \nat a payment plan in order to spur their trajectories as students and \nas human beings.\n  It is been a long time since Husson's days of preparing students for \ncareers in commerce, teaching and telegraphy, or since it purchased a \ndairy farm that it converted beautifully into its present idyllic \ncampus. And bridging the span of those years are Paul Husson, Chesley \nHusson's grandson, who still works at the university, and Husson \ngraduate and legend, Clara Swan, former Husson coach, athletic \ndirector, professor, and Dean for whom the Swan Center is named.\n  They understand better than anyone that, while Husson may transition \nfrom a college to a university, and even though new disciplines may \nemerge, the Husson experience and outlook on education endures, from--\nto paraphrase part of the Husson mission statement--its dedication to \nexcellence in teaching, its adherence to forging a personalized \ncollegiate experience with\n\n[[Page S10320]]\n\nits students, its development of individual self-worth, and a \ncurriculum which promotes clear thinking and communication skills.\n  The college that time and again was the defining force behind so many \nstudents and graduates in the last century will now be the university \nthat will propel new generations into this age and beyond, and it will \ndo so with the same bedrock foundation that places the individual \neducation of each student first and the forward-looking focus that \nenables Husson students and graduates to set and reach any goal. Husson \nUniversity understands, conveys, and puts into action what the English \npoet, Robert Browning, once so eloquently expressed in words ``a man's \nreach should exceed his grasp or what's a Heaven for?''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10320-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FISHMAN REALTY GROUP\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize Fishman Realty \nGroup of Portland, a 12 person real estate firm providing vital \nassistance to naval personnel transitioning from Brunswick Naval Air \nStation in my home State of Maine as a result of the 2005 Base \nRealignment and Closure round. In this effort, Fishman Realty Group \nmanages the Army Corps of Engineers' Homeowners' Assistance Program, a \ncrucial initiative that enables departing Navy personnel to sell their \nhomes to the Federal government. In turn, service members and their \nfamilies are able to purchase homes elsewhere without missing a step in \nnot only their service, but also their livelihood. Given the housing \ncrisis our country is currently facing, fostering a smooth transition \nfor our service members is an absolute necessity.\n  With the Brunswick Naval air Station slated for closure in 2011, the \nprospect that our current precarious housing market would hinder naval \nfamilies from selling their homes is certainly unsettling. For \ninstance, service members reassigned to another base could potentially \nface large losses on their homes--impeding the ability of these men and \nwomen to purchase homes elsewhere and continue their duties.\n  That is why Fishman Realty Group has proven to be a beacon in \ncombating markets depressed by crumbling housing prices. Through the \nHomeowners' Assistance Program, Fishman Realty Group is responsible for \nmaintaining and listing the properties that the government has acquired \nfrom the departing personnel, preventing financial loss for their \nfamilies, and protecting an already depressed market from further \neconomic turmoil. As the sailors of Brunswick Naval Air Station depart, \nthey need not fear that their homes will become financial burdens.\n  The effort of Fishman Realty Group is a shining example of how small \nbusinesses can make a tangible and tremendous difference during an \neconomic downturn. Founded by Alan Fishman in 1987, Fishman Realty \nGroup offers full service real estate brokering and property management \nthroughout the greater Portland area. Additionally, the firm couples \nthese offerings with local appraisers, lenders, and engineers; and \nfacilitates transactions within and around the Portland community. In \nthese challenging times for the housing market, it is a testament to \nFishman Realty Group's business integrity that it reaches out to help \nmilitary families, demonstrating that their business ethic is \nfundamentally grounded in putting others first.\n  In 21 years of service to Portland communities, Fishman Realty Group \nhas transformed landscapes and expanded opportunities for hundreds of \nbusinesses and families. I wish Fishman Realty Group and its employees \ncontinued success, and I thank them for their commitment to the \ncommunity of Brunswick Naval Air Station.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10320-2", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNITED RADIO BROADCASTERS\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to briefly discuss \nsome of the amazing efforts broadcasters have made and are currently \nundertaking not due to government mandates or regulation, but rather as \nstewards of the public airwaves and as proud members of their local \ncommunities.\n  We all know how my home State and our gulf neighbors were ravaged by \nthe 2005 hurricane season. What many do not realize however is that our \nlocal broadcasters performed heroically during this traumatic time. \nDespite personal losses and risks to their own safety, broadcasters \nworked feverishly to keep their signals on the air before, during, and \nafter these devastating storms. Their efforts in the wake of Hurricane \nKatrina literally proved to be a life line to many victims who were \nstranded by the storm.\n  Even when towers did go down during Katrina, the citizens of \nLouisiana witnessed a rare phenomenon in today's world. Radio \nbroadcasters, who were competitors just the day before, banded together \ncombining resources and personnel to establish the United Radio \nBroadcasters of New Orleans. By putting aside self interests, the \nUnited Radio Broadcasters were able to keep the citizens of Louisiana \nup to date with vital and even life saving information.\n  Today, we continue to see similar efforts benefiting communities \nacross the country. For example, in a recent edition of Radio Guide, \nthere is an inspiring article about steps one broadcaster is taking to \nimprove its connection to the local community in times of need. Clear \nChannel has unveiled a series of emergency response teams that can be \ndeployed to areas hit by natural disasters. Specifically, these teams \noperate as radio stations on wheels. Armed with mobile towers, \ngenerators, satellite/Internet connectivity, and other radio \ninfrastructure needs, they have the ability to keep a station on the \nair even if the station's permanent studio or tower is knocked out of \ncommission. Some of these emergency assets were successfully deployed \nin Baton Rouge during Hurricane Gustav last month. While it is my hope \nthat these capabilities rarely, if ever, have to be used, it is \ncomforting to know they are at the ready.\n  This endeavor and similar investments being made by broadcasters \nacross the country represent a strong commitment to serving local \ncommunities. While many here in Washington want to increase the level \nof regulation placed upon local broadcasters, I would point out that \nthe examples I spoke of today were not dictated from some federal \nagency. Rather, these efforts were voluntarily undertaken by the men \nand women who are committed to serving the needs of their local \nlisteners.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10320-3", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10320-4", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10320-5", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10320-S10321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING RECESS ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2008\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2008, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on September 29, 2008, during the recess \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Hoyer) had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 2162.

A bill to require the Federal Communications Commission to \nprovide for a short-term extension of the analog television \nbroadcasting authority so that essential public safety announcements \nand digital television transition information may be provided for a \nshort time during the transition to digital television broadcasting; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Short-\nterm Analog Flash and Emergency Readiness Act. This simple piece of \nlegislation will help make sure those consumers who fail to make the \ntransition to Digital Television, DTV, by February 17, 2009 are not \nleft without access to emergency information. This bill will also allow \nthose consumers to understand what steps they need to take in order to \nrestore their television signals.\n  I voted against the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which directs that \non February 18, 2009, over-the-air full-power television broadcasts, \nwhich are currently provided by television stations in both analog and \ndigital formats, will become digital only. I voted against this bill in \nboth the Commerce Committee and during its consideration by the full \nSenate because it failed to address the core policy questions of the \nimplementation of the transition to DTV. Specifically, it did not \nadequately address the minimization of consumer disruption and the \nestablishment a national interoperable communications network with the \nanalog spectrum that broadcasters were vacating. I was one of only \nthree ``No'' votes in Committee.\n  When the Commerce Committee passed its portion of the Deficit \nReduction Act of 2005, the then-Republican majority on the Committee \ndid not want to spend significant resources on the DTV transition to \nminimize consumer disruption. Nor, did they want to spend any resources \non building a national interoperable public safety communications \nnetwork. The only thing that mattered to Republicans in 2005 was \ngenerating sufficient money to meet our budget reconciliation \ninstructions. Because the Committee failed to set forth coherent policy \nobjectives in 2005, consumers and our Nation's first responders will \nbear the brunt of that failure.\n  I believe that many have forgotten why we moved forward with the DTV \ntransition. It was to free up much needed spectrum to create a national \ninteroperable public safety communications network. I know the people \nof West Virginia strongly support their first responders and would have \ngladly accepted that transition to make sure that in times of crisis \nour local police, fire, and emergency response teams could communicate. \nInstead, the DTV transition has been sold as nothing more than having a \nbetter television picture. That is unfortunate because we are making \nthis transition to address a critical public safety need--one \nidentified by the 9/11 Commission.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Communications Commission still has not \ndevised a plan to establish this national public safety communications \nnetwork. The spectrum has been auctioned and the big wireless companies \nhave secured their futures. But our nation's first responders, which \nshould have been this Administration's first priority, are not much \ncloser to achieving interoperable communications.\n  As my good friend FCC Commissioner Michael Copps has stated, ``the \nquestion of public safety is . . . the first obligation of the public \nservant.'' In a\n\n[[Page S10325]]\n\nmore perfect world, our nation's first responders would already have \naccess to an interoperable and fully-funded broadband network that \nmakes use of dedicated public safety spectrum. We are still a long way \nfrom developing this network for public safety, and that is something \nof which we all should be ashamed. If we fail to establish this network \nquickly and in a manner that works for the public safety community, I \nam afraid we may have lost the opportunity forever.\n  This Administration has failed consumers as well. In 2005, Congress \nleft almost all of the implementation of the transition to the private \nsector--broadcasters, cable and satellite companies, and consumer \nelectronics retailers. Although well-heeled industries state that they \nhave devoted hundreds of millions of dollars to making Americans aware \nof the DTV transition, I am not sure that it is going to minimize the \ndisruption.\n  The recent DTV transition test market of Wilmington, North Carolina \ndemonstrated that, even with extraordinary levels of outreach, some did \nnot know about the DTV transition. I would note that Wilmington \nreceived far more attention than any market in West Virginia is likely \nto receive, or any other part of the country for that matter.\n  Even if a consumer was aware of the DTV transition, several thousand \npeople called into the FCC for assistance--they could not set up their \nbox, they could not receive certain digital signals, or their antennae \nneeded adjustment, to name just a few of the problems. Consumers, \nespecially the elderly and those with limited English proficiency, are \ngoing to need help in managing the transition.\n  Among its many shortcomings, the DTV Act did not require the Federal \nagencies charged with administering the transition to develop a program \nto assist consumers with attaching the converter boxes to their sets. \nBy contrast, in the United Kingdom, there is an assistance program, \nknown as ``Help Scheme,'' that will assist a many as 7 million \nhouseholds with selecting, installing, and using DTV equipment.\n  Unfortunately, in the remaining time before the transition, we are \nnot going to be able to replicate the United Kingdom's consumer \nassistance plan. But, we may be able to take small steps that can help \nconsumers.\n  My legislation is one such step. It simply allows the FCC to permit \nanalog television signals to be broadcast for thirty days after the \ntransition so that, at a minimum, one station in a market can send a \nsignal explaining what has happened to a consumer's television signal \nand how to restore that signal. Far more importantly, it will allow the \nbroadcast of emergency information so that people are aware of \nimpending storms, floods, or other emergencies.\n  This was done in the Wilmington television market and people found it \nto be beneficial. A hurricane almost hit Wilmington around the time of \nits DTV transition. Because it was a test market, the government would \nhave had the luxury of postponing the transition if a hurricane struck \nthe region. On February 18, 2009, Americans left in the dark will not \nhave that luxury. They would not know if a Nor'easter is on its way, or \ncatastrophic flooding is occurring, or if a terrorist has once again \ntruck our Nation.\n  We cannot let that happen. We must pass this legislation before we \nadjourn for the year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 3665. A bill to amend chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, \nto modify the rate of accrual of annual leave for administrative law \njudges, contract appeals board members, and immigration judges; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill to enhance \nthe annual leave for Administrative Law Judges, Contract Board of \nAppeals Judges, and Immigration Law Judges in the Federal Government. I \nwant to thank Senator Pryor for his support of this bill.\n  Prior to 2004 Federal employees with less than three years of Federal \nservice accrued annual leave at a rate of 4 hours per biweekly pay \nperiod. Employees with 3 to 15 years of service accrued leave at a rate \nof 6 hours per pay period, and those with over 15 years of service \naccrued leave at a rate of 8 hours.\n  As part of the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2004, Congress \nchanged the leave accrual rate for new mid-career employees, allowing \nagency heads to deem a period of qualified non-federal career \nexperience for an individual an equal period of service performed by \nFederal employee. In addition, the act stated that all senior \nexecutives and other senior level employees shall accrue annual leave \nat the maximum rate of 8 hours for each bi-weekly pay period.\n  In the past, ALJs, CBAJs, IJs and members of the Senior Executive \nService have been treated similarly. However, the Office of Personnel \nManagement is now taking the position that these judges should not \nreceive the same leave benefits as members of the SES since they are \nnot under a pay for performance system. In addition to my general \nconcerns over pay for performance, I believe it is inappropriate for \nALJs, CBAJs, and IJs to be in such a system as it could threaten their \nindependence. In fact, ALJs and CBAJs are not allowed to receive bonus \nawards for this very reason.\n  Given the shortage of ALJs to adjudicate social security benefits and \nthe need to recruit more immigrations judges, I believe that Congress \nshould act to provide these judges with enhanced leave benefits.\n  I am pleased that this bill has the support of the Association of \nAdministrative Law Judges, the International Federation of Professional \nand Technical Engineers, the National Association of Immigration \nJudges, and the Senior Executives Association.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3665\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ACCRUAL RATE OF ANNUAL LEAVE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE \n                   LAW JUDGES, CONTRACT APPEALS BOARD MEMBERS, AND \n                   IMMIGRATION JUDGES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 6303 of title 5, United States \n     Code, is amended by striking subsection (f) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, \n     the rate of accrual of annual leave under subsection (a) \n     shall be 1 day for each full biweekly pay period in the case \n     of any employee who--\n       ``(1) holds a position which is subject to--\n       ``(A) section 5372, 5372a, 5376, or 5383; or\n       ``(B) a pay system equivalent to a pay system to which any \n     provision under paragraph (1) applies, as determined by the \n     Office of Personnel Management; or\n       ``(2) is an immigration judge as defined under section \n     101(b)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1101(b)(4)).''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect on the first day of the first applicable \n     pay period beginning on or after 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 3666. A bill to require certain metal recyclers to keep records of \ntheir transactions in order to deter individuals and enterprises \nengaged in theft and interstate fencing of stolen copper, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my friend \nfrom Minnesota, Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Copper Theft Prevention Act \nof 2008. I am pleased to be working with Senator Klobuchar on this \ninitiative to curb copper theft, which is on the rise in our country \nand around the world.\n  We are living in tough economic times where the value of precious \nmetals is at an all time high. Due to worldwide economic growth, \nparticularly in fast-growing China, copper is worth between $3 to $4 a \npound. Copper is used in the manufacturing of consumer goods, and the \nconstruction, electric utility, and telecommunications industries. \nBecause of the metal's high ductility, malleability, and electrical \nconductivity, copper has become the benchmark for all types of wiring.\n  Stolen copper can easily be turned into cash and a very small \npercentage of people who steal copper are actually caught. It's no \nwonder why thieves are stealing copper in every form--costing Americans \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in theft, damage, and threats to \nsafety.\n\n[[Page S10326]]\n\n  To steal a large amount of copper quickly and safely, thieves target \nspools on the back of trucks and storage yards. This was evidenced \nseveral months ago in Ogden, Utah, when a thief stole a 1,700-pound \nload of copper from a metal yard apparently using the metal company's \nCaterpillar excavator to load it into his truck. I am aware of another \noccurrence in Utah County where a man was arrested for repeatedly \nstealing copper wiring nearly every week from a construction company. \nThe thief would load his truck with the wire, then sell it anywhere \nbetween $800 and $1,200. The actual value of the wire is more than \n$18,000.\n  Some of the most dangerous places to steal copper wire are from \nsubstations and from utility poles. According to an April 2007 report \npublished by the U.S. Department of Energy entitled, ``An Assessment of \nCopper Wire Thefts from Electric Utilities,'' thefts at substations and \nutility poles are\n\n       related to the large number of methamphetamine users who \n     are stealing copper wire. Medical studies have shown that \n     this drug reduces the ability of the brain to assess risk \n     before taking action; hence users of this drug are not \n     concerned about the risks involved in stealing wire from high \n     voltage substations, utility wires, and transformers. The \n     people who risk their life to steal copper wire from a \n     substation typically only receive a few hundred dollars from \n     the sale of the stolen wire, sufficient for the next drug \n     fix. Thefts from storage sites and trucks are most likely \n     done by professional criminal and not the drug abusers. \n     Storage sites and trucks are also more difficult to break \n     into than an unguarded substation or utility pole.\n\n  We must cut off the incentives that fuel such blatant criminal \nactivity, and I believe the proposed legislation goes a long way in \naccomplishing this goal. Under the proposed bill, scrap metal dealers \nwould be: required to keep records of copper transactions, including \nthe name and address of the seller, the date of the transaction, the \nquantity and description of the copper being purchased, an identifying \nnumber from a driver's license or other government-issued \nidentification and, where possible, the make, model and tag number of \nthe vehicle used to deliver the copper to the scrap dealer.\n  Required to maintain these records for a minimum of 1 year from the \ndate of the transaction and make them available to law enforcement \nagencies for use in tracking down and prosecuting copper theft crimes.\n  Required to perform transactions of more than $250 by check, rather \nthan cash.\n  Subject to civil penalties of up to $10,000 for failing to document a \ntransaction or engaging in cash transactions of more than $250.\n  Let me be clear--the bill does not preempt States from enacting their \nown laws. Indeed, the proposed legislation provides a baseline from \nwhich all States must operate.\n  On this point, Utah law currently requires anyone selling certain \nmetals to provide identification before the sale is final. Some in Utah \nwould like to tighten the law to include additional regulation and \nlegislators would not be precluded from doing so. Indeed, States can \nenact more robust legislation as necessary.\n  I am committed to moving this legislation forward and hope that my \ncolleagues will join our effort to refine and enact this important bill \nas it moves through the legislative process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 3668. A bill to create a grant program for collaboration programs \nthat ensure coordination among criminal justice agencies, adult \nprotective services agencies, victim assistance programs, and other \nagencies or organizations providing services to individuals with \ndisabilities in the investigation and response to abuse of or crimes \ncommitted against such individuals; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Crime Victims \nwith Disabilities Act of 2008.\n  Adults with disabilities experience violence or abuse at least twice \nas often as people without disabilities, and adults with developmental \ndisabilities are at risk of being physically or sexually assaulted at \nrates four to ten times greater than other adults. In fact, an \nestimated 5 million crimes are committed annually against persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities and an estimated 70 percent of these crimes \nare not reported.\n  Adding insult to injury, individuals with disabilities suffer \nadditional ``victimization'' within the justice system, due to lack of \nphysical, programmatic, and communications accommodations needed for \nequal access.\n  The Crime Victims with Disabilities Act takes a commonsense approach \nto fixing this problem by providing funds to increase the \ninvestigation, prosecution, and prevention of crimes against persons \nwith disabilities and by facilitating collaboration among criminal \njustice agencies and other agencies and organizations that provide \nservices to people with disabilities to improve services to those who \nare victimized.\n  Collaboration among criminal justice agencies and agencies and \norganizations that provide services to individuals with disabilities is \nnecessary to ensure that crimes are reported and investigated properly, \nprosecutors are properly trained, appropriate accommodations are \nprovided to disabled victims, and communication between criminal \njustice agencies and organizations that provide services to individuals \nwith disabilities is effective.\n  The bill funds a modest grant program that would allow States, units \nof local government, and Indian Tribes to develop programs to \nfacilitate collaboration among criminal justice agencies and agencies \nand organizations that provide services to individuals with \ndisabilities for these purposes. The bill authorizes $50,000 for each \nplanning grant and $300,000 for each implementation grant for a total \nauthorization for the grant program of $10 million for the first year.\n  The bill also authorizes $4 million over 4 years to fund research to \nassist the Attorney General in collecting valid, reliable national data \nrelating to crimes against individuals with developmental and related \ndisabilities for the National Crime Victims Survey conducted by the \nBureau of Justice Statistics of the Department of Justice as required \nby the Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act. Currently, the \nBureau of Justice Statistics does not specifically collect this data, \nleaving many crimes against persons with disabilities unreported in the \nsurvey and making it difficult to address this problem adequately.\n  The Association of University Centers on Disabilities, the National \nCenter for Victims of Crime, the National Council on Independent \nLiving, the National Disability Rights Network, the National Child \nAbuse Coalition, Easter Seals, the Arc of the United States, and United \nCerebral Palsy have endorsed the bill. I hope my colleagues will join \nme in supporting this bill which will protect some of the most \nvulnerable members of our society--individuals with disabilities who \nare victims of crime.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3668\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Crime Victims with \n     Disabilities Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Adults with disabilities experience violence or abuse \n     at least twice as often as people without disabilities, and \n     adults with developmental disabilities are at risk of being \n     physically or sexually assaulted at rates four to ten times \n     greater than other adults.\n       (2) Individuals with disabilities suffer from additional \n     ``victimization'' within the justice system, due to lack of \n     physical, programmatic, and communications accommodations \n     needed for equal access.\n       (3) Women with disabilities are more likely to be \n     victimized, to experience more severe and prolonged violence, \n     and to suffer more serious and chronic effects from that \n     violence, than women without such disabilities.\n       (4) Sixty-eight to 83 percent of women with developmental \n     disabilities will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime.\n       (5) An estimated 5,000,000 crimes are committed against \n     individuals with developmental disabilities annually.\n       (6) Over 70 percent of crimes committed against individuals \n     with developmental disabilities are not reported.\n       (7) Studies in the United States, Canada, Australia, and \n     Great Britain consistently show that victims with \n     developmental disabilities suffer repeated victimization \n     because so few of the crimes against them are reported.\n       (8) The National Crime Victims Survey conducted annually by \n     the Bureau of Justice\n\n[[Page S10327]]\n\n     Statistics of the Department of Justice, does not \n     specifically collect data relating to crimes against \n     individuals with developmental disabilities, nor do they use \n     disability as a demographic variable as they use other \n     important demographic variables, such as gender, age, and \n     racial and ethnic membership.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The purpose of this Act is to increase the \n     awareness, investigation, prosecution, and prevention of \n     crimes against individuals with a disability, including \n     developmental disabilities, and improve services to those who \n     are victimized, by facilitating collaboration among the \n     criminal justice system and a range of agencies and other \n     organizations that provide services to individuals with \n     disabilities.\n       (b) Need for Collaboration.--Collaboration among the \n     criminal justice system and agencies and other organizations \n     that provide services to individuals with disabilities is \n     needed to--\n       (1) protect individuals with disabilities by ensuring that \n     crimes are reported, and that reported crimes are actively \n     investigated by both law enforcement agencies and agencies \n     and other organizations that provide services to individuals \n     with disabilities;\n       (2) provide prosecutors and victim assistance organizations \n     with adequate training to ensure that crimes against \n     individuals with disabilities are appropriately and \n     effectively addressed in court;\n       (3) identify and ensure that appropriate reasonable \n     accommodations are provided to individuals with disabilities \n     in a safe and conducive environment, allowing crimes to be \n     reported accurately to law enforcement agencies; and\n       (4) promote communication among criminal justice agencies, \n     and agencies and other organizations that provide services to \n     individuals with disabilities, including Victim Assistance \n     Organizations, to ensure that the needs of crime victims with \n     disabilities are met.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to reduce gas prices by promoting domestic energy \nproduction, alternative energy, and conservation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Harmonizing America's Energy, Economy, Environment, and National \nSecurity Act, that I believe can lead our Nation out of the current \nenergy crisis.\n\n[[Page S10329]]\n\n  Much of the Nation's attention has understandably been focused on the \nfinancial turmoil taking place on Wall Street. Since the very \nbeginning, I have been hard at work in addressing the financial crisis \nand I will be supporting the economic stabilization bill when the \nSenate votes tonight.\n  But I will vote with a heavy heart, for I have spent my entire career \nfocusing on eliminating debt at the local, State and Federal level. \nWhile deciding to vote for a package of this magnitude feels like being \npunched in the gut, the thought of what would happen to average \nAmericans if we did nothing is much more painful. I am, however, very \npleased to see that any profit we may make off this deal will be used \nto pay down the national debt.\n  This is affecting not only Wall Street but Main Street and my street. \nOhioans depend on credit to buy a home, drive to work and send their \nchildren to school. If this doesn't pass, the possible ramifications \nare staggering. Imagine if you can, businesses laying off staff or \nclosing completely because they can't make payroll; retirement funds \nthat have already taken a dramatic hit being reduced to nothing; \nparents unable to get a loan to pay for child's college tuition; \nfamilies unable to get credit for a car or a house; cities unable to \nfloat bonds to build hospitals or schools; and home prices continuing \nto plummet.\n  We must act Mr. President. We must set aside our differences and our \nideologies and do what is right. But our work cannot stop here. We must \nmake a full-court press to stabilize the housing market and secure our \nenergy supplies. While we have been debating and acting on the \nfinancial crisis, our energy crisis has not only continued, but in many \nways grown worse. It remains an issue that needs to be addressed sooner \nrather than later, and if our economy is to quickly recover, a \ncomprehensive energy policy will need to be part of the equation.\n  I have heard loud and clear from thousands of Ohioans how this energy \ncrisis is directly affecting them and their loved ones. They are \nexpecting that we work together in bipartisan fashion to craft \nlegislation that will address our Nation's long-term energy \nrequirements.\n  Take for example, the severe fuel supply disruption created by our \nshortsighted offshore drilling policy and hurricanes Ike and Gustav. \nBoth hurricanes followed paths that paved straight through the heart of \nour Nation's offshore oil production and home to the bulk of our \nrefining capacity. Due to the frequency of gulf hurricanes, many oil \nexperts have pointed to this as a reason we need to open additional \nareas of the Outer Continental Shelf outside of the Gulf of Mexico. \nWith 25 percent of our oil production currently taking place within the \nGulf of Mexico, gulf hurricanes frequently lead to wild price spikes in \nthe gasoline market as oil rigs and refineries are taken off line to \navoid damage and loss of life.\n  According to the Energy Information Agency, Ike and Gustav lead to a \n25 percent drop in our domestic oil production compared to this time \nlast year, from 5.1 billion barrels a day to 3.8 billion barrels per \nday. The loss in refining capacity cut our gasoline inventories to \nlevels we have not seen since 1967, resulting in widespread fuel \nshortages that left many in the Southeast driving from gas station to \ngas station, desperate to find fuel for their cars. Much of the reason \nwhy these supply disruptions have not spread across the country is that \nwe have reached out and imported large quantities of gasoline from \noverseas. Some of which has undoubtedly come from countries like \nVenezuela, that do not have our best interests at heart.\n  This situation is cause for concern in its own right, but is also \nunderscored by the current financial crisis and the fact that this is \nno longer a question about the price of oil. Energy security is a \nmatter of national security.\n  We have clearly ignored our financial situation for far too long. The \nnational debt stands at $9.6 trillion, almost double the $5.4 trillion \ndebt that existed when the senator came to the Senate in 1999. By the \nend of 2009, the national debt is expected to have grown to $10.5 \ntrillion. The Congressional Budget Office said the Federal Government \nwill finish the fiscal year with a near-record deficit of $407 billion. \nThese numbers do not include borrowing from the Social Security Trust \nFund which would put the overall number close to $600 billion and $700 \nbillion by next year.\n  We cannot overlook our ballooning national debt. Today, 51 percent of \nthe privately-owned national debt is held by foreign creditors--mostly \nforeign central banks. Foreign creditors provided more than 70 percent \nof the funds that the U.S. has borrowed since 2001, according to the \nDepartment of Treasury. And who are these creditors?\n  According to the Treasury Department, the three largest foreign \nholders of U.S. debt are China, Japan, and OPEC Nations.\n  This is insane and it has to stop. We cannot afford to allow the \ncountries that control our oil and our debt to control our future.\n  Americans are hurting from our addiction to oil, I'm not sure they \nfully realize the extent our national security, and indeed our very way \nof life, is threatened by our reliance on foreign oil.\n  Every year we send billions of dollars overseas for oil to pad the \ncoffers of many Nations that wish our demise. In fact, in 2007, we \nspent more than $327 billion to import oil, and 60 percent of that, or \nnearly $200 billion, went to the oil-exporting OPEC nations. In 2008, \nthe amount we will spend to import oil is expected to double to more \nthan $600 billion, $360 billion of which will come from OPEC. Let's \ntake a moment to put those import figures into context. When compared \nto our FY2008 budget for our Nation's defense, which was more than $693 \nbillion, the $600 billion we will spend to import oil in 2008 is nearly \nequal to our entire defense budget.\n  There is no question that our dependence on foreign oil has serious \nnational security implications. In addition to funding our enemies--as \nI just explained--we cannot ignore the fact that much of our oil comes \nfrom and travels through the most volatile regions of the world.\n  A couple of years ago, I attended a series of war games hosted by the \nNational Defense University. I saw firsthand how our country's economy \ncould be brought to its knees if somebody cut off our oil.\n  In 2006, Hillard Huntington, Executive Director of Stanford \nUniversity's Energy Modeling Forum testified before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, and based on his modeling, ``the odds of a foreign \noil disruption happening over the next 10 years are slightly higher \n[than] 80 percent.'' He went on to testify that if global production \nwere reduced by merely 2.1 percent due to some event, that it would \nhave a more serious effect on oil prices and the economy than \nhurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  Let us take a moment to think of our Nation like a business. Our \nfeedstock is oil, and our of competitors control the cost of our oil. \nWe have debt, but our competitors also control our debt. What's to keep \nour competitors from raising prices, calling in our debt and running us \nout of business?\n  I hope this scenario scares you as much as it scares me.\n  But also keep in mind, that as Congress sat here and twiddle its \nthumbs over simply expanding domestic drilling within our own borders, \nRussia and China were actively and aggressively laying claim to energy \nresources around the globe.\n  Russia, the world's second biggest oil exporter, has its sights on a \nlarge section of the Arctic seafloor that is believed to contain \nbillion of barrels of fuel equivalent. The country has also made moves \nto control a larger portion of the world's natural gas reserves. \nRussia, which has significant reserves of natural gas, is considering \nthe creation of a natural gas cartel similar to OPEC. Venezuela and \nIran have expressed interest.\n  Russia has proven it has no qualms with using energy as a weapon. In \n1990, Russia tried to suppress independence movements in the Baltics by \ncutting energy supplies. In all, Russia has used energy as a tool to \nfurther their foreign policy goals on no less than six countries. \nEnergy is believed to be one of the driving reasons for Russia's \nmilitary action in the independent nation of Georgia.\n  China as well is moving ahead in securing its energy future. In \nAfrica, China is handing out loans and funding\n\n[[Page S10330]]\n\nexpansive infrastructure projects in an effort to lay claim to \nlucrative oil reserves. With the help of Chinese investment, Angola \nrecently passed Nigeria to become the largest petroleum producer on the \ncontinent.\n  I am going to be brutally honest with you folks, the future of our \ncountry is in jeopardy. We cannot continue to transfer our wealth \noverseas to this degree without expecting serious consequences. Rather \nthan addressing these national security concerns we have been living \nthe life of Riley, and allowed the environmental movement to run wild.\n  Congress let them get away with. We let them get away with it Mr. \nPresident. Why? Because oil was cheap and so Congress felt no urgency \nto act. Well, oil is not cheap anymore. While detrimental to our \neconomy and competitiveness, the high price of oil finally spurred some \nof my colleagues into action and I am proud that Congress has taken \nsome steps to address the energy crisis.\n  The recently passed fiscal year 2009 Continuing Resolution removed \nthe moratoria on oil exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf and \nmoratorium on regulations for the development of oil shale. Reserves in \nthe Outer Continental Shelf are believed to equal 8.5 billion barrels \nof oil, and undiscovered resources could equal ten times that. There \nare currently 800 billion barrels of technically recoverable reserves \nlocked up in our Nation's oil shale. This is three times larger than \nthe total proven oil reserves of Saudi Arabia.\n  The Senate has also passed a tax extenders package that includes many \nincentives to develop advanced alternative energies that will lead our \ncountry to a future free of oil. Included in the package were popular \ntax credits for the wind and solar industry that have helped foster \nstrong emerging industries in my home State of Ohio.\n  Congress needs to continue to act. I believe the Harmonizing \nAmerica's Energy, Economy, Environment, and National Security Act is \nthe vehicle for a bipartisan effort to develop a meaningful \ncomprehensive energy plan.\n  Addressing this crisis requires nothing less than a Second \nDeclaration of Independence--to move us away from foreign sources of \nenergy in the near term and away from oil in the long term.\n  As you know, oil is not easily found nor substituted, and it will \nremain an integral component to our economy in the short-term. But we \nmust make investments today that will help us achieve our goal \ntomorrow. To do this I believe we must find more, use less, and \nconserve what we have.\n  In order to find more and stabilize our Nation's energy supply, my \nlegislation would encourage the development of oil resources within the \nOuter Continental Shelf and with regards to our oil shale reserves. It \nwould also open ANWR to responsible development, where it is believed \nthat there is over 10 billion barrels of oil.\n  While these resources will not physically come online for a number of \nyears, moves to expand development will send a clear signal to the \nmarket that we are serious about meeting our future energy demands and \nbegin to drive down the cost of oil because investors will know that \ngas won't be worth as much in the future and will therefore sell it off \ntoday--lowering the cost immediately.\n  And while we must increase our production of fossil fuels to relieve \ncosts and reestablish our independence in the short term, in the long \nterm we must reduce our demand for oil.\n  With that goal in mind, it is essential that we explore alternative \nmeans to meet our Nation's energy needs.\n  It is long past time for our government to provide the spark to \nrekindle our Nation's creativity and innovation. Following Russia's \nlaunch of Sputnik, President Kennedy challenged our country to be the \nfirst in the world to land a man on the moon. We must now undertake a \nsimilar Apollo-like project to establish clean, reliable and \ndomestically abundant energy alternatives and in turn usher in a new \nera of American freedom and independence.\n  My legislation would help to fund such a project by setting aside a \nportion of the federal revenues raised through lease revenues in the \nOuter Continental Shelf and ANWR to be used for the development of \nadvanced alternative energies, like wind, solar, fuel cells, advanced \nbatteries, and advanced biofuels. It would also set aside funds to be \nexplicitly to boost funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram and to pay down our national debt.\n  The bill will also repeal Section 526, a provision that places our \ndomestic coal-to-liquid industry in jeopardy. We have the largest coal \nreserves in the world, and at current rates of consumption, U.S. coal \ndeposits will last for more than 240 years.\n  Coal can provide significant new supplies of affordable synthetic \nfuels for transportation. A lot of Americans don't understand that many \ncountry's get their oil from coal. In fact, South Africa gets nearly 70 \npercent of their oil from coal. But we are beginning to make advances \nhere. In fact, Baard Energy is planning a CTL and biomass facility in \nSE Ohio that will produce 53,000 BPD of jet and diesel fuel, and other \nliquid production from coal and biomass feedstocks.\n  Last but not least, as we look to increase our supply and spark new \ninnovation, we must also be more responsible with the energy we \ncurrently use. My legislation would fund the development of new \nconservation technologies and practices and would help to disseminate \nthese across the country.\n  Americans today demand action and they demand we come together in a \nbipartisan fashion to solve our energy crisis. For 10 years I have been \na member of the Environmental and Public Works Committee and for 10 \nyears I have tried to coax Congress into harmonizing our energy, \neconomy and the environment. Congress has refused and now the chickens \nhave come home to roost.\n  I believe that the best message we can send to OPEC, those investing \nin the oil market, and indeed the entire world, is that we get it. We \nmust demonstrate that we are going to find more by going after every \ndrop of oil that we can responsibly drill and that we are going to use \nless by undertaking a new Apollo project to make the U.S. the most oil \nindependent nation in the world.\n  I envision an America ten years from now where we have enough oil to \ntake care of our needs. I imagine an America that is the least reliant \ncountry in the world on oil, an America where our economy is not \nthreatened by our reliance on foreign energy sources. It will be an \nAmerica that has created hundreds of thousands of jobs through the \nresponsible development of our Nation's resources and the through the \ncreation of new industries in the field of alternative energy.\n  Wouldn't it be great for our children and grandchildren to one day \ncelebrate the time America put aside its differences and came together \nto reaffirm its independence a second time and rekindled the American \nspirit of self reliance, innovation and creativity to usher in new era \nof prosperity?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3669\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to require the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission to develop and impose aggregate \nposition limits on certain large over-the-counter transactions and \nclasses of large over-the-counter transactions; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Over-the-\nCounter Swaps Speculation Limit Act, a bill to establish workable \nspeculative position limits that apply to both bilateral over-the-\ncounter swaps transactions and on-exchange transactions.\n  The Over-the-Counter Swaps Speculation Limit Act would close the \n``over-the-counter swaps loophole'' once and for all by requiring the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission--or CFTC--to apply the position \nlimit system to bilateral swaps, not just the on-exchange transactions \nthat are limited today.\n  Let me explain what the bill would do:\n  CFTC would enforce ``aggregate'' position limits so that a trader's \npositions on and off exchange would be combined. Swaps would no longer \nbe exempt from position limits.\n  CFTC would be allowed to grant hedge exemptions for bone fide \nhedging. This exemption would be limited to trading that hedges against \nprice risk exposure related to physical transactions in that energy \ncommodity.\n  Neither institutional investors hedging against inflation, nor swaps \ndealers hedging their secret dealings would qualify for a hedge \nexemption.\n  The bill would give CFTC the power to issue civil fines to enforce \nposition limits when unwinding a speculative position would be \ndisruptive to the marketplace.\n  This legislation is the missing piece to otherwise comprehensive \nanti-speculation legislation debated in the Senate in July and adopted \nby the House of Representatives in September.\n  Both of the House and Senate bills included vital provisions to \nprotect our markets, including provisions to close the London Loophole \nby imposing speculation position limits on trading conducted on Foreign \nBoards of Trade.\n  It would grant CFTC the authority to collect data and monitor trading \nin Over-the-Counter Swaps markets, shining the bright light of \noversight onto a previously un-watched market.\n  It would improve the data collection systems at CFTC to distinguish \nbetween swaps dealers, institutional investors, and genuine \nspeculators;\n  It would assure no true speculator is exempted from speculative \nposition limits; and increase CFTC's staffing levels.\n\n[[Page S10336]]\n\n  Reacting to congressional pressure, the CFTC took many of the steps \nthrough administrative action that our bills in Congress would have \nrequired.\n  CFTC largely closed the London Loophole and began monitoring London \ntrading of American crude oil.\n  CFTC began collecting detailed data on OTC swaps trading, especially \nby swaps dealers and institutional index traders, and it began \nmonitoring these markets.\n  CFTC reclassified a major swaps dealer as a speculator and proposed a \nrulemaking to revise its system for granting speculative limit \nexemptions.\n  This is true progress, but the swaps loophole--exempting voice \nbrokered bilateral swaps from the speculative position limit system--\nremains in place. Traders are able to hold positions far above \nspeculative position limits simply by executing their trades through a \nvoice broker.\n  Until this summer, the Federal Government knew very little about OTC \nswaps, which have been exempt from CFTC oversight since 1993. But \nthanks to CFTC's increased oversight this summer, published in its \nSeptember 2008 ``Staff Report on Commodity Swap Dealers and Index \nTraders,'' we know that traders do in fact use these swaps markets to \nhold positions above the speculative position limits on regulated \nexchanges.\n  The CFTC report found that on a single day in June there were:\n  ``18 noncommercial traders (speculators) in 13 markets who appeared \nto have an aggregate position . . . that would have been above the \nspeculative limit or an exchange accountability level if all the \npositions were on-exchange.''\n  CFTC discovered that a few traders held positions that would have \n``significantly exceeded'' an aggregate position limit.\n  What is the purpose of speculative position limits if traders know \nthey can buy the equivalent product in unlimited quantities from a \nvoice broker?\n  The Over-the-Counter Swaps Speculation Limit Act puts an end to this \nflawed system by instructing CFTC to establish a system of aggregate \nposition limits. As the staff report demonstrated, CFTC knows how to \ncalculate such limits.\n  I believe this legislation avoids the pitfalls of previous efforts in \nthe 110th Congress to limit speculative positions in swaps.\n  It is simple, granting CFTC the broad mandate to impose aggregate \nposition limits across positions held on registered entities, foreign \nboards of trade, and OTC markets that impact the price discovery \nfunction of a regulated market. It grants the regulator proper \ndiscretion to determine which contracts are functionally equivalent and \nwhat the limits should be.\n  It applies speculative position limits only to swaps that impact the \nprice discovery function on regulated markets. By focusing CFTC efforts \nonly on the major, standardized swaps contracts, the bill maintains \nlegal certainty for unique financing agreements and other private \nbilateral transactions.\n  The bill also prevents speculators from migrating to less regulated \ncontracts. CFTC will only be allowed to exempt contracts from position \nlimits after it determines that the contract is not functioning as a \nhaven from regulation. CFTC must impose speculative position limits on \nany contract that: is highly standardized; settles on the price of a \ncontracted traded in a regulated marketplace; has its prices widely \npublished and referenced; or traded in significant volumes.\n  Finally, the legislation addresses CFTC staff concerns that enforcing \nposition limits on bilateral swaps contracts would be too cumbersome. \nIn recent briefings, CFTC staff argued that the primary reason CFTC was \nnot calling for speculative position limits on swaps is that position \nlimits on swaps would force parties to void existing contracts, which \nharms the counterparty as much as the trader who is over their limit.\n  Regulators should not force a trader to break a contract if such \naction would punish the counterparties as well as the speculator. To \naddress this, this legislation gives CFTC the power to enforce position \nlimits with fines instead of forcing a trader to unwind a position.\n  Over the past 6 months, OTC swaps markets have been exposed, and it \nhas become increasingly apparent that speculative position limits are \nboth appropriate and feasible in order to protect regulated markets \nfrom manipulation and excessive speculation.\n  The regulated and unregulated energy markets are fully integrated. \nWith traders moving back and forth freely, it is no longer reasonable \nto believe that bad behavior in swaps can be isolated.\n  A manipulated swaps market would likely impact the price discovery \nfunction of a futures market, and in turn affect consumer prices.\n  If we want fair play in the energy markets, we cannot continue to \ninstruct the CFTC to swallow its whistle when it sees violations at the \nSwaps' end of the court.\n  We need to allow CFTC to call foul when it sees excessive \nspeculation, whether on an exchange or in a voice brokered swaps \nmarket.\n  The Over-the-Counter Swaps Speculation Limit Act would give the CFTC \nback its whistle. It would allow the Commission to use the speculative \nposition limit system in existence since the 1930s--to reel in \nexcessive speculation in American energy markets.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3671\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nWellness Trust; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, reforming the healthcare system is a top \npriority for me. I have been on the frontlines in the fight for \nhealthcare for every single American for as long as I have been in \npublic service. And every passing day, and year, the task becomes both \nmore urgent and more difficult--success more expensive and failure more \ncostly.\n  The United States spent about $2.1 trillion on healthcare in 2006, \ntwice what we spent 10 years ago, and half of what we're projected to \nspend 10 years from now. Preventable and chronic diseases are this \ncentury's epidemic. The number of people with chronic conditions is \nrapidly increasing and it is estimated that if we do not intervene now, \nby 2025 nearly half of the population will suffer from at least one \nchronic disease.\n  The wellness gap also affects health care costs. About 78 percent of \nall health spending in the United States is attributable to chronic \nillness, much of which is preventable. Chronic diseases cost the United \nStates an additional $1 trillion each year in lost productivity, and \nare a major contributing factor to the overall poor health that is \nplacing the Nation's economic security and competitiveness in jeopardy.\n  Unlike some health care challenges, proven preventive services and \nprograms exist. If effective risk reduction were implemented and \nsustained, by 2015 the death rate due to cancer could drop by 29 \npercent. Improved blood sugar control for people with diabetes could \nreduce the risk for eye disease, kidney disease, and nerve disease by \n40 percent. Similarly, blood pressure control could reduce the risk for \nheart disease and stroke by 33 to 50 percent. Yet, only half of \nrecommended clinical preventive services are provided to adults. About \n20 percent of children do not receive all recommended immunizations, \nwith higher rates in certain areas. Nearly 70 percent of people with \nhigh blood pressure do not now control it. And racial disparities in \nthe use of prevention exist.\n  The country faces low use of preventive services because of the low \nvalue placed on prevention, a delivery system bent toward fixing rather \nthan preventing problems, and financial disincentives for prevention. \nInsurers have little incentive to invest in preventive services today \nthat will benefit other insurers tomorrow. This is especially true for \nthose preventive services that reduce chronic diseases that develop \nover a period of several years or decades. The costs of prevention are \nincurred immediately but most of its benefits are realized later, often \nby Medicare. The United States spends only an estimated 1 to 3 percent \nof national health expenditures on preventive healthcare services and \nhealth promotion.\n  In addition, the workforce to deliver prevention is also \ninsufficient. The supply of providers who are trained to emphasize \nprevention is shrinking. Between 1997 and 2005, the number of medical \nschool graduates entering family practice residencies dropped by 50 \npercent. There is an acute shortage of community health workers. \nBetween 25 and 50 percent of the existing Federal, State and local \npublic health workforce is eligible for retirement in the next 5 years. \nToday, more than 75 percent of the existing public health workforce has \nno formal public health or prevention training. There is no national, \nuniform credentialing system for public health or prevention workers \nthat would ensure that these workers are trained in the basics of \npreventive care.\n  A system that promoted full use of high-priority prevention could \nsave lives and reduce costs. For example, complete, routine childhood \nvaccination could save up to $40 billion in direct and societal costs \nover time. Promoting screenings and behavioral modifications in the \nworkplace can lower absenteeism and, in most cases, health costs to \nfirms. Preventive health care services could reduce government spending \non health care. If all seniors recommended to received a flu vaccine \ndid, health costs could be reduced by nearly $1 billion per year. Over \n25 years, Medicare could save an estimated $890 billion from effective \ncontrol of hypertension, and $1 trillion from returning to levels of \nobesity observed in the 1980s.\n  So today, I am pleased to introduce The 21st Century Wellness Trust \nAct. This legislation is a critical part of the broader effort we will \nundertake next Congress to cover every single American and bring \nreforms to our delivery system that make it more efficient and improve \nhealth outcomes.\n  The 21st Century Wellness Trust Act would create a Wellness Trust at \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to refocus the efforts of our healthcare \nsystem on prevention and wellness. Through the Trust Fund Board, the \nWellness Trust will become the primary payer for priority prevention \nservices, as well as ensure an adequate and appropriately trained and \ncredentialed prevention health workforce. The Trust will also serve as \na central source of prevention information and ensure the inclusion of \nprevention and wellness in the development of a nationwide, \ninteroperable health IT infrastructure.\n  We cannot afford to wait any longer and I am proud to introduce The \n21st Century Wellness Trust Act which will be an important part of the \nsolution. We must undertake reforms that move us from a system of \nsickness to a system of wellness. From a system that is tilted towards \ninstitutional and emergency care to one that not only covers everyone, \nbut is designed to promote prevention of disease and wellness.\n\n[[Page S10338]]\n\n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 3675. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the treatment of certain excessive employee remuneration, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Compensation \nFairness Act of 2008 to tighten the rules for the amount of \ncompensation that is deductible as an ordinary and necessary business \nexpense. The recent financial crisis has brought the issue of executive \ncompensation to the forefront.\n  We have all read about the outrageous salaries that many of the chief \nexecutive officers of troubled companies have earned over the past few \nyears. Some have increased their pay by increasing the risks their \ncompanies take. According to Equilar, a compensation research firm, the \nCEOs of the 10 largest financial services firms in a survey of 200 \ncompanies with revenues of at least $6.5 billion were awarded a \ncombined total of $320 million last year, even though the firms \nreported mortgage-related losses that totaled $55 billion and that \nwiped out more than $200 billion in shareholder value. That is \nunacceptable.\n  It is not just the financial industry where executive pay has become \nexcessive. For 2006, the CEOs of large U.S. companies averaged $10.8 \nmillion in total compensation, more than 364 times the pay of the \naverage U.S. worker. We can learn from what led us to the current \nsituation and one way to make CEOs more accountable is to limit the \ntaxpayer subsidy for executive compensation.\n  I am pleased that the bailout legislation places limits on the \nexecutive compensation of the firms that participate in the Treasury \nprogram. I commend Chairmen Dodd and Baucus for their efforts for to \nplace limits on executive compensation part of the solution. However, I \nbelieve that executive compensation for all public companies should be \nreexamined.\n  Under current law, the allowable deduction for the compensation of \nthe top five highly paid individuals, including the CEO and the chief \nfinancial officer, CFO, is limited to $1 million per year. This \nlimitation does not include commissions and performance-based pay. I am \nconcerned that these exceptions have weakened the effectiveness of the \nlimitation and encourage performance-based pay arrangements which could \ncause executives to manipulate earnings.\n  The Compensation Fairness Act of 2008 would make several changes to \nthe limitation on deduction for compensation. It would repeal the \nexceptions for commission and performance-based pay. Under current law, \nan employee that is covered by the limitation has to be an employee the \nlast day of the year. The legislation would change this to make a \ncovered employee one who is employed at any time during the year. This \nlegislation would retain the $1 million limitation and index it for \ninflation.\n  The Compensation Fairness Act of 2008 would not limit the amount of \nsalary an executive can receive, but it would just limit the tax \nsubsidy. Taxpayers should not have to bear the cost of excessive \ncompensation. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful businessmen of \nall time, has annual salary of $100,000.\n  Limiting the deduction of executive compensation is just one part of \naddressing compensation. Earlier this Congress, the Senate passed \nlegislation which would limit the amount of compensation that can be \ndeferred to $1 million. Senator Obama has introduced legislation that I \ncosponsored and the House has passed which would require annual \nshareholder approval of a public company's executive compensation plan.\n  Once we address the current crisis, we need to have a serious debate \non executive compensation and the deductibility of compensation should \nbe part of the conversation. I urge my colleagues to consider changing \nthe current tax treatment of compensation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 3677. A bill to establish a Special Joint Task Force on Financial \nCrimes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation that I am \nintroducing today to make sure that those responsible for the financial \nmeltdown of recent days are brought to justice. Joining me on the bill \nis my distinguished colleague, Senator Feinstein.\n  While I congratulate the congressional leadership, especially \nChairmen Dodd and Frank, and Senators Reid, McConnell, and Gregg, in \ncrafting the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, one issue \ncontinues to deeply disturb me and many of my constituents. \nSpecifically, I refer to accountability and the importance of bringing \ncriminals to justice.\n  In my view, today's economic turmoil did not happen by pure chance, \nand I am troubled that certain greedy individuals may have crossed the \nline into criminal activity.\n  Clearly, no one should reap rewards from this colossal failure, and \nthose responsible on Wall Street should follow the Enron criminals \nstraight to jail. The pursuit and prosecution of those liable for this \nmeltdown must receive the highest possible level of attention, and this \nlegislation dedicates a Special Task Force on Financial Crimes within \nthe Justice Department whose sole mission is to ferret out those \ndirectly involved in engineering this catastrophe.\n  The congressional pursuit of answers--through hearings that Senator \nDodd has indicated he will hold--should occur in tandem with the legal \ninvestigation and prosecution of those responsible for this debacle. \nBoth must receive the same rigorous attention applied to this rescue \npackage--and not be subsumed by the routine of the day-to-day \nlegislative and criminal investigation process moving forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 3678. A bill to promote freedom, human rights, and the rule of law \nin Vietnam; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \npiece of legislation--the Vietnam Human Rights Act.\n  Over the last several sessions of Congress, legislation addressing \nthe human rights situation in Vietnam has been repeatedly introduced \nbut has never been enacted into law.\n  Like many of my Senate colleagues, I had hoped that strengthening our \nrelationship with Vietnam on the trade and economic front and \nsupporting Vietnam's integration into the international community would \ndramatically improve Vietnam's human rights record.\n  But that has not turned out to be the case.\n  The United States has removed Vietnam from its list of Countries of \nParticular Concern, granted Vietnam permanent normalized trade \nrelations, and supported Vietnam's bid to join the World Trade \nOrganization, yet Vietnam continues to arrest its citizens for their \npeaceful advocacy of political views.\n  It also continues to strictly restrict religious freedom, to harass \nand detain labor activists, and to refuse its citizens the basic rights \nof freedom of association, assembly, and expression.\n  Just last year, Vietnam carried out one of its harshest crackdowns in \n20 years against peaceful protestors calling for political change.\n  The crackdown, which continued through mid-2007, led to the arrest of \nhundreds of individuals, including Father Nguyen Van Ly, who was \nsentenced to 8 years in prison.\n  This crackdown happened shortly before the visit of Vietnamese \nPresident Nguyen Minh Triet to the United States last June.\n  At the end of 2007, the United States Commission on International \nReligious Freedom summed up Vietnam's recent behavior this way:\n\n       Vietnam's overall human rights record remains very poor and \n     deteriorated in the last year . . . Dozens of legal and \n     political reform advocates, free speech activists, labor \n     unionists, and independent religious leaders and religious \n     freedom advocates have been arrested, placed under home \n     detention or surveillance, threatened, intimidated, and \n     harassed.\n\n  Now we are witnessing yet another crackdown--this time on Catholic \nChurch members in Hanoi who have been holding prayer vigils to demand \nthe return of properties confiscated after the Communist government \ntook power in the 1950s.\n  The Vietnamese government has responded to these protests through \nintimidation, violence, and arrest.\n\n[[Page S10339]]\n\n  Just last week, Ben Stocking, the Bureau Chief for the Associated \nPress in Hanoi, was beaten by Vietnamese security forces for \nphotographing one such vigil. It is time for such behavior to stop.\n  The Boxer bill seeks to improve human rights in Vietnam by shifting \nthe focus of U.S. non-humanitarian foreign aid to a comprehensive \napproach that does more to address human rights.\n  The bill specifically requires that any spending increase for U.S. \nnon-humanitarian development, economic, trade, and security assistance \nto Vietnam be matched by additional funding for programs focusing on \nhuman rights, the rule of law, and democracy promotion.\n  To date, the majority of non-humanitarian U.S. assistance programs to \nVietnam have focused on business, trade, and security, and have not \neffectively addressed human rights abuses.\n  In addition, the bill outlines objectives for U.S. diplomacy with \nVietnam on human rights related issues and encourages Vietnam to \nrelease its religious and political prisoners.\n  The Boxer bill also prohibits Vietnam from having access to the U.S. \nGeneralized System of Preferences, GSP, program until Vietnam improves \nits labor standards. The GSP program allows developing countries to \nimport certain items into the U.S. duty-free.\n  While the 110th Congress will shortly come to an end, I wanted to \nintroduce this legislation as a signal to the Vietnamese government \nthat its record on human rights and recent behavior has not gone \nunnoticed. I intend to reintroduce this legislation very early in the \n111th Congress.\n  Let me be clear. I support a strong bilateral relationship between \nVietnam and the United States. But the Vietnamese government must \ndramatically improve its human rights record in order for our \nrelationship to grow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/10/01/senate-section/article/S10339-1", "month": "10", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 701--HONORING THE LIFE OF MICHAEL P.

MINIMIZATION OF LONG-TERM COSTS AND MAXIMIZATION OF \n                   BENEFITS FOR TAXPAYERS.\n\n       (a) Long-Term Costs and Benefits.--\n       (1) Minimizing negative impact.--The Secretary shall use \n     the authority under this Act\n\n[[Page S10344]]\n\n     in a manner that will minimize any potential long-term \n     negative impact on the taxpayer, taking into account the \n     direct outlays, potential long-term returns on assets \n     purchased, and the overall economic benefits of the program, \n     including economic benefits due to improvements in economic \n     activity and the availability of credit, the impact on the \n     savings and pensions of individuals, and reductions in losses \n     to the Federal Government.\n       (2) Authority.--In carrying out paragraph (1), the \n     Secretary shall--\n       (A) hold the assets to maturity or for resale for and until \n     such time as the Secretary determines that the market is \n     optimal for selling such assets, in order to maximize the \n     value for taxpayers; and\n       (B) sell such assets at a price that the Secretary \n     determines, based on available financial analysis, will \n     maximize return on investment for the Federal Government.\n       (3) Private sector participation.--The Secretary shall \n     encourage the private sector to participate in purchases of \n     troubled assets, and to invest in financial institutions, \n     consistent with the provisions of this section.\n       (b) Use of Market Mechanisms.--In making purchases under \n     this Act, the Secretary shall--\n       (1) make such purchases at the lowest price that the \n     Secretary determines to be consistent with the purposes of \n     this Act; and\n       (2) maximize the efficiency of the use of taxpayer \n     resources by using market mechanisms, including auctions or \n     reverse auctions, where appropriate.\n       (c) Direct Purchases.--If the Secretary determines that use \n     of a market mechanism under subsection (b) is not feasible or \n     appropriate, and the purposes of the Act are best met through \n     direct purchases from an individual financial institution, \n     the Secretary shall pursue additional measures to ensure that \n     prices paid for assets are reasonable and reflect the \n     underlying value of the asset.\n       (d) Conditions on Purchase Authority for Warrants and Debt \n     Instruments.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary may not purchase, or make \n     any commitment to purchase, any troubled asset under the \n     authority of this Act, unless the Secretary receives from the \n     financial institution from which such assets are to be \n     purchased--\n       (A) in the case of a financial institution, the securities \n     of which are traded on a national securities exchange, a \n     warrant giving the right to the Secretary to receive \n     nonvoting common stock or preferred stock in such financial \n     institution, or voting stock with respect to which, the \n     Secretary agrees not to exercise voting power, as the \n     Secretary determines appropriate; or\n       (B) in the case of any financial institution other than one \n     described in subparagraph (A), a warrant for common or \n     preferred stock, or a senior debt instrument from such \n     financial institution, as described in paragraph (2)(C).\n       (2) Terms and conditions.--The terms and conditions of any \n     warrant or senior debt instrument required under paragraph \n     (1) shall meet the following requirements:\n       (A) Purposes.--Such terms and conditions shall, at a \n     minimum, be designed--\n       (i) to provide for reasonable participation by the \n     Secretary, for the benefit of taxpayers, in equity \n     appreciation in the case of a warrant or other equity \n     security, or a reasonable interest rate premium, in the case \n     of a debt instrument; and\n       (ii) to provide additional protection for the taxpayer \n     against losses from sale of assets by the Secretary under \n     this Act and the administrative expenses of the TARP.\n       (B) Authority to sell, exercise, or surrender.--The \n     Secretary may sell, exercise, or surrender a warrant or any \n     senior debt instrument received under this subsection, based \n     on the conditions established under subparagraph (A).\n       (C) Conversion.--The warrant shall provide that if, after \n     the warrant is received by the Secretary under this \n     subsection, the financial institution that issued the warrant \n     is no longer listed or traded on a national securities \n     exchange or securities association, as described in paragraph \n     (1)(A), such warrants shall convert to senior debt, or \n     contain appropriate protections for the Secretary to ensure \n     that the Treasury is appropriately compensated for the value \n     of the warrant, in an amount determined by the Secretary.\n       (D) Protections.--Any warrant representing securities to be \n     received by the Secretary under this subsection shall contain \n     anti-dilution provisions of the type employed in capital \n     market transactions, as determined by the Secretary. Such \n     provisions shall protect the value of the securities from \n     market transactions such as stock splits, stock \n     distributions, dividends, and other distributions, mergers, \n     and other forms of reorganization or recapitalization.\n       (E) Exercise price.--The exercise price for any warrant \n     issued pursuant to this subsection shall be set by the \n     Secretary, in the interest of the taxpayers.\n       (F) Sufficiency.--The financial institution shall guarantee \n     to the Secretary that it has authorized shares of nonvoting \n     stock available to fulfill its obligations under this \n     subsection. Should the financial institution not have \n     sufficient authorized shares, including preferred shares that \n     may carry dividend rights equal to a multiple number of \n     common shares, the Secretary may, to the extent necessary, \n     accept a senior debt note in an amount, and on such terms as \n     will compensate the Secretary with equivalent value, in the \n     event that a sufficient shareholder vote to authorize the \n     necessary additional shares cannot be obtained.\n       (3) Exceptions.--\n       (A) De minimis.--The Secretary shall establish de minimis \n     exceptions to the requirements of this subsection, based on \n     the size of the cumulative transactions of troubled assets \n     purchased from any one financial institution for the duration \n     of the program, at not more than $100,000,000.\n       (B) Other exceptions.--The Secretary shall establish an \n     exception to the requirements of this subsection and \n     appropriate alternative requirements for any participating \n     financial institution that is legally prohibited from issuing \n     securities and debt instruments, so as not to allow \n     circumvention of the requirements of this section.\n\n     SEC. 114. MARKET TRANSPARENCY.\n\n       (a) Pricing.--To facilitate market transparency, the \n     Secretary shall make available to the public, in electronic \n     form, a description, amounts, and pricing of assets acquired \n     under this Act, within 2 business days of purchase, trade, or \n     other disposition.\n       (b) Disclosure.--For each type of financial institutions \n     that sells troubled assets to the Secretary under this Act, \n     the Secretary shall determine whether the public disclosure \n     required for such financial institutions with respect to off-\n     balance sheet transactions, derivatives instruments, \n     contingent liabilities, and similar sources of potential \n     exposure is adequate to provide to the public sufficient \n     information as to the true financial position of the \n     institutions. If such disclosure is not adequate for that \n     purpose, the Secretary shall make recommendations for \n     additional disclosure requirements to the relevant \n     regulators.\n\n     SEC. 115.

Additional jurisdiction in certain trafficking offenses.''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, few issues in the world today raise as \nmany human rights implications as the insidious practice of human \ntrafficking. According to International Labor Organization estimates, \nthere are over 12 million people in forced or bonded labor, forced \nchild labor, or sexual servitude at any given time around the globe. \nHuman trafficking truly represents commerce in human misery.\n  The U.S. Government has been increasingly vigilant in addressing this \nglobal scourge. In 2000, Congress passed the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act, which gave our government important new tools to better \nprotect trafficking victims, prosecute traffickers, and prevent future \ntrafficking crimes in this country and abroad. In 2003 and again in \n2005, Congress reauthorized the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, and \nI am proud to cosponsor the latest reauthorization bill--the William \nWilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of \n2008--which Senators Biden and Brownback introduced in May.\n  I chair the Senate Judiciary Committee's new Subcommittee on Human \nRights and the Law, created at the beginning of the 110th Congress. Our \nsubcommittee's second hearing, in March 2007, considered legal options \nto stop human trafficking.\n  The hearing shed light on a legal loophole in current law. The U.S. \ngovernment is allowed to prosecute human traffickers who commit crimes \nin the United States, but it is not permitted to prosecute traffickers \nwho commit crimes abroad and then come to our shores.\n  In June 2007, Senator Coburn and I introduced a bill to close this \nloophole. The Trafficking in Persons Accountability Act would permit \nthe U.S. Government to go after human traffickers who are present in \nthe United States, regardless of whether their heinous acts took place \nin this country or elsewhere. Our bill says to the traffickers: You \ncannot come to the United States and use us as a zone of impunity and \nas a safe haven for your ill-gotten gains. Closing this loophole would \nserve as another tool in the global fight against human trafficking.\n  The Trafficking in Persons Accountability Act follows on other human \nrights legislation I have introduced with Senator Coburn, the ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law. We introduced \nsimilar legislation to allow the U.S. Government to prosecute \nindividuals found in the United States who have recruited children for \ncombat or deployed child soldiers in another country. Congress recently \napproved this bill, and it awaits the President's signature.\n  And last year, Congress approved a bill to permit the U.S. Government \nto prosecute those present in the United States who have committed the \nhuman rights atrocity of genocide anywhere in the world.\n  The Trafficking in Persons Accountability Act is supported by the \nInternational Justice Mission, the Chicago-based National Immigrant \nJustice Center, the Break the Chain Campaign, the Urban Justice Center, \nMosaic Family Services, Global Rights, the Florida Immigrant Advocacy \nCenter, Asian Pacific Islander Legal Outreach, and the Rape, Abuse & \nIncest National Network.\n  We cannot discuss the issue of human trafficking without \nacknowledging the visionary leadership of the late Senator Paul \nWellstone, who called the trafficking of human beings ``one of the most \nhorrendous human rights violations of our time.''\n  On the day Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act on \nOctober 11, 2000, Senator Wellstone went to the Senate floor and said \nthe following: ``I believe with passage of this legislation . . . we \nare lighting a candle. We are lighting a candle for these women and \ngirls and sometimes men forced into forced labor. . . . This is the \nbeginning of an international effort to go after this trafficking, to \ngo after this major, god-awful human rights abuse.''\n  Senator Wellstone's commitment to combating human trafficking and \nother human rights abuses stands as one of his most enduring legacies. \nThe candle Senator Wellstone lit nearly 8 years ago is burning bright, \nand we will rekindle it today with the passage of this legislation.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to pass the Trafficking in Persons \nAccountability Act, and I hope the House of Representatives will soon \nfollow suit, so this important bill can be sent to the President and \nsigned into law.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate has \npassed the Trafficking in Persons Accountability Act of 2007, which \nwould improve our efforts to stop the abominable practice of human \ntrafficking in the United States and around the world. This modern-day \nform of slavery forces, defrauds, or coerces victims into sexual or \nlabor exploitation. It is the world's fastest growing criminal \nenterprise and generates $9.5 billion annually, $4 billion of which \ngoes to the prostitution industry. Nearly 1 million people, mostly \nwomen and children, are trafficked worldwide, including nearly 18,000 \npersons in the United States.\n  This legislation would expand the Federal court's jurisdiction over \nhuman trafficking cases to include offenses committed abroad by \nnoncitizens that enter our borders. Currently, the Department of \nJustice can only prosecute human trafficking crimes if they occur \nwithin the United States or are committed by a U.S. citizen abroad. \nThis legislation would permit the Department of Justice to prosecute \noffenders of trafficking crimes abroad if they are present in the \nUnited States and punish human traffickers who attempt to seek refuge \nin this country.\n  Nowhere on Earth should it be acceptable to deceive, abuse, and force \na person into a life of enslavement. We should not tolerate human \ntrafficking across our borders, nor should we allow trafficking \noffenders to seek a safe haven in our country. I commend subcommittee \nchairman Senator Durbin for introducing this legislation and for his \nhard work to combat human rights abuses worldwide. This is an area in \nwhich I have worked for many years as the chairman and ranking member \nof the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.\n  I was proud to work with Senator Durbin to create the Human Rights \nand the Law Subcommittee, the first congressional committee to \nspecifically address human rights issues. This subcommittee has held \nhearings on many important issues, and two important pieces of \nlegislation considered by the subcommittee will become law this \nCongress. The Genocide Accountability Act closed a loophole that until \nnow allowed those who commit or incite genocide to seek refuge in our \ncountry without fear of prosecution for their actions. Soon, the \nPresident will sign into law the Child Soldiers Accountability Act, \nmaking it a crime to recruit or use child soldiers. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with Senator Durbin to make progress towards\n\n[[Page S10390]]\n\neradicating these and other human rights abuses.\n  This bill is a step forward towards the prevention of human \ntrafficking, protection of victims, and prosecution of traffickers. I \nhope the House of Representatives acts quickly on this legislation so \nit can be enacted before Congress adjourns.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Durbin \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, the committee \nsubstitute, as amended be agreed to, the bill, as amended be read a \nthird time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements related \nto the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5688) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a complete substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.
