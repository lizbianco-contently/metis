Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside so that I may call up amendment No. 476.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 476.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure that our troops serving in harm's way remain \n    America's top budget priority by: ensuring full funding for the \n   Department of Defense within the regular appropriations process, \n    reducing reliance on supplemental appropriations bills, and by \n      improving the integrity of the Congressional budget process)\n\n       On page 41, strike lines 9 through 11 and insert the \n     following:\n       (2) for fiscal year 2008,\n       (A) for the national defense (050) function, \n     $498,844,000,000 in new budget authority and $507,394,000,000 \n     in outlays; and\n       (B) for all other functions, $443,468,000,000 in new budget \n     authority and $514,013,000,000 in outlays.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, to briefly describe the amendment, it is a \ndefense firewall amendment. This is not a new idea. We have had defense \nfirewalls in the past. They have worked with some success. There have \nbeen a few problems with them, but overall they worked with some \nsuccess.\n  We drafted the defense firewall in this amendment in a little \ndifferent way than previous firewalls. These changes, I believe, will \nactually result in the firewall having its intended effect. That is, to \nmake sure that the defense money in the budget is actually spent on \ndefense.\n  In past years, a defense firewall has, frankly, been necessary. The \nchairman of the Budget Committee can attest to the fact that, under \nRepublican control, this budget enforcement tool should have been in \nplace. I have been very critical of Republicans when we chose to \nunderfund defense purposely to shift money to other programs. Over the \nlast several years, we used a kind of sleight of hand and budget \ngimmicks, and then restored defense spending later on in emergency \nsupplementals. In effect, this raises overall spending for the \nGovernment.\n  Instead of honest budgeting and trying to increase certain non-\ndefense programs in the open, we hid our spending habits from the \nAmerican people. I have always said, that if you want to increase non-\ndefense spending, have an honest vote to do so rather than using a \ngimmick. Fund defense honestly rather than what we have been doing, \nwhich is dishonest budgeting. We have not had the transparency under \nwhich I believe this institution should operate.\n  When the Democrats were campaigning last year, they criticized us in \na lot of ways for using budget gimmicks, and I think rightly so. It is \ntheir time to keep what they have campaigned on--honest budgeting and \ntrue transparency. That is what we need in this place.\n  I want to take a minute to demonstrate what I have talked about for \nthe last several years. Unfortunately, given how the new Democrat \nmajority has chosen to fund BRAC, this Congress is continuing the bad \nhabits of Congresses past.\n  What this chart shows is, in 2002, we added $1.9 billion in new \nspending. We took away from defense, about $1.9 billion, and then added \nthat amount back in a supplemental. And this happens because everybody \nknows that Congress is going to fund defense to add that spending back \nlater. We don't want to vote to actually cut defense, so we shift the \nmoney in the regular appropriations process and put it back in during \nan emergency supplemental. But what happens is that the $1.9 billion in \n2002 gets added into the baseline for the next year. Then the next \nyear, we underfunded defense by $11.5 billion, we shifted the money to \nother programs, and then added back the defense spending during the \nsupplemental. The effect of this is to add on to the previous year--all \nof that in fiscal year 2004.\n  You can see the green bar at the bottom is the combination of the \nprevious 2 years; that is added into the baseline. Then you do this \nagain. Robbing from defense to once again add to the nondefense part of \nthe baseline. This continues each year all the way up, and then you see \nwhat happens until we get to 2006. The cumulative effect of this is \nshown on the next chart.\n  I know the chairman of the Budget Committee likes charts, so we \nwanted to make sure we would have some of our own today. The cumulative \neffect of doing this each year for 5 years is a total of $84 billion. \nWe don't have the new numbers for 2007 yet, but it is about an extra \n$40 billion. So we are probably well over $125 billion for a 6-year \ntotal in new spending. That really is the problem.\n  People are not being honest. If they want to increase spending, do it \nhonestly. What our defense firewall says is that if you want to adjust \ndefense spending, it cannot be done during the appropriations process; \nit has to be done during the budget process so that we are being honest \nwith the American people. Since we assume a defense number in this \nbudget, this amendment puts a wall around that amount so that it cannot \nbe taken during the appropriations process. That wall says we will not \ntake any more money out of defense to put into the other appropriations \nbills. This is transparency. This is honesty in budgeting.\n  When Republicans were in the majority, the Democrats claimed that we \nwere fiscally irresponsible. They promised that they were going to come \nto power and be fiscally responsible. This is an amendment that will \ngive them the opportunity to do just that. It gives them the \nopportunity to reject one of the budget gimmicks that has been used to \nadd new spending.\n  I call on my colleagues in the majority to join with me in putting \ntransparency into the budget process so we can help restrain Federal \nspending. Why do I say that? It is because when the Defense bill comes \nup as part of the process, no one, especially during a time of war, is \ngoing to vote to cut defense. So knowing that the Defense bill has to \npass, the other bills get funded first. Defense comes up and it is \nslightly underfunded, so they know they have to make that up during an \nemergency bill. The emergency bill comes to the floor, and everybody \nknows it is going to pass. That is how this whole budget gimmick ends \nup increasing overall spending.\n  If you support fiscal responsibility, if you don't want to add a \nburden of debt and higher taxes onto young people and future \ngenerations, vote for this amendment. This is a fiscally responsible \nway to budget and to bring transparency into the Senate. This is the \nkind of amendment we need going forward. Both parties should operate \nunder this kind of honesty when it comes to budgeting. I encourage all \nof my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for this amendment. I \ndon't favor this amendment, but it is a thoughtful, serious amendment, \nand it deserves thoughtful, serious consideration.\n  Let me just indicate that the budget resolution, as it stands with \nrespect to funding for defense and funding for the war, is not affected \nby this amendment. The budget resolution has the President's full \nrequest for the war. So I wish to be clear that the Ensign amendment \ndoesn't affect that. What the Ensign amendment does provide is a 60-\nvote point of order against any legislation that exceeds the budget \nauthority, which he sets for defense and\n\n[[Page S3455]]\n\nnondefense discretionary spending, which is in the resolution. So what \nhe is seeking to do is prevent money from going from defense to \nnondefense or the other way, from nondefense to defense. That is \nsomething we have done in the past.\n  My own analysis of it is that firewalls have not worked particularly \nwell. We had them under the 1990 budget agreement. I think what we \nlearned from that experience was they just didn't work as intended. Why \nnot? Because instead of preventing games, I am afraid it encouraged \ngames.\n  Let me say why I believe that is the case. No sooner were firewalls \ncreated for defense and international spending and domestic spending in \nthe 1990s than our colleagues started to become very creative about how \nto jump over the firewalls.\n  For example, Congress started to dramatically expand the amount of \nmedical research done by the Department of Defense. Instead of doing it \nat the National Institutes of Health, they tried to, in effect, evade \nthe firewall--which, again, is absolutely well intended. But by doing \nthe medical research not at NIH over in the domestic discretionary \nspending, they shifted the cost over into defense spending.\n  I am very strongly in favor of medical research, as I know my \ncolleague from Nevada is. But does anyone in this Chamber really \nbelieve that we would have increased breast cancer research more \neffectively by not having it done at NIH rather than by the United \nStates Army? And since firewalls were put in place, successive \nadministrations have now started putting FBI budget authority over in \nthe Defense Department. This is the kind of game that I think, in many \nways, the Senator is seeking to prevent but I am afraid may just be \nencouraged.\n  Why has that been done? It has been done to evade the firewalls. It \nis not clear to me what problem this amendment would actually solve. We \nhaven't had firewalls in the last several years. Yet defense spending \nhas grown rapidly.\n  Since 2001, defense, as a share of gross domestic product, has grown \nvery significantly. Here is a chart that shows what has occurred.\n  Defense, as a share of gross domestic product--which all the \neconomists say is the best way to measure--has gone from 3 percent in \n1999 to 4.2 percent of GDP now.\n  Seen another way, defense spending--this is not a share of GDP, but \nthis chart is expressed in constant 2008 dollars so that we have a fair \napples-to-apples comparison.\n  We can see that defense spending has gone up very dramatically. In \nfact, we are now past, in real terms, the spending at the President \nReagan defense buildup peak, and we are now set to go beyond the \nVietnam war spending peak.\n  The Ensign amendment will actually take away flexibility from \nappropriators about how best to live within their overall total \nallocation. They have a much closer perspective on the programmatic \nneeds of the various agencies, and I don't think we should be reducing \nthat flexibility.\n  If the Appropriations Committee were to move to eliminate $50 million \nin wasteful spending at the Department of Defense--let's presume for a \nmoment that we found $50 million of waste at the Department of \nDefense--I think those of us close to this know that is not a \ntheoretical possibility--that if $50 million of wasteful spending was \nfound at the Department of Defense, it couldn't be easily reallocated \nto Homeland Security because it would face this defense firewall block. \nI think that is a mistake.\n  Finally, I note for my colleagues on the other side that a vote for \nthe Ensign amendment is a vote to endorse and enforce not just defense, \nbut also the nondefense discretionary spending levels in the Democratic \nbudget resolution. My colleagues will be voting to endorse $443.5 \nbillion in nondefense discretionary spending because this firewall \nworks both ways.\n  If my colleagues think money ought to be transferred from domestic \nnondefense spending to defense spending, it would face this same \nfirewall. It would have the same 60-vote hurdle.\n  On that basis, while I absolutely respect the constructive intention \nof the Senator from Nevada, I believe it would have precisely the \nopposite effect that he intends.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I will take.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of the amendment \nof the Senator from Nevada. I think it is a critical amendment as we \nlook at the budget with which we are dealing.\n  We know the budget we received from the other side of the aisle is a \nclassic tax-and-spend budget. It raises taxes by $900 billion. It \nraises spending $144 billion in nondefense discretionary. The practical \neffect of that is very clear. The size of Government is going to grow \ndramatically, and the American workers are going to have to pay a heck \nof a lot more in taxes.\n  But there is something else we need to be sensitive to, and that is--\nand I credit the Senator from North Dakota for doing this--the Senator \nfrom North Dakota has put in place the numbers the President asked for \nto fight the war--$145 billion I believe is the number; something like \nthat--for the 2008 budget. The problem is that unless that money is \nsecured in a way that it cannot be gamed or used or reallocated, it can \nbe used to grow the Government in nondefense discretionary activity. We \nhave seen that happen. We have seen that happen, regrettably, all too \noften around here where money, which is defense money, is taken out of \nthe Defense Department, moved over to the social spending side of the \nledger because there is some account somebody wants to spend money on, \nand then halfway through the year, the Defense Department starts to run \nout of money and everybody is going to vote to replenish the Defense \nDepartment with a supplemental. That is the way it works around here.\n\n  Regrettably, it happened last year that way. Regrettably, it happened \nthe year before last that way. Regrettably, it happened the year before \nthe year before last that way. That is exactly what happens around \nhere. Money is taken out of the Defense Department, put into the social \nspending accounts, it grows the base of the social spending accounts, \nand then the Defense Department is replenished through a supplemental \nbecause everybody knows we have to fund the Defense Department, \nespecially during a time of war.\n  What the Senator from Nevada is trying to do is make sure that where \nwe have this massive amount of money sitting there, these warfighting \nfunds, and where we have increased the defense base by so much money, \nwe essentially protect that money from being raided for the purposes of \nbeing used for everyday accounts around the operation of Government and \nfor building the base of the operation of Government.\n  When we look at the history of the Congress, that type of action is \nneeded. We need that type of protection. So a defense firewall is \nabsolutely critical to fiscal discipline, and, I would argue--and I \nthink history stands with me on this argument--if we don't have a \ndefense firewall, it is very clear that the social nondefense, \nnondiscretionary spending number isn't going to increase by $144 \nbillion, which is the number which is in this bill, which is a pretty \nsignificant increase over the President's number, by the way--the \nPresident jumped it up by a significant amount--it is going to increase \nby a lot more because we know defense money is going to flow into those \naccounts throughout the appropriations process in order to take care of \nthis issue or that issue that somebody believes is important to their \nagenda.\n  We heard yesterday the Senator from Massachusetts talk about how No \nChild Left Behind had to receive more money, how IDEA had to receive \nmore money, how Pell grants had to receive more money. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota has put more money into those accounts, significantly more \nmoney, and the President has put more money into those accounts, \nsignificantly more money. But I can assure my colleagues that when that \nappropriations bill hits the floor with those dollars in it, it is \ngoing to go up even further because there is going to be money taken \nout of the Defense Department and put into the Labor-HHS bill for the \npurpose of expanding those programs because that\n\n[[Page S3456]]\n\nmoney is sitting there and the money is defenseless, to use a term of \nart. The money is defenseless. It is going to be raided and taken over \nto the social side of the ledger from the Defense Department.\n  The Senator from Nevada has the right approach to set up this \nfirewall and make it clear that we are going to have fiscal discipline. \nThat is what we need, fiscal discipline. This budget doesn't have much \nfiscal discipline in it. In fact, it doesn't have any to speak of. But \nas a practical matter, it shouldn't get worse. We should put in place \nsome limits that allow us to make sure even with this massive increase \nin nondefense discretionary money, that is where it stops, and we don't \nend up with the Defense Department being used as the piggy bank to fund \neven more nondefense discretionary spending.\n  The Senator is on the right track. It has been done before. It was \nactually quite effective before. I disagree with the characterization \nof it by the Senator from North Dakota. It made life a little more \ndifficult with the appropriators and others who wanted to take \nadvantage of defense dollars in order to use them on the nondefense \ndiscretionary side of the ledger, for social spending or whatever \nprojects were floating around they wanted to do.\n  It will also have a direct impact, quite honestly, on earmarks. It \nwill make it more difficult to earmark because there won't be money \navailable with which to earmark. If you are opposed to earmarks, for \nfiscal discipline, if you think the Defense Department should get the \nmoney we promised them to fight the war, you have to vote for the \nEnsign amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as the Senator from New Hampshire well \nknows, the war funding is secure. It is absolutely secure. At his \nurging, we put the war funding in a sidecar. Our cap adjustment for war \ncosts is available only for war costs. That is a red herring of an \nissue, and he knows it.\n  Let's go back to this question of how things really work. I must say, \nI am sympathetic to the basic notion of trying to exert discipline and \nnot having money that is appropriated for defense used for something \nelse. I am absolutely sympathetic to that. The problem is, I don't \nthink this works, and I am asking to have the list of earmarks that is \nin the Defense appropriations bill brought to me because I will then \nread that list. It will take me a good part of the day because we all \nknow what is really happening around here.\n  The Senator talked about somehow suppressing earmarks. Please, do I \nreally have to read the list of earmarks that has been put in the \nDefense appropriations bill that have nothing----\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me complete the thought. I will be happy to yield. \nDon't we all know, haven't we all read the Defense appropriations bill \nand seen earmark after earmark after earmark put into that Defense bill \nthat has nothing whatsoever to do with defense? I will be happy to \nyield.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, my point was that this will increase the \npiggy bank available to nondefense discretionary to be used for \nearmarking because it will take defense dollars and move them over to \nnondefense discretionary accounts. I don't argue with the argument that \nthere is a significant number of earmarks in the defense budget. I hope \nthat as part of reading his Defense Department earmarks--which I will \nbe happy to agree exists--he will at the same time list the earmarks \nthat were added into the Labor-HHS bill over the last 4, 5, 6 years as \na result of literally billions of dollars being taken out of the \nDefense Department to pump up the Labor-HHS bill. That is where the \nearmarks occurred.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield in a minute, if I may just \nrespond to the Senator. I think we all know the truth of this \ninstitution is that as soon as we create something such as a firewall, \nvery creative minds go to work in this institution to find a way around \nit. That is the hard reality. I am happy to yield.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, first of all, the Senator from North \nDakota made the point that defense funding is secure. We do not in any \nway think we are going to underfund defense or the war funding. The \npoint we were making about defense spending is that because everybody \nis going to make sure defense spending is secure, once the money for \ndefense is put in there, money is taken out and put into other spending \nprograms, then later in the year it is filled back in for defense.\n  Everybody knows we are going to fund the war. Everybody knows we are \ngoing to do the critical needs of the Department of Defense. What we \nare arguing is that other spending is going to be increased because of \nthe budget gimmicks because there is no transparency.\n  What my amendment does is put transparency back into the process. \nThat is why the Senator from New Hampshire and myself are arguing how \ncritical this amendment is if we want to actually have some fiscal \nrestraint, if we want to not just continue to blow up the deficits and \npass this huge debt on to future generations.\n  Without transparency, without all the budget gimmicks, the numbers \nthat my colleagues saw that I put up and the charts I put up for the \nlast 5 years--let's put those charts back up. For the last 5 years, $84 \nbillion total has been added in nondefense, other types of social \nspending programs. And it was done, in a way, with budget gimmicks, \nwhere people, kind of sleight of hand over here, looked as though they \nwere being fiscally responsible, but they were not. They said they were \noperating within the budget caps that were set out, but because then \nthe Defense spending was declared as emergency, that allowed people to \nget around the Defense caps.\n\n  What we are trying to do is to install some fiscal discipline. That \nis why we put a 60-vote, supermajority, point of order against this \nkind of activity. There is still flexibility. If people wanted to \nargue: let's take the money out, let's increase these accounts the way \nit has been done in the past, at least there is a supermajority \nrequired to do so.\n  I keep going back to last fall's election and before that, when the \nDemocrats accused Republicans in the majority of being fiscally \nirresponsible. This is a chance to fulfill their campaign promise of \nbeing fiscally responsible. It is time to step up, put mechanisms in \nplace that will put the discipline into this body to help hold down the \nspending that goes on in this place.\n  I will not argue that games won't be played. What we are going to do, \nthough, is to make it more difficult to play the games. There will \nalways be people who will try to get around whatever budget discipline \nwe put in. The appropriators are famous for that. What we are trying to \ndo here is to put in budget discipline, to put in a steeper wall to \nclimb over to get around these sleight-of-hand budget tricks.\n  That is what this amendment is about, to say let's for once be \nfiscally responsible around this place. Let's think about the children \nand future generations as far as spending is concerned. I ask my \ncolleagues to support this amendment when it comes up to the full \nSenate for a vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, at Andrews Air Force Base in 1990, I helped \nto craft the first statutory firewalls as part of the budget summit \nthat resulted in \nthe Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. That act created three categories \nof discretionary spending--defense, international, and domestic \ndiscretionary.\n  At the time, the device of the three separate caps to protect each \ncategory from being raided by another category made sense. There was a \ndefinable military threat, and nondefense funds did not contribute \nsignificantly to the defense of the Nation. That is not the case \nanymore. The September 11 attacks blurred the line between defense and \nnondefense spending. Military threats can no longer be viewed as \nmatters that are fought solely through the Defense Department. The \nenemy may attack our troops overseas or civilians here at home. Within \na matter of weeks, the focus of our war against terrorism can shift \nfrom military efforts abroad, to our homeland security efforts here at \nhome, and then back again.\n\n[[Page S3457]]\n\n  To respond to this threat, the Congress should maintain maximum \nflexibility to shift funds to where they are needed most--whether for \nour homeland security needs here at home or for our troops overseas or \nfor our veterans who need health and medical care. With so much \nuncertainty regarding the threat of terrorism and the war in Iraq, it \nmakes no sense to limit how those funds can be spent.\n  Senators should know that firewalls in the past have forced the \nCongress to resort to all sorts of machinations to pass its annual \nspending bills. Firewalls were used in past years, as part of a \npartisan budget process, to hold nondefense discretionary spending at \nunrealistically low levels. These spending levels were set early in the \nyear under different fiscal circumstances and at levels that neither \nthe administration nor the Congress expected to stay within. The result \nwas always unnecessary delays in the appropriations process and even \nmore spending as nearly all budgetary discipline evaporates in the push \nto pass an end-of-the-year omnibus bill.\n  These kinds of budget gimmicks undermine the people's confidence in \nthe Congress to manage the Nation's spending priorities.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I was hoping for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield 10 minutes to the Senator off \nthe bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                              The Iraq War\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, on Thursdays, Senator Durbin and I hold a \nconstituent coffee so we can hear from the folks back home. A young man \ncame a few months ago who was about 25, 26 years old. He had been back \nfrom Iraq for a year. The first 6 months of that year he spent in a \ncoma. An explosion had shattered his face, blinded him in both eyes, \nand has left him without the use of one arm.\n  He told us about how he was going through rehab, and he introduced us \nto his family. He has a wife and two young daughters like I do, and his \nwife talked for a bit about the adjustments they were making at home \nsince dad got hurt. I found myself looking at not just him, but at his \nwife, who loves him so much, and I thought about how their lives were \nforever changed because of the decision that was carried out 4 years \nago.\n  The sacrifices of war are immeasurable.\n  I first made this point in the fall of 2002, at the end of the speech \nI gave opposing the invasion of Iraq. I said then that I certainly do \nnot oppose all wars, but dumb wars--rash wars. Because there is no \ndecision more profound than the one we make to send our brave men and \nwomen into harm's way.\n  I have thought about these words from time to time since that speech, \nbut never so much as the day I saw that young man and his wife.\n  The sacrifices of war are immeasurable. Too many have returned from \nIraq with that soldier's story--with broken bodies and shattered nerves \nand wounds that even the best care may not heal. Too many of our best \nhave come home shrouded in the flag they loved. Too many moms and dads \nand husbands and wives have answered that knock on the door that is the \nhardest for any loved one to hear.\n  And the rest of us have seen too many promises of swift victories, \nand dying insurgencies, and budding democracy give way to the reality \nof a brutal civil war that goes on and on and on to this day.\n  The sacrifices of war are immeasurable. It was not impossible to see \nback then that we might arrive at the place we are at today.\n  I said then that a war based not on reason but on passion, not on \nprinciple but on politics would lead to a U.S. occupation of \nundetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined \nconsequences. I believed that an invasion of Iraq without a clear \nrationale or strong international support would only strengthen the \nrecruitment arm of al-Qaida and erode the good standing and moral \nauthority that took our country generations to build. There were other \nexperts, and leaders, and everyday Americans who believed this too.\n  I wish we had been wrong. I wish we weren't here talking about this \nat the beginning of the war's fifth year. Because the consequences of \nthis war have been profound. And the sacrifices have been immeasurable.\n  Those who would have us continue this war in perpetuity like to say \nthat this is a matter of resolve on behalf of the American people. But \nthe American people have been extraordinarily resolved. They have seen \ntheir sons and daughters killed or wounded on the streets of Fallujah. \nThey have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this effort--money \nthat could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and \nour competitive standing as a nation.\n  No, it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this \nchaos, but a failure of strategy--a strategy that has only strengthened \nIran's strategic position; increased threats posed by terrorist \norganizations; reduced U.S. credibility and influence around the world; \nand placed Israel and other nations friendly to the United States in \nthe region in greater peril.\n  Iraq has not been a failure of resolve, it has been a failure of \nstrategy--and that strategy must change. It is time to bring a \nresponsible end to this conflict is now.\n  There is no military solution to this war. No amount of U.S. soldiers \nnot 10,000 more, not 20,000 more, not the almost 30,000 more that we \nnow know we are sending--can solve the grievances that lay at the heart \nof someone else's civil war. Our troops cannot serve as their \ndiplomats, and we can no longer referee their civil war. We must begin \na phased withdrawal of our forces starting May 1, with the goal of \nremoving all combat forces by March 30, 2008.\n  We also must make sure that we are not as careless getting out of \nthis war as we were getting in, and that is why this withdrawal should \nbe gradual, and keep some U.S. troops in the region to prevent a wider \nwar and go after al Qaida and other terrorists.\n  But it must begin soon. Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be \nthere forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Iraqis to take \nownership of their country and bring an end to their conflict. It is \ntime for our troops to start coming home.\n  History will not judge the architects of this war kindly. But the \nbooks have yet to be written on our efforts to right the wrongs we see \nin Iraq. The story has yet to be told about how we turned from this \nmoment, found our way out of the desert, and took to heart the lessons \nof war that too many refused to heed back then.\n  For it is of little use or comfort to recall past advice and warnings \nif we do not allow them to guide us in the challenges that lie ahead. \nThreats loom large in an age where terrorist networks thrive, and there \nwill certainly be times when we have to call on our brave servicemen \nand women to risk their lives again.\n  But before we make that most profound of all decisions--before we \nsend our best off to battle, we must remember what led us to this day \nand learn from the principles that follow.\n  We must remember that ideology is not a foreign policy. We must not \nembark on war based on untested theories, political agendas or wishful \nthinking that has little basis in fact or reality. We must focus our \nefforts on the threats we know exist, and we must evaluate those \nthreats with sound intelligence that is never manipulated for political \nreasons again.\n  We must remember that the cost of going it alone is immense. It is a \nchoice we sometimes have to make, but one that must be made rarely and \nalways reluctantly. That is because America's standing in the world is \na precious resource not easily rebuilt. We value the cooperation and \ngoodwill of other nations not because it makes us feel good, but \nbecause it makes all the world safer--because the only way to battle \n21st century threats that race across borders--threats like terror, and \ndisease, and nuclear proliferation--is\n\n[[Page S3458]]\n\nto enlist the resources and support of all nations. To win our wider \nstruggle, we must let people across this planet know that there is \nanother, more hopeful alternative to the hateful ideologies the \nterrorists espouse--and a renewed America will reflect and champion \nthat vision\n  We must remember that planning for peace is just as critical as \nplanning for war. Iraq was not just a failure of conception, but a \nfailure of execution, and so when a conflict does arise that requires \nour involvement, we must do our best to understand that country's \nhistory, its politics, its ethnic and religious divisions before our \ntroops ever set foot on its soil.\n  We must understand that setting up ballot boxes does not a democracy \nmake--that real freedom and real stability come from doing the hard \nwork of helping to build a strong police force, and a legitimate \ngovernment, and ensuring that people have food, and water, and \nelectricity, and basic services. And we must be honest about how much \nof that we can do ourselves and how much must come from the people \nthemselves.\n  Finally, we must remember that when we send our servicemen and women \nto war, we make sure we have given them the training they need, and the \nequipment that will keep them safe, and a mission they can accomplish.\n  We must respect our commanders' advice not just when its politically \nconvenient but even when it is not what we want to hear. And when our \ntroops come home, it is our most solemn responsibility to make sure \nthey come home to the services, and the benefits, and the care they \ndeserve.\n  As we stand at the beginning of the fifth year of this war, let us \nremember that young man from Illinois, and his wife, and his daughters, \nand the thousands upon thousands of families who are living the very \nreal consequences and immeasurable sacrifices that have come from our \ndecision to invade Iraq.\n  We are so blessed in this country to have so many men and women like \nthis--Americans willing to put on that uniform, and say the hard \ngoodbyes, and risk their lives in a far off land because they know that \nsuch consequences and sacrifices are sometimes necessary to defend our \ncountry and achieve a lasting peace.\n  That is why we have no greater responsibility than to ensure that the \ndecision to place them in harm's way is the right one. And that is why \nwe must learn the lessons of Iraq. It is what we owe our soldiers. It \nis what we owe their families. And it is what we owe our country--now, \nand in all the days and months to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Illinois, \nSenator Obama, for the wisdom he has displayed with respect to the \nconflict in Iraq. I read a speech he gave when he was a State Senator \nwarning about the dangers of going to war in Iraq. In many ways it \nreflected many of the same feelings and analysis I had given in my \nspeech on the floor of the Senate.\n  I gave the last speech before that fateful vote to authorize going to \nwar in Iraq. I believed at the time it was a mistake to go to Iraq \nbefore finishing business with Osama bin Laden. After all, it was \nSaddam Hussein in Iraq whom this administration decided to go after. \nBut it was not Saddam Hussein or Iraq that attacked this country on 9/\n11, it was Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaida network that had attacked \nthis country. We have still never held Osama bin Laden to account. I \nhave always felt that was an extremely serious mistake, a military \nmistake for this country. I was so impressed that the Senator from \nIllinois, who was a State senator at the time, had the wisdom and the \njudgment to see that. I wish more had seen it.\n  I, again, thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, so we can get the order, I understand we \nare going to go to Senator Bunning next; is that the game plan? He is \non his way to the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. I thank the Senator very much for his continuing \ncourtesy as we try to move through this. Senator Bunning, we are told, \nis on his way to the floor to offer an amendment. We are also asking \nSenator Bingaman to come.\n  I see Senator Bunning is here now. We can go to his amendment.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Ensign amendment is the pending \nquestion.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 483\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning], for himself and \n     Mr. Enzi, proposes an amendment numbered 483.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide a point of order against any budget resolution \n       that fails to achieve an on-budget balance within 5 years)\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. CIRCUIT BREAKER TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Circuit Breaker.--If in any year the Congressional \n     Budget Office, in its report pursuant to section 202(e)(1) of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 projects an on-budget \n     deficit (excluding Social Security) for the budget year or \n     any subsequent fiscal year covered by those projections, then \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget for the budget year \n     shall reduce on-budget deficits relative to the projections \n     of Congressional Budget Office and put the budget on a path \n     to achieve on-budget balance within 5 years, and shall \n     include such provisions as are necessary to protect Social \n     Security and facilitate deficit reduction, except it shall \n     not contain any reduction in Social Security benefits.\n       (b) Point of Order.--If in any year the Congressional \n     Budget Office, in its report pursuant to section 202(e)(1) of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 projects an on-budget \n     deficit for the budget year or any subsequent fiscal year \n     covered by those projections, it shall not be in order in the \n     Senate to consider a concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     the budget year or any conference report thereon that fails \n     to reduce on-budget deficits relative to the projections of \n     Congressional Budget Office and put the budget on a path to \n     achieve on-budget balance within 5 years.\n       (c) Amendments to Budget Resolution.--If in any year the \n     Congressional Budget Office, in its report pursuant to \n     section 202(e)(1) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     projects an on-budget deficit for the budget year or any \n     subsequent fiscal year covered by those projections, it shall \n     not be in order in the Senate to consider an amendment to a \n     concurrent resolution on the budget that would increase on-\n     budget deficits relative to the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget in any fiscal year covered by that concurrent \n     resolution on the budget or cause the budget to fail to \n     achieve on-budget balance within 5 years.\n       (d) Suspension of Requirement During War or Low Economic \n     Growth.--\n       (1) Low growth.--If the most recent of the Department of \n     Commerce's advance, preliminary, or final reports of actual \n     real economic growth indicate that the rate of real economic \n     growth (as measured by real GDP) for each of the most \n     recently reported quarter and the immediately preceding \n     quarter is less than 1 percent, this section is suspended.\n       (2) War.--If a declaration of war is in effect, this \n     section is suspended.\n       (e) Supermajority Waiver and Appeals.--\n       (1) Waiver.--Subsections (b) and (c) may be waived or \n     suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-\n     fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (2) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this subsection shall \n     be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the bill or \n     joint resolution, as the case may be. An affirmative vote of \n     three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and \n     sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling \n     of the Chair on a point of order raised under this \n     subsection.\n       (f) Budget Year.--In this section, the term ``budget year'' \n     shall have the same meaning as in section 250(c)(12) of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, this amendment is almost identical to the \nlanguage that was included in the fiscal year 2003 budget resolution \nthat Chairman Conrad authored. This amendment provides that, starting \nwith the fiscal year 2009 budget, if\n\n[[Page S3459]]\n\nCBO's budget and economic outlook reports projections that the Social \nSecurity surplus will be spent for non-Social Security programs during \nany year covered by its projections, then the budget resolution must \npresent a plan to protect Social Security by reducing those deficits.\n  As you can see by this chart, in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, these \nare the Social Security dollars that are being used in this current \nbudget that has been proposed for other purposes. From $423 billion up \nto $1.027 trillion. If the budget resolution fails to put the budget on \na glidepath to protecting the Social Security surplus within 5 years, \nit will be subject to a point of order in the Senate. There is an \nexception for times of war and low economic growth, and it can be \nwaived by a vote of three-fifths of the Senators.\n  The purpose of this circuit breaker is to put the budget on a path to \nbalance without spending the Social Security money that is needed for \nthe baby boomers' retirements. It ensures that Social Security trust \nfunds will be used for their intended purpose and that is for \nretirement of the baby boomers and all after.\n  We all know the challenges the Social Security system faces as the \nfirst of the baby boomers start to retire very shortly. The effects of \nthis demographic tidal wave will begin to grow rapidly as the years \nprogress. Chairman Conrad will point to a provision in this budget that \nhe calls the ``save Social Security first'' point of order. However, \nthis point of order does not--I say emphatically does--not protect the \nSocial Security surplus the way my amendment will do it. In fact, the \nbudget resolution before us spends, as I showed you, over $1 trillion \nadditional of the Social Security surplus. My amendment says that just \nbecause we have been spending the Social Security surplus for decades \ndoesn't mean we should continue. We have dug ourselves into a big \nditch. The budget before us keeps digging.\n  My amendment says stop digging. It forces Congress to make a plan to \nprotect the Social Security surplus. I urge my colleagues to think \nabout the future of Social Security retirees and support this \namendment. We have this amendment before us. It is almost exactly like \nthe amendment the now chairman of the Budget Committee put in the 2003 \nbudget resolution, and his rationale for knocking out the point of \norder in the budget markup was: ``Well, we have been doing it for \nyears.''\n  Yes, we have been doing it for years, and it is time to stop. Stop \nspending the Social Security surplus for other purposes--other purposes \nbeing any other functions for which the Federal Government might need \nmoney. What does that do to my grandchildren and the grandchildren of \neverybody else in this body and those listening? It says to your \ngrandchildren: You have to fend for yourself. We are going to leave you \nwith this pile of debt, such that in 2017 we are not going to have \nenough money in the trust funds to pay off your Social Security \nbenefits--in 2017, when we start spending this money out of the trust \nfunds--with the interest we are supposed to be getting from it. By \n2040, we will have spent down all the trust funds and all the interest. \nWhat does that mean? That means in 2041 those benefits in Social \nSecurity will be 74 percent of what we promised our recipients. That is \nthe money that will be coming in, in Social Security taxes at that \ntime. We will only be able to pay out 74 percent of the benefits \nbecause we have prespent the trust funds for other purposes.\n  My amendment says: Stop. Think about what you are doing, Members of \nthe Senate, Members of the Congress. Stop digging the hole. We are \ngoing to bury our future generations in a massive debt situation where \ntheir benefits will not be able to be paid.\n  I ask support for this amendment when it comes up for the vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator talks about Social Security \nmoney being spent in the Democratic budget resolution--and he is right. \nThere is money spent, Social Security money, in the Democratic budget \nresolution. Why? Because our friends on the other side, in the 6 years \nthey have controlled everything, have dug such a deep hole it is going \nto take us a while to climb out. Look at the President's budget. That \nis the only budget from the other side. The other side has not \npresented a budget other than the President's budget.\n  Here is what the President's budget does in terms of spending Social \nSecurity money. The President's budget spends $1.16 trillion of Social \nSecurity money over the next 5 years--every dime that is available. We \nuse $1.03 trillion. So let's be clear. The only budget from the other \nside uses more Social Security money than does our budget. Both budgets \nuse Social Security money because we are now in such a deep hole it is \ngoing to take time to dig out.\n  Here is the record from the other side. The record from the other \nside is they have so far spent $1.1 trillion of Social Security money \nand, if the President's budget is followed, they will have spent $2.5 \ntrillion by 2017. Every dime of Social Security money that is available \nto spend will have been spent by our friends on the other side. That is \ntheir record.\n  Look, we inherited this mess. We have to climb out and we are making \nprogress. Our budget balances by 2012, and over time we will end this \npractice of using Social Security money. Let me indicate that in this \nbudget resolution, we have passed a ``save Social Security first'' \namendment. It says there can be no new mandatory spending or tax cuts \nuntil the 75-year Social Security solvency is restored, unless it is \npaid for or gets a supermajority vote. That is in the underlying budget \nresolution to protect Social Security.\n\n  I say to my colleague, he has offered an amendment I previously \noffered. When I offered it, it was before we descended into this \ndeficit and debt ditch. It was designed to prevent us from going that \nroad, from going down the path of using Social Security money to fund \nother things. Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side opposed \nit and defeated it. They prevented it from being put in force, which \nwould have hopefully prevented all this from happening. But that was \nnot the case. Now it is akin to closing the barn door after the cattle \nare gone. Now the Senator from Kentucky offers this amendment.\n  The upshot of this amendment, if it were to pass, would be to create \na 60-vote hurdle against having a budget resolution next year. That is \nwhat the effect of the Bunning amendment would be. If people want to \nvote for it as a symbolic measure, that is fine with me. Members should \nknow they are free to vote however they think is the right way when we \nvote on the Bunning amendment later this evening.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank you, as chairman of the Budget Committee, for \nbringing forward the ``save Social Security first'' amendment in \ncommittee. It makes it very clear in the budget resolution that we \nintend to come out of this hole and are committed to making sure Social \nSecurity moneys are restored.\n  Last night we heard from other colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. Senator Sessions offered an amendment that basically would fly \nin the face of Senator Bunning's amendment, wouldn't you say, because \nit essentially would take away the ability to have a 60-vote point of \norder as it relates to extending the tax cuts that created the hole in \nthe first place. Because isn't it true that essentially the tax cuts \nwere paid for by using Social Security surplus funds?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is certainly right. Senator Sessions' \namendment would allow all of the tax cuts to be extended without having \nto be paid for, without having to be offset. So it does directly \ncontradict at least the spirit of the Bunning amendment.\n  I must say, I am very much in sympathy with the spirit of the Bunning \namendment because, after all, it was my amendment back in 2002 when it \nreally would have done some good because that was before we went down \nthis path of using Social Security funds to pay all kinds of other \nbills.\n  I have said many times that what is being done here in Washington is \na basic violation of any kind of the sense of the trust fund because \ntrust fund moneys that are in temporary surplus before the baby boomers \nretire are\n\n[[Page S3460]]\n\nbeing used to pay other bills. You could not do that in any other \ninstitution. You could not do that in any private business. You could \nnot do that in any other private sector institution. You could not take \nthe retirement funds of your employees and use them to pay your \noperating expenses. If you did that, you would be in violation of \nFederal law. You would be on your way to a Federal institution, but it \nwould not be the Congress of the United States, it would not be the \nWhite House; you would be headed for the big house because that is a \nviolation of Federal law. But that is the practice that has grown up. \nIt has been, unfortunately, the case here for 30 years, with only 2 \nyears of exception: The last 2 years of the Clinton administration, we \nwere able to stop using Social Security funds to pay other bills. That \nwas one of the greatest achievements of the Congress and the \nadministration. Unfortunately, under this new administration, they went \nright back the other way, using every dime of Social Security money to \npay other bills. Now we are in such a deep hole that it is going to \ncontinue for some period of time until we are able to dig out.\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I might ask a second question of my friend. Again, I \nwill start by congratulating the Senator. I remember, as a new member \nof the Budget Committee, coming in in 2001 when there were record \nsurpluses, that the Senator was warning us about what could happen. \nActually, is it not true that at that time, the Senator was suggesting \na third of the surpluses go to prefunding the liability of Social \nSecurity so we would not find ourselves in this mess? Would not that \nhave had a very different outcome on where we are today?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. I thank the Senator for remembering that. I did have \na plan. Instead of giving the outsized tax cuts the President proposed, \nI proposed giving a $900 billion tax cut, very large tax cuts, but to \nuse the rest of the money to strengthen Social Security, to either \nprefund the liability or pay down the debt.\n  Instead, a different judgment was made. Social Security money that \nreally never was in what I would consider surplus--because it is all \nneeded when the baby boomers retire--has been taken and has been used, \nevery dime under the President's fiscal plan, to pay other bills and to \nfinance tax cuts. I think that was a profound mistake. That is why I \noffered the amendment the Senator from Kentucky has now offered, an \namendment I offered back in 2002, to prevent us from ever going down \nthis path. Now we have gone down it. Both budgets, if we are to be \nhonest, use Social Security funds. We use somewhat less than the \nPresident's budget. It is going to take time to dig out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, two wrongs do not make a right. The fact \nis that the President's budget includes it, every President's budget \nhas included it since Ronald Reagan. That includes Bush 1, Bill \nClinton's budget for 8 years, and now George W. Bush's budget. They \nhave included spending the Social Security trust funds that are in \nsurplus in every budget for over 15 years that I know of.\n  Now that my good friends from the Democratic Party are in the \nmajority, they are doing the same thing. They are spending our trust \nfunds that the Social Security system must buy bonds with. That is the \nlaw. We do not have another law that says you can take the Social \nSecurity trust funds and you can put it in this little box and you must \nkeep it. No. The law says--and I was on the Ways and Means Committee \nwith the current chairman of the Senate when we tried to wall off \nSocial Security trust funds. It did not pass over in the House at that \ntime. So we have been spending them ever since. That does not make it \nright. It is still wrong to spend it.\n  The other side said they are going to fix the surplus problem. Well, \nthey are not. I hope they do. This amendment gives some teeth to that \npromise because it holds the majority--whoever is the majority--\naccountable.\n  Now that they are in the majority, they do not want to hold \nthemselves responsible for the Social Security trust funds. They say: \nOh, because we have been doing this all this time, it is too late to \nstop. We can save $1.027 trillion if we stop now and do not include \nthis in our 5-year projections.\n  I hate to tell you, if we moved this out to 10 years, what it would \nlook like. I am not going to do that because the budget is a 5-year \nbudget. But $1 trillion, to my grandkids and their retirement or \nSenator Conrad's grandkids or anybody's kids, is a lot of money, and \nthe more we can save for their retirement, the less we are going to \nhave to borrow down the road.\n  So, please, when you are considering this amendment, consider the \nconsequences of what we are doing here. We are doing more of the same. \nIt is time we stopped doing it.\n  I ask for your support. This is a very important amendment. It is not \na feel-good amendment; it is a substantive amendment that we actually \nare doing things to stop spending the Social Security trust funds.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Kentucky, who may be one of the \nmost effective spokespersons in the Senate on the issue of protecting \nthe Social Security accounts and making sure that as we move forward, \nwe are responsible in that area.\n  This amendment accomplishes exactly that. It is a brilliantly drafted \namendment because it was, of course, drafted by the chairman of the \nBudget Committee and offered by him.\n  Mr. Chairman, it reflects that the times have changed. Well, they \nreally have not; the numbers have changed. Instead of $2 trillion, we \nare now talking $1 trillion of Social Security money that is going to \nbe used in this budget.\n  You know, the cattle are not out of the barn; they truly are in the \nbarn. And we figure each cow is worth a dollar. We should be protecting \nthem, and we should be at least addressing them. What I think the \namendment does is it highlights the essence of one of the most \nsignificant problems with this budget; that is, although it spends a \nlot of money and it raises a lot of taxes, it does nothing on the issue \nof the long-term solvency of this Government, which is the most \nsignificant threat we face.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee has held numerous hearings on \nthis issue. I have congratulated him on being focused on this issue. \nBut, unfortunately, he brought forward a budget which does not address \nthis. We have created a government which is not going to be affordable \nto our children because the costs of Social Security and the costs of \nMedicare when the baby boomer generation retires is simply going to \noverwhelm their fiscal ability to support that generation.\n  We should be getting on right now and doing things that correct this. \nThere were ideas put forward which would accomplish this that the \nPresident put forward in the area of Medicare. There are things you can \ndo in the area of Social Security. For example, you can get the \nreimbursements correct on the COLA.\n  But what this budget does is nothing. It does nothing to protect or \naddress this outyear problem. What it does do is aggravate the problem \nby digging the hole deeper by using $1 trillion of Social Security \nfunds to operate the Federal Government over the 5 years of this \nbudget.\n  So when the chairman of the committee drafted the amendment, he was \nthinking correctly. And when he said that--he was speaking here \nrelevant to the use of Social Security funds by the administration in \nprior budgets--they included as the definition of a balanced budget one \nthat raided the Social Security trust fund of every dime. Then he \nclaimed that it was a balanced budget. That was no balanced budget; \nthat was a budget built on massive borrowing disguised as balancing the \nbudget.\n  Well, that is essentially a statement which could be applied exactly \nto this budget. So the chairman was right with that statement. Then he \nwent on further and said: It threatens Social Security to take $180- to \n$190 billion of Social Security money, to use it, instead of paying \ndown the debt or prepaying the liability, to use to it pay operating \nexpenses of the Government, it threatens Social Security. That again is \nbeing done within this budget to the tune of $1 trillion.\n  So the Senator from Kentucky in his own way is once again \nhighlighting the issue effectively and has put forward language which \nwill accomplish the\n\n[[Page S3461]]\n\ngoal. It was good language when it was offered by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, and it is good language offered by the Senator from \nKentucky. I certainly hope we support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, I want to say I have been \nput at a disadvantage here because the Senator from Kentucky, whom I \nlike very much, whom I respect very much, has offered an amendment I \ndrafted.\n  Unfortunately, they did not support it when I offered it back in \n2003. It really would have helped us avoid this disaster of using \nSocial Security money. So maybe we have here a coming around to support \nan issue at least at a later point. I am going to recommend to my \ncolleagues that we vote for this amendment on the floor, as a symbolic \nmeasure if for no other reason.\n  When I drafted this amendment and offered it back in 2002, what a \ndifference it would have made if it had been adopted. But, \nunfortunately, our colleagues who have just spoken so eloquently in \nfavor of it now opposed it then. They opposed it when it actually would \nhave done something. Well, I still appreciate the fact that they now, 5 \nyears later, appreciate the wisdom of my words then. I certainly will \nnot stand in the way of adopting this amendment tonight. In fact, my \nvote will be cast in favor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I don't want to prolong the debate because \nthe Senators from New Mexico and Tennessee have an amendment ready to \ngo. But I would note that the most recent inconsistency on this is not \nour side, it would be on the Democratic side, in that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota voted against this amendment in committee, which he now is \ngoing to vote for on the floor. I wanted to make that point. So the \ninconsistency is in the eye of the beholder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me say that I cast that vote in committee because the \npractical effect of this amendment now is not going to protect Social \nSecurity. The practical effect of this amendment is to create a 60-vote \nhurdle to pass a budget resolution next year.\n  But, look, I am proud of the amendment I crafted 5 years ago. I think \nwe have to send every message we can that it is wrong to be using \nSocial Security trust funds to pay other bills. I believe that with \nevery fiber of my being. Senator Bunning has offered this amendment \nunfortunately 5 years too late. I am going to support it even though it \nis 5 years too late.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will conclude my comments by saying that \nI hope the Senator from North Dakota is not cynical, because of his \nrather negative view of what this amendment will do. I hope it does not \ncome to fruition.\n  I hope what the amendment does is force the people who bring the \nbudget next year to look at Social Security and figure out how we are \ngoing to deal with it and thus put in place some entitlement reform \nwhich addresses this issue and gets us into a position where we are \nable to protect it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is for that reason that I will support \nthe amendment, because it may, even at this late hour, help build \npressure for what the Senator from New Hampshire and I both want to do, \nwhich is somehow find a path to addressing these long-term entitlement \nchallenges. It may help do that.\n  In that spirit, I will support the amendment tonight.\n  Now we have Senator Bingaman ready.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator from New \nMexico?\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time does the Senator from New Mexico seek?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I need at most 15 minutes. I know my colleague from \nTennessee needs a comparable amount of time. I know there are others \nwho wish to speak, but I don't know if they will be able to come to the \nfloor at this point.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico. And \nthen the Senator from Tennessee, how much would the Senator seek?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Up to 15 minutes, please.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Senator from New Hampshire provide the Senator \nfrom Tennessee with time off his side on this amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would. I understand the Senator from South Carolina \nwants to speak on the Bunning amendment. Should we complete that \ndebate?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think in fairness to the other two Senators, we should \nlet them go forward with their amendment. Then we could come back to \nthe Senator from South Carolina for his comments on the Bunning \namendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Sounds good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from North Dakota seeking \nconsent to set aside the Bunning amendment so we may proceed to this \namendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, I think we should set aside the Bunning amendment so \nthat the Bingaman amendment may be offered. The Senator from Tennessee \ncould speak on that. We did ask them to come at this time to do so. I \napologize to Senator DeMint. We were not aware that he was on his way \nto the floor. In fairness, that is what we should do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 486\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Alexander, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Ensign, and \n     Mr. Reid, proposes amendment numbered 486.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide additional funding resources in FY2008 for \n    investments in innovation and education in order to improve the \n                 competitiveness of the United States)\n\n       On page 10, line 9, increase the amount by $1,008,000,000.\n       On page 10, line 10, increase the amount by $428,000,000.\n       On page 10, line 14, increase the amount by $345,000,000.\n       On page 10, line 18, increase the amount by $179,000,000.\n       On page 10, line 22, increase the amount by $35,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 1, increase the amount by $18,000,000.\n       On page 14, line 9, increase the amount by $11,000,000.\n       On page 14, line 10, increase the amount by $9,000,000.\n       On page 14, line 14, increase the amount by $3,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 12, decrease the amount by $1,019,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 13, decrease the amount by $437,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 17, decrease the amount by $348,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 21, decrease the amount by $179,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 25, decrease the amount by $35,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 4, decrease the amount by $18,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf \nof myself and Senators Alexander, Lieberman, Domenici, Ensign, and \nReid. This is an amendment that I believe will go a long way toward \nensuring that the United States maintains its preeminent status in our \nglobal economy.\n  On March 6, Senator Reid and Senator McConnell and many of the rest \nof us held a press conference on the introduction of a bill we called \nthe America COMPETES Act. The bill represents recommendations from two \nreports on the status of our Nation's ability to compete in the global \neconomy. Those reports are the National Academy of Sciences report on \n``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' and the Council on \nCompetitiveness report entitled ``Innovate America.''\n  Obviously, this is not the right time to try to enact that \nlegislation. Let me make it clear to my colleagues that we are not \nproposing that legislation as an amendment to the budget resolution. \nWhat we are proposing, though, is an amendment that tries to make sure\n\n[[Page S3462]]\n\nthat the budget ceilings, the overall amounts that are permitted for \nthe various agencies and functions of the Government, are as high as \npossible so that there is room in this budget to actually go forward \nand appropriate the funds called for in that authorizing legislation. \nWe hope we will bring up that authorizing legislation some time in the \nnext couple of months and get it passed and sent to the President.\n  Let me describe briefly what this amendment would do. It would \nprovide for the National Science Foundation to meet the President's \nrequested funding level of $6.4 billion for the Department of Energy. \nIt would allow the budget to meet the President's request for the \nOffice of Science at $4.4 billion, as well as provide funding that \nwould allow for a program similar to that administered by the Hertz \nFoundation for training a new generation of Ph.D. students in the \nphysical sciences. For the National Institutes of Science and \nTechnology, it will provide necessary funding to meet the $704 million \nauthorization level in the bill, thereby strengthening programs such as \nthe Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership to help small and \nmedium-sized businesses compete in the global economy.\n  The reports I referred to were important in that they tapped into and \nidentified a growing uneasiness that is being experienced throughout \nthe country about our ability to remain competitive in world markets. \nIt is clear that we are slipping in our world leadership role in \nscience and engineering. We are losing site of the importance of long-\nterm investments in creating the conditions for prosperity.\n  In 1995, Alan Greenspan was quoted as saying:\n\n       Had the innovations of recent decades, especially in \n     information technologies, not come to fruition, productivity \n     growth would have continued to languish at the rate of the \n     preceding 20 years.\n\n  Recent work that has been done by the Federal Reserve bears out that \na broader category of such intangible investments now accounts for a \nfull 11 percent of our gross domestic product and that much of our \neconomic growth is attributable to these activities: research and \ndevelopment and information technologies. The statistics that we have \nbear out that while we are not yet at a point of crisis, we are \napproaching one. At the macro level, the fastest growing economies \ncontinue to increase their research and development investments at \nnearly five times the rate of the United States. Collectively, we have \nChina and Ireland, Israel, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan \nincreasing their research and development investment rates by 214 \npercent between 1995, when Alan Greenspan made his statement, and 2004. \nDuring that same period when they were increasing their investment by \nover 200 percent, the United States was increasing its investment by 43 \npercent.\n  A recent survey of several industries in the United States and Europe \nfound that 48 of 235 recent or planned research and development \nfacilities would actually be located in this country; 55 were to be \nlocated in China, 18 in India. Indeed, on a trip I took to India a \ncouple years ago, we learned that the Intel Design Center for Intel \nCorporation in Bangalore is now designing chips that are fabricated by \na manufacturing plant in New Mexico. It used to be the other way \naround. It used to be that we would do the design work, the high-end, \nvalue-added work here, and the manufacturing would occur elsewhere.\n  The achievement and interest level of U.S. students in math and \nscience is a serious problem for all of us. In fact, the most recent \nNAEP assessments of educational progress in math reveal that only 23 \npercent of 12th graders in this country performed at or above \nproficient. That is in the year 2005. Unfortunately, this assessment in \nscience reveals that the scores for 12th graders have declined since \n1996 in each of the science areas--in the earth sciences, physical \nsciences, and life sciences. Only 18 percent of 12th graders scored at \nor above proficient in science.\n  So the issues are serious. They are ones about which more and more of \nthe opinion leaders and thoughtful students of this subject have come \nto be concerned. These reports have been a major contribution to the \ndialog. Those of us in Congress are now called upon to actually put in \nplace some solutions to these problems.\n\n  I believe passing this amendment to the budget resolution to ensure \nthat there will be room in the budget for funding to meet these very \nimportant needs is extremely important.\n  Let me also acknowledge--and this is something for which I commend \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee--the budget resolution before us \nincreases funding for education by more than $6 billion over what the \nPresident proposed. Much of that increased funding is to allow for full \nfunding in the appropriations process of some of these math and science \neducation initiatives and also strengthening math and science teaching \nskills for our Nation's teaching workforce. That is clearly intended by \nthe budget resolution. The amendment we are offering today does not \npropose increases in funding in that area because, in fact, the budget \nresolution itself does make room for the funding increases that America \nCOMPETES calls for.\n  Let me acknowledge the extremely impressive leadership of my \ncolleague from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, in focusing the attention \nof the Congress on this issue. He has been the single most aggressive \nMember of the Senate in making sure we continue to address this issue \nat every stage. As I see it, our amendment is one step in that process. \nI know it has the support of Senator Reid. I believe it also will have \nthe support of the managers of the legislation. I hope it has the \nsupport of all Senators, Democratic and Republican.\n  I should point out that the offset that this legislation calls for is \nessentially whatever change in funding the Appropriations Committee \nchooses to make in so-called function 920. It gives them discretion to \neither do a very modest across-the-board cut in other funds or find \nsome other way to locate the funds needed.\n  This legislation would add $1.9 billion that is currently not \npermitted in the budget for these essential items. It is important that \nwe pass the amendment. I urge all my colleagues to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from New \nMexico. He has been working at this a long time. He helped originate \nthe report by the National Academy of Sciences to which he referred, \n``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' He has also performed a service \nto the Senate and the country by doing some of the hard, less \nglamourous work, because he has worked his way through the budget \nprocess and, in his words, we are making sure with this amendment that \nwe have room in the budget to appropriate funds to support what I \nbelieve is the single most important legislation before the Congress \nthis year; that is the America COMPETES Act which has been introduced \nby the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, and by the Republican leader, \nSenator McConnell.\n  At one stage in its development over the last 2 years it had 70 \nSenators, an equal number of both parties, supporting it and has been \nvetted and worked on by at least a half dozen of our committees. I \nthank Senator Bingaman for his long-time leadership on this effort, \nespecially for making sure there is room in the budget for it.\n  On this side of the aisle, we talk a lot about progrowth policies and \nprogrowth investments. We usually mean tax cuts when we talk about \nthat. I learned a long time ago that while low taxes and balanced \nbudgets are one important part of a progrowth strategy, they are not \nthe only important part.\n  When I was Governor of my State, the Senator from New Hampshire was \nGovernor of his State. That is a low-tax State. It was nearly as low a \ntax State as Tennessee when we were both Governors. That was important. \nBut we also found out in Tennessee that if we wanted an auto industry, \nwe had to have good four-lane highways. If we wanted to grow new jobs, \nwe wanted to have a good banking. That was part of a progrowth \nstrategy.\n\n  But more than anything else, the most important part of a progrowth \nstrategy in my State was schools, colleges, and universities. We \nlearned that better schools, colleges, and universities meant better \njobs.\n  So this legislation we are talking about is about America's \nbrainpower advantage. It is the reason why we produce a third of all \nthe money for\n\n[[Page S3463]]\n\nabout 5 percent of all the people in the world. It is because of the \nbig ideas that have come out of our country. From the automobile, to \nthe electric light bulb, to Google--they have been created here. The \njobs are here and the standard of living is higher here.\n  But the rest of the world has figured that out. They have the same \nbrains we do, and suddenly China is recruiting the most distinguished \nChinese professors from great American universities to come back to \nChina to build up China. You heard what Senator Bingaman said about \nwhat is happening in India.\n  We are talking about a little money for progrowth investments here. \nWe would make room for $1 billion the President requested--that the \nPresident requested--to restore funding for basic scientific research \nin math and science education so we can keep our brainpower advantage. \nThis is the real way to keep our good jobs from going to China and \nIndia and other countries in the world.\n  It is important to keep that $1 billion over the next year in \nperspective. That is half what we spend in the war in Iraq in a week. \nWe spent $237 billion on debt last year, $378 billion on Medicare, $545 \nbillion on Social Security, at least $70 billion on hurricanes. We are \ngoing to be asked to pass a $100 billion supplemental request for the \nwar in Iraq.\n  We will not have enough money to pay all these important bills unless \nwe keep enough money in the budget for the investments that keep our \nbrainpower advantage so we can keep our jobs. That is where we get all \nthat money.\n  The Bingaman-Alexander amendment would help make room for the $1 \nbillion requested by the President to fund basic research in math and \nscience education.\n  Specifically, one, it would restore $398 million for the National \nScience Foundation, bringing the total to $6.429 billion, as requested \nby the President.\n  Two, it restores $610 million for the Department of Energy's Office \nof Science, bringing the total to $4.481 billion, which meets the \nPresident's request, and then adds $70 million extra for three programs \nthat are part of the Reid-McConnell America COMPETES Act: Discovery \ninstitutes, PACE Graduate Fellows, and Distinguished Scientists.\n  It adds $11 million for the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, as authorized for next year by the Reid-McConnell \nlegislation.\n  The majority leader and the minority leader, in the midst of some \ncontentious discussions in the Senate--which we have regularly--are \nrising above that and putting this piece of legislation into play. I \nknow of no other piece of legislation that has that kind of bipartisan \nsupport that is that important to the future of our country. It is \nbased on work Senator Bingaman, Senator Domenici, Senator Mikulski, \nSenator Ensign, Senator Lieberman, Senator Hutchison, and many others \nhave been a part of. Senator Frist and Senator Reid put the bill in, in \nthe first place, toward the end of last year.\n  It began because Senator Bingaman and I and others walked down the \nstreet to the National Academy of Sciences and said: Please tell us \nexactly what we ought to do, in priority order, to keep our brainpower \nadvantage. Give us 10 specific things to do. They gave us 20, in \npriority order. That was put together with other important work done by \nthe Council on Competitiveness. Then here we are today with the \n``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' report and with the Council on \nCompetitiveness' report.\n  The bill, the America COMPETES Act, to which this amendment relates, \nauthorizes $16 billion in new spending over 4 years. But this is a \nsignificant savings over the original legislation, the one that was \nsponsored by 70 Senators and reported by the committees. We took out $3 \nbillion from the bills passed by Energy and Commerce. We avoided a \nnumber of duplicative undergraduate scholarship programs. We wanted \nprogrowth investment, but we wanted to do it wisely and prudently.\n  I wish to conclude my remarks with some of the provisions of the \nAmerica COMPETES Act. I know the Senator from South Carolina is waiting \nto speak, and others will be speaking, too, so I will conclude my \nremarks quickly. But it includes such matters as doubling funding for \nthe National Science Foundation. It will set the Department of Energy's \nOffice of Science on track to double in funding over 10 years. It will \nstrengthen the skills of thousands of math and science teachers, and \nothers.\n  As I said, provisions of the America COMPETES Act include double \nfunding for the National Science Foundation, or NSF, from $5.6 billion \nin fiscal year 2006 to $11.2 billion in fiscal year 2011; setting the \nDepartment of Energy's Office of Science on track to double in funding \nover 10 years, increasing from $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2006 to over \n$5.2 billion in fiscal year 2011.\n  Another provision is to strengthen the skills of thousands of math \nand science teachers by establishing training and education programs at \nsummer institutes hosted at the National Laboratories and by increasing \nsupport for the Teacher Institutes for the 21st Century program at NSF.\n  Another provision is to expand the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship \nProgram at NSF to recruit and train individuals to become math and \nscience teachers in high-need schools.\n  Another provision is to assist States in establishing or expanding \nstatewide specialty schools in math and science that students from \nacross the State would be eligible to attend--as they do now in North \nCarolina and other States.\n  Another provision is to expand Advanced Placement, AP, and \nInternational Baccalaureate, IB, programs by increasing the number of \nteachers prepared to teach these math, science, and foreign language \ncourses in high schools. This would allow thousands of new students to \ntake these outstanding college preparatory classes.\n  Another provision is to provide grants to universities to establish \nprograms modeled on the successful UTeach program at the University of \nTexas--where students getting a bachelor's degree in math or science \ncan concurrently earn teaching credentials and become the new \ngeneration of math and science teachers.\n  Another provision is to create partnerships between National \nLaboratories and local high-need high schools to establish centers of \nexcellence in math and science education.\n  The challenge America faces today is really about brainpower and \njobs.\n  We Americans--who constitute just 5 percent of the world's \npopulation--produced about 30 percent of the world's wealth last year. \nYet we worry that America may be losing its brainpower advantage. We \nsee what is happening in China and India and other countries, too, such \nas Finland, Singapore, and Ireland. We face a new ``flat'' world where \nmore and more countries can compete with us, and we must rise to the \nchallenge. That is why we must fund this progrowth investment in our \neconomy and create the best new jobs here instead of shipping them \noverseas. That is why I hope all my colleagues will join in supporting \nthis amendment.\n  One more point. We asked our National Academies what to do to keep \nour brainpower advantage. We worked 2 years through various committees \nand many changes to bring our legislation to this point. We still have \nsome way to go, although a parallel path is being pursued in a \nbipartisan way in the House.\n  I believe we will get there, and get there soon, with this kind of \nleadership. But we should realize President Hu of China walked over to \nthe National Academy of Sciences in China last July, and they do things \nin a little different way. He announced to his joint academy meeting in \nthe Great Hall of the People exactly what China's innovation effort \nwould be over the next 10 years, how they are going to increase their \npercentage investment in the gross domestic product, how they are going \nto improve their universities and elementary and secondary schools, and \nexactly what they would do to recruit distinguished Chinese leaders to \ncome back, because they know their brainpower advantage, to the extent \nthey can develop and improve on it, is the most important aspect of \ncreating good jobs and a higher standard of living here.\n  So this legislation is a step in that direction for us. We have much \nmore to do. We have the research and development tax credit to make \npermanent. We have provisions in the immigration legislation which have \npassed once,\n\n[[Page S3464]]\n\nwhich I hope pass again, to in-source brainpower, to give a preference \nto people with high skills in science, technology, engineering, and \nmath. Let them stay here, create jobs here instead of in other \ncountries. We are going to continue to work on that.\n  But Senator Bingaman has, by his leadership and persistence, come up \nwith an amendment, which I join him in cosponsoring, which will make \nroom for funding. We need to properly support the America COMPETES Act \nthat Senator Reid and Senator McConnell have cosponsored, along with 40 \nof us right now. Hopefully, we will be keeping that brainpower \nadvantage and, therefore, keeping our good jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to withhold for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to comment very briefly on the \namendment that was offered.\n  I commend Senator Bingaman and Senator Alexander for one of the most \nthoughtful amendments I have seen being offered on the budget \nresolution. It is bipartisan. It is something that has been very well \nthought through. It is almost a model for how things ought to be done \nin this Chamber. So I especially commend Senator Bingaman and Senator \nAlexander for this effort, and many other colleagues who have been \ninvolved in it. I hope it serves as an example for everybody about how \nwe do business around here. I thank the two Senators very much.\n  Mr. President, we now have Senator DeMint who wants to comment \nbriefly on the Bunning amendment and also lay down an amendment. We \nhave an understanding we have the potential of a side-by-side amendment \nwith the DeMint amendment, if that becomes necessary. Senator Gregg and \nI have talked about that.\n\n\n                        Importance of Education\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. As the chairman knows, strong math and science \neducation is critical if we, as a nation, are going to continue to have \na skilled and educated workforce that can compete in the global \neconomy.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, I agree.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Does the chairman agree that we need to improve K-12 \nmath and science education for all students in this country and do all \nwe can to strengthen the math and science teaching skills of the \nteaching workforce?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, these are both very important elements to \nmaintaining our economic edge.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am very pleased that the chairman's mark increases \nfunding for education by more than $6 billion over the President's \nproposed budget, and I ask, was it the chairman's assumption that this \nincrease should be used, in part, to fund provisions that will \nstrengthen K-12 math and science education and strengthen the math and \nscience teaching skills of the teaching workforce?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the chairman and look forward to working with \nhim to ensure these critical programs receive funding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I join Senator Bingaman and other \ncolleagues to offer an amendment to increase our investment in our \nNation's economic competivenes.\n  Our amendment will provide just over $1 billion for the coming fiscal \nyear to support world-class research in the physical sciences and for \neducating our next generation of scientists.\n  Just over a year ago, the National Academy of Science report, \n``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' focused national attention on a \nchallenge of enormous significance. We are not doing enough to harness, \nand develop, our national brainpower.\n  Earlier this month, I joined a bipartisan group of Senators to \nintroduce the America COMPETES Act, S. 761. This act is the result of a \nremarkable cooperative effort, involving three Senate committees and \nvaluable contributions from a number of Senators. We have the support \nof the majority leader and the minority leader, and we are going to \nmake this happen.\n  All of us that worked to write this legislation are deeply concerned \nabout maintaining our Nation's ability to compete in the high-tech, \nglobal marketplace.\n  Our bill increases our investments in science and mathematics \neducation at all levels--kindergarten through high school, college, and \ngraduate school. The America COMPETES Act will also build on \neducational programs at Department of Energy laboratories. These \nprograms will strengthen the teaching skills of math and science \nteachers throughout the country.\n  The America COMPETES Act authorizes a doubling of research dollars to \nkey research agencies, including the Department of Energy Office of \nScience, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology.\n  The amendment we offer today will allow us to follow through on the \npromise of the America COMPETES Act. We need to devote the resources \nnecessary to meet the goals of this important legislation.\n  We need to take action now to support our standard of living and \nensure we continue to grow and prosper. If we do not, we can expect \nother nations to rival our global competitiveness--and one day to \nsurpass us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we set the \npending amendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 489\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 489.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a reserve fund for Social Security reform)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESERVE FUND FOR SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM.\n\n       If the Senate Committee on Finance reports a bill or joint \n     resolution, or an amendment is offered thereto, or a \n     conference report is submitted thereon, that provides changes \n     to the Federal Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance \n     Benefits Program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) by--\n       (1) requiring that the Federal Old Age and Survivors Trust \n     Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund are to \n     be used only to finance expenditures to provide retirement \n     income of future beneficiaries of such program;\n       (2) ensuring that there is no change to current law \n     scheduled benefits for individuals born before January 1, \n     1951;\n       (3) providing participants with the benefits of savings and \n     investment while permitting the pre-funding of at least some \n     portion of future benefits; and\n       (4) ensuring that the funds made available to finance such \n     legislation do not exceed the amounts of the Chief Actuary of \n     the Social Security Administration's intermediate actuarial \n     estimates of the Federal Old Age and Survivors Trust Fund and \n     the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, as published in \n     the most recent report of the Board of Trustees of such Trust \n     Funds;\n     the chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may \n     make the appropriate adjustments in allocations and \n     aggregates to the extent that such legislation would not \n     increase the deficit for fiscal year 2008 and for the period \n     of fiscal years 2008 through 2012.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, as we all came into this debate on the \nfirst Democrat budget, a lot of us had high hopes. If you think back to \nthe November elections, it seemed, at least for a few months, that \nRepublicans and Democrats, in many ways, were saying a lot of the same \nthings. We all decided it was very important we stop wasteful spending. \nWe talked about reducing the debt. We even talked about keeping some of \nthe tax relief that had gotten our economy going and created more jobs, \nalthough there is certainly some disagreement as to which tax cuts \nshould be kept in place.\n  As we see the Democratic budget at this point, there are certainly a \nnumber of us who are disappointed, particularly as we see this budget \nallows crushing tax increases to hit Americans at every income level, \nas well as tax increases on the businesses that provide us all our \njobs. Even more, there is nothing in this budget that does anything to \ncut spending. We all know there is wasteful spending\n\n[[Page S3465]]\n\nthroughout this Federal Government. We need to get about the task of \nfinding it and cutting it.\n  Perhaps the worst example of wasteful spending is when we take the \ntaxes people pay for Social Security and, instead of saving them, we \nspend them on other things. For a number of years now, the amount of \ntaxes all Americans pay in every paycheck for their future Social \nSecurity income--they have actually been more than we need to pay the \nbenefits of current retirees. It is what we refer to as the Social \nSecurity surplus. But instead of saving this surplus over the years, we \ntake that money and put it in the general fund and spend it on all \nkinds of things.\n  Even worse than spending Social Security on other things is we do not \ncount it as debt when we talk about the deficit every year. So using \nthe Social Security money is actually a way to hide even more wasteful \nspending without counting it as debt.\n  Now, for everything we borrow from Social Security, we put an IOU in \nthis so-called trust fund, with this idea someday we are going to pay \nit back. But we need to try to remind the American people there are no \nplans in this Congress--and there never have been any plans--to pay \nthat money back. Unfortunately, the Democratic budget that has been \nproposed over the next 5 years will spend over $1 trillion additionally \nin Social Security taxes, as well as the interest that is supposed to \nbe paid on that money that has already been borrowed. So the money that \nshould be saved for the future of Americans in their retired days is \nbeing spent every year, and it is being used to conceal more and more \nwasteful spending.\n  A lot of us have heard the news reports over the last year or two \nabout the number of corporate pension plans that are going broke. The \nreason for that is, over the years not enough money has been put in \nthose pensions to allow the companies to actually pay the benefits that \nhave been promised. We call that an underfunded pension plan. It is \ncreating huge problems for us throughout our country and for a number \nof workers who are counting on those pensions in their retirement.\n  But as we consider Social Security, it is a pension plan. It is a \npension plan Americans pay into with the reasonable expectation that \none day they will be able to get their promised benefits. But Social \nSecurity is not only an underfunded pension plan, it is a completely \nunfunded pension plan. Not one dime of all the trillions of dollars \nthat have been put into Social Security over our lifetime is saved. As \nI said before, it is actually being used to obscure a bigger debt and \nto obscure more and more wasteful spending at the Federal level.\n  I commend Senator Bunning for his amendment that would require our \nbudgeting needs not budget these Social Security dollars for other \nspending. I think it is very important that we take this a step \nfurther. Not only should we not spend the Social Security surplus, but \nwe should take that money and put it in a reserve account so we \nactually save it for the future instead of giving it to the general \nfund to spend on anything we in Congress can come up with. Take the \nSocial Security surplus--the cash itself will be about $80 billion this \nyear; if you count the interest, it gets well more than that--put it in \na reserve account and not spend it.\n  The amendment I have offered would allow us, within the budgeting \nprocess, to set this money aside and not spend it. Unless we support \nthis amendment as part of the budgeting process, when we bring this up \nto actually get it done some time this year, there will be a point of \norder against it and it will not be allowed to pass. So it has to be \ndone now. That is the purpose of this amendment.\n  Now, what will happen if we pass this amendment and we take this \nmoney off the table and no longer allow Congress to spend it? Then we \nare going to have to be honest about our debt, and we are probably \ngoing to have to cut some wasteful spending because this money is not \ngoing to be available for us to spend. It will put a lot of pressure on \nboth parties, Republicans and Democrats, to figure out how to cut \nwasteful spending and how to save the Social Security money we promised \nto future generations. If we put it in a reserve account, we will also \nstart the process to create a funded Social Security system, a Social \nSecurity system that has real money so we can keep our promises to \nfuture generations.\n\n  So I support Senator Bunning's amendment. I offer another that will \ntake it a step further, so that the money we take off the table cannot \nbe spent on anything else; it has to be in a reserve account and can \nonly be spent on Social Security in the future. I wish to thank the \nSenator for allowing me to offer that amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, would the Senator be open to some \nquestions with respect to his amendment so we might clarify it so we \nmight have a floor understanding of the intention of the Senator?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me first say that in large measure, I am in agreement \nwith what I hear the Senator saying. I have always thought we are \nengaged in ``funny money'' accounting around here, taking Social \nSecurity money and using it to pay other bills. That is the object of \nthe Senator's amendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Well, that is part of the goal. The goal is not to spend \nit on other things but to actually set it aside so we don't spend it. \nIn the past, as the Senator knows, we talked about lockboxes, where we \ndon't spend it, but in effect we do spend it, even if it is paying down \nthe debt.\n  The goal of the amendment is to take money that is surplused for \nSocial Security and say it will only be spent for Social Security. This \namendment doesn't take it any further than that. It doesn't tell \nCongress how the money should be saved or invested; it doesn't get into \nthe more controversial aspects of will it go into personal accounts. It \ndoes not establish individual ownership at all. These are the things \nthat have divided us in the past.\n  But I think we agree with the basic concept: Let's take Social \nSecurity off the table and somehow save it in a way that we can't spend \nit so we can be more honest in our accounting.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That raises a whole series of questions, and that is \nanother thing I wanted to ask the Senator about. If it is set aside, if \nit is not used to pay down the debt, how would those funds be invested \nunder the amendment from the Senator?\n  Mr. DeMINT. My amendment doesn't specify. Congress would have to \ndetermine that. As the Senator knows, as part of the budget process, \nthis does not affect it happening. We would still have to perform the \nact of taking the money off the table. I think, again, as a majority \nSenator, you would have a greater determination of how that money is \nsaved. There is no intent in my amendment to direct how it is saved. It \ncould be T bills or something within the Federal Government. But the \nhope is we will put it in some type of holding or savings that is not \npart of the general fund anymore. It is not spent.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, is there anything in this amendment that \nwould prevent it from being invested in some other securities other \nthan Government bonds?\n  Mr. DeMINT. There is nothing that allows for it or prevents it. So I \nassume, again, with my colleagues in control of what comes to the \nfloor, there is no danger of it drifting into any controversial area. I \nthink we can certainly agree on some safe savings that would be risk \nfree for the American people.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is there anything that would prevent the funds from going \nto private accounts?\n  Mr. DeMINT. It does not allow for that in any way. That would have to \nbe a separate piece of legislation, so that would be determined by--\nthis legislation does not open the door for private accounts.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator for his answers to those questions. \nHas the Senator sent the amendment to the desk?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I appreciate that. We have an understanding that if there \nis a desire to have a side-by-side amendment, that will be open to our \nside. I thank the Senator for answering those questions and for \noffering the amendment.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3466]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in the interest of trying to move things \nalong with some dispatch, we have now had a number of amendments \noffered, including the Bunning amendment, the DeMint amendment, the \namendment by Senators Bingaman and Alexander. We now want to make \ncertain we are ready to go to the Allard amendment. We are told Senator \nAllard will be here momentarily. That would be the next amendment in \norder. We are trying then to go to the Baucus amendment. We are trying \nto reach his staff to see if that would be accommodated within his \nschedule. We also have Senator Collins. When would she be available?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as I understand it, Senator Collins expects \nto be here by 11:45 to present her amendment. Then, as I also \nunderstand it, at 12:30, we go to an hour which is agreed to and under \nthe rule they have an hour certainly available to them on the Humphrey-\nHawkins, and that would be Senator Brownback and Senator Schumer, I \nbelieve, who have that hour.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let us check with Senator Baucus and see.\n  Mr. GREGG. We certainly want to accommodate Senator Baucus on our \nside.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right. Let's see if we can't work that out in the \nnext few moments. Until then, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I see Senator Allard has now come to the floor. We want \nto thank him for helping expedite the consideration of the budget \nresolution. We very much appreciate his coming on short notice to the \nfloor to offer his amendment.\n  Senator Allard's amendment is now in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator seek unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Precisely so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, while I am getting set up, I ask unanimous \nconsent to set aside the pending business. I have two amendments at the \ndesk, and I ask unanimous consent to call them up en bloc and send them \nto the desk.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, we have only been noticed \non this side about one amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Yes. I plan on calling it up--I wish to call up both \namendments so I have votes on them. The first amendment, and then the \nsecond amendment I plan on putting in the group of amendments we will \nvote on at the end, which we only allow a few minutes for debate. The \nfirst amendment I was going to call up--this will be the one we will \ndebate and take up floor time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right. Fair enough.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wish to send up----\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could we get the second amendment?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I will be glad to get those to my colleagues. Here is the \none on discretionary spending, the one we will be debating during this \ntime period. Would the Senator like the second amendment before I send \nit up?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have a procedure we try to follow so that we see \namendments before they are sent to the desk. That would be very helpful \nto us. We were noticed on the Senator's first amendment. That is the \namendment the Senator offered in the committee; am I correct?\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is the one that was offered in committee dealing \nwith discretionary spending. The second amendment deals with mandatory \nspending.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I appreciate that. If the Senator could send up the one \nwe have seen and withhold on the other until we have had a chance to \nlook at that.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That would be fine.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I appreciate it very much.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I wish to make sure we get an opportunity to vote on the \nsecond amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, the Senator's right will be protected to have both \nof these amendments voted on.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator very much.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 491\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments about the \nPART program in general, which is a program that has been put in place \nby the Congress through a piece of legislation that was passed more \nthan a decade ago. This program directs the agencies to set up \nmeasurable goals and objectives, and then we go in later on and those \ngoals and objectives are evaluated to see if the agency is actually \nmeeting those goals and objectives.\n  The piece of legislation, which was passed more than a decade ago, \nwas called the Government Results and Procedures Act. So these agencies \nhave had time to work with this program for some time under the Clinton \nadministration as well as the Bush administration.\n  When making funding decisions, Members of Congress should consider \nwhat they are buying for the taxpayer. Funded programs should be \neffective and efficient. The Federal Government has completed \ncomprehensive assessments of the performance of almost 1,000 programs, \nrepresenting 96 percent of the total program funding using this Program \nAssessment Rating Tool, which is referred to as PART. These detailed \nprogram assessments and the evidence on which they are based are \navailable for the public to view at www.expectmore.gov. It is a very \ngood reference for the public to use--for, in fact, Members of Congress \nor any agencies to know exactly where they stand as far as where their \nperformance standards are concerned.\n  These assessments represent the combined wisdom of career officials. \nThis is not a political process, these are objective evaluations done \nby career officials at agencies and OMB--the Office of Management and \nBudget--and are based on evidence of that program's performance.\n  Programs assessed with the PART receive an overall rating. The best \nrating they can get is ``effective.'' Then it goes to ``moderately \neffective,'' ``adequate,'' ``results not demonstrated'' or \n``ineffective.'' While a program's overall rating should not be the \nsole determinant of its funding, Congress should prioritize funding \nprograms that perform well. Ineffective programs, in particular, should \nbe scrutinized to determine if the resources they use could be better \nspent elsewhere and if their goals could be achieved through another \nmeans.\n  When determining where to invest resources, Members of Congress can \nlook to the PART for important information. No. 1: Does the program \naddress an existing problem, interest or need, and those that do not \nshould not be funded.\n  The other question to be asked is: Does the program have performance \ngoals that relate to the outcomes the American people want? Those that \ndo not may not be worthwhile investments of taxpayer dollars. Do \nindependent, rigorous evaluations demonstrate that the program is \neffective? If not, Congress may want to reconsider whether to fund the \nprogram.\n  If evaluations have not been conducted, Congress may want to consider \ninvesting some money in an evaluation to determine if the program is \nhaving its intended impact.\n  Is the program working to improve its performance is another question \nwe ask. A program that does not have an improvement plan in place or is \nnot working aggressively to improve may not be the best investment of \nresources.\n  The other question: If an increase in funding is requested for a \nprogram, has the program explained how the additional funding will \nimpact its performance? Programs that cannot articulate how they will \nuse their resources simply aren't the best candidates for investment.\n  So that is what the PART Program is all about. It is a good program, \nand it is being implemented more and more throughout the agencies.\n  Some of the PART findings are programs that have been ineffective. \nLet's look at a few of those.\n  PART found that actual additional natural gas reserves attributable \nto technology developed by the Natural Gas Technology Program have been \nrelatively small. Moreover, as noted by the National Academy of \nSciences:\n\n       It is difficult to separate the contributions made by the \n     Department of Energy and contributions made by industry and \n     others.\n\n  Another program rated ineffective by PART is the Migrant and Seasonal \nFarmworkers Program, which may not concentrate enough on providing \ntraining and employment. Each year, more than 60 percent of the \nprogram's approximately 30,000 participants receive only supportive \nservices, such as emergency cash assistance. They don't carry on with \nthe goal and objective, which is training and employment. Although \nthese services are important, they are not contributing significantly \nto helping participants gain stable, year-round employment. If we want \nto train them, we need to look at that program.\n  PART found the same thing with the Health Professions Program. One \nstudy found that only 1.5 percent of the physicians trained by \ninstitutions receiving the program's family medicine training grant \nprovided health care in areas with a physician shortage, compared to \n1.1 percent of physicians trained by other institutions. There is only \na four-tenths of a percent performance difference. What is that program \naccomplishing?\n  PART found no evidence that the Radiation and Exposure Screening and \nEducation Program reaches the maximum number of beneficiaries or the \nbeneficiaries who are at the greatest risk. There is not even an \nestimate of the number of people potentially affected by uranium and \nnuclear testing activities and where they might live.\n  Another program rated ineffective by PART is the Juvenile \nAccountability Block Grants Program. It was found ineffective because \nit has no measurable impact on either juvenile crime or the juvenile \njustice system to date.\n  These are only a few of the programs that have been looked at by the \nPART Program. I think they provide the information Members of Congress \nneed to evaluate whether programs are ineffective.\n  The amendment before us just addresses a portion of discretionary \nspending. The full PART Program evaluates mandatory programs and \ndiscretionary programs.\n  I put forward two amendments. The amendment before us is the \ndiscretionary program where we will get a considerable amount of \ndebate. The mandatory amendment is one the chairman asked be reviewed, \nand he assured me I will have an opportunity to offer that amendment at \na later time.\n  So I rise today asking Members to support this amendment where we \ndeal with the discretionary spending as the PART Program is being \napplied. The overall purpose of the amendment is to pay down the \nFederal debt and eliminate Government waste by reducing spending on \nprograms rated ``ineffective'' by the Office of Management and Budget's \nPART program. This is through the career professionals in the agency. \nThis is not driven by any kind of political agenda. PART is a \nGovernment-wide assessment of the performance of almost 1,000 programs, \nagain, representing 96 percent of total program funding.\n  If we look at programs in the discretionary spending area which are \nrated ineffective, it amounts, over the time period of this budget, \nwhich is 5 years, to $88 billion of program spending. My amendment says \nwe will reduce 25 percent of the spending in this area, which is about \n$17 billion over the period of 5 years. We will say that those programs \nare ineffective and we need to reduce spending for those so that we \nmotivate the agencies to redo their programs, so they truly are \naccomplishing what was laid out for the original purpose of the \nprogram.\n  What happens in our budget that is before us is we have $900 billion \nin increasing taxes by default because we don't do anything to extend \nthose tax provisions which are expiring in 2010 and before. So my point \nis this: We are forcing the taxpayers to pay more into the Federal \nbudget, and at the same time we are spending $88 billion on ineffective \nprograms.\n  My amendment says we are going to take a portion of the $88 billion--\nabout $18 billion--out of here for a strong signal from the Congress \nthat we want to support effective programs and we want the taxpayer \ndollars spent in a responsible way. My amendment doesn't take all of \nthe $88 billion, realizing there may be points in time when another \nprogram is not meeting its goals and needs more money. So that \nflexibility is allowed in this particular amendment. It doesn't target \nany specific program. Those programs which I\n\n[[Page S3468]]\n\nrecounted to you are just representative of some of the efforts that \nhappen under the PART Program. It is a wonderful way for the Members of \nCongress to begin to evaluate whether a program is effective, and then \nnot just leave it there but say, through the budget, to those agencies: \nYou have to get your act together; we don't tolerate using taxpayer \ndollars--particularly when we are increasing your taxes--to allow those \nprograms to go on in an ineffective manner.\n  Almost worse than being rated ineffective, we have programs out there \nthat have made absolutely no effort at all to measure their results. I \nbelieve these are the worst offenders. In the following years, I hope \nCongress will look at those programs. They have absolutely refused to \ndo anything to create accountability so that the Members of Congress \ncan evaluate what is going on in those programs.\n  So that is what my amendment is all about. It is about saving \ntaxpayer dollars in a responsible way; it is about forcing managers of \nthese programs to put in effective goals and objectives so that they \naccomplish what the legislation intended. The budget authority is about \n$4.3 billion in each year, from 2008 to 2012. That comes close to about \n$18 billion or so, which is used to pay down the Federal debt.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in trying to bring \nforward more accountability in the programs we have passed. I think \nthis is a wonderful tool we have for whatever administration is in \ncontrol. This is a direct message to the agencies to get their act in \norder, because we are concerned about how taxpayer dollars are being \nspent. This is not an onerous amendment. It is trying to bring \naccountability to Government programs that we pass.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to Senator Allard, as I expressed in \nthe committee, the only problem I have with this amendment is that, \nunfortunately, a budget resolution cannot assure the right things would \nbe cut. As you know, we don't really have that power. We just give a \nblock of money to the Appropriations Committee and they decide how to \nspend it.\n  Mr. President, does the Senator need more time or could we go to \nSenator Baucus?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, let me summarize my comments and respond. \nI think if we look at our budget process, we hopefully--maybe not this \nyear but next year--will be able to put in some instructions to the \ncommittees. I understand we cannot specifically tell them but, as \nbudgeteers, we have an opportunity to put in instructions to the \nvarious committees to participate.\n  I hope this passes, and maybe we can deal with this in conference. If \nnot, maybe the chairman would look at it either in conference committee \nor in future years and we can put in some kind of instructions and say: \nLook at those programs under your jurisdiction and look at the ones \nclassified as ineffective and begin to demand more accountability on \nthose particular programs.\n  I hope we can get a ``yea'' vote on both of these amendments to send \na message, if nothing else, to the conference committee to get it \npassed. If it doesn't work out this year, maybe we can work it out in \nfuture years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste in support of both of my amendments be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Council for Citizens Against\n\n\n                                             Government Waste,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 2007.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Soon you will be voting on S. Con. Res. 21, \n     the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2008. \n     The Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW) \n     believes there are serious fiscal problems with this budget \n     proposal. It spends more money than the president requested; \n     it raises taxes by allowing the tax cuts that have led to our \n     robust economy to expire; and it doesn't address the looming \n     financial crisis our Nation faces--the exploding costs of \n     Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Furthermore, it does \n     not cut a single program, even those with questionable \n     results, or go after waste, fraud and abuse.\n       The budget proposal needs substantial improvements. Two \n     amendments, which will be offered by Sen. Wayne Allard (R-\n     Colo.), are a good place to start.\n       One amendment will help eliminate government waste by \n     reducing spending on programs that have been rated \n     ineffective by the Program Assessment Rating Tool or PART. \n     The amendment cuts discretionary spending by $4.3 billion in \n     the years 2008-2012 by simply reducing these ineffective \n     programs' annual funding by 25 percent.\n       The other amendment will reduce mandatory spending by \n     eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse by 1 percent. In a May \n     2004 Government Accountability Report (GAO), ``Opportunities \n     for Congressional Oversight and Improved Use of Taxpayer \n     Funds,'' several suggestions to find savings in mandatory \n     spending programs were provided to Congress. The amendment \n     saves $13 billion in the first year and $71 billion over 5 \n     years.\n       In both instances, any savings from these amendments will \n     reduce the debt and cannot be used for new spending.\n       On behalf of the more than 1.2 million members and \n     supporters of CCAGW, I urge you to support these amendments. \n     All votes on S. Con. Res. 21 will be among those considered \n     in CCAGW's Congressional Ratings.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Thomas Schatz,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think now would be a good time to go to \nSenator Baucus. I apologize to the Senator from Montana for the \nmiscommunication that occurred this morning. I apologize to him for \nthat. As a result, he came at 10 o'clock seeking time, which we all \nagreed was to be his time. Through a miscommunication, we wound up \ngoing to another Senator. I very much thank the Senator for his \nacceptance of the apology.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Allard amendment is set \naside.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from North Dakota, \nSenator Conrad. He has done a super job, almost impossible job putting \nthis budget together. It is tough enough to get agreements in this \nbody, and it is more difficult when it is a budget resolution. I \ncompliment my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their excellent \nand diligent work. I also say to him I appreciate his offer of an \napology with respect to the misunderstanding and miscommunication. This \nSenator is probably as much a part of the miscommunication as anybody.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 492\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus], for himself, Ms. \n     Landrieu, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, and \n     Mr. Nelson of Florida, proposes an amendment numbered 492.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide tax relief to middle class families and small \n    businesses and to expand health insurance coverage for children)\n\n       On page 3, line 13, decrease the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, decrease the amount by $52,700,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, decrease the amount by \n     $126,916,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 22, decrease the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 23, decrease the amount by $52,700,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, further decrease the amount by \n     $126,916,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 9, increase the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 10, increase the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 18, increase the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 19, increase the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, increase the amount by $5,200,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 2, increase the amount by $57,700,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, increase the amount by $131,916,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, increase the amount by $5,200,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by $62,900,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, increase the amount by \n     $194,816,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 17, increase the amount by $5,200,000,000.\n\n[[Page S3469]]\n\n       On page 5, line 18, increase the amount by $62,900,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, increase the amount by \n     $194,816,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 20, increase the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 21, increase the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 24, increase the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 25, increase the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 3, increase the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 4, increase the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 49, line 6, decrease the amount by $15,000,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I again commend the chairman for his able \nwork in bringing this budget to the floor. He has done a superb job.\n  The budget resolution before us leaves a surplus of $132 billion in \nthe year 2012. The amendment I now offer on behalf of Senators \nLandrieu, Pryor, Bayh, and Bill Nelson would state the Senate's will on \nwhat we should do if that surplus materializes.\n  In sum, our amendment says that the Senate's highest priority for any \nsurplus should be American families. Our amendment would put children \nfirst. It would take $15 billion out of that $132 billion and devote it \nto improving children's health care coverage under CHIP, the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. The budget resolution already recognizes this \npriority in a deficit-neutral reserve fund.\n  Our amendment would also reduce the amount in that reserve fund. So \nwe are not increasing the net amount of spending on CHIP. It will be \nthe same. We are just making that work on CHIP more likely.\n  We are saying if we have a surplus in 2012, then we ought to spend \nsome part of that surplus on children's health, and we are saying if we \nhave a surplus in 2012, we should not raise taxes to pay for all of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. If we have a surplus in 2012, we \nshould not cut Medicare to pay for all of CHIP. Rather, we should use \nsome of that surplus to fund children's health; that is, put children \nfirst.\n  Then our amendment takes the rest of the surplus and returns it to \nthe hard-working American families who created it. Our amendment \ndevotes the rest of the surplus to the extension and enhancement of tax \nrelief for hard-working American families.\n  Here are the types of tax relief about which we are talking. We are \ntalking about making the 10-percent tax bracket permanent. That is a \ntax cut for all taxpayers. Obviously, if the 10-percent tax bracket is \nmade permanent--that is, for all years--all taxpayers who pay income \ntaxes, irrespective of their income, irrespective of their bracket, get \na tax break.\n  We are talking about extending the child tax credit. That provides a \n$1,000 tax credit per child. This tax credit recognizes a family's \nability to pay taxes decreases as family size increases. Unless we act, \nthe child tax credit will fall to $500 per child. Currently, it is at \n$1,000. The child tax credit should be made permanent. We need to \nrecognize the financial responsibilities of childbearing.\n  We are also talking about continuing the marriage penalty relief, \nwhich is a tax cut on which the American family has come to rely. It is \ngoing to continue. We know that. We should recognize that fact. \nMarriage penalty relief makes sure a married couple filing a joint \nreturn has the same combined tax liability as they would have if they \nwere not married.\n  We are also talking about enhancing the dependent care credit. \nClearly, this credit is very important to working families. It \nrecognizes the additional cost for raising children in this fast-paced \nsociety.\n  We are talking about improving the adoption credit. The majority of \nadoptions cost over $20,000. This provision offers a credit of $10,000 \nfor those willing to give a home to a needy child.\n  We are talking about providing combat pay under the earned-income tax \ncredit, otherwise known as the EITC. Under current law, income earned \nby a soldier in a combat zone is exempt from income tax. That is good. \nThis actually, however, hurts low-income military personnel under the \nEITC. If not for the EITC combat pay exception, combat zone pay would \nnot count as earned income for purposes of determining the credit. This \namendment makes that exception permanent so that military families can \nget the full benefit of the EITC.\n  We are talking about reforming the estate tax. We want to try to give \nAmerican families certainty. We want to support America's small farmers \nand ranchers, and in this amendment, we have allowed room for estate \ntax reform that will do that.\n  And we talk about returning surplus revenues to hard-working American \nfamilies.\n  That is what our amendment does. It is very simple, very \nstraightforward. It says we should put America's kids and families \nfirst. It says if we have a surplus, these are the priorities it should \nbe used for. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from North Dakota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, they have changed presiding officers on \nme. It is good to have you in the chair.\n  Madam President, I thank very much Senator Baucus for his leadership \non this very important amendment. This amendment is to reassure all \nthose who have benefited from the middle-class tax cuts that those tax \ncuts will go forward, that those children who are not now currently \ncovered under the SCHIP legislation will have the opportunity to be \ncovered.\n  The Senator has also provided for small business because we have a \nnumber of provisions that are critically important to small business \nand, of course, to prevent the estate tax from having this bizarre \noutcome, which is now in the law, where the exemption would go down to \n$1 million from $3.5 million just two years before. That makes no \nsense. So the Senator provides for room in this amendment to deal with \nestate tax reform.\n  The precise contours of that will be up to, obviously, the Finance \nCommittee. The Senator is providing the resources to provide for the \nmiddle-class tax cuts, to have estate tax reform, to have SCHIP funded \nso those kids will be funded, and to have critical elements of small \nbusiness covered as well.\n  I appreciate very much the leadership the Senator has provided in \nputting this amendment together. All of us know if those provisions \ncame to the floor, they would enjoy broad bipartisan support. In fact, \nthey would probably get supermajorities. They might get 70 votes on the \nSenate floor. So it makes sense to have them in the resolution.\n  I thank Senator Baucus. He has spent a lot of time energy, and effort \nbringing colleagues together around this amendment. I, for one, \nappreciate it. I hope my colleagues will support the Baucus amendment. \nI know there have been dozens of colleagues--I think virtually every \nmember of our caucus--who have been involved in the discussions about \nthe elements of the amendment that the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee has offered.\n\n  Madam President, would the Senator like more time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I believe this amendment should be \nadopted by every Senator because essentially it is saying if we have a \nsurplus in 2012, as contemplated by the budget resolution, these are \npriorities all of us support. If these were before the Senate today as \nactual tax provisions--and they will be, I am sure, at some future date \nbecause the current tax cuts don't expire until 2010--that we will vote \nfor them anyway because it is the right thing to do.\n  Marriage penalty relief, child tax credit, the combat pay exception \nfor soldiers, adoption credit, the 10-percent bracket--these are all \nprovisions that are very important. The American public deserves them. \nI hope very much this amendment will be adopted by all Members because \nI think it is something all Members and all the citizens of our country \nsupport.\n  I see the ranking member is on the floor. I would be interested in \nknowing the degree to which he enthusiastically supports the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I suspect I will support it, although I \ndon't know, but I wish to ask the chairman\n\n[[Page S3470]]\n\nof the Finance Committee a few questions so I get more specifics on the \namendment.\n  What is the total cost of this amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is approximately $195 billion. It allocates the \nprojected surplus that is in the budget resolution.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I might ask, Madam President, further, of the chairman, \nthe surplus, however, is in the year 2012. So what happens to these \nrates in 2011 that will expire? Are those picked up?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is a good question. The answer to that is \nessentially this is a 5-year budget resolution, so we want to balance \nthe budget in 5 years, in 2012. But because the tax cuts that are \nmentioned in the amendment currently expire in 2010, the Senator raises \nthe question about 2011, 2012. If I understand the import of the \nquestion of the ranking member of the Budget Committee, it is what \nhappens in 2011.\n  Mr. GREGG. Or 2010.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In the earlier years, 2010, there would be a deficit, but \nby the time we finish the 5 years, there would be a surplus. We have \nwritten this amendment in a way to prevent a yo-yo, on-off effect of \nthe tax provisions. To make it perfectly perfect, so there is not a \ndeficit in any year, 2010, 2011, or 2012, we can have the tax cuts go \nup or down, and so forth, but I think it is best for the American \npeople not to have a yo-yo effect, not go up and down, but to extend \nacross the board those provisions which are contained in the amendment \nat the end of the day would not be a deficit.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would it be appropriate--if I can ask the chairman of the \nFinance Committee or the chairman of the Budget Committee--I want to \nget to what the tax cuts are specifically, but they would be extended \nif they expired in 2010, 2011, or 2012, they would be extended through \nthat period. If that is the case, then the Senator must be using more \nthan the surplus in 2012. He must be using some number in 2010 by which \nyou increase the deficit and 2011 by which you increase the deficit.\n  My question is, what is the number the Senator is using for 2010 and \n2011 to account for those extensions in those years?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is true, in those years there is deficit spending, but \nit comes in balance in 2012.\n  Mr. GREGG. But how do they score in those 2 years?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think it is $194 billion for those 3 years 2010, 2011, \n2012.\n  Mr. GREGG. So there is another $60 billion on top of the surplus that \nis used; is that correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Approximately.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I have a question, if the Senator will recognize me for a \nquestion, if the Senator will allow me to ask a question of Senator \nBaucus. I think the Senator from New Hampshire has the time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think I have the time for the purpose of asking \nquestions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question by the Senator from New Hampshire \nis pending.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I have a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator to ask whatever questions he has. I \nhave additional questions.\n  Mr. ALLARD. In effect, this adds to the debt?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Sorry?\n  Mr. ALLARD. In effect, this amendment adds to the total debt?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No, we are back in balance by 2012 at the end of the 5-\nyear period contemplated by this amendment. In the meantime, we are in \ndeficit for the years 2010 and 2011.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the answer to your question, if I might interject, \nis it increases the debt by $195 billion.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I had $194 billion, but $195 billion. That seemed to me \nit did increase the debt. Maybe we can check that out.\n  Mr. GREGG. That would have to be what it does.\n  May I ask a further question of the Senator. It costs $195 billion \nover the 3 years to extend these tax cuts. Is the education tuition tax \ncredit presumed in that number?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. There is an underlying answer to all these questions; \nnamely, these are questions the Finance Committee is going to address \nand find the appropriate offsets and deal with the pay-go when it comes \nup at that time. But essentially, education tuition tax credits are not \nprovided for in this amendment, but are in the budget resolution.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I may ask further, Madam President, would the expensing \nsection 179 accounts be included in that number?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Section 179 expensing is not contemplated.\n  Mr. GREGG. In this number. Is capital gains contemplated in this \nnumber?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is not.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is continuing the dividend rate contemplated in this \nnumber?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is not.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator. I think that answers my questions. I \nam presuming what is contemplated in this number then will be the \nmarriage tax penalty and the child credits; is that correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Those two and some others, correct, including the 10-\npercent bracket.\n  Mr. GREGG. And the 10-percent bracket. I am presuming I certainly \nwill be supportive of this amendment in its present form. However, I do \nsuspect we are going to have an amendment which picks up the other \nextensions.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I expect we will.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is the arbitrariness of the process around here that \nthe Senator from Montana is first to the surplus that was left, but the \npractical effect of our amendment will be essentially the same as the \nSenator's, which is to extend the tax credit rates. That is tax \ndeductions--tax rates. I also think the ones we are going to suggest we \nextend--and we will get to this in our debate--are ones which are more \noriented toward economic activity, generating or creating economic \nactivity, than the extensions which are included in the chairman's \nproposal, which are all good and appropriate but which don't translate \nother than through maybe greater consumption directly into economic \nactivity, such as the capital gains and the dividend rate does, and the \nexpensing, obviously.\n\n  We will have that discussion when we offer ours, and I appreciate the \nchairman's courtesy in allowing me to ask him these questions.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I will say to the body, the world, and \nalso primarily to the Senate and the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, of course, these are all issues--that is, those issues \nraised basically by the ranking member of the Budget Committee--that \nthe Finance Committee is going to work on over the next several years. \nIt is up to us, up to the committee, and up to this body to find the \noffsets to pay for them. We will do the very best we can. I think we \ndon't want to get into a deficit situation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, if the Senator will yield for one further \nquestion, what is the chairman, within his score, what is he \nanticipating as to how the death tax treatment would be dealt with?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The estate tax provision.\n  Mr. GREGG. The death tax.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Some people call it the death tax. We all know what we \nare talking about. This amendment contemplates extending the estate tax \nprovisions that are in effect in 2009 permanently.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the chairman will yield further, and through the \nPresident, I would ask, in 2009, what is the exempted amount?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Again, under current law I think the exempted amount is \n$3.5 million.\n  Mr. GREGG. That would be the minimum in 2009 also?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The 2009 extension. The point is that the resolution also \ncontemplates--well, it has an additional $4 billion that can be used \nfor other tax purposes, including changing the provisions of the \nFederal estate tax.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I thank the chairman for his courtesy.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I again want to thank very much Senator \nBaucus for offering this amendment, which is to protect the middle-\nclass tax cuts and to make certain we don't have this anomaly of the \nestate tax being at $3.5 million in 2009 and\n\n[[Page S3471]]\n\nthen going down to $1 million. That makes no sense. The Senator has \nsaid very well that the amendment he has provided would prevent that \nfrom occurring, and there are some additional funds that would be used \nto make those provisions even more attractive, or they could be used \nfor other tax provisions.\n  The truth is, the budget resolution doesn't cite that. We give \ncertain instruction to the Finance Committee and, ultimately, the \nFinance Committee is going to make these judgments. What the chairman \nof the Finance Committee has said is that it is his intention to have \nestate tax reform to protect the middle-class tax cuts and also to have \nthe resources to extend children's health care coverage to every child \nin America. Every single witness before our committee, and I think it \nis fair to say virtually every witness before the Finance Committee, \nhas said that covering children, as the Senator from Montana has so \naggressively pursued--coverage for every child in America is the right \nthing to do substantively for this country. Covering children is the \nleast expensive thing to do and has the greatest payoff as an \ninvestment because a child's entire life is then improved if they catch \na health care problem when they are young.\n  I think the Senator from Montana has put together an amendment that \ndeserves the support of every Member of the body.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. I might ask the question, Madam \nPresident: Basically, what are budgets? Budgets are an expression of \npriorities. This budget is designed to express what this body thinks, \nwhat so many of us think are the proper priorities for this country. \nSince the resolution has about a $132 billion surplus, we think the \nstrong priority should be to use that to help middle-income Americans.\n  The provisions in this amendment provide for that and clearly help \nkids get health insurance. A major problem in this country, clearly, is \nhealth care. We spend so much on health care. Yet there is some \nquestion what we get out of it. This country spends $6,300 per person--\nthat is per capita--on health care, which is almost twice as much as \nthe next most expensive country. Yet we are not twice as healthy. The \nproblem, clearly, is coverage; that is, not everybody has health \ninsurance. Everybody in America should have health insurance.\n  The other question is cost, but this amendment addresses the coverage \nside of it; that is, trying to help more people get health insurance, \npeople who do not now have health insurance. Where do we begin? We \nthink we begin with kids. Currently, there are about 6 million children \nwho are covered under the Children's Health Insurance Program. There \nare about 6 million others who are eligible but not covered. We \nbelieve, and this amendment states, that if we begin providing health \ninsurance coverage for more Americans, we should certainly begin with \nkids. When we begin with kids, let's help those kids who don't have the \nsame financial means that other kids have.\n  A lot of other kids, fortunate for them, their families, father and \nmother, have a good job and health insurance is part of the job. But we \nare talking about kids who don't have that. These are kids whose income \nlevels, or their parents' income level, is just above the qualifying \nrate for Medicaid. Medicaid does provide health insurance for kids, but \nthere are a lot of kids who don't get health insurance because their \nfamily's income is just above the Medicaid cutoff. That needs to be \ncovered under the Children's Health Insurance Program, on which this \namendment is designed to expand.\n  So I would summarize by saying that I think it is a proper set of \npriorities, given the resources we have, and I hope every Senator \nsupports this amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 480\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 480, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside, and the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself, Mr. \n     Warner, and Mr. Smith, proposes an amendment numbered 480.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a deficit-neutral reserve fund for permanently \n   extending and increasing the above-the-line deduction for teacher \n classroom supplies and expanding such deduction to include qualified \n                   professional development expenses)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR EXPANSION OF \n                   ABOVE-THE-LINE DEDUCTION FOR TEACHER CLASSROOM \n                   SUPPLIES.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the allocations, aggregates, and other levels in this \n     resolution by the amounts provided by a bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     would permanently extend and increase to $400 the above-the-\n     line deduction for teacher classroom supplies and expand such \n     deduction to include qualified professional development \n     expenses, provided that such legislation would not increase \n     the deficit over the total of the period of fiscal years 2007 \n     through 2012.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, the amendment that I have proposed, \nwith my colleagues, Senator Warner and Senator Smith, would establish a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund to allow for the expansion of an existing \ntax credit for schoolteachers and other educators who buy supplies for \ntheir classroom. The reserve fund that our amendment creates would \nallow for an increase in the current $250 deduction to $400, and it \nwould make it permanent. This tax deduction is available to educators \nwho incur out-of-pocket expenses in order to improve the educational \nexperience of their students.\n  The amendment would also allow this above-the-line tax deduction to \nbe claimed for expenses related to professional development.\n  This amendment builds upon a $250 tax deduction in the current law \nthat Senator Warner and I authored in 2001. It became law as part of \nthe tax relief package that passed that year. This tax relief was later \nextended through the end of this year, and I would suggest that there \nis no reason for us to have the uncertainty about the continuation of \nthis valuable tax deduction. We should move to make it permanent.\n  Teachers who buy classroom supplies in order to improve the \neducational experience for their students deserve more than just our \ngratitude. They deserve this modest tax incentive to thank them for \ntheir commitment and their hard work. So often teachers across this \ncountry, and certainly in the State of Maine, earn modest salaries. Yet \nthey dig deep into their own pockets to spend money to improve the \nclassroom experience of their students.\n  A survey by the National Education Association found that teachers \nspend, on average, $443 a year on classroom materials. Other surveys \nshow that they are spending even more than that. In fact, a survey \nconducted by the National School Supply and Equipment Association has \nfound that educators spend, on average, $826 to supplement classroom \nsupplies, plus an additional $926 for instructional materials on top of \nthat; in other words, a total of $1,700 out of their own pockets.\n  I have spoken with literally dozens of teachers in Maine who tell me \nthat they routinely spend far in excess of the $250 deduction limit \nthat is in current law. I have made a practice of visiting schools all \nover Maine. In fact, I visited approximately 160 schools during the \npast 10 years, and I have seen firsthand the dedication of our \nschoolteachers to their students. At virtually every school that I have \nvisited, teachers are spending their own money to benefit their \nstudents.\n  Year after year, teachers spend hundreds of dollars on books, \nbulletin boards, computer software, construction paper, stamps, ink \npads, just about anything you can think of. Let me give a couple of \nexamples. There are two elementary school teachers in Augusta, ME, \nAnita Hopkins and Kathy Toothacher, who purchased books for their \nstudents so they could have a classroom library, as well as workbooks \nand sight cards. They have also purchased special prizes to give to \ntheir students as positive reinforcement. Mrs. Hopkins estimates that \nshe spends between $800 and $1,000 of her own money on extra materials \nto make learning more enjoyable and to create\n\n[[Page S3472]]\n\na more stimulating classroom environment.\n  In addition to increasing the amount of this deduction, I think we \nshould also expand it so that it can be used by educators who are \npaying for their own professional development. We hear a lot of \ndiscussion about the provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act and \nabout the need for highly qualified teachers. One of the best ways for \nteachers to improve their qualifications is through professional \ndevelopment. Yet in towns in my State, and I expect throughout the \ncountry, school budgets are often very tight and money for professional \ndevelopment is often very small or even nonexistent.\n  That is why I think we should allow this tax deduction to also be \nclaimed when a teacher takes a course or attends a workshop and has to \npay for it out of his or her own pocket. In my view, it is the students \nwho are the ultimate beneficiaries when teachers receive professional \ndevelopment to sharpen their skills, or perhaps teach them a more \ninnovative way to teach the material and present it to their students.\n  Studies have consistently shown that other than involved parents, the \nsingle greatest determinant of classroom success is the presence of a \nwell-qualified teacher. I know from talking to educators across Maine \nthat they are eager to take advantage of professional development \nopportunities in order to make an even more positive impact on their \nstudents.\n  The teacher tax relief that we have made available since 2001 is \ncertainly a positive step, and I am very proud, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Warner, to have authored that law. Today, we can set \nthe stage for making that deduction permanent, for expanding it to \ninclude professional development, and to increase it to $400 to more \naccurately reflect what educators really spend in the classroom.\n  This amendment is a small but appropriate means of recognizing the \nmany sacrifices that teachers make each and every day to benefit \nchildren across America. I am very pleased that the National Education \nAssociation has endorsed this amendment, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat a letter from the NEA supporting the amendment be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 21, 2007.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Education \n     Association's (NEA) 3.2 million members, we urge your support \n     for an amendment (S. Amdt. 480) to be offered by Senators \n     Collins (R-ME), Warner (R-VA), and Smith (R-OR) to the Senate \n     Budget Resolution that would increase, expand, and make \n     permanent the tax deduction for educators' out-of-pocket \n     classroom supply expenses. Votes associated with this issue \n     may be included in the NEA Legislative Report Card for the \n     110th Congress.\n       The educator tax deduction helps recognize the financial \n     sacrifices made by teachers and paraprofessionals, who often \n     reach into their own pockets to purchase classroom supplies. \n     Studies show that teachers are spending more of their own \n     funds each year to supply their classrooms, including \n     purchasing essential items such as pencils, glue, scissors, \n     and facial tissues. For example, the National School Supply \n     and Equipment Association found that in 2005-2006, educators \n     spent out of their own pockets an average of $826.00 for \n     supplies and an additional $926 for instructional materials, \n     for a total of $1,752.\n       The amendment would add a deficit neutral reserve fund to \n     the Budget bill, directing funding sufficient to increase the \n     deduction to $400, make it permanent, and expand it to cover \n     professional development expenses. This expansion is critical \n     as teacher quality is the single most critical factor in \n     maximizing student achievement. Ongoing professional \n     development is essential to ensure that educators stay up-to-\n     date on the skills and knowledge necessary to prepare \n     students for the challenges of the 21st century.\n       The current deduction was extended at the end of 2006, but \n     will expire again at the end of this year absent additional \n     congressional action. Increasing, expanding, and making the \n     deduction permanent will acknowledge the sacrifices made by \n     those who have dedicated their lives to educating our \n     children and will alleviate the uncertainty they face as they \n     wait each year to see if the deduction will be extended.\n       We urge your support for this important amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Diane Shust,\n       Director of Government Relations.\n     Randall Moody,\n       Manager of Federal Policy and Politics.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I hope the managers of the bill might \nbe willing to act on this amendment shortly.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, we have a unanimous consent request we \nare working on. I do not yet have that printed version before us so \nthat Senator Gregg and I might be able to enter into that.\n  I would like to talk for a moment to the Senator from Maine about her \namendment. If the Senator from Maine could tell me, what is the cost of \nher amendment and what is the proposed way of paying for it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, the way I have drafted the amendment is \nto use a technique that has been commonly used in the budget resolution \nof creating a deficit-neutral reserve fund. That means the committee of \njurisdiction, the Finance Committee in this case, would be required to \ncome up with an offset for the cost to avoid an impact on the budget. I \ndo not have a cost estimate from CBO yet on the proposal. It is not an \nexpensive tax incentive, but we have followed the wisdom and advice of \nthe leaders of the Budget Committee by drafting it in such a way that \nit would not have a budget impact.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. Does the Senator have a rough, even \nback-of-the-envelope estimate of the cost?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I would say to the chairman of the \nBudget Committee that we have requested an estimate, but we have not \nyet received one. Because of that uncertainty, we did go the route of \nthe deficit-neutral reserve fund so that, regardless of the cost, it \nwould be offset by the decisions made by the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator for the thoughtfulness of her \namendment. I thank her for doing it as a deficit-neutral reserve fund \nso it does not impact the budget and says to the committee of \njurisdiction that, if they come forward with the proposal, they will \nfind a way to offset the costs. I certainly appreciate what the Senator \nhas done so as to not have an adverse impact on the budget. We do \nappreciate that.\n  Madam President, does the Senator require a rollcall vote?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I do not.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, we have to check with the Finance \nCommittee before we can take this on a voice vote, but it is my \nintention, if we get clearance, to try to do that at the appropriate \ntime. I thank the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor working with me on this issue. I think it is a modest approach that \ncan make a real difference to the thousands of teachers across this \ncountry who dig deep into their own pockets in order to enrich the \nclassroom experience for their students. It is a modest but appropriate \nway for us to recognize their financial sacrifice. I hope the two \nmanagers of the bill will be able to clear the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I have given an amendment, which I hope \nto bring up at this time, to the majority as a courtesy. I am waiting \nfor them to take a look at it before I offer it.\n\n[[Page S3473]]\n\n  Essentially, this amendment deals with reconciliation. Reconciliation \nis a fairly arcane exercise, but it has significant impact around here. \nReconciliation is the tool the Budget Committee has, to put some teeth \ninto our efforts to try to control spending. There are no \nreconciliation instructions in the majority proposal. I wish there \nwere. I wish there were reconciliation instructions on entitlements, \nand I wish those reconciliation instructions had followed the \nsuggestions of the President, as I said in my opening statement, where \nhe made recommendations that were very reasonable and would not have \naffected beneficiaries but would have saved $8 trillion over the 75-\nyear life of Medicare and would have helped move them toward balance by \ngetting the providers paid correctly and by having very high-income \nindividuals contributing to the cost of their insurance, especially \ndrug insurance.\n  But there is also another side to reconciliation, and that is, as \ncommittees are given reconciliation instructions which save money, \nsometimes they take that money and they spend it, which is not the \npurpose of reconciliation. Reconciliation should not be used for a \ncover event for the purposes of spending money.\n  The majority has put in place a point of order that would make it \nvery difficult to use reconciliation for the purposes of reducing \ntaxes. It is perfectly reasonable that we should also make it very \ndifficult for doing that for purposes of spending money. I didn't want \nto eliminate the ability to spend money. Some money is going to be \nneeded, at least that these programs as they get adjusted in \nreconciliation should have, maybe, some adjustment. For example, 2 \nyears ago, when the HELP Committee received reconciliation instructions \non education accounts, they basically reduced the subsidy that went to \nlenders by approximately $20-some-odd billion, I think $21 billion or \n$22 billion. At the same time, they took some of that reduction in \nsubsidy and put it toward expanding the Pell Grant Program, especially \nfor people who were going into the math and science disciplines.\n  That was a good policy decision, and I don't want to tie the hands of \nour authorizing committees excessively, but I think there has to be an \nunderstanding that reconciliation is primarily an effort to control \nspending and to discipline spending on the entitlement side of the \naccounts. It doesn't deal with discretionary spending.\n  This amendment will essentially say that for every $10 you save under \nreconciliation expense, no more than $2 could be actually spent. So it \nsays you can't spend more than 20 percent of the savings that are \ngenerated in a reconciliation exercise. It is an attempt once again to \nput some discipline in here.\n  Why is it relevant to a budget that doesn't have any reconciliation \nat all? As I said, I wish this did have reconciliation. It is relevant \nbecause the House has put reconciliation instructions in, a very small \namount. It appears to me the intention of the House honestly is to use \nreconciliation as a cover for spending, not as a cover for controlling \nspending--which would be, in my opinion, an inappropriate action. That \nis why I brought forward this language. I hope others would agree with \nme that that would be inappropriate and certainly inconsistent with \nreconciliation as a concept.\n  I am handed a note to point out that when we did the reconciliation \ninstruction in 2005, we had net savings in that of approximately $40 \nbillion, which was the most recent large reconciliation instruction we \npursued in this Congress and which was constructive and which actually, \nin the outyears, turns into very significant savings.\n  This is basically to put in place a discipline which will allow us to \nbe sure the Budget Act's purposes are not abused and it is not used to \nrun interference and allow an easier path to greater spending on the \nentitlement side of the account.\n  It is a very reasonable approach. It doesn't totally bind the hands \nof the authorizing committees but makes it clear that a budget should \nbe for the purposes of a budget, which is to discipline the spending of \nthe Federal Government, and having this discipline in place is \nappropriate.\n  I would like to offer that amendment, hopefully in the near term, so \nwe can get it in the queue here.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Conrad). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the budget \nresolution currently before the Senate. I particularly wanted to speak \nin support of the additional funding that the resolution provides for \nthe Veterans' Administration, funding that will help one of the most \nimportant challenges facing the Nation today.\n  That challenge is how do we repay our men and women in uniform who \nhave sacrificed for us on the frontlines, on the battlefield, when they \nreturn home, and how do we ensure they have all the support and \nservices they need to resume their lives.\n  But before I turn to the VA funding, I want to first speak about the \ncurrent economic situation in America and how this resolution will help \nto even the economic playing field for the people of this country. When \nI would go around, especially in rural America, which I think you \nunderstand, Mr. President, and start talking about economic issues, I \nwould be in a situation where I would think 10 people would come to a \nsmall cafe and 100 people would show up.\n  When the price of gas goes up over $3 a gallon, such as it did last \nsummer, people who have a longer way to drive will feel it first. When \nthey have two kids they are trying to send to college, and tuition at \nthe University of Minnesota goes up 110 percent, they feel it first. \nWhen their health care premiums go up 60 percent in 7 years, such as \nthey have been in our State, middle-class people feel it first. When it \nis their kids who are going to war and their neighbors and their \ncousins and their grandkids, they feel it first in their hearts.\n  That is what this is about, at the national level, the economic \npolicies that produce record deficits and ever-mounting debt. What was \na $128 billion Federal budget surplus in 2001 turned into a $258 \nbillion deficit in 2006. A $5.6 trillion 10-year projected surplus in \n2002 has turned into a $2 trillion projected deficit.\n  Federal deficits have gone up by $1.5 trillion, with most of it being \nheld by Government and companies in China and India and many of our \neconomic competitors. This resolution will begin the effort to restore \nfiscal sanity and responsibility to our Government. It includes a \nstrong pay-as-you-go rule that requires that we pay for any new \nmandatory spending or offsets or else get 60 votes to approve it. There \nwill be no more spend-as-you-like bills.\n  This does not mean there will be no new mandatory spending or tax \ncuts to help working families. In fact, the resolution includes a \nreserve fund for new tax relief measures but only if we find \nappropriate offsets. It means we have to work to implement them in a \nfiscally responsible way.\n  The resolution also makes it much harder to push through budget \nreconciliation measures that are now used in the opposite way than they \nwere intended, to increase the budget deficit or decrease the budget \nsurplus. This resolution signals an end to the spend-as-you-like \npolicies that have created our current fiscal problems at the national \nlevel.\n  My colleagues and I have, in the Budget Committee, started reversing \nthis trend and putting the interests of middle-class families front and \ncenter. This budget resolution is a good start.\n  I would like to address the veterans provisions in the resolution, \nwhich I think are also very important to the middle-class families in \nour country.\n  In the past 4 years, American military service personnel and their \nfamilies have endured conditions that are unprecedented, including \nrepeated deployments. I cannot tell you how many families I speak to \nwhere their kids have been asked to serve not once in the National \nGuard but to be repeatedly called back, and every time they say \n``yes.''\n  One and a half million American service men and women have served in\n\n[[Page S3474]]\n\nIraq and Afghanistan. These wars are creating a new generation of \nveterans who need their country to stand with them. These are men and \nwomen who have served our country on the frontline, and when they come \nback to the country, they are too often shunted to the end of the line \nwaiting for health care, waiting for education benefits, and now as the \nshocking revelations from Walter Reed have shown us, some have been \nleft waiting in the most squalid of conditions.\n  I wish to commend you, Mr. President, and members of the Budget \nCommittee for recognizing that the President's request for fiscal year \n2008 severely shortchanged the needs of veterans in this country. \nPassage of this resolution, with $3.5 billion added to the President's \nrequest for a total of $48.1 billion in discretionary veterans spending \nshould be our highest priority.\n  At a time when we are spending billions on awards of reconstruction \nprojects overseas, we can certainly afford this increase in veterans \nfunding at home.\n  In addition to providing billions more for veterans health care and \nother support programs, this resolution rejects the President's \napparent belief that now is the time to increase mandatory fees that \nveterans must pay under TRICARE. The President's budget called for an \nincrease in TRICARE pharmacy copayments from $8 to $15. It calls for an \nannual enrollment fee based on a veteran's family income. It proposed \nto require veterans to cover their entire copayment for nonservice-\nconnected disabilities. This budget resolution blocks those outrageous \nproposals.\n  This administration has shockingly underestimated the number of \nveterans who would require medical care. To give you an example, in \nfiscal year 2005, the Department of Defense estimated it would have to \nprovide care for 23,500 veterans when they came home from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. In reality, Mr. President, more than four times that \nnumber required help.\n  Last year, the Pentagon underestimated the number of veterans who \nwould require care by 87,000. That this administration underestimated \nand underfunded veterans programs should not come as a surprise. Ever \nsince the war in Afghanistan and Iraq began, the administration has \nseemed oblivious to the fact that when you send hundreds of thousands \nof solders into battle, you must have a plan to provide for the \nhundreds of thousands of veterans whom you are creating and Active-Duty \nsoldiers who will require substantial support when they return home.\n  With this additional discretionary spending, we can begin to \nseriously address the repair of traumatic brain injury and \npolytraumatic injuries suffered by the soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan \nthat have so tragically become the signature injuries of this war.\n  We can enhance and expand the recovery and rehabilitation centers for \nthe 30,000 wounded Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. We can provide \nincreased counseling and create greater awareness of the tens of \nthousands of veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and \nother mental illnesses. According to a Veterans Health Administration \nreport, roughly one-third of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who sought \ncare through the VA have been diagnosed with potential symptoms of \npost-traumatic stress, drug abuse or other mental disorders.\n\n  On an issue that is particularly important to Minnesotans, we can \nincrease benefits for National Guard members and Reservists who are \nbeing asked to play the role of Active-Duty soldiers on the battlefield \nbut then are treated as second-class veterans when they return home.\n  This past weekend, I traveled to Iraq with three of my colleagues to \nvisit our troops in the field and assess the situation on the ground. I \nwas fortunate to have the opportunity to thank the brave men and women \nfrom my State for their sacrifice. The sacrifices our troops are making \nand the risks they are taking was driven home in a poignant and \npowerful moment at the Baghdad airport, when I stood with nine Duluth \nfirefighters who are members of Minnesota's National Guard.\n  They were there to show their respect for fallen soldiers. They stood \nthere and saluted as six caskets were loaded onto an airplane, all of \nthem draped in the American flag. I watched these men stand stoically \nbut sadly, and then I saw them return to their task at hand.\n  With all the political noise in Washington about the war in Iraq, we \noften lose touch with what the perspective is of the men and women on \nthe frontline. I went to Iraq to find that perspective. I met marines \nin Fallujah from Roseville and Rochester. I met a Navy Seabee from \nAppleton, MN. I met Army soldiers assigned to help train Iraqi troops \nfrom Minneapolis and St. Paul. I met Army Reservists based out of Fort \nSnelling. I met National Guardsmen attached to the fighter wing in \nDuluth. These soldiers and National Guard members I met in Kuwait, \nBaghdad, and Fallujah, they did not ask about the resolution the Senate \nwas debating, they did not ask me about what my plan was to bring them \nhome to their families; they did not ask about the shortages in \nequipment and body armor; they did not ask about repeated tour \nextensions. They only asked about two things: First, they wanted to \nknow what the results were of the Minnesota High School Hockey \nTournament.\n  But they asked one more thing. They asked that we take care of them \nwhen they return home. I pledged to them, and I bring that point to the \nSenate floor today, that their sacrifice will not be overlooked, that \ntheir service will not be forgotten, and their debt will be repaid.\n  The VA funding in this resolution is the first in a series of \npayments toward the debt we owe these soldiers on the frontlines who \nhave sacrificed for us. I have always believed when we ask our young \nmen and women to fight and to make the ultimate sacrifice for our \nNation, we make a promise we are going to give them the resources they \nneed.\n  This has always been a country that believed in patriotism, and \npatriotism means wrapping our arms around those who have served us.\n  In his second inaugural address, President Lincoln reminded the \nAmerican people that in war, we must strive to finish the work we are \nin, to bind up the Nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have \nborne the battle and for his widow and his orphan.\n  Today, Americans are again called to bind up our Nation's wounds and \nto care for those who have borne the battle, as well as their families \nwho have shouldered their own sacrifice.\n  Let us live up to this solemn obligation to bring our troops home \nsafely and to honor our returning soldiers and their families by giving \nthem the care and the benefits they have earned.\n  That is why I support the veterans funding included in this budget \nresolution.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that the time from 12:30 to 1:30 \ntoday be for debate only, equally divided and controlled between \nSenators Schumer and Brownback--this is the Humphrey-Hawkins report \nthat is part of any consideration of a budget resolution; that at 1:30, \nSenator Grassley be recognized to call up two amendments, one relating \nto payment limits and one relating to the Smithsonian institution; that \nthere be a total of 60 minutes for debate with respect to the two \nGrassley amendments, with the time controlled 30 minutes for Senator \nGrassley and 30 minutes for the chairman of the Budget Committee; that \nno amendments be in order to either amendment during this debate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleagues for their continuing cooperation.\n  On the Collins amendment, we could accept that amendment at this \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I can't speak for Senator Collins. I don't know if she \nneeds a vote or not.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I asked her the direct question if she would require a \nrollcall vote. She said she did not.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then let's proceed.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, on the Collins\n\n[[Page S3475]]\n\namendment creating a deficit-neutral reserve fund for a teacher \nclassroom expense deduction, that that amendment be considered on a \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 480.\n  The amendment (No. 480) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The 12:30 hour having arrived, this is time controlled by \nSenators Schumer and Brownback.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we hope to also, later this afternoon, \nafter Senator Grassley has proceeded with his two amendments, proceed \npotentially to amendments from the other side of the aisle relative to \nSCHIP and from our side of the aisle relative to SCHIP and then an \namendment in response to the amendment of the Senator from Montana, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee. That would be the sequence I hope we \ncan get to later today. Those are all important amendments. We would \nlike to get them done. It would be constructive.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is correct. That is the intention. After the \namendments of Senator Grassley are discussed and debated, we would then \nbe able to turn to a discussion of SCHIP with both sides participating, \nSenator Kyl thereafter to be recognized to offer an alternative to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Montana.\n  We await the Senators whose time has been reserved. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak as chairman of the Joint \nEconomic Committee in terms of our Humphrey-Hawkins budget debate time.\n  Today, we are going to begin putting the Nation's fiscal house back \nin order and to get our economic policy priorities straight. I salute \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, the indefatigable Kent Conrad, \nfor the great job he has done over the years in trying to get our \ncountry back on the right fiscal track.\n  For the last 6 years, we have been governed by a shallow economic \nstrategy, guided by deep and indiscriminate tax cuts. The strategy has \nproduced burgeoning deficits, mediocre economic performance, and a \nserious global trade imbalance. My colleagues and I on this side of the \naisle have a different policy vision. We believe the middle class is \nthe backbone of the country and that when we pursue policies to help \nthe middle class feel confident about their economic future, we produce \na strong economy, capable of meeting just about any challenge.\n  We have not had those kinds of policies or that kind of economy over \nthe past 6 years. The economy went through the most prolonged jobs \nslump since the 1930s, as it struggled to recover from the 2001 \nrecession. Then, while the economy was growing, it was not producing \nenough jobs. In the summer of 2003, job creation began to turn upward \nagain but not as rapidly as we were used to in past economic \nrecoveries. Something was still missing--growth in real wages.\n  In the past, increased productivity meant real wages increased. In \nrecent years, American workers have continued to be remarkably \nproductive. However, while our output per hour grew 18 percent from \n2001 through 2006, after adjusting for inflation, workers' pay and \nbenefits grew only by half as much--8.7 percent. That is serious stuff. \nWhen output goes up and workers only retain less than half of it, \nsomething is the matter.\n\n  Even that modest growth in compensation came much more from benefits \nthan from wages. It is not that employers were becoming more generous \nin providing benefits. To the contrary, benefit costs have been \nincreasing because health care insurance costs are rising, and \nemployers have had to make contributions to restore the solvency of \ntheir pension plans. Those higher benefit costs squeezed take-home pay, \nbut workers have not been getting more generous benefits in return. \nThey are shouldering more of the burden for their health insurance, and \ntheir pensions remain in jeopardy.\n  So where have the benefits from economic growth been going? They have \nbeen going to profits and salaries and bonuses of top executives. \nProfits as a share of national income are at an alltime high, and \nincomes at the very top of the economic scale have been soaring. At the \nsame time, middle-class families and families striving to get into the \nmiddle class have been struggling to get ahead.\n  I wish I could say businesses have been investing their profits to \nmake the economy grow, but another remarkable feature of the current \neconomic recovery is how slowly business investment is growing relative \nto profits. Business profits have been flush, yes, but business \ninvestment spending has been weak. There hasn't been any real trickle \ndown from the President's huge tax cuts to the rest of the economy. We \nhad a small growth spurt for a couple of years, but the most recent \nnews paints a picture of an economy that is growing at a pace below its \nlong-term sustainable potential.\n  The main results of the President's tax cuts have been, A, larger \nbudget deficits, and B, reduced national savings. With less of our own \nsavings, we are borrowing more from the rest of the world to support \nour current standard of living. The record current account deficit last \nyear--the amount we had to borrow from the rest of the world to finance \nour trade deficit--was equal to a stunning 6.5 percent of the entire \nGDP; 6.5 percent of the GDP goes to financing our trade deficit. We are \nborrowing more than ever from the rest of the world. Those debts will \nbe paid back with interest from the income of our children. The Federal \nGovernment is increasingly reliant on the rest of the world to buy our \npublic debt, and who knows what kind of financial crisis would ensue if \nthe rest of the world decided they no longer wanted to hold such vast \nquantities of U.S. debt. Even if they don't, the idea that we are \nsaddling our children to repay this debt is not fair to them and not \ngood for the future of America.\n  To conclude, it is no wonder that middle-class families do not give \nPresident Bush much credit for the economy. They are paying more for \ngas and utility bills. Their health insurance and prescription drug \ncosts are rising much faster than their pay, and college tuition costs \nare through the roof. They see good manufacturing jobs disappearing and \na wave of new competition from economies such as China and India. They \nare also less likely to support expanded trade because they sense that \nthe Government is not on their side when it negotiates trade \nagreements, and they see that some of our largest trading partners \nregularly flout the rules of free trade. They see a Federal Government \nthat doesn't pay its bills and is building up foreign debt that will be \na burden on our children and our grandchildren.\n  I commend Senator Conrad for crafting a budget resolution that gets \nus started on the road to recovery from these misguided policies. There \nis much work to do, but we are off to a good start with this budget \nresolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for having this \ndiscussion on the budget.\n  I am ranking member on the Joint Economic Committee. I wish to \ndiscuss some of the things Senator Schumer was talking about on \neconomic performance. What I would like to do in making this \npresentation--I will speak for 10 minutes now and 20 minutes later--is \nto talk first about what has taken place in the economy recently and \nthen to talk about human capital development that is important for us \nto develop more and into the future.\n  I think we have a bit of a different presentation on the factual \nsetting of what has happened as a result of the tax cuts. I believe \nthere would be agreement that if the economy has not substantially \nperformed as well as some may suggest, as the Senator from New York \nsuggested, then the answer is certainly not a big tax increase. That \nwould clearly not be the case if what we want to do is stimulate \neconomic growth. I believe there would be\n\n[[Page S3476]]\n\na broad basis of support and a realization of that from economists and \npeople around the world. If your economy is not performing well, the \nanswer is certainly not to put on a trillion-dollar tax increase to try \nto stimulate that economy to perform better. That would be clearly the \nwrong answer. Yet we are finding that in this budget.\n  I am here to discuss what has taken place in the economy. One of the \nkey questions the Senate will address during this debate is what \nprocedural rules to put in place to help instill budgetary discipline \non this institution. Unfortunately, those proposed fiscal discipline \nmeasures which appear in this budget amount to a little more than a \nguaranteed tax increase for the American public on the magnitude of \n$900 billion to $1 trillion.\n  As my colleague from New Hampshire has noted, it is the largest tax \nhike ever on American workers and their families--the largest ever. \nThat certainly would not be the prescription I would hear from most \neconomists as to how to get the economy performing better, to put on a \n$1 trillion tax hike.\n  As part of the majority's rhetoric, we will hear much talk about how \nthe fiscal policies--most notably the pro-growth tax policies--of the \npast 6 years have not benefitted everybody in this society. To \nsubstantiate that assertion, one can only rely on bits and pieces of \ndata and not the full view and the big picture of what has happened in \nthe economy, which is what I would like to cover, and cover now, and \ncover with charts, to let people see what the facts are and draw their \nown conclusions.\n  It is undeniable our Nation was heading into recession during the \nyear 2000, the last year of President Clinton's administration. I was \nin the Senate, and one could certainly see that in the economic data. \nThe dot-com bubble was bursting; economic growth turned negative in the \nthird quarter of 2000. The unemployment rate bottomed out in April of \n2000 and began its rise. In the period from January 2001 to August \n2001--the first year of the Bush administration--only 1 month \nregistered positive job growth. In that period, 700,000 jobs--nearly \nthree-quarters of a million--were lost.\n  Then came the horrors of 9/11, and the Nation's economy tumbled \nfurther. It was like hitting a brick wall and falling. From September \nto December more than a million jobs were lost. We all remember the \ntrauma to us as a country, and the trauma to the economy at that time.\n  I have a number of charts I will present today, and I hope they will \nput some perspective on our debate. We can argue about the degree to \nwhich pro-growth and pro-job tax relief enacted in 2003 caused the \neconomic turnaround. I think that is a legitimate debate. I would note, \nhowever, that recent economic conditions display a striking contrast to \nthe conditions that prevailed prior to enactment of pro-growth tax \nrelief under the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 \nthat was passed in May of 2003.\n  Consider these charts and the data behind them, and then draw your \nown conclusion.\n  Let's look at this chart on economic growth since 2000: inflation-\nadjusted annualized GDP growth. You can see where we were prior to and \nthen in 2000 and 2001 with negative economic growth rates taking place. \nYou can see anemic growth rates taking place afterwards. You can see \nwhat took place: tax relief enacted in May of 2003 and the strong \nspike, continuous spike in growth that took place.\n  Since the enactment of tax relief in 2003, annualized growth in the \ninflation-adjusted GDP, our gross domestic product--that is, the size \nof the pie, the size of the economy in the country--has averaged a \nrobust 3.5 percent growth rate. That compares with the relatively tepid \naverage of 1.3 percent from the first quarter of 2001 to the second \nquarter of 2003.\n  So you look at this period before tax relief: 1.3 percent; you look \nat the period since the tax cut enactment: a 3.5-percent average growth \nrate. I would much rather have a 3.5-percent growth rate than a 1.3-\npercent growth rate.\n  What about investment? That is a key part of our growth, to make \nproductivity grow, to make wages grow. Business investment is a key \ncomponent of economic growth.\n  Since the enactment of tax relief in 2003, growth in real business \nfixed investment has averaged 5.7 percent. With tax relief enacted. You \ncan see where we were beforehand, negative investment; afterwards, \npositive investment at a nice rate, 5.7 percent.\n  Prior to the enactment of tax relief, from the first quarter of 2001 \nthrough the second quarter of 2003, business investment declined at an \naverage rate of 5.6 percent; but it increased 5.7 percent on average \nafterwards--a direct mirror opposite with the investment and tax cuts \nthat took place.\n  Let's talk about unemployment rates. That is certainly a key. We want \nto have people employed in this economy, and employed at an aggressive \ngrowth rate. The unemployment rate has declined from a peak of 6.3 \npercent in June of 2003, when tax relief was implemented, to 4.5 \npercent in February of 2007.\n  So you can see again, with tax relief enacted, a decline in the \nunemployment rate takes place. At 4.5 percent, the unemployment rate \nstands below the average rate of the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s, and \nthe 1990s. Where we sit today stands below those average unemployment \nrates.\n  Again, tax relief was enacted. We can argue about, did that cause it \nor not, but I think you have to clearly say we have had a nice \nimprovement that has taken place in the time period following enactment \nof tax relief.\n  What about payroll employment changes since 2000? There have been 42 \nmonths of consecutive gains in payroll employment. Close to 7.6 million \nnew payroll jobs have been created during the period since September \n2003--again, that period when we did the tax relief.\n  From June of 2003 through February 2007, payroll employment gains \nhave averaged a healthy 169,000 per month. In contrast, 91,000 jobs \nwere lost on average in the period between January of 2001 and May of \n2003.\n  Again, you get this mirror situation where you were losing jobs prior \nto this time period, and you are growing them at a nice, strong, clip \nand engagement rate which is taking place after the enactment of tax \nrelief. Good, positive rates have taken place.\n  With that, Mr. President, I believe in our time agreement I had until \n12:50, and then I have 20 minutes at a later point. I will go through a \nseries of additional charts later, but my colleague from Pennsylvania, \nI believe, was going to speak. I do not know if the manager would like \nto take the time of Senator Casey at this point in time.\n  Mr. President, I ask the manager of the bill if her side desires to \nhave the floor at this point in time.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Yes, we would like to do that. We are awaiting the \narrival of Senator Casey. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I could, I will yield to Senator \nCasey as soon as he arrives on the Senate floor, if that would be \nacceptable to the manager?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. That would be acceptable. He is on his way.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, let's look at these numbers, the Institute for Supply \nManagement activity indexes. This indicates whether expansion or \ncontraction is taking place. The Institute for Supply Management \nindexes of manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities signals \nexpansion or contraction taking place in the economy. When it is above \n50, there is expansion. When it is below 50, there is contraction. \nThis, again, displays robust expansion following tax relief. In \ncontrast, it displays contraction or tepid growth prior to tax relief.\n\n  So you can see, again, the tax relief point that took place, as shown \non this chart. You had some growth. You had some decline taking place \nat this 50-percent point. Where it is below that 50-percent point, you \nhave contraction. Where it is above that 50-percent point, you have \nexpansion. After tax relief, you have a strong expansion rate, which is \ntaking place in these numbers.\n  While correlations do not imply causality, there has been a clear and \nstriking turnaround in a wide array of economic indicators from signals \nof contraction or tepid growth prior to enactment of the pro-growth tax \nrelief in 2003 to signals of strong expansion and robust growth \nfollowing tax relief taking place.\n  One final point. A key to increases in incomes, wages, and living \nstandards is\n\n[[Page S3477]]\n\ngrowth in productivity, as this chart clearly shows.\n  Again, we have a period where there is productivity growth and real \nhourly compensation going up. Pro-growth tax relief, such as that \nenacted in 2003, lays a solid foundation for continued strong growth in \nthe productivity of American workers. That growth is ultimately what \nboosts the wages, salaries, benefits, and living standards of American \nworkers and their families--built on a solid economic basis. Raising \ntaxes--raising taxes--as some on the other side are suggesting--is not \na productive way to proceed in us increasing real wages, real incomes \nfor individuals to stimulate the economy. In fact, the other route is \nthe way to go: get the economy growing built on fundamentals and built \non cutting taxes.\n  With that, Mr. President, I know my colleague from Pennsylvania is in \nthe Chamber.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak today about the budget we are \ngoing to be debating and about our economic prospects as we go forward. \nI also want to thank those who have been working so diligently to put \nthis budget package together. Senator Schumer has worked, especially as \nthe chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, to focus our attention on \nsome of the economic realities we face in the weeks ahead.\n  The fact is, when we look at the economic data, Wall Street has done \npretty well over the last 6 years, but the average American, however, \nhas not shared in that prosperity.\n  Since 2001, median household income is down after inflation. More \nthan 5 million more people--a total of 37 million Americans--live in \npoverty today, including 1.3 million more children. So now we have some \n12.9 million children in poverty.\n  Long-term unemployment is up 80 percent. Three million manufacturing \njobs have been lost in that time period, many from my home State of \nPennsylvania, like in manufacturing States across the country.\n  We also have to look beyond the data from where we are now and have \nbeen in the past. We have to look to the future. We all know we face a \ntremendous challenge when the retirement of the baby boom generation \nbegins in earnest. The coming retirement of those Americans means the \nSocial Security and Medicare obligations we owe them, because of their \ndecades of work, are coming due. At the same time, this administration \nhas been issuing debt, in my judgment, at an irresponsible and reckless \npace--most of it being purchased by governments across the world and by \nindividual countries we are competing against.\n  We hear a lot in the context of our energy policy about reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil. There is tremendous agreement about that \ngoal. I think in the economic context we can use the same language. It \nis about time the U.S. Government, especially this administration, \nbegan to get on the road of reducing our dependence on foreign debt. We \nneed to have policies that will do that.\n  For the last 10 years, prior to coming to Washington as a Senator, I \nwas a public official in Pennsylvania--8 as auditor general and 2 as \ntreasurer. One of the jobs I had, especially as auditor general, was to \nbe one of the so-called issuing officials. We issued debt in State \ngovernment. As part of that, one of my responsibilities, one of my \nbasic requirements, by statute, was to certify that Pennsylvania was \nnot only staying within its constitutional debt limit but was assuring \nit was not straining its borrowing capacity from an economic or fiscal \nstandpoint because doing so would undermine Pennsylvania's debt rating \nand drive up the cost of future borrowing.\n  I do not think there is anyone in this administration, or in this \nCongress for that matter, who could certify or would certify the \nFederal Government is not straining its borrowing capacity today, and \ncertainly for the last several years. The fact is, our debt is not just \na piece of paper filed away in some cabinet. It is real. It represents \na lot of things. It represents, first of all, a dependence upon other \ngovernments in terms of our foreign debt. It often represents a taking \naway from investments in very important programs for people.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, you understood that in your work in \nthe Congress and now in the Senate. You understand those critical \ninvestments. If you drive up the cost of borrowing, you make it more \ndifficult for us to not only borrow money but to invest. All of our \nfamilies will be the losers in that scenario.\n  So I think in addition to gaining control of our fiscal house and \nputting our fiscal house in order and beginning to reduce our \ndependence on foreign debt, we must also, at the same time--and I think \nit is obviously related--increase our investment in American families. \nWe need to start to do that by keeping our promises to those of our \nfamilies who rely upon good investments by the Federal Government.\n  We all know in a global economy--and certainly the newer global \neconomy--it is very clear that goods can be moved all over the world. \nWe are happy about that. It is amazing what technology and \ntransportation have done to bring that about. Money can move in a \nmatter of minutes now. We know that. But people, by and large, tend to \nbe much more stationary in the sense that they do not move nearly as \nfast as money or goods.\n  America, in particular, has been able, over a long period of time, to \ndevelop our own talent--the talents of our people--and to attract \ntalent from all over the world. But the only way we are going to \nmaintain that, to maintain our competitive edge, to be able to invest \nin strategies that will work, is to actually focus our attention on the \nskills and the education and the advancement of the American people. In \norder to do that, we have to give the American people the tools they \nneed to compete in a global economy.\n\n  We all know if we do that and we meet our obligations and keep our \npromises, we will ensure the global marketplace and trade are conducted \non a fair basis and that we don't put our workers at an unfair \ndisadvantage. But in order to do that, we have to invest. That is why, \nas the Presiding Officer knows from listening to our colleagues in the \nDemocratic caucus, and certainly by analyzing the budget that was put \ntogether by the Budget Committee, especially under the leadership of \nChairman Kent Conrad from North Dakota, what that budget has done, what \nthe proposal does is puts together a budget that makes sense, that \nmakes fiscal sense, that begins to reduce our deficit and brings us \ninto balance by 2012. In fact, it brings us beyond balance. It gives us \na $132 billion surplus.\n  Also, it realizes that right now we are in a hole because of how we \nhave been conducting fiscal business in this town for the last several \nyears. It realizes that when you are in a hole, as the old expression \ngoes, you should stop digging. It realizes people are our most valuable \nresource. This budget invests in them in so many ways. One good example \nof that, or two actually, is the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, the so-called SCHIP program, and the Presiding Officer knows \nin the State of New Jersey the benefit that program has had in his \nState and in the State of Pennsylvania and in so many others. We have \nto make sure we get that right, not only to maintain the coverage for \nthe millions of children already enrolled and their families and their \ncommunities and the economy as a whole benefit when they are enrolled, \nso we have to keep them covered, but we also have to meet the larger \nchallenge of insuring the 9 million other children who have no health \ninsurance at all and won't even begin to be covered under the \nPresident's budget. That is an important investment this budget \nproposal makes.\n  It also increases education funding at the same time by funding No \nChild Left Behind, making sure our families get help with higher \neducation and all the rest. This budget makes sure we are making the \nright decisions on Medicare and Medicaid. The Presiding Officer knows \nMedicaid increasingly and overwhelmingly is about making sure that \nolder citizens have the opportunity to get quality care in nursing \nhomes, and it is also ensuring we are covering poor children and poor \nfamilies.\n  This budget does all of this while also being fiscally responsible by \nreducing the size of the deficit and by beginning\n\n[[Page S3478]]\n\nto lower our debt to foreign governments, and making sure we are doing \nthis in the context of both reducing debt and deficit, but also making \nimportant investments. This budget focuses on the right priorities in \nan economic sense, but it also bears in mind that we have obligations. \nWe have promises to keep. This budget goes a long way toward making \nsure we are being fiscally responsible and keeping our promises.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to talk about \nsome of these economic issues, and I join my colleagues from Minnesota \nand Pennsylvania in a discussion of these items.\n  I note from the discussion of my colleague from Pennsylvania that he \nfocuses on human capital, which I absolutely agree with. I have a few \ncharts I will cover in a few minutes about an investment in human \ncapital I hope we can all agree on, and that is trying to encourage and \nrebuild the family structure in the country. This is something I have \nworked on across the aisle with my colleagues, particularly in the \nDistrict of Columbia when last year I was chairman of the DC \nAppropriations Subcommittee. We were deeply concerned about the lack of \nfamily formation in the District of Columbia, so it became the key area \nand the initial place to begin to develop human capital being within \nthe family structure.\n  We are finding in the District of Columbia and in many urban areas in \nparticular, and all across the country, but in the District of Columbia \nin total we had 63 percent of our children born out of wedlock. This \nputs a child in a situation where it is more difficult to develop human \ncapital. You can develop a child and a child can be raised well in that \nsetting, but it becomes much more difficult. I worked with the Mayor at \nthat time, Mayor Williams, and I worked with Delegate Eleanor Holmes \nNorton, and we put together a program called the Marriage Development \nAccount. If you were at 85 percent of poverty or below and got married, \nwe would put in a Federal dollar, raise two private sector dollars, and \nyou as a couple would put in a dollar. We would match this 3 to 1 to \nencourage the formation of married units--a family--around which to \nbuild a family.\n  This has broad bipartisan support, left and right support this, and I \nam hopeful we can look at ways in reforming welfare programs in \nparticular to encourage the formation of families as one of the key and \nvital steps for human capital development and growth. This is something \nwe ought to be able to agree on across the aisle. We have agreed \npreviously, and I hope we can do that now, because we have to develop \nhuman capital. We particularly have to do it now, and the best place to \nstart is the family and developing the human capital there. Clearly, \none of the best ways we can break the poverty cycle is forming more \nfamily units. That shows up in all of the data. It is broadly supported \nin a bipartisan fashion and it is something where we need to change the \nwelfare policies.\n  I wish to also look at this idea that tax policies since 2003 have \nbeen more beneficial to upper income households and less beneficial to \nlower income households in the United States. Here again, I have a \nseries of charts. I will first start with conditions under the Clinton \nadministration and look at impacts of Federal policies as far as a \nshare of the overall economy. This is an instructive chart when you \nlook at income, after-tax income, distribution data during the Clinton \nyears. Let's consider the distribution. The data for all of these \ncharts comes from CBO's December 2006 historical effective Federal tax \nrates. The data are from 1979 to 2004. First, it is interesting to look \nat what happened to after-tax income between 1992 and 2000. These would \nbe the Clinton administration years. The only group of households that \nsaw a share of the Nation's after-tax income increase was the top 20 \npercent. Their share during the 1992 to the 2000 time period--you see \nthese arrows all going down: the lowest 20 percent, the second lowest \n20 percent, middle, second highest, everyone is down, down, down; up is \nthe top 20 percent. Their share of after-tax income went up during the \nClinton administration years and their tax policy.\n  Now let's postulate the same question--because the charge is often \nmade that the tax cuts have only benefitted--the wealthy in this \ncountry. I have seen the charts repeatedly, and it is important to \ndiscuss what the data have shown. What happened for 2000 through 2004 \nis the opposite of what happened during the Clinton years as far as who \ngrew what share of after-tax income that happened during 1992 to 2004. \nIt went the opposite. The only group that didn't see a share of after-\ntax income increase was the top 20 percent. Everybody else saw their \nshare of the after-tax income grow: the lowest 20 percent, the second \nlowest 20 percent, middle, the second highest. The only people who went \ndown were the top 20 percent.\n  It is important to point out, when we have talked about these things \nin generic numbers and phrases--about only the upper income households \nhaving benefitted--but we ought to look at the actual data we have \navailable to us.\n  Again, I will go back to what happened in 1992 and remind people \nthese are the Clinton years. The lower income all saw their share of \nafter-tax income decrease; the upper income group saw theirs go up. In \n2000 to 2004, we saw a reversal of those arrows under these tax \npolicies that are being so castigated as being against lower income. \nThe share of after-tax income received by the top 1 percent of \nhouseholds grew 42 percent, from 10.9 percent in 1992 to a peak of 15.5 \npercent at the end of the Clinton years. Again, we are talking about \nthe Clinton years, the share of after-tax income, the top 1 percent of \nall households, up 42 percent during the Clinton era and the Clinton \nyears. That is what took place.\n  What happened from 2000 to 2004 is after-tax income received in the \ntop 1 percent of households actually declined. This declined at the end \nof the first Bush term. They do not support the assertion that there \nhas been a massive shift of income to the highest income households \nsince 2000. The data don't support it. The critics of the pro-growth \ntax policies enacted after 2000 assert that the highest income \nhouseholds have disproportionately benefitted. That simply is not \nsupported by the data.\n  Let's look at the top 10 percent of households paying their share of \nincome taxes. Since 1984, the top 10 percent of households have paid an \nincreasing majority of all Federal income taxes. In 2004, the final \nyear of data available in CBO's report, the share of Federal income \ntaxes paid by the top 10 percent of households reached a high of 70.8 \npercent--70.8 percent. So you can see it was continuing to grow.\n  It is worth noting that in 2004, the bottom 40 percent of households \npaid a negative share of Federal income taxes. I want to show that \nchart. That is, they received resources from the income tax system. In \nother words, they were paid by the income tax system--not paid into. \nThey received from the income tax system. Since 2000, the ``relative \nFederal income tax burden,'' or the share of all Federal income taxes \npaid compared to the group's share of all income, has declined for all \nincome groups except the top 20 percent--except the top 20 percent. So \nagain we have these tax lines going in a different direction.\n  Striking is the fact that the relative Federal income tax burden of \nthe top 1 percent of households declined for 1992 to 2000 during the \nClinton administration. So again we have this comparison of Clinton \npolicies to Bush policies. This is the relative Federal income tax \nburden of the top 1 percent of family households income. That declined, \nthe percentage, their share that they paid of the overall tax burden, \nand it went up in 2000 and 2004 in the Bush years. In 2004 it not only \nincreased but it was higher than in 1992 when President Clinton took \noffice.\n  The CBO's report also reveals that for the time period from 2000 to \n2004, the effective total Federal tax rate reduction has been the \nhighest on a percentage basis for the lowest income groups. In other \nwords, you have the most decline as far as the Federal tax rates for \nthe lowest income groups. I think that is as it should be. We shouldn't \nbe critical of the tax policy saying it is harming low income and \nbenefitting disproportionately high income when the data don't support \nthat.\n\n[[Page S3479]]\n\n  The same is true if you look at the income tax rate reductions. \nAgain, the lowest 40 percent of households have a negative effective \nincome tax rate and a negative income tax share. In other words, they \nwere paid back by the Federal income tax system.\n  Clearly the tax policies enacted since 2000 have benefitted all \nincome groups and have not resulted in a shift in income shares in \nfavor of high-income households or in tax burdens toward lower income \nhouseholds. Indeed, the data say the opposite. The top 10 percent of \nhouseholds are paying a bigger share of total Federal taxes and total \nFederal income taxes than in any prior time covered by the report.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' indulgence, but the falsehoods about tax \ncuts and a bigger share of the pie for the wealthy need to be \naddressed. I think it is important that we do address these.\n  I also note in yesterday morning's Wall Street Journal in discussing \nthis budget, it says the Senate Budget Committee chairman is pulling \noff a neat magic trick--and here I am quoting the Wall Street Journal:\n\n     . . . of claiming his budget includes ``no tax increase,'' \n     even as it anticipates repeal of the Bush tax cuts after \n     2010.\n\n  These are the same tax cuts I have been discussing, the tax cuts that \nhave helped stimulate growth, that have helped stimulate employment, \nthat have helped reduce the tax burden on the lower income people in \nthe United States.\n  The Wall Street Journal goes on to say:\n\n       How does he pull that rabbit out of his hat? By positing \n     what amounts to a giant asterisk where the tax increase is \n     supposed to go and hoping no one will notice.\n\n  In other words, the taxes go up after 2010, since the tax reductions \nput into place in the Bush tax cuts are not continued.\n  The article continues that the chairman has:\n\n     . . . no intention of extending the Bush tax cuts, which he \n     voted against and whose repeal would slap the economy in 2011 \n     with the largest tax increase in U.S. history. But Senate \n     Democrats don't want anyone to know this, at least not before \n     the 2008 election. . . . All of this is really sleight-of-\n     hand to disguise that Democrats are intent on repealing the \n     Bush tax cuts.\n\n  What would the impact of that be? People talk about it in generic \nterms, but let's unpack it a little bit. The Wall Street Journal \nreports that:\n\n       This would raise the tax on capital gains to 20 percent \n     from 15 percent, more than double the tax rate on dividends \n     to 39.6 percent from 15 percent, and sharply increase \n     marginal tax rates at all levels of income.\n\n  This will hurt growth, this will hurt investment, this will hurt job \ncreation, and this will hurt wages. This backdoor tax increase sends a \nbad signal to the economy. That bad news, if allowed to stand, will be \nbad news for the economy throughout for the working men and women of \nthis country. This isn't fiscal responsibility; it is bad tax policy \nthat hurts people.\n  This budget will only increase the burden on families. We need to \nstep back and be willing to get control of entitlement spending and \nacross-the-board spending. We need policies that encourage the \nformation of families, and support the preservation of traditional \nfamilies, as a way of developing human capital.\n  We need to help those who need a hand, but we are quickly reaching a \npoint where we are asking too few people to carry too much of a burden \non the tax rates. We are on the verge of killing incentive and \ninitiative.\n  We need to get serious about reforming a tax system that even the \nmost educated Americans cannot comprehend. We need to put in place an \nalternative flat tax and let people choose a tax system. This current \ntax system is unintelligible, burdensome, manipulative, and it needs to \nbe changed. We are in desperate need of a tax system that is simple, \nefficient, and globally competitive. We need to just have a fair \nsystem. Our tax system needs to treat everyone the same, not heap \ndizzying layers of regulation on top of regulation or carve out \nloopholes for the privileged who have the ability to hire lobbyists.\n  Despite the chairman's call for simplifying the Tax Code, there is \nnothing in his budget that promotes greater simplicity. Despite the \nchairman and his colleagues in the majority being fully aware of the \nneed for entitlement reform, they choose to totally ignore our looming \nfiscal problem. They choose, in this budget, to completely ignore the \nurgent need to address entitlement reform, especially as the first baby \nboomers begin retiring next year. This budget does not contain any \nproposals that, on net, would reduce mandatory spending or the debt. \nThe majority, evidently, wishes to simply wait for a fiscal train wreck \nto happen.\n  If we sit on our hands and let this budget and its ``magic act'' \nbudget enforcement provisions take effect, all we will do is impose the \nlargest tax increase in American history at the worst possible time--\nwhen the fiscal train wreck begins as the baby boomers enter their \ngolden years of retirement. That is not a budget; that is recipe for \ndisaster.\n  I look forward to further debate on this budget, and I really hope we \ncan start working together on it in a bipartisan fashion to address the \nclear problems we have. We can do that, and we need to do it. Now is \nthe time. The sooner we act, the more options we have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here to speak on behalf of the \nbudget resolution and to share some statistics about what has been \ngoing on in this country for middle-class families. I have to tell you \nthis before I show the statistics. Having met with people all over our \nState and having sat in living rooms and had meetings with people, they \ncould not really understand why their kids who just graduated from \ncollege could not buy a house, and they could not understand why they \nwere struggling to send their kids to college and why they were \nstruggling to go on vacations because of the high gas prices.\n  While having meetings with these people, lightbulbs would go on in \ntheir heads about these things. That is what is going on with a lot of \npeople in this country. That is what the statistics show. That is why \nit is so important to have a budget that gets these families and kids \non a strong fiscal track. At least this budget brings us back to the \npay-as-you-go rule. At a time when the wealthiest have been getting \nwealthier and wealthier, at least this budget says how can we help the \nmiddle class going forward.\n  Let's look at the statistics.\n  First, look at the productivity. Typically, real compensation for \nworkers--the wages and benefits--tends to track productivity growth. \nThat is what it did in the late 1990s. This hasn't really happened \nsince the 2001 recession. Our productivity growth, as you can see, has \nbeen strong, as the blue line on this chart represents, but \ncompensation growth has been relatively weak. That is the red line \nthere.\n  Recent gains in real compensation have not significantly narrowed the \ngap that has been opened. Workers have a long way to go to catch up \nwith the gaps they have missed out on so far in this recovery. So it is \nbecause of their work that we are seeing this productivity gain, but \nthey are not getting their piece of the pie. That is what we see in the \nincreasing gap every year.\n  We have to look at the next chart reflecting real earnings growth. \nThis looks complicated at first, but it makes sense when you look at \nwhat the lines represent. The bluish-purplish bars are for the kinds of \nreal earnings growth we saw in the late 1990s. If we focus on usual \nweekly earnings of full-time workers, we see only modest gains--and \nthat is the red here--in the distribution from 2000 to 2006. This \ncontrasts sharply with the gains you see in the late 1990s, which is \nthe blue part of the graph, when productivity first accelerated.\n  I note this marked difference between what you saw from 1996 to 2000 \nand from 2000 to 2006. This doesn't even include bonuses of highly paid \nexecutives or capital gains and other nonwage income earned at the very \ntop of the income distribution. This chart shows how real earnings \ngrowth has been weaker and more unequal than in the late 1990s. For me, \nwhen I think about those people in the living rooms in Brooklyn Park, \nMN, as they talk about how they could not afford health care, this is \nwhat it is about, because their real earnings growth has been much \nweaker and it has been harder for them to afford these important parts \nof\n\n[[Page S3480]]\n\ntheir expenditures, such as health care, gas, and those things. Those \nprices have gone up.\n  Now, at the same time we have this going on, we have this: CEO \ncompensation, right now, is 350 times average work pay. I think the \naverage person has to work an entire year to make up for what so many \nof our top CEOs make in the first day of the year. In 1980, the average \nCEO made about 50 times as much as the average worker. In 2004, that \nratio was nearly 350. The average CEO made 350 times the pay of the \naverage worker.\n  So you can see what has been going on with the share of wealth in \nthis country and why we have these people all over the country who are \nworking hard and who are the engine of the economy--the middle class--\nand it is harder and harder for them to keep up and to get by. That is \nwhat we are trying to do in this budget resolution--start the process \nof getting the country back on track so that we respect the people \ndoing the work, the middle class, the hard-working men and women of \nthis country.\n  The last thing I wish to share with you is about the distribution of \nwealth in this country. This is a similar way of looking at the CEO \ndistribution issue. In 2004, the wealthiest 1 percent of households had \nmore net worth than the bottom 90 percent of households. So here you \nhave the top 1 percent. This is their portion of the pie, 33 percent. \nHere is the bottom 90 percent, the middle class people; 9 out of 10 \npeople are here, and their wealth is actually less than this top 1 \npercent of the people in this country. Even when you go to the next 9 \npercent, which is about 36 percent of the wealth, when you include them \nuntil you have the top 10 percent, the wealthiest 10 percent of people \nin this country, they have more than two-thirds of the total wealth.\n  So statistics are important, but what really matters is the people in \nthis country. When you look at the statistics, you understand why, for \na student from the University of Minnesota, Jay Boler, it was hard to \nget by day after day and to afford college tuition when it had gone up \n110 percent at 4-year colleges in the last 2 years. He is not in that \ntop 1 percent. That is not where he is. You can understand why Jeanne \nO'Hearn, who owns a drycleaner in Robbinsdale, MN, is trying to get by \nwith few employees. It is hard to afford health care for her employees. \nYou can understand because she is not in that top 1 percent. You can \nunderstand why a mom in Mahnomen, MN, whose child had been called back \nto Iraq for the third time, cannot sleep at night and why she is upset \nbecause he is probably not going to get the benefits he needs when he \ngets back. She is not in that top 1 percent.\n  What this budget resolution does is at least acknowledge the fiscal \nissues of this country by putting back pay-as-you-go, because this \ninterest doesn't hurt the top 1 percent, but it hurts everybody else in \nthis country. It also says we are going to start helping the people who \nhave helped us; that is, the middle class.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment on the \nagricultural portion of the bill to provide payment limitations on \npayment to farmers. The American people recognize the importance of \nfamily farmers in our Nation and the need to provide an adequate safety \nnet for family farmers. That is what a farm program is all about.\n  In recent years, however, assistance to farmers has come under \nincreased scrutiny, and it should. Take a look at some of the headlines \nthat ran last year on the front page of the Washington Post. The first \nheadline reads:\n\n       Farm program pays $1.3 billion to people who don't farm.\n\n  That is going to make any taxpayer, rural or urban, mad because the \ngeneral assumption is that farm programs support family farmers and do \nnot go to people who don't farm.\n  A second headline reads:\n\n       Federal subsidies turn farms into big business.\n\n  In other words, the Federal taxpayers are paying to help big farmers \nget yet bigger.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       The shift in subsidies to wealthier farmers is helping to \n     fuel this consolidation of farmland. The largest farm's share \n     of agriculture production has climbed from 32 percent to 45 \n     percent, while the number of small- and medium-size farms has \n     tumbled from 42 percent to 27 percent.\n\n  These were just a couple of headlines from a series of articles from \nthe Washington Post on waste and abuse in farm program spending.\n  Critics of farm payments have argued that the largest corporate farms \nreap most of the benefits of these payments. What is more, farm \npayments that were originally designed to benefit small- and medium-\nsize family farms have contributed to their own demise. Unlimited farm \npayments have placed upward pressure on land prices and have \ncontributed to overproduction and lower commodity prices driving many \nfamily farmers off the farm.\n  The law creates a system that is out of balance. This is pointed out \nin the chart I have, which shows that we have a system where 10 percent \nof the farmers--10 percent of the farmers--maybe I should say just 10 \npercent of the farmers get 72 percent of the benefits, and the top 1 \npercent of the biggest farmers get almost 30 percent of the benefits. I \nbelieve we need to correct our course and modify the farm programs \nbefore those programs cause further concentration and consolidation in \nagriculture and lose the support of urban taxpayers because without \ntheir support, we could not have a farm safety net.\n  Today, most commodities are valued off demand. Markets dictate \nprofitability. When farmers overproduce by planning for, according to \nthe farm program, whether its a loan or the LDP Program or whatever it \nmight be, then markets are not functioning.\n  I mentioned earlier that the Federal farm programs are influencing \nland prices across the country. Iowa land is now selling for between \n$4,000 and $6,000 an acre in counties near my home of New Hartford, IA.\n  When I was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, before the last \nelection, I was also a member of the Budget Committee and the \nAgriculture Committee. I have used those committee positions as \nopportunities to file amendments that I believe will help revitalize \nthe farm economy for young people across this country.\n  My amendment today will put a hard cap on farm payments at $250,000. \nThe average taxpayer listening to me might say: What planet did you \ncome from--$250,000 is an awful lot of support. But I am saying in \ncomparison to limits that are now in the bill of $360,000 and legal \nsubterfuge to get around the law to allow some farmers to get millions \nof dollars. So this is a $250,000 hard cap--still too high for some \nfamily farmers but a compromise that has gotten through this body in \nthe past and I am counting on getting through this time.\n  No less important, this will close those legal subterfuges or \nloopholes--whatever you want to call them--that have allowed large \noperations to evade even the $360,000 limit and, as a result, receive \nbenefits many times larger.\n  To remind everybody, I voted against the conference report of the \npresent farm bill in the year 2002, and this was one of my many \nreasons, because it did not have this hard cap in there, even though it \npassed the Senate. I have been fighting to reduce large-scale subsidies \nfor over 30 years. If one looks at the Congressional Record in the \n1970s, it will show I was leading in that area. More recently, I worked \nwith the good Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, on a similar \nmeasure in the 2002 farm bill, and it passed with bipartisan support of \n66 to 31. That amendment, as I said, was taken out in conference. So I \nurge my colleagues to check their past votes on this issue during the \nlast farm bill debate.\n\n  One section that was added in the farm bill was section 1605, which \nset up a Commission on the Application of Payment Limitations for \nAgriculture. The purpose of the Commission, after the failure of our \nlegislation in 2002 in the farm bill because it didn't come out\n\n[[Page S3481]]\n\nof conference, was to set up this Commission. The purpose of the \nCommission was to study this issue. The Commission also said that the \n2007 farm bill is the time for these reforms to be made as part of the \nchange to permanent law. So that is why it is legitimate to have it as \npart of this budget debate.\n  Congress enacted the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1987, called \nthe Farm Program Integrity Act, to establish eligibility conditions for \nrecipients and to ensure that only entities engaged actively in \nagriculture receive farm payments. To be considered actively engaged in \nfarming, that act required an individual or entity to provide a \nsignificant contribution of inputs--capital, land, equipment--as well \nas significant contributions of services of personal labor or active \nmanagement to the farming operation. But people have been able to find \nloopholes around this act, facilitating huge payments that our hard cap \nis meant to overcome.\n  I held a hearing through the Finance Committee on a Government \nAccountability Office report that was released about 3 years ago, April \n24, 2004. The GAO report recommended that measurable standards and \nclarified regulations would better assure that people who receive \npayments are, in fact, engaged in farming.\n  Of the $17 billion in payments the USDA distributed to recipients in \n2001, $5.9 billion went to just 149,000 entities. Corporations and \ngeneral partnerships represented 39 and 26 percent of these entities \nrespectively.\n  Here is an example from the March 2005 Washington Post article of \nsomeone who qualified for payments. I quote from the newspaper:\n\n       If the purpose of farm subsidies is to make family farms \n     viable, it's hard to see why payments of more than $400,000 a \n     piece should have gone to 54 deceased farmers between 1995 \n     and 2003, or why residents in Chicago should have collected \n     $24 million in farm support over that period.\n\n  This type of arrangement, and others such as that, raises questions \nabout the interpretation and enforcement of the 1987 act's requirements \nthat each partner be actively engaged in farming. This is why I wrote \nthe Government Accountability Office to conduct that study I referred \nto on which we held a hearing in the Finance Committee. I encourage \nMembers of this body to take a look at that report as well.\n  During past markups of the Senate Budget Committee, I was able, with \nthe help of the current chairman, Mr. Conrad, to include a sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment expressing support for stronger farm payment \nlimits. The proposed amendment would cap Farm Commodity Program \npayments at $250,000 a year per person during any one year. This would \nencompass direct payments, countercyclical payments, loan deficiency \npayments, and marketing loan gains. Gains from commodity certificates \nwill be counted toward limitations, closing another very abusive \nloophole, particularly those farming in cotton and rice.\n  By adopting this amendment, it could save the taxpayers over $500 \nmillion in savings over a 5-year period of time and more than $1 \nbillion over 10 years. With these savings, the amendment that is being \npresented by Senator Grassley and Senator Dorgan would put money toward \nconservation, nutrition, research, value-added agriculture, and \nrenewable energy programs.\n  The budget resolution before us provides a very much needed reserve \nfund for the farm bill of $15 billion. Every penny of this fund will be \nneeded if we are to adequately respond to the major needs and \nopportunities to increase energy independence, restore cuts in \nconservation, improve farm income through value-added grants, reduce \nhunger, and invest in the future of food and agriculture through \ncutting-edge research.\n  However, the reserve fund is conditioned on offsets. The amendment I \nam offering is part of the solution to this reserve fund dilemma. A \nvote for this amendment, then, will help us get a better farm bill \ndone, not just to help farmers but to help the entire society as it \nincludes so much that benefits people just beyond agriculture.\n  Not only has the Senate previously agreed to payment limit reform, \nbut the President, in his past budgets--I think at least the last 3 \nyears--has supported a broad set of savings proposals recommending \nreduction in subsidies for larger, more financially secure farmers and \npromoting more efficient production decisions, although this year the \nadministration proposed that no one should get farm payments if they \nhave an adjusted gross income of over $200,000 a year. That is just \nanother way, and not a bad way, but another way of getting what I am \ntrying to get through this hard cap. So I don't find fault in what the \nadministration is proposing in that area. I think the administration is \nproposing a very good bite and another bite at the apple.\n  I have been hearing directly from producers for years exactly what \nthe Secretary of Agriculture heard at his farm bill forums. We are \nhearing that young producers are unable to carry on the tradition of \nfarming because they are financially unable to do so because of high \nland values and cash rents.\n  Neil Harl, a distinguished agricultural economist at Iowa State \nUniversity and one of the contributors to the Payment Limitation \nCommission, wrote this:\n\n       The evidence is convincing that a significant portion of \n     the subsidies is being bid into cash rents--\n\n  Making the cash rents higher--\n\n     and capitalized into land values.\n\n  All making it very difficult for new, young farmers to get started in \nfarming. If investors were to expect less Federal funding or none at \nall, land values would likely decline, perhaps by 25 percent.\n  On March 20, 2005, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution printed this:\n\n       As time has gone by, smaller farmers most in need have \n     received less and less of the government's support and \n     corporate-like farms more and more.\n\n  By voting in favor of this amendment, we can restore the cuts that \nwere made to conservation, rural and renewable energy programs during \nthe markup of the Ag section of reconciliation. We can allow young \npeople to get into farming and lessen the dependence on Federal \nsubsidies. This will help restore public respectability for Federal \nfarm assistance by targeting this assistance to those who need it, \nwhere it has traditionally been over the 70 years of the farm program.\n  Before I close, I wish to remind everyone who voted against a similar \namendment during the 2005 reconciliation vote, the argument that we \nneed to wait until the farm bill debate is not going to work anymore--\nthat was the argument some people who changed their vote used at that \nparticular time--because this is the year of farm bill debate. This is \nthe budget that contains the baseline for the farm bill that we are \ngoing to pass this year.\n  Let's stop kicking the can down the road and say we have to wait \nuntil the farm bill debate. The here and now is the here and now. How \ncan you say you are for conservation or you are for renewable energy or \nyou are for child nutrition--that you are for all those things and then \ncome to the floor and vote the opposite way? This is an opportunity to \nshow to the people of this country we are not going to subsidize the \nbiggest farmers getting bigger, wasting taxpayers' money, keeping young \npeople off the farms and out of the farming profession and bringing \nill-repute to a farm program that it takes city folk, represented in \nthe Congress, to vote for in order to sustain the safety net for \nfarmers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is the Senator from Iowa \nhas this half hour. I ask the Senator from Iowa if he will yield me 10 \nminutes?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will yield 10 minutes, yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am pleased to be a cosponsor, as I have been in the \npast. The Senator from Iowa is offering a budget amendment. It is a \ngood amendment. The Senator from Iowa will join me in introducing some \nlegislation on this subject following this discussion. Some will say: \nLet's have this during the farm bill. We will have this debate then, \ntoo, I assume.\n  Let me say, I don't think there is a bigger supporter or stronger \nsupporter in this Chamber for family farmers than I am. I know my \ncolleague from Iowa is a family farmer. It goes without saying he has \nbeen supportive. But I am not interested in supporting the corporate \nagrifactories that have grown up this country. That is not the purpose \nof a farm program.\n\n[[Page S3482]]\n\n  I come from a rural State. I am proud to stand here and support \nfarmers who have names, in my State: Olsen, Larson, Christianson, \nJohnson, Schmidt, Schmaltz, Cooper. I am proud to support them. They \nare out there living under a yard light, struggling, trying to make a \nliving. They plant a seed and hope it will grow. If it grows, they hope \nit doesn't hail. They hope it rains enough and it doesn't rain too \nmuch. Finally, when they get in and get the seed off and the crop off \nand after that seed has grown into a plant, they put it through a \ncombine, take it to the elevator, and then they hope and pray there is \na decent price, so in the end, if everything went right, maybe they \nmade a living for themselves and their families. It is a big struggle \nfor them.\n  What is the value of having these families living out there? A friend \nof mine from North Dakota wrote a piece about that. He said: What is it \nworth? What is it worth for a kid to know how to fix a tractor, to plow \na field, to hang a door, to butcher a hog, to pour cement, to weld a \nseam? What is it worth for a kid to know all those things? That \nuniversity is on a family farm; that is where kids learn it. What is \nthat worth to our country?\n  We have on the floor of the Senate this issue of a farm program. A \nfarm program is a safety net, a bridge over troubled times when prices \ncollapse, when the crops are destroyed. This is a bridge over price \nvalleys, a bridge over difficult times. Regrettably, it has grown to \nbecome a set of golden arches for some of the biggest enterprises in \nthe country, and we propose that we put some payment limits on here \nthat are reasonable payment limits. I am pleased to be a cosponsor \nalong with my colleague, Senator Grassley. I think this is common \nsense.\n  Let me give some examples of what persuades us to come to the floor \nof the Senate. Ten years ago, the top 10 percent of recipients of farm \nprogram payments received just over half of all farm payments. Now, 10 \nto 11 years later, the top 10 percent get 72 percent. It has grown from \nabout half to about three-quarters for the top 10 percent. The top 1 \npercent receive nearly a quarter of all farm payments.\n  Mr. President, a 61,000-acre operation in a southern State got $38 \nmillion in farm payment programs over 5 years. I didn't come to fight \nfor that. I don't support that. The farm was organized into 66 separate \ncorporations so its 39 owners could avoid payment limits. That is not \nfarming the land. That is farming the farm program. I don't support \nthat.\n  A 12,000-acre cotton farm took in $2.1 million, a cotton factory in \nCalifornia, $16 million over 8 years. This is not the farm program we \nought to be supporting.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture pointed out that they paid \n$400,000 each to 55 farmers who were dead; 27 of the dead farmers \nreceived payments every year for 9 years--$400,000 each for dead \npeople. That is unbelievable.\n  I support a farm program, one I can be proud of, one that says to \nfamilies living out there: We want to help you. We know you take \nunbelievable risks, and when you run into trouble, into tough times, we \nwant to reach out our hand to say we are with you, we want to help you. \nThat is what the farm program is supposed to be about. But it is \nbecoming a perverse program when millions of dollars are taken from \ntaxpayers in the form of taxes and then transferred to big corporate \nagrifactories who get millions of dollars.\n  From the Government Accountability Office: Eleven partners ran an \n11,900-acre farm and collected a million dollars, and every single one \nof the farmers lived outside the State where the farm was located. The \nonly engagement they had in the farm was a telephone conversation.\n  Six partners received $700,000 in farm payments for a 6,400-acre \nfarm. They said they provided daily management, living several hundred \nmiles away.\n  I don't think we need to say more. It does not take much more to \nillustrate the absurdity of what is happening. My colleague and I are \noffering--get this--a proposal that limits program payments to \n$250,000. Let me say again, I come from farm country. No one here cares \nmore about family farmers than I do. I believe in the farm program. I \nfought for a good farm program. But I have not fought for a program \nthat hands over millions of dollars to people who reorganize into farm \nfactories in order to farm the farm program and suck money out of what \nwe put aside to help people during tough times.\n\n  It is beyond me why we would not take this step quickly and easily, \nto say payment limitations that would be effective are the right thing \nfor us to do. This should not be controversial at all. This ought to be \naccepted by unanimous consent. That is what ought to happen. We ought \nto have a unanimous consent request.\n  I will say this. If there are those who argue that multimillion \ndollar operations need millions of dollars from the American taxpayer \nto continue their operations, then there is something horribly wrong \nwith the farm program that accedes to that request. That is not why we \ncreated a farm program in this country. We said we want America's \nlandscape to be dotted by yard lights that represent a farm. I \nunderstand that big corporate agrifactories could farm from California \nto Maine. I understand we have operations that milk 3,000 to 4,000 cows \na day, three times a day. That has nothing to do with family farming. I \nunderstand you could farm from the west coast to the east coast and you \nwould not have to have people living out there.\n  But I also understand that there is value to this country, cultural \nvalue to this country, where the seedbed of family values began, on the \nfarm and in small towns, and rose to our big cities as a set of family \nvalues that this country has always appreciated.\n  That is the cultural value of having family farms. It is the economic \nvalue of having family farms. The way we will keep family farms is to \nhave a decent farm program that says, when you are in trouble, when you \nhave prices collapse, you have a safety net. That is what we are trying \nto do. We will try to save it. What will happen is we will lose the \nfarm program one day with stories that say this program gives millions \nof dollars to people with millions of acres who do not need this help.\n  I am pleased be a cosponsor with my colleague, and I look forward to \nworking with him on these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his support, \nnot only this year but over the long period of time we have been \nfighting this battle.\n  I send this amendment to the desk, and I would then like to make a \nunanimous consent request and also a request of some abeyance by my \ncolleagues--if I could have permission in the 5 minutes I have left--\nto, first of all, set the amendment I sent up to the side and then to \ncall up another.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 464\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent to set that amendment aside for \nthe consideration of an amendment dealing with the Smithsonian.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 502.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure the appropriate use of funds provided for the \n            Smithsonian Institution, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 41, line 9, decrease the amount by $17,000,000.\n       On page 41, line 10, decrease the amount by $15,000,000.\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. ADJUSTMENT FOR SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION SALARIES AND \n                   EXPENSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Chairman of the Senate Committee on \n     the Budget may revise the allocations, aggregates, and \n     discretionary spending limits for one or more bills, joint \n     resolutions, motions, amendments, or conference reports that \n     make discretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2008 for an \n     amount appropriated, but not to exceed $17,000,000 in \n     budgetary authority and outlays flowing therefrom, once the \n     Comptroller General of the United States has submitted a \n     certification to Congress that since April 1, 2007--\n       (1) the Smithsonian Institution does not provide total \n     annual compensation for any officer or employee of the \n     Smithsonian Institution greater than the total annual \n     compensation of the President of the United States;\n       (2) the Smithsonian Institution does not provide deferred \n     compensation for any such officer or employee greater than \n     the deferred compensation of the President of the United \n     States;\n       (3) all Smithsonian Institution travel expenditures conform \n     with Federal Government guidelines and limitations applicable \n     to the Smithsonian Institution; and,\n       (4) all Smithsonian Institution officers and employees are \n     subject to ethics rules similar to the ethics rules widely \n     applicable to Federal Government employees.\n       (b) Criteria for Certification.--In making the \n     certification described in subsection (a), the Comptroller \n     General of the United States should take into account the \n     following:\n       (1) The Smithsonian Institution is a premier educational, \n     historical, artistic, research, and cultural organization for \n     the American people.\n       (2) The Inspector General for the Smithsonian Institution \n     recently issued a report regarding an investigation of \n     unauthorized and excessive authorized compensation, benefits, \n     and expenditures by the Secretary of the Smithsonian \n     Institution.\n       (3) The Inspector General's findings indicate that the \n     actions of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution are \n     not in keeping with the public trust of the office of the \n     Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.\n       (4) Priority should be given to funding for necessary \n     repairs to maintain and repair Smithsonian Institution \n     buildings and infrastructure and protect America's treasures.\n       (5) Priority should be given to full funding for the Office \n     of the Inspector General for the Smithsonian Institution so \n     that the American people and Congress have renewed confidence \n     that tax-preferred donations and Federal funds are being \n     spent appropriately and in keeping with the best practices of \n     the charitable sector.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment, as I said, focuses on \nthe Federal Government's support for the Smithsonian Institution. The \nAmerican people, I believe, have been shocked and outraged to read in \nnewspapers and see on their TVs a story about the out-of-control \nspending at the Smithsonian by the Secretary of the Institution: First-\nclass air travel for the Secretary and his wife, a palace for an \noffice, and hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on the Secretary's \nown home for things such as chandelier cleaning and pool heaters are \nimpossible to justify. As my colleagues know, the Federal Government \nprovides over 70 percent of the Smithsonian's approximately $1 billion \nbudget. Most of the rest of the budget comes from tax-preferred \ncharitable donations. Directly or indirectly, the Federal taxpayers pay \nfor almost everything in the Smithsonian.\n  My amendment is very straightforward. The budget resolution provides \nfor a $17 million increase for the Smithsonian. I commend the chairman \nof the Budget Committee for increasing the spending for the \nInstitution, and I support that action. As a report issued today from \nthe Smithsonian Arts External Review Committee made clear, there are \nvery significant problems at the Smithsonian in terms of maintaining \nand protecting the Smithsonian infrastructure and exhibits. The \nSmithsonian is the keeper of America's treasures, and we want a museum \nwe can all be proud of. So I support the additional $17 million.\n  But similar to many Americans, my reaction to the Secretary's \nspending is I want to make sure we are not having new money used to \norder another round of champagne. My amendment basically fences the $17 \nmillion increase but allows the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto revise the allocations--effectively to release the $17 million in \nnew spending--once and only after the General Accounting Office has \ncertified the following:\n  No. 1, that no one at the Smithsonian is getting paid more than the \nPresident of the United States, as was proposed by the House \nAppropriations Committee last year; no more paying for French doors at \nthe Secretary's home, in other words. There are many fine museums and \ncharities that receive the same amount of charitable donations as the \nSmithsonian that are able to hire very able directors for what we pay \nthe President of the United States.\n  No. 2, the Smithsonian must follow the travel expenditure guidelines \nof the Federal Government. No more first-class flights with wife and \nSecretary to Hawaii to enjoy Thanksgiving.\n  No. 3, the Smithsonian must have ethics rules similar to the ethics \nrules of Federal Government employees. No more sitting on corporate \nboards, making big, big money--corporations that have contractual \nrelations with the Smithsonian and possible conflicts of interest.\n  The amendment also makes clear that the actions of the Secretary are \nnot in keeping with the public trust of the office.\n  Finally, the amendment states that a priority should be given to \nfunding for repairing and maintaining the Smithsonian and to fully fund \nthe Office of Inspector General at the Smithsonian so the American \npeople and the Congress can have renewed confidence that the $700 \nmillion-plus in Federal funds the Smithsonian has is used properly and \nappropriately.\n  I am still working with the chairman and with Senator Gregg to make \ncertain this amendment is drafted in a manner that meets their \nconcerns. I am confident we can do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, very briefly--because I know Senator \nLincoln is waiting and we will be giving her 15 minutes and giving \nSenator Chambliss 10 minutes to respond to this--on the most recent \namendment, I would say to Senator Grassley, do you need a rollcall vote \nor is this something we can take on a voice vote?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We do not need a rollcall vote.\n\n[[Page S3484]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We do not need a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That would be enormously helpful. If we could spend a \nlittle time working together so we make sure we get this drafted so \nthis works with the larger resolution, I think it is something we can \ntake on a voice vote. But let's make sure we have it drafted in a way \nall of us intend.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am sure we will be able to work that out.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Iowa very much.\n  Now we are back to the question of payment limits. I yield 15 minutes \nto the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the chairman for his tireless work. He and his \nstaff are remarkable in the way they go at this budget. They do a \ntremendous job of trying to balance so many different items of interest \nto this diverse body, and certainly to the priorities of the American \npeople. I compliment him on the hard work he has put into this effort.\n  I know the Senator from Iowa knows the great respect I have for him. \nHe and I have worked together on the Finance Committee on multiple \nthings. Unfortunately we come today with a large disagreement. I rise \ntoday in strong opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from \nIowa regarding further payment restrictions, because we did deal with \nthis issue in the 2002 farm bill.\n  We came to a compromise, and a compromise is just that: It is where \ntwo sides come together and figure out something that is reasonable for \neverybody. But this amendment goes farther on payment restrictions on \nthe farm safety net offered by Senator Grassley and Senator Dorgan. \nThis issue of payment limitations is not a new topic of debate. Yet, \nunfortunately, it will no doubt be a topic of much debate as we work to \ncraft a new farm bill this year. I have been here in the Congress \nduring two debates, two farm bills. We have produced two farm bills, \nand I have been a part of that.\n  I realize that is an important avenue and the place where this debate \nshould be taken. In my view, it is within the context of our farm bill, \nnot the context of this budget debate, that this issue should be \ndebated. We do not need to be here talking within the context of the \nbudget about policy decisions that should be debated and decided in the \nfarm bill through the Agriculture Committee.\n  This issue remains largely misunderstood for many both inside and \noutside the beltway. While I wish this were not the case, I gladly take \nthis opportunity to provide some clarity to this issue, hopefully some \npassion as well, because as a farmer's daughter I take a tremendous \namount of pride in telling others about the farmers whom I represent \nand what American farmers provide this Nation and this world.\n  Just as Senator Dorgan talked about the solidness of the names of his \nfarmers, guess what. The names of my farmers are not any less American \nor any less solid. I have got to say, I am as proud of those farmers in \nmy State who plant seed in the ground and help to provide food and \nfiber for this world and for our country as he is. It does not \nnecessarily mean how wholesome your name might be whether you are a \ngood American farmer.\n  They talk about 10 percent of our farmers get roughly 72 percent in \nterms of these payments. Well, I will also let you know the other side \nof that coin, and that is 10 percent of our producers out there \nrepresent 90 percent of what is produced in this country.\n  Yes, we have some large farmers. We have farmers who are hardcore and \ndiligent and as red-blooded and as American as some of the smaller \nfarmers are. Yes, they do produce a tremendous amount, 90 percent of \nthe food and fiber we have in this country. It is critically important \nto remember that. It is not size that is important. The dollars, these \ndollars we talk about, do not go into their pockets, these dollars go \nto the banker, the local seed dealers and the implement dealers to pay \noff the notes it takes to farm, particularly in southern parts of this \ncountry because of the capital-intensive crops we grow.\n  Senator Dorgan brings up dead individuals who get payments. I would \npropose that that is illegal. That is not a problem this issue takes \ncare of. That is a problem for USDA, and it is one that should be taken \ncare of. But it misrepresents what the debate here today is all about. \nThat is what I want to bring people back to.\n  Above all else, our farm policy seeks to do one thing for all of our \nfarmers, whether you are in one region of the country or another. It \nseeks to provide for those producers of commodities a strong level of \nsupport, a safety net, not a hammock but a safety net, to protect these \nproducers against low prices brought on by factors that are completely \nbeyond their control, including but not limited to foreign tariffs and \nsubsidies some five or six times greater than the help that is provided \nto farmers across this globe and what we provide our growers. Yet they \nstill provide us with the safest, most abundant, and affordable food \nsupply in the world.\n  One of the fatal flaws of the 1996 bill, which was called Freedom to \nFarm, was its lack of an adequate safety net in the face of foreign \nsubsidies and tariffs that dwarf our support of U.S. producers.\n  I know Senator Grassley and Senator Dorgan and many of my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle recognize the challenges our U.S. producers \nand industries face in an uncertain and often, quite frankly, unfair \nglobal marketplace. I am proud to say the 2002 farm bill corrected that \nmistake. It was a hard-fought compromise, as I mentioned. We came to \nthe table and we agreed each other had points to be made, and we came \nup with something that was in the middle of the road, and would at \nleast be acceptable by both.\n\n  The amendment now before us would seek to further limit that very \nsupport at a time the producers need help the most, creating a gaping \nhole in the safety net for farmers. Furthermore, during hearings and \nlistening sessions on the proposals for a new farm bill, most farm \norganizations support the compromises agreed to in the 2002 bill, and \nthey recognize that future arbitrary limits on farm payments only serve \nto diminish our producers' ability to compete globally.\n  Proponents of tighter limits continue to sensationalize this issue by \nciting misleading articles about large farm operations receiving very \nlarge payments as a reason to target support to smaller farmers. \nBecause my farmers are larger does not mean they are not family farmers \nor they are not young farmers; it means they are doing what they have \nto do to compete.\n  Unfortunately, sensationalized stories only serve to cloud this \nmisunderstood issue further. Senators need to understand this amendment \nhas very serious implications. Let me attempt to provide a bit of \nclarity on this issue of farm size.\n  First, payment limitations have disproportionate effects on different \nregions of this country; there is no doubt about it. Simply put, the \nsize of farm operations is relative to your region. Put even more \nsimply, a small farm in Arkansas may be a huge farm in another area of \nthe country, which leads me to my next point. This amendment continues \nto unfairly discriminate on a regional basis because it does not \ndifferentiate between crops that are extremely cost intensive and those \nthat are not cost intensive. In Arkansas, we raise rice and cotton, two \nof our largest commodities, and we do so because that is what we are \nsuited to grow; that is what any farmer would grow. These crops happen \nto be the most expensive crops to produce in the entire country.\n  This amendment would lump cotton and rice into the same category with \ncrops that require half as much of an input in terms of cost.\n  Finally, on the issue of size, farmers of commodities are not getting \nlarger to receive more payments. They do not want to have to become \nlarger farmers; it creates more of a challenge and certainly more \nobstacles for them. They get larger in an attempt to create an economy \nof scale, to remain competitive internationally. You can see it in \nbusiness. How do they offer lower prices to their consumers? They \ncreate an economy of scale that allows them to be able to do that. That \nis exactly what our farmers are doing in the southern growing areas of \nthe country. At a time when we were telling our\n\n[[Page S3485]]\n\nfarmers to compete on the global market, we now hear of in this budget \ndebate an amendment that would discourage farmers from acquiring the \nvery economies of scale they will need to compete in that global \nmarketplace.\n  If you limit the amount of support farmers may receive, you are \nplacing on them a substantial domestic disadvantage before sending them \nout to compete in an international marketplace that is already unfair \nfor our producers. This is not the case in Europe and other foreign \nmarkets where agricultural subsidies and tariffs are at a level far \nhigher than we see in the United States.\n  Finally, I say to those who feel farmers are getting rich at the \nexpense of the taxpayer, there is a reason why our sons and daughters \nare not rushing back to the farm and their family's heritage. It is \nbecause farming is a very tough business with a lot of challenges. \nSenator Dorgan mentioned the challenges his farmers face. My farmers \nface similar challenges, if not greater challenges, in terms of \ndemographics and climate, in terms of pests and all of the many \nproblems they face, as well as the international marketplace, trade \nbarriers, and a multitude of other things.\n  Farms that have been in families for generations are being sold \nbecause farm income is insufficient to meet the rising input cost \nassociated with raising a crop, particularly in our area. I have to \ntell you, I have a wonderful farm family farming 5,000 to 6,000 acres, \nwhich in some places would seem to be a very large farm. It is a farmer \nwith two sons who farm the land of three widow women who live down the \nlane from him, and several, yes, inheritants of farm land who want to \nkeep their farm in their family, perhaps for their children who do not \nlive there any longer.\n  Do they not have the right to maintain their farms to ensure that if \nthere is a farmer there who can increase his amount of land enough \nthrough rental property and others, to be able to keep that land in \nproduction, to keep his family farm alive and theirs as well? He \nreaches to that economy of scale because it is the only way he can \nsurvive, he and his two children.\n  I urge my colleagues to take this opportunity to send a strong \nmessage to all of our farmers, not one region of the country or \nanother, one that tells them their Government will stand behind them \nand their rural communities they support.\n\n  I have to say, we are coming dangerously close to a trade deficit in \nagriculture. Do we want to see that happen? You know, it is unfortunate \nthe American people have become very accustomed to almost taking for \ngranted the fact we not only produce an abundant food supply but that \nwe produce a safe and affordable one, the lowest per capita of any \nother developed nation in what we pay for food for our families, not to \nmention our growers grow our crops in regard to all of the regulations, \nwhether it is the regulation of their chemical application and the \ntests they have to take, whether it is making sure they are meeting the \nguidelines of keeping wetlands conservation areas, making sure they are \nnot stripping the land or not using the land properly, but they are \ndoing it in the best sense of what it means to everybody involved to be \ngood conservationists.\n  We do that, and we do that at a small cost, a small cost, which is a \nsafety net program that is less than one-half of 1 percent of the \noverall budget, the agriculture budget. What an investment for our \nchildren to know they will be able to maintain not a trade deficit in \nagriculture but maintain domestic production of crops, food, and fiber \nthat they know are going to be healthy and that are going to be grown \nwith the kind of regulations that produce a crop that is safe, not an \nimported crop that is being grown with chemical applications that we \nbanned 10 years ago, or practices that are less than phytosanitary \nconditions. We want to make sure--and this is the way we do it--to \nprovide the safety net for all farmers in a way that they can maintain \nthe economy of scale. They have to in order to be able to be \ncompetitive.\n  I have to say, if we do not stand behind the farmers of this country, \nthe producers--all of them--and assure them their Government will \nsupport the production of food and fiber in this country, recognizing \nthe regional differences and the challenges our producers face in the \nglobal marketplace, making sure that for them we will appreciate the \nsafe and abundant food and fiber supply they provide, we will have made \na sorry mistake.\n  We have to make sure that we assure them that we are not going to \noutsource our food production but, rather, that we are committed to \nensuring that production stays here where it belongs. I urge my \ncolleagues to think sensibly about this amendment, to vote against this \namendment, and not to unfairly disadvantage farmers in one region of \nthe country, in my State and elsewhere. Furthermore, the budget \nresolution is not the appropriate venue for this debate.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose the Grassley-Dorgan amendment. Let's \ndeal with this in the farm bill, the appropriate place. Let's come \ntogether. If there needs to be a compromise, we will come to a \ncompromise as we did last time. We worked hard. We got a good one. I do \nnot think this amendment is necessary.\n  I thank my colleagues for their time and attention. I hope they will \nthoughtfully review what we have presented today and not support the \nGrassley-Dorgan amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I think I have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Arkansas \nfor a forceful, correct, and direct argument on this issue. Here we go \nagain. This is the annual debate we have over whether the farm bill \nshould be rewritten during budget resolution, which is what was tried \nlast time, when the appropriate place to write the farm bill is during \ndebate on the farm bill. That is going to take place later this year. \nOnce this budget is completed, we will have the numbers to move ahead \nin deciding what the new 5-year farm bill will be like. We are in the \nsixth year of the current farm bill that was written in 2002. Yet here \nwe are, in the last year of the farm bill, debating a major provision \nof that legislation.\n  Frankly, if one goes to farmers all across America--and I say this \nbecause I have done it. Senator Grassley, who is my dear friend, has \nnot. I held eight field hearings all across America last summer as \nchairman of the Senate Ag Committee in which we asked farmers: What do \nyou think about the 2002 farm bill? We even got specific and talked \nabout payment limits: What do you think about the payment limit \nprovision?\n  There is a general, overwhelming consensus all across America that \nthe 2002 farm bill is working exactly the way farmers and ranchers \nwanted it to work; that is, it has been a very market-oriented farm \nbill. In years when prices have been low, there have been Government \npayments to farmers. In years when prices have been high, there have \nbeen a minimal number of payments going to farmers.\n  As a result of that farm bill being very market oriented, we have \nsaved $17 billion over the projected amount of the expenditure in the \nfarm bill from 2002. Nobody is talking about that. Nobody is talking \nabout the fact that our farmers have been very efficient. They have \ndone whatever is necessary to go back and rework their operations to \nmake sure they maximize efficiency. As a result, they have saved that \n$17 billion.\n  What Senator Grassley has done today is to stand up and say: If you \nmake this change, and we limit these big payments to farmers, we are \ngoing to save $486 million. The fact is, he is not going to save one \ndime because what he does is, he takes that $486 million and spends it \nelsewhere. So we are saving not one dime with the passage of this \namendment.\n  What does this amendment do? It takes the 2002 farm bill and \ninterrupts it during the last year of the farm bill so that farmers and \nranchers across America, and the bankers who have financed those \nfarmers and ranchers, now are going to be in a state of flux as to \nwhether what we decided in 2002 was going to be proposed for our \nfarmers and ranchers for a 6-year period of time will, in fact, be \nlived up to by the U.S.\n\n[[Page S3486]]\n\nCongress. The appropriate time and place to debate any payment limit \nproposal is during reauthorization. That is going to be coming up \nshortly.\n  The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 authorized a \ncommission on payment limitations for agriculture. That commission has \nalready been referred to by Senator Grassley. The purpose of this \ncommission was to conduct a study on the potential impact of further \npayment limitations on direct payments, countercyclical payments, as \nwell as the marketing assistance loan benefits on farm income, land \nvalues, rural communities, agribusiness infrastructure, planting \ndecisions of producers affected, and supply and prices of covered and \nother agricultural commodities. In other words, this commission was to \nlook at all aspects of farming and decide what would be the effect of \nchanging payment limits on agriculture in general.\n  The first recommendation of the commission stated:\n\n       Any substantial changes should take place with \n     reauthorization of the next farm bill.\n\n  No other aspect of Federal farm policy has been studied as \nextensively as payment limitations. The top recommendation of those who \nstudied this issue was not to make any change. I admit I come from a \nState where we would be negatively impacted by tighter payment limits.\n  I want to take note of the commission members. This was a balanced \npanel from all across the Nation. The commission consisted of 10 \nmembers. They were from Kansas, Texas, Mississippi, Illinois, North \nDakota, Iowa, Georgia, Arizona, and USDA. They agreed to recommend that \nno substantial changes in payment limits should take place outside of \nthe reauthorization of the farm bill.\n\n  Another recommendation of the commission stated as follows:\n\n       Changes in payment limits should be sensitive to \n     differences in commodities, regions, and existing \n     agribusiness infrastructure.\n\n  We talk about where the major portion of the payment limits issue \ncomes from. It actually comes from all over the country. But farmers in \nthe Southeast will be negatively impacted, probably more so than most \nothers. Guess where the largest number of payments goes to farmers. It \ndoesn't go to my home State of Georgia. It goes to Senator Grassley's \nState of Iowa. Do I have a problem with that? Absolutely not because I \nknow he has farmers who get dirt under their fingernails. They know how \nto change oil in their tractors. They know how to farm their farms the \nway they can most effectively derive an income from them, and they \ndeserve to have support when times are tough. I have no problem with \nthat. They are doing exactly what the farm bill allows them to do and \nthat is absolutely fine.\n  One common misconception in regard to farm program payments is that \n10 percent of farmers--and this has been stated today--receive 80 to 90 \npercent of farm program payments. That is simply wrong. According to \nKansas State University Economics Professor Dr. Barry Flinchbaugh, \nthose numbers are far from the truth. It should be noted that Dr. \nFlinchbaugh was chairman of the USDA Commission on the Application of \nPayment Limits. Dr. Flinchbaugh makes the point that small farms, those \ndefined with gross sales of less than $100,000, make up 84 percent of \nthe farms in the United States. They receive 30.5 percent of the \npayments while producing 21 percent of the food supply. Medium-sized \nfarms, which are defined as farms with sales between $100,000 and \n$500,000, comprise 12.2 percent of total farms while producing 28 \npercent of the food supply and receive 42.7 percent of farm program \npayments. Large farms that have sales in excess of $500,000 and consist \nof 3.8 percent of the farms, receive 27 percent of farm program \npayments and provide over 50 percent of the food supply.\n  In the words of Dr. Flinchbaugh:\n\n       These programs are designed for the medium-sized farmers. \n     They've done what they were supposed to do. So what's the \n     issue? It's a farce.\n\n  My point is that Senator Grassley's amendment is not simply a budget-\nsaving measure; it is a complex issue that deserves thorough discussion \nwhen all farm policies are reviewed later this year, not during the \nbudget debate. The Grassley amendment substantially alters farm policy \nrules that farmers and their bankers expect to be in place through the \nlife of this farm bill. His amendment fails to recognize differences in \ncommodities, regions, as well as agribusiness infrastructure. Senator \nGrassley blatantly ignores the recommendations of the commission that \nstudied this issue extensively, an issue that has been studied more \nthan any other aspect of Federal farm policy.\n  Let me close by saying the Senator from North Dakota, who is also a \ngreat friend of agriculture and a good friend of mine and I have great \nrespect for him, brought up the fact that dead farmers are receiving \npayments. I agree with my colleague from Arkansas. If that is the case, \nthen that is the individual who ought to be gone after, not the payment \nlimits in the farm bill. But if somebody is getting a payment that \nought not to receive a payment, there ought to be a fraud charge filed \nand pursued against that particular individual. That is easy enough to \ndo. If anybody has the names, if they get them to me, I will get them \nin the right hands, and they are going to be pursued from a fraud \nstandpoint. That is the issue involved there, not whether payment \nlimits are a problem with those particular individuals.\n  The other issue, we talk about farm payments in general. I think all \nof my farmers in the southern part of the United States would just as \nsoon not get farm payments. The fact is, though, the Europeans pay \nsubsidies, true subsidies in the amount of four times greater than the \npayments that are made under the farm bill.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the Grassley amendment at the appropriate \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time remains?.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nIsakson.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise in full support of Senator \nChambliss, the farmers of Georgia, and farmers around the United States \nof America. This amendment, while I am sure it is well-intended, has \nthe effect of destroying agriculture in the South and in particular in \nGeorgia. The cost of operations in Georgia is tremendous. To have an \narbitrary cap such as this will be absolutely destructive to our part \nof the State and to the No. 1 industry in the State of Georgia.\n  Why are we trying to hurt farmers who only wish to provide a decent \nliving for their families? This is a diverse and distinguished Senate \nwith Members who have all kinds of experience. But I doubt anyone here \nhas ever bought a cotton picker--not one, not two. Many Georgians have \nto have two. When they buy them, they buy them at a quarter of a \nmillion apiece. That investment in infrastructure alone, added to the \ntrucks, the pickers, the bins, and all the other facilities one needs, \nshows that this limitation would be absolutely punitive to the farmers \nof the South.\n  While I respect greatly the Senator from Iowa and those who bring \nthis amendment forward, I strenuously object to it on behalf of the \nfarmers of Georgia. I concur with the other Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nChambliss, that we should join other Members of the Senate in ensuring \ndefeat of the Grassley amendment.\n  Passage of this amendment would result in many traditional family \nfarms going out of business in many, many States.\n  The Farm Service Agency is already going to be overwhelmed by many of \nthe new programs included in this bill. This amendment would result in \nincreased costs to the government and to farmers.\n  Supporters of this amendment say that these payments go to the few \nand the big. I could not disagree more.\n  This amendment punishes the farmer whose livelihood depends solely on \nthe\n\n[[Page S3487]]\n\nfarm. In my part of the country, a farmer must have a substantial \noperation to make ends meet.\n  In the name of common sense, why should anyone want to punish family \nfarmers who have made large investments in order to become competitive \nin an international marketplace?\n  Why are we trying to hurt farmers who only wish to provide a decent \nliving for their families even though they are facing soaring cost of \nproduction?\n  As I have stated, this is a diverse and distinguished Senate with \nMembers that have all kinds of experience. But I doubt anyone here has \never bought a cotton picker. You know what a cotton picker costs today? \nThe average price for a new one off the John Deere lot in Albany, GA, \nis about a quarter million dollars.\n  If you're an average farmer in south Georgia, you're going to need \ntwo of them. That's just the beginning of the equipment needs. There's \ntractors, grain carts, trucks--are all needed to put a crop in.\n  By the way, you know where those cotton pickers are made? In a great \nState: Iowa. I wonder if those employees at that manufacturing plant \nsupport this amendment?\n  The cost of producing crops today costs several hundred dollars per \nacre. Reduced payment limits and increased benefit targeting flies in \nthe face of skyrocketing production costs and record-low commodity \nprices.\n  In fact, this amendment would give less support to Southern farmers \nthan the current farm bill does.\n  My colleagues, I will not stand witness to the demise of farming the \nSouth. Therefore, I oppose this amendment and ask my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 3:15 be on the subject of SCHIP and controlled by our side; from \n3:15 to 4:15 be controlled by Senator Kyl, and that is equally divided.\n  Mr. GREGG. Do we equally divide the time? Why don't we give Senator \nKyl 40 minutes and your side 20 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right, 40 minutes to Senator Kyl, 20 minutes to our \nside. Then we have Senator Cornyn from 4:15 to 4:45.\n  Mr. GREGG. On SCHIP.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We may need 10 minutes in response to him. Then from \n4:50, 5 minutes, to respond to Senator Cornyn, 4:50, Senator Dorgan, \nand then we are going to go to votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let's make sure we have that correct. Would \nthe Senator repeat the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would be happy to: that the time until \n3:15 be controlled by our side on the subject of SCHIP; from 3:15 to \n4:15 on the subject of the Kyl amendment, with 40 minutes for the \nminority, 20 minutes for the majority; then from 4:15 to 4:45 the time \nto be under the control of Senator Cornyn on SCHIP, with 10 minutes \nafter that reserved for a response by our side on the Cornyn amendment; \nand then----\n  Mr. GREGG. The last 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The last 5 minutes under the control of Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we should also make clear we have not done \nsecond degrees. We are not doing second degrees. That is an \nunderstanding we have on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all the \npending amendments be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 504\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for himself, and Mr. \n     Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered 504.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To affirm the Senate's commitment to the reauthorization of \n             the State Children's Health Insurance Program)\n\n       On page 48, line 19, before ``The'' insert the following:\n       (a) Priority.--The Senate establishes the following \n     priorities and makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Senate shall make the enactment of legislation to \n     reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program \n     (SCHIP) its top health priority for the remainder of fiscal \n     year 2007, during the first session of the 110th Congress.\n       (2) Extending health care coverage to the Nation's \n     uninsured children is an urgent priority for the Senate.\n       (3) SCHIP has proven itself a successful program for \n     covering previously uninsured children.\n       (4) More than 6 million children are enrolled in this \n     landmark program, which has enjoyed broad bipartisan support \n     in Congress, among our Nation's governors, and within state \n     and local governments.\n       (5) SCHIP reduces the percentage of children with unmet \n     health care needs.\n       (6) Since SCHIP was created, enormous progress has been \n     made in reducing disparities in children's coverage rates.\n       (7) Uninsured children who gain coverage through SCHIP \n     receive more preventive care and their parents report better \n     access to providers and improved communications with their \n     children's doctors.\n       (8) Congress has a responsibility to reauthorize SCHIP \n     before the expiration of its current authorization.\n       (b) Reserve Fund.--\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment that I hope \nwill garner unanimous support. The amendment simply puts children first \nin America's budget.\n  The amendment I am offering today, along with Senator Rockefeller, \nsays reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Plan, \notherwise known as SCHIP, is the top health priority of this Congress.\n  I applaud the work of Chairman Conrad and other members of the Budget \nCommittee for reporting out a budget that provides up to $50 billion \nover 5 years for reauthorization of CHIP.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will adopt the other amendment that I \noffered earlier today. That amendment will move $15 billion of that \nCHIP funding from the reserve fund into the numbers of the resolution. \nIt would make the funding even more likely to happen.\n  The $50 billion level of funding in the budget will ensure that CHIP \ncan meet the demand for services. This funding will ensure that CHIP \nfulfills its promise of providing health coverage for children who are \neligible for CHIP and Medicaid but not enrolled.\n  Congress has a historic opportunity to help millions of children and \nfamilies this year. We must get this right.\n  As we look at CHIP's track record, we can be very proud of its \naccomplishments over the past decade.\n  Since 1997, the share of children without health insurance has \ndropped by one-fifth. Among the poorest children--those with family \nincomes less than twice the poverty level--one-third fewer children are \nuninsured today than in 1997. Just as Congress intended, the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program is making inroads to help more children get \nhealth coverage.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program has also helped to decrease \nracial and ethnic disparities in children's coverage. Today, the \npoorest African-American children are one-third more likely to have \nhealth coverage, and Hispanic children are one-quarter more likely to \nhave health coverage than they were in 1997.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program has also helped to improve \nthe quality of care children receive by increasing the likelihood \nchildren have a ``medical home''--that is, a doctor, clinic, or HMO \nthey routinely visit for care. Research demonstrates that 97 percent of \nchildren enrolled in CHIP and Medicaid have a ``medial home.'' That is \nmuch better than the 72 percent of uninsured children.\n  We can all agree--CHIP is a great program that has had tremendous \nbenefit for millions of children. But we also know that we can do much \nbetter.\n  Today, three-fourths of the 9 million uninsured children in our \nNation are eligible for--either Medicaid or CHIP; but they are not \nenrolled. CHIP reauthorization holds the promise of helping us make a \ndifference in these children's lives.\n\n[[Page S3488]]\n\n  CHIP provides a funding stream to help States provide health coverage \nto children in need. But that funding stream is often unpredictable and \ndoes not always track the demands for coverage in the State. We can do \nbetter.\n  But we will not be able to address these problems unless we move \nforward with reauthorization this year. And we must do so quickly.\n  If Congress does not enact a reauthorization bill before CHIP funding \nexpires on September 30, we will lose the $25 billion in CHIP funds \nthat are now in the Congressional Budget Office baseline.\n  We simply cannot afford to miss this deadline. We cannot tell States \nthat we just could not get it done. We cannot tell millions of children \nthat they will have to lose coverage. Failure is not an option.\n  CHIP is certainly not the only solution to the health care problems \nfacing our Nation. I share the concerns voiced by so many of my \ncolleagues about the need for broader health reforms. But CHIP can be a \nfirst step toward this broader goal of health reform.\n  This amendment commits the Senate to move forward to reauthorize CHIP \nbefore the deadline, this year. It is a simple statement about the \nprogram's importance and of our will to put children first in our work \nthis year.\n  Let me be clear. CHIP is not a Democratic priority or a Republican \npriority. This program was created in a bipartisan spirit fostered by \nthe late Senator John Chafee and Senator Hatch, working together with \nSenators Kennedy and Rockefeller.\n  Reauthorization must also be a bipartisan priority. I intend to \ncontinue in this spirit and work with my colleague, Senator Grassly, \nand other members of the Finance Committee to get this done the way it \nshould be this year.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to \nreinforce our bipartisan commitment to reauthorize CHIP this year. Our \nchildren are depending on us. We must not let them down.\n  I strongly urge adoption of this amendment at the appropriate time.\n  In conclusion, we can all agree this is a great program with \ntremendous benefit for millions of children. We also know we can do \nmuch better.\n  Mr. President, we have a list of cosponsors on this amendment which I \ndo not have with me at the moment. We will get that later for the \nRecord. But I strongly urge the adoption, at the appropriate time, of \nthis amendment because we then would be putting children first.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my colleague from Montana \nbe given 3 minutes at this time. He has been waiting very patiently.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Baucus for allowing me to \nspeak. I also thank the good Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 464\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak on amendment No. 464, the Grassley-\nDorgan amendment on farm payment limitations, making those limitations \nmax out at $250,000. That is a quarter of a million dollars. That is \nhow much money that is going to be maxed out for individual family \nfarmers to get. That is a reasonable request. I think it makes the farm \nbill more defendable to the American people.\n  I am a family farmer. I understand family farmers are the backbone of \nthis country. They keep our food security there so we do not have \npeople going hungry. What the farm program has meant to do, and has \nalways been meant to be, is a safety net for farmers so when market \nprices drop they have that safety net to depend upon. There is not one \nfarmer I know of who does not want to get their income from the \nmarketplace. So we need to keep it that way.\n  We need to encourage fair trade deals. We need to encourage more \ncompetition in the marketplace. We need to make sure our freight rates \nare, what I would call, not abusive, if we are going to keep family \nfarmers on the land.\n  Some 30 years ago, the student body in the high school I went to in a \nfarming community had 160 kids in it. Today, that same student body is \nless than half that size because we have not had a farm bill that has \nworked for the farmers.\n  This amendment makes sense because it puts a cap of $250,000 on the \nbenefits from farm program subsidies and eliminates those big \nagribusinesses that have been taking money they do not need, quite \nfrankly. They do not need that safety net that the farm program \nsubsidies provide in our farm program.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I ask that all the Members of the Senate \nsupport amendment No. 464, the Grassley-Dorgan amendment, because it is \nthe right thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 504\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the \nbudget resolution. I have many highly complimentary things I could say \nabout Senator Conrad, who has probably the toughest job in the Senate. \nHe has proceeded brilliantly, fairly, calmly, and within the public \ninterest. The public interest is, to me, the most important. He has \nshown that commitment by including $50 billion for the reauthorization \nof the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  I reserve a note of personal privilege. I first became aware of what \nhappens to children--in this case, in rural America--when I was a Vista \nvolunteer in West Virginia in 1964 and 1965. I saw children and their \nfamilies who had no concept of health care. Never in their lives did \nthey have health care or most anything else that really counted in \nterms of giving them hope. So that has been kind of my moral compass \never since. It is the way I vote, it is the way I feel, and it is who I \nam.\n  I know this budget was not easy for the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. But I am so proud the chairman and the Democrats are \nstanding up for children and making CHIP reauthorization the top health \npriority of this year. This is not a Democratic program. This is not a \nRepublican program. If there is anything at all that was ever an \nAmerican program--Governors, everybody--nobody can disagree on the \npower of this program, with the exception that it is now in deep \nstress. It has been cut by two-thirds from its present inadequate \nfunding.\n  This amendment would not only restore the full 6 million children who \nare not covered--and, again, I want you to contemplate a child not \ncovered, a child who develops a toothache, a child who develops a \nstomachache, a child who is miles from a hospital and whose family may \nnot have a car to get that child there.\n  Children's health insurance means everything. Immunization, \npreventive care--CHIP is the only program that has ever done this. We \ndid this with Medicare in 1965. We did it 30 years later with the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. I think it is the single most \naccepted Federal program in my State of West Virginia, with the \nexception, obviously, of Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid.\n  The problem is the budget was cut. So of the 6 million who originally \nwere covered, many are now not covered. We have many problems facing \nus. The budget chairman, Senator Conrad, has corrected these problems. \nHe has included not only the 6 million who were on it but many of whom \nwere cut or would be cut, and then he has included the 6 million more \nwho are eligible because they qualify in every way except there is not \nthe money to cover them. There would now be the money to cover them.\n  I have never faced the problem, to be honest, could I make it in life \nin some way or another, where was my next meal coming from, what would \nhappen if I had some kind of an illness. That is not the typical \nexperience in lots of rural America and urban America. That is where my \nheart lies, with those people. I think we have a sacred responsibility \nas a Senate, on the most bipartisan issue I can possibly think of, to \nremedy this problem and to take care of it quickly by adopting this \npiece of legislation.\n  We remember, in 1977, there were 10 million uninsured children. The \nfailure of health care reform in the early 1990s took away our will, \ntook the wind out of our sails. It turned us into incrementalists. So \nwe did not start thinking about the big picture, how to cover Americans \nbroadly.\n\n[[Page S3489]]\n\n  I can remember standing on the floor of the Senate with the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts. People were saying: Well, this is \nnationalized health insurance. We were waving our Blue Cross-Blue \nShield cards. It did not make any difference, once it was labeled that \nwas it: dead on arrival. That was a tragedy and now is a particular \ntragedy with respect to children.\n  So today we have almost 9 million children under the age of 18, and \nthey still have absolutely no health insurance. How does one walk into \nthis body, with the health insurance we have, with the people we \nrepresent, and allow a situation like that to continue? It is a \nprofound moral issue. It takes the form of legislation, it takes the \nform of goodwill and determination, but it is a profound moral \nobligation of the richest country in the world.\n  So I am strongly for this Baucus legislation. I think we have an \nobligation to adopt it. I hope we have the courage and the skill to do \nso.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, how \nmuch time does he desire?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 7, 8 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 7\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Chair let me know when there is \na minute and a half remaining?\n  Mr. President, first of all, I think all of America ought to \nunderstand a basic and fundamental principle: this budget debate is \nreally about national priorities. It is about a national priority. That \nis why we rise here.\n  Senator Baucus, Senator Rockefeller, myself--it is not just the \nDemocrats on this issue of the Children's Health Insurance Program, but \nRepublicans as well--but we have been around here for many years, and \nwhat a difference a year makes because in this particular budget we are \nputting children first. We are putting children first. We are putting \nchildren's health care first, and we are putting children's education \nfirst. What a difference it is from the recent years where all we had \nis tax breaks, after tax breaks, after tax breaks. This budget is \ndifferent. This budget is very different. It says children are going to \nbe first.\n\n  Secondly, it says that we know there are probably 9 million children \nwho do not have any kind of health insurance, but about 6 million of \nthem are eligible for Medicaid and CHIP. We find that working Americans \nare having more and more difficulty affording health insurance. One of \ntheir great concerns is not just for themselves but for their children.\n  Help is on the way with this budget because with this budget makes a \ncommitment of $50 billion, to help those working families get health \ninsurance for their children. So if their child has an earache, if that \nchild is suffering from asthma, if that child has intestinal flu, the \nparent will not have to stay awake all night and wonder whether that \nchild is $225 sick, because that is what it is going to cost that \nworking family to take that child down to the emergency room. They \nwon't have to worry about sending that child to school sick while they \ngo out to work. That day, the child will be able to get good, quality \nhealth care. That is what we stand for on this side.\n  We see the success of this program. We have seen over the period of \nthese last years the growth of millions of enrolled children, up to 6 \nmillion children, and we know this program can work for an additional 6 \nmillion children.\n  But we are faced with a budget on the opposite side by the \nRepublicans, and what would that do? It would effectively drop almost \nhalf of the children who are currently covered.\n  Here is a map which says 14 States will run out of SCHIP funds in \nfiscal year 2007 under what the administration has proposed. Big \nalternative. You asked about alternatives. Our budget would provide the \nfull coverage. This is what happened in the red States on the chart. If \nyou live in those red States and have children, you are in big trouble. \nHere it is in 2008, an increasing number of States that are going to be \nexcluded.\n  Finally, by 2012, under the Republican budget--look at this--\nvirtually 80 percent of the States will see a drop in the coverage for \ntheir children. With the program that has been put forward by Senator \nConrad and others, it will mean all of this will be white because we \nwill make sure all of those children are covered.\n  Now, what is the impact in terms of health disparities? Let's talk \nnow about the impact on children. We talked about the numbers. We \ntalked about the budget. Let's talk about what the health impact is on \nthe children.\n  The SCHIP program reduces health disparities. This chart shows the \ndisparities between the various groups before the enrollment--between \nWhite, African American, and Hispanic--and after enrollment. Look at \nthis dramatic reduction in terms of the disparities.\n  Health disparities are one of the principal problems we are facing in \nour health care system today. This is one of the best ways to resolve \nthe health disparities, with the Baucus amendment, to try to make sure \nthat there is coverage for every child in America, because of all of \nthe long-range implications of reducing the costs of health care, but \nmost of all because we care about the children.\n  This shows one particular disease: asthma. We have seen the rate of \nasthma virtually double over the period of the last 5 years. The \nprincipal reason for that is because this administration has relaxed \nenvironmental protections and increased numbers of toxins that are in \nthe air. We have double the number of children who are dying from \nasthma now, this year, than we had 9 years ago.\n  But look at what this does for those children who have asthma, before \nenrollment and after enrollment--the dramatic reduction. Here are the \nnumber of asthma attacks, the number of medical visits, and we see the \ndramatic reduction of attacks in terms of the children of this country.\n  So it really comes down to this: This chart demonstrates the \nalternatives, what is included in the Baucus-Rockefeller amendment and \nwhat we have with the Republican proposal. Their proposal is less than \nhalf than what is needed to maintain the current services--the current \nservices; not increasing and providing the health care coverage for \nchildren but just for current services--and the Senate budget \nresolution is the $50 billion to cover all eligible children. That is \nthe issue. This budget puts the children first, and the most dramatic \nexample of that is the strong commitment to ensure that all the 6 \nmillion children who are eligible for CHIP and Medicaid are covered. \nThose who are basically the sons and daughters of working families in \nthis country will know that under this budget, help is on the way. This \nwill be true in every State across this country.\n  This has been a success, and it has been bipartisan. I take my hat \noff to my colleagues and friends, Senator Hatch, Senator Snowe, and \nSenator Smith--all Republicans. Republicans and Democrats have worked \ntogether. But on this issue in terms of priorities, which is a key \nelement in this budget debate and a key difference between the two \nviews about the budget, this amendment is an essential aspect of the \nbudget proposal, and I commend Senator Conrad and those on the Budget \nCommittee for supporting it.\n  I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts and thank those who have spoken on SCHIP.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, could we do 5 minutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Five minutes, yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S3490]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota yields 5 minutes \nto the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if you would let me know when there is 1 \nminute left.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to respond to the points the \nsenior Senator from New Hampshire made yesterday regarding the track \nrecord of the administration and the Republican Congress on education \nfunding.\n  Senator Gregg points to the historic increases in the No Child Left \nBehind Act funding under President Bush, but what he doesn't point out \nis that most of the increase happened after the first year of enactment \nof the No Child Left Behind Act when Democrats controlled the Senate \nand demanded a substantial increase. Since then, new funding for \nelementary and secondary education has plummeted.\n  These are the figures. The President's budget for fiscal year 2002 \ncontained virtually no increase in funding for No Child Left Behind. In \nthe two years following that, he actually proposed cuts in funding for \nNo Child Left Behind. The year after that saw a minimal increase and \nthen No Child Left Behind was actually cut. In fact, since President \nBush has been in office, most increases in funding for education have \ncome about due to pressure from Congressional Democrats.\n  No Child Left Behind is only half the story. Under Republican control \nof the Senate, increases in funding for education programs overall have \ngotten smaller year after year.\n  Two years ago, funding for education was actually cut by over half a \nbillion dollars. Last year, the President proposed the largest cut to \noverall education funding in the history of the Department of \nEducation--$2.2 billion--and again this year, the President's proposal \nis an overall cut of $1.3 billion.\n  So my colleague from New Hampshire is right. President Bush claims to \ninclude an increase of $1 billion in No Child Left Behind funding in \nhis budget for this year, but that is not a real increase. First, it \ndoes nothing more than fill the cut that was enacted in 2006, and \nworse, as he has time and again, the President robs other education \nprograms to pay for it.\n  As I mentioned, he proposes a $1.3 billion cut to education programs \noverall. That is not providing new resources for our schools; that is a \nshell game. But even more important than these points is the fact that \nthe funding which has been secured is simply insufficient to fulfill \nthe bipartisan promise to leave no child behind. That was a promise, \nnot a political slogan. But year after year of broken promises by the \nWhite House and the Republican Congress have left 3.7 million children \nbehind. Their budgets have meant larger, not smaller, class sizes. \nThey've meant fewer teachers trained. This irresponsible neglect comes \nat a time when schools are being asked to do more.\n  We had the debate and the discussion yesterday, and my colleagues \nlistened to my friend and colleague from New Hampshire talk about all \nthe increases in education. Go ask any school board in this country, go \nask any superintendent in the country, go ask any teacher in this \ncountry what has happened in their school and what has happened in \ntheir district and what has happened in their community on education. \nYou will hear the answer: It has been cut, cut, cut, cut. That has been \nthe answer. You can make all the charts in the world. But go out and \nask the schoolteachers, go out and ask the superintendents of schools, \nand they know what has been happening. It has been as we have described \nhere.\n  That has certainly been true as well in the Republican reconciliation \nbill last year, which my colleague from New Hampshire claimed provided \n$9 billion in student benefits and did not cut $12 billion from the \nstudent loan programs. The facts are that $22 billion was cut from the \nstudent loan programs. About $9 billion was spent by that bill more \nthan half of it on sweetners for the banks, such as increased loan \nlimits on federally subsidized loans and reduced origination fees which \ntranslate to increased profits for banks.\n  A small grant program was included, but as my friend from New \nHampshire acknowledged yesterday, 90 percent of students are not \neligible for that program. 4.7 million Pell eligible students were left \nout in the cold.\n  The Senate bill included $6 billion in grant aid for all Pell \neligible students, but the Republicans jettisoned that proposal in a \npartisan conference. This program also wrongly limits eligibility to \nstudents enrolled in school full time. So forget it if you're trying to \nsupport a family and have to work while you're trying to get your \ndegree. This limitation and others related to curriculum also exclude \nvirtually all community college students.\n  But the most important fact is one conceded by the Senator from New \nHampshire. The vast majority of the cuts to student loan programs were \nnot dedicated to student aid. Instead, $12 billion was used to offset \ntax giveaways for the wealthy.\n  Our schools, children and families deserve more than accounting \ngimmicks. Our schools need new resources to make progress on reform, \nand families need real help to afford a college education for their \nchildren. Republican budgets have provided neither.\n  How much greed do those lending companies want? Has anybody read the \nNew York Times recently about what is happening with the investigations \nof the student loan program, those billions of dollars going to the \nstudent loan program? Sallie Mae--the value of its stock was $3.17 in \nJanuary 1995; it has traded above $50 per share for most of this year. \nThat is coming from students and from low- and middle-income families.\n  But when you talk about investing in children, don't listen to the \nSenator from New Hampshire and don't listen to me; listen to your \nsuperintendent of schools, listen to the schoolteachers, listen to \nparents, and you will find out what has been happening and where the \ncuts have been over the past years. If there is a question about what \nhas been happening in student loans, ask any middle-income or low-\nincome family. Ask any students who are going to our fine public and \nprivate colleges. You will find out the tuitions have been going up \nthrough the roof, and a substantial part of that is by the fact that we \nhave a student loan program that works for the banks and not for the \nstudents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, unfortunately, we have two Senators and \nwe have about 12 minutes remaining. Senator Reed, how much time do you \nneed? Mr. REED. Five minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Reed and \nthen the remaining time to Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his gracious \nyielding of time and for his exceptional work on this budget.\n  I wish to speak particularly to the issue of SCHIP. Shortly, Senator \nCornyn will offer an amendment that was offered in the Budget Committee \nand defeated there, and it should be defeated on the floor of the \nSenate. His amendment seeks to tie the hands of the Finance Committee \nand make policy determinations on a program that has direct impact on \nmillions of American families and children.\n  Millions of low-income Americans receive their health care under the \nState Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP. This program is a \nsafety net for low-income families. Rhode Island has provided \nextraordinary support to families working and struggling to provide \nhealth care for their children. By most estimates, the number of \nuninsured is going up in this country--most recently estimated at about \n46 million. If we undermine the SCHIP program, those numbers will \nincrease and particularly, obviously, in the ranks of uninsured \nchildren.\n  SCHIP provides approximately 20,000 Rhode Islanders with health \ninsurance coverage. My State worked hard on a bipartisan basis--\nRepublican Governors, Democratic Governors, and the Democratic \nassembly--to build a health care system for children that works. A few \nyears ago, we had one of the lowest rates of uninsured children in the \nNation because of SCHIP and local efforts. In the last several years, \nthe rate of uninsured children, even in Rhode Island, has gone up.\n  We have to have the resources to keep this program going forward.\n\n[[Page S3491]]\n\nThese dollars mean the difference between children getting access to \nhealth care and being denied health care. It affects their ability to \nlearn in school and their long-term ability to be productive and \ncontributing citizens. This is a vital program.\n  We see these shortfalls perennially in some States that aggressively \nsupport the SCHIP program. We have been able to make fixes in the past, \nredistributing funds. This time, we need a budget--and Senator Conrad \nhas provided it--that will give us the resources and flexibility to \nreauthorize SCHIP so it will work in the future.\n  Senators Boxer, Conrad, and Rockefeller have put forth responsible \namendments to deal with the SCHIP policy issue. Unlike the proposed \namendment of Senator Cornyn, the Baucus-Rockefeller amendment puts the \nneeds and interests of children first in the context of \nreauthorization.\n  I believe this budget, including up to $50 billion to expand SCHIP, \nis exactly the right direction. When you go to Rhode Island, or any \nState, and you talk to particularly the working people who are \nstruggling to make ends meet, the No. 1 issue on their minds is: How \ncan I afford health care insurance?\n  I had a neighbor rush across the street last Friday morning, while I \nwas clearing the snow off my car, who said: I don't know what I can do; \nmy health insurance just went up 66 percent. That is the crisis real \nAmericans face every day. This is a response--a very important \nresponse--but not a final answer to health care in the United States. \nGoodness gracious, if we cannot take care of children and give them \nhealth care, then what else should we do? What is more important than \nthat?\n  I think we have to recognize that some States, such as mine, have \nbeen able to expand this program to include the parents of some of \nthese children. That is a positive step because it provides better \nhealth care for the whole family. In fact, the statistics and analyses \nshow if you can have a family treated as a whole, you have a better \nhealth outcome. Also, it provides, again, another way to stop the ever \nincreasing number of uninsured Americans, be they children or adults.\n  I congratulate Chairman Conrad for his work and commitment. I hope \nwhen we leave this budget debate, we can proclaim loudly and proudly we \nhave expanded coverage health care coverage for children in this \ncountry. That is something I think we can all take great pride and \nclaim satisfaction in doing. I urge us to reject the Cornyn amendment \nand support this budget. I commend Senator Conrad for what he has done.\n  I will make several quick points about the budget. It restores fiscal \ndiscipline. I commend the chairman for that. It adds important assets \nand commitments to affordable housing funds. The language allows us to \ngo forward on that. Education and veterans are important priorities. \nThis budget is one of which the people can be proud. I know the people \nof Rhode Island will be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise to support the Baucus amendment \nas opposed to the Cornyn amendment. I am thrilled this budget before us \naddresses health care in a responsible way in the amendment from this \nside. We provide up to $50 billion for this critical Children's Health \nInsurance Program over the next 15 years that will allow eligible \nchildren, who are not today enrolled, to be able to get the coverage \nthey so necessarily need, and it is a critical step.\n  I commend the authors on this side and Senator Conrad for his \ntremendous work on that amendment. I rise also to thank Senator Conrad \nfor his tremendous leadership in finally bringing us a budget that \nredirects the priorities of America's working families. Our families \nacross the country want us to focus on strengthening our country from \nwithin. That starts by investing at home in our schools, as Senator \nKennedy talked about, and in our infrastructure, and in our \ncommunities. That is exactly what this budget does. It still provides \nevery dollar the President asked for for Defense spending over the next \n5 years.\n  Americans want us to make investments in our future in a responsible \nway. Every family knows the importance of fiscal discipline and the \nimportance of keeping a balanced budget. They expect the Federal \nGovernment to share that responsibility. With this budget, we are \nrestoring an important pay-as-you-go rule that means we are being \nresponsible today, and we are not burdening our grandchildren with new \ndebt tomorrow.\n  American families, we know, also need relief from taxes that are too \nmuch today squeezing the middle class, and the budget Senator Conrad \nhas put forward provides relief from the alternative minimum tax for 2 \nyears and avoids any tax increases. I commend him for his responsible \napproach.\n  With this budget, we are proving we can invest in our people and our \ncommunities and our security without sacrificing the future. It is \nimportant to note, as we debate the budget today, that it reflects a \nnew direction for our country. I recall last November when the American \npeople demanded a change, and this budget reflects that call. It says \nacross this country that we will no longer see our veterans \nshortchanged on their medical care; we will no longer see our \ncommunities facing very painful cuts in housing; we will no longer have \nour ports having gaping security holes they have faced for too long; no \nlonger will our schools be so underfunded; no longer will community \nhealth care be undermined continuously at the Federal level; and \nimportantly, no longer will we keep forcing more debt onto our children \nand grandchildren, without a plan to bring this budget back into \nbalance.\n  On this side, we have said for a number of years there is a better \nway, and this budget proves that. I recognize, as we all do, we cannot \nfund everything everybody wants. No budget can. But this budget, I \nbelieve, moves us in the right direction in a responsible way, and that \nis a dramatic new start for this Senate. Last year, we were struggling \nto protect critical needs. This year, we are investing in them.\n  I wish to highlight some of the national priorities in this budget. \nWe know the Bush administration has not adequately funded veterans \nhealth care. Now, as we begin the fifth year of this war this week, \nthat becomes more and more evident across the country--whether it is \nour veterans, who have been struggling to get mental health care, or \nare waiting in long lines for benefit claims, or a lack of focus on the \nsignature issue of this war, traumatic brain injury, that we have seen \nhighlighted in the press over the last several weeks, or seeing that \nveterans are shortchanged at medical facilities, as we saw with Walter \nReed.\n  This budget we are presenting to America increases our support for \nveterans by $3.5 billion over the President's proposal. In fact, the \ntotal $43.1 billion we are now investing in veterans' care represents a \nfull 98 percent of the independent budget. That is the budget that has \nbeen devised by our veterans service organizations that, as we all \nknow, clearly have proven to be fairly accurate in what they have told \nus they needed over the last years.\n  Our budget also, importantly, rejects the President's proposal that \nwould have imposed new fees and higher drug copayments on some of our \nveterans. Those fees would force more than 100,000 of our veterans to \nleave the VA health care system, and that was wrongheaded.\n  I have seen personally the detrimental effects of underfunding \nveterans health care. As everybody knows, I have fought very hard on \nthis floor to fix the administration's funding blunders and had to work \nhard here to increase veterans funding by $3 billion in 2005 and 2006. \nBy increasing funding for veterans, this budget finally does what the \nadministration has failed to do, and that is recognize the service and \nsacrifice of those men and women who have paid the price of this war.\n  We heard Senator Kennedy a few minutes ago make a strong statement on \neducation. This budget begins to invest here at home in our schools. We \nhave seen years of painful cuts. After that time, we have produced a \nbudget today that addresses the needs of American families who worry so \nmuch about finding and affording educational opportunities for their \nchildren. This budget provides the largest increase in funding for \nelementary and secondary education programs in 5 years. That is going \nto make a real difference for families across this country. We increase \nfunding for the Department of\n\n[[Page S3492]]\n\nEducation by $6.1 billion above the President's budget and restore all \nof the painful cuts he proposed--in Perkins grants, Pell grants, Head \nStart, No Child Left Behind, and the Individuals with Disabilities Act. \nThose are not just names of programs; those are real children who are \nimpacted by the lack of funding we have seen, and this budget restores \nthat.\n  I can tell my colleagues that as a former educator and a parent, I \nknow the importance of having the full partnership of the Federal \nGovernment in supporting our children and our students. I am so glad \nthis budget strengthens the partnership and eliminates harmful cuts.\n  I also wish to mention the important investment in this budget in \nsecuring our ports. Last year, I worked with other Senators on both \nsides of the aisle to pass the Safe Ports Act. Unfortunately, even with \nthe passage of that authorization, the President didn't adequately fund \nthis vital program for the security of our country. We, in this budget, \nincreased funding for the Safe Ports Act and provided $400 million for \nthe Port Security Grant Program. That funding means more radiation \ndetectors, more partners in safe trade, and more customs officials who \nare needed in order to facilitate our trade.\n  I am very proud that this budget takes real steps, concrete steps to \nimprove port security, while also making sure we maintain and improve \nour trade efficiency.\n  Finally, I give my personal thanks to Senator Conrad and his staff \nfor their tireless work in leading the fight on this budget. It has \nbeen a privilege to stand at his side on the Budget Committee and to \nwork with him to right this fiscal ship.\n  This budget, once again, invests in the true priorities of the \nAmerican people while keeping the needs and aspirations of our future \ngenerations in mind. I look forward to passing this budget so we can \nmove forward with the new direction the American people have demanded.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, it is my understanding that under the \nprior order, Senator Kyl is now recognized for an hour, with Senator \nKyl having 40 minutes under his control and the Democratic side having \n20 minutes under their control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, the \nranking member of the committee, for all his hard work and support for \nthose of us who have prepared amendments and would like to offer them.\n  This is actually the Kyl-Graham amendment. The Senator from South \nCarolina will be offering this amendment and, incidentally, as soon as \nwe have the exact text typed, we will present that for actual formal \nsubmission, but I can begin talking about it right now. Let me begin \ndoing that.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to demonstrate, I believe, that \nthere is sufficient ability in this budget to take care of a couple of \nproblems that are very important and which we believe should be \nincluded within this budget before it gets passed: provisions that \nprovide for the education of American children, provide for capital \ngains and dividend tax relief to continue to exist both for our \nfamilies and businesses and the competitiveness of our economy, as well \nas other provisions which were not included in the underlying budget, \nsuch as death tax reform, which I think most of us acknowledge needs to \noccur and which we need to provide for in the budget.\n  This amendment Senator Graham and I will be offering in a moment is \ndesigned to include these very important provisions which I think most \nof us support in the budget. Not to do so would clearly represent a \nvery big hole, I suggest, in the budget.\n  There is a suggestion in the amendment that was offered by the \nSenator from Montana and others that what Republicans have been saying \nabout this budget resolution--namely, that it raises taxes on every \nAmerican taxpayer--is, in fact, the case because as approved by the \nBudget Committee on a party-line vote, I might add, this budget raises \ntaxes by $916 billion over the 5 years of the budget, which would be, \nof course, the biggest tax increase in the history of the country.\n  The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the Senator from \nMontana, well understood this, and I suggest probably is the reason for \nhis offering of the amendment to reduce the revenue that is projected \nby the budget resolution and then, in his case, purports to dedicate \nthat revenue to middle-class tax relief. He wouldn't be offering this \namendment were it not for the recognition that there is a huge tax \nincrease in the budget that came from the Budget Committee.\n  So I submit, to begin this conversation, that Senator Baucus's \namendment is a good start, but it leaves in place the tax hikes on \nmillions and millions of Americans, and that is not something most \nRepublicans want to see.\n  If the Baucus amendment is adopted, then Democrats will be proposing \nto raise taxes on hard-working Americans by $736 billion over 5 years, \nrather than the $916 billion, still the biggest tax increase ever. We \ndon't think this is right.\n  Incidentally, on a technical note, according to the Republican Budget \nCommittee staff, the Baucus amendment increases the deficit in 2010 and \n2011. This is important. When the interest is factored in, the Baucus \namendment would take the budget out of balance in 2012 by some $6 \nbillion. In the past, the Budget Committee members have had an informal \nagreement that interest would not be computed for amendments because it \nwould be too cumbersome.\n  While this amendment would take the budget further into deficit--\npreventing tax increases is more important than worrying about a small, \nmanageable size deficit--it may be interesting to note that the Baucus \namendment would have this effect.\n  In addition to raising taxes, we are talking about increasing the \namount of deficit.\n  The Senator from Montana notes that his amendment would extend the \n10-percent bracket, the child tax bracket, the marriage penalty relief, \nthe adoption tax credit, the earned-income tax credit for combat pay, \nand provide modest estate tax relief. I agree with the Senator on all \nthese policies except with the modesty of the death tax relief.\n  Senator Baucus and some of his cosponsors, especially the two \nSenators Nelson, have always supported repeal of the death tax, as have \nI. So it is disappointing to many family businesses and farm owners \nthat we now have sponsors who had supported the repeal of the death tax \nendorsing an amendment that would set the death tax rate at what I \nbelieve is a confiscatory 45 percent and set the exemption at only $3.5 \nmillion, which most of us believe is too low. This leaves more than \n22,000 families subject to the estate tax each and every year, \naccording to the Joint Tax Committee.\n  Another one of the cosponsors of the amendment of the Senator from \nMontana, the Senator from Arkansas, says on his Senate Web site that he \nsupports a $5 million exemption and a 35-percent rate. I am \ndisappointed he would then be endorsing a proposal that would have a \n45-percent rate. A 45-percent rate allows the Government--think about \nthis for a moment--to take almost half a family farm or business over \nthe $3.5 million exempted amount at the time of death.\n  There is a reason this particular policy has been supported by life \ninsurance companies. I think everybody can understand that. It keeps \nthe onerous death tax in place and would require these family \nbusinesses and farms to continue to pay exorbitant premiums to \ninsurance companies.\n  One of the reasons we would like to eliminate the death tax is so we \ndon't have to pay the burden of trying to avoid the tax, which a lot of \nthese small businesses have to do.\n  As I said, the Kyl-Graham amendment we think substantially improves \nthe Baucus amendment by modifying the year-to-year revenue numbers so \nthat certain tax provisions that have been essential in helping \nfamilies pay education expenses essential to our economic recovery, \nessential to savings for retirement, senior citizens, and families \nfacing the death tax are provided for in this budget. Let me quickly go \nthrough them and then ask my colleague, Senator Graham, to make further \ncomments.\n\n[[Page S3493]]\n\n  On the matter of education, the Baucus amendment fails to extend the \nmany education tax provisions that are scheduled to expire. Our \namendment, on the other hand, makes higher education more affordable \nfor middle-class Americans by extending the tuition deduction, \nextending the modifications to the Coverdell education savings \naccounts, extending certain provisions for the student loan interest \ndeduction, and for extending the exclusion for employer-provided \neducational assistance.\n  These are important provisions to American families. They need to be \nrecognized in this budget.\n  Our amendment permanently extends the $250 deduction for expenses of \nelementary and secondary school teachers who, on many occasions, are \nrequired to pay for the very school supplies they feel are necessary \nand are important for educating the kids for whom they are responsible.\n  These are the education provisions.\n  On capital gains and dividends, who can argue that the capital gains \nand dividend tax rate reductions have been two of the most important \nreasons for the strong economic recovery that our country has made. Yet \nthe Baucus amendment fails to prevent an increase in these two \nimportant tax rates.\n  An extension of the current rates would allow our economic recovery \nto continue. Allowing these rates to expire and to go back up to where \nthey were would be devastating for our economy and for the \ncompetitiveness of our capital markets and, by the way, for the \nretirement savings of many Americans.\n  So the Kyl-Graham amendment permanently extends the reduced tax rate \nfor qualified dividends and capital gains for nearly 18 million \nfamilies and individuals every year. That, too, is an important \ncomponent that should be in this budget.\n  Quickly on two items before I turn to the discussion of the death \ntax, this goes to competitiveness. What our amendment would do is \nprevent tax increases that would clearly hurt our competitive position \nin the world economy. We talk about outsourcing of jobs and \ncompetitiveness and the rest of it. If you want to know what will save \nAmerican jobs and will allow us to continue to grow, it is the tax \nrates that Senator Graham and I preserve in this budget.\n  America cannot be the home for worldwide capital markets if it is \nhostile to American investors. So the amendment makes the existing tax \nrates for long-term capital gains and for qualified dividends permanent \ntax policy. We understand that the lower tax rates that were \nimplemented in 2003 and extended again in 2006 have been a tremendous \nsuccess for our economy and have benefited a broad range of American \ncitizens.\n  Growth, since the 2003 tax relief, has averaged more than 3.5 percent \na year, while it averaged 1.3 percent from the first quarter of 2001 \nthrough the second quarter of 2003, before these tax rates were put \ninto effect.\n  The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 40 percent since the \nlower investment tax rates were enacted.\n  The average 401(k) balance has risen by about 65 percent since 2003, \nvery good news for American families and investors.\n  Why would we want to destroy this tremendous growth in the economic \nwealth of Americans? All of this investment activity makes it easier \nfor entrepreneurs and businesses to raise funds to expand and grow \ntheir businesses, create more jobs, and improve the standard of living \nfor all Americans.\n  By the way, to answer the question of who benefits by all this, some \nof our colleagues are prone to suggest it is only the wealthy who \nbenefit. Not so. It is interesting to note that most Americans who are \nbenefiting from these lower tax rates are middle-income taxpayers. \nFully 43 percent of tax filers in 2004 reporting capital gains had \nadjusted gross income of under $50,000. These are not the wealthy; \nthese are not the rich. Just 9.5 percent of filers reporting capital \ngains had an adjusted gross income of $200,000 or above.\n  So the majority of Americans benefiting from these lower tax rates, \nthe rates we preserve in the budget if our amendment is adopted, are \naverage, middle-class Americans.\n  For lower income Americans, the current 5-percent rate for \ninvestments, which drops to zero in 2008, is another important but \nsometimes forgotten benefit, especially, important, I might add, to our \nsenior citizens.\n  According to statistics calculated by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, more than 75 percent of all elderly taxpayers' returns \nreporting capital gains income have adjusted gross incomes of less than \n$100,000; more than 40 percent have incomes of $50,000 or less. Again, \nwealthy, the rich? No, we are trying to preserve lower tax rates for \nmiddle-income Americans and for senior citizens who rely significantly \non their investment income in their retirement.\n  Madam President, 79 percent of all elderly taxpayers' returns \nreporting dividend income have incomes of $100,000 or less, and 44 \npercent have incomes of $50,000 or less, adjusted gross income. So \nclearly, continuing these lower tax rates is important for our senior \ncitizens and for middle-income Americans.\n  Incidentally, these lower tax rates, far from blowing a hole in the \nbudget, have actually helped increase revenues far beyond the \nprojections of CBO.\n  I note that since 2003, Treasury has collected $133 billion more in \ncapital gains revenue than was originally projected by CBO and exceeded \nthe official CBO projections by 68 percent.\n  In the meantime, all the additional tax revenue flowing into the \nTreasury from our growing economy has caused our budget deficit to \nshrink below 2 percent of GDP, which is below the historical average.\n  If we stay on this current path, we can see continued increase in \nrevenues, continued reduction in the deficit, and continued growth of \nour economy, not to mention support for our families and retirees.\n  Last point. What happens if the budget is adopted without providing \nfor the continuation of these lower tax increases? Last fall, Goldman \nSachs conducted a very interesting analysis. They wanted to see how the \neconomy would react if taxes were increased in 2011, as the Democrats \nadvocate.\n  Their analysis showed that the tax increase, and I am now quoting, \n``would almost surely mark the onset of a recession.'' Their analysis \nassumed that the Federal Reserve would step in and cut interest rates \nto boost the economy, and I am quoting here, ``In an effort to \nresuscitate demand, the Fed immediately cuts the federal funds rate, \nbringing it 250 basis points below the status quo level over the next \nyear and one-half. Despite this, output growth remains well below trend \nover that period, putting downward pressure on inflation as slack in \nthe economy increases.''\n  That is a projection of what would occur if this were to happen. We \nwant to prevent this. We want to keep the economy strong and not allow \nanything that would cause it to go into recession.\n  Just a final point having to do with the death tax reform. We can't \npass a budget that doesn't include an assumption that we are going to \nreform the death tax. We ought to be repealing the death tax. But what \nwe have done in this amendment is to provide an amount of money that \nwould accommodate the kind of death tax reform that has been supported \nby both Republicans and Democrats.\n  Last year, the senior Senator from Louisiana introduced a death tax \nreform bill, S. 3626, which would provide for a $5 million exemption \nper estate, indexed for inflation. It would provide for a family \nbusiness ``carve out,'' a 35-percent rate to taxable estates, and it \nwould begin in the year 2010. The Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Pryor, has \nendorsed death tax reform that meets these specifics in a statement, \naccording to his Web site.\n  Now, our amendment provides room in the year-by-year revenue numbers \nin the budget to accommodate death tax reforms such as those which were \nproposed by Senator Landrieu and endorsed by Senator Pryor. There have \nbeen other Members on the Democratic side of the aisle who have \nsupported proposals I have introduced on death tax reform.\n  What we are very much hoping is that all of the people, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, who have supported these proposals in the \npast will remain true to their commitments to their constituents to \nmake sure small farms and small business owners aren't going\n\n[[Page S3494]]\n\nto have to prepare for or pay the death tax and that we would make room \nfor that in this budget. If we fail to do that, then clearly we are not \ngoing to be able to provide the kind of relief our constituents demand \nand deserve.\n  Our amendment provides room in the year-by-year revenue numbers to \naccommodate death tax reform such as that which has been proposed by \nour Democrat colleagues and, I would add, that I have proposed as well.\n  Now, of course, budget resolutions don't dictate policy to the \nFinance Committee, so it would certainly be our intention to work with \na lot of different Senators. I worked with Senator Lincoln in the past, \nand certainly we would want to work with Senators Landrieu and Pryor \nand all of the others who have indicated they would be willing to \nsupport a kind of death tax reform. As long as we have provided the \nnumbers in the budget as Senator Graham and I propose here, then we can \nwork to make those provisions law.\n  I would hope we could craft an estate tax proposal that would provide \nan exemption of at least $5 million, indexed for inflation, that \nprovides workable relief for the smallest estates, and that provides \nfor a top death tax rate which is no higher than 35 percent--no higher \nthan 35 percent. Workable relief could mean a lower rate for the \nsmallest estates; it could also mean a family business carve-out as \nlong as it actually works for small businesses and farms and doesn't \ndrive up their administrative costs and leave them with planning \nuncertainty.\n  All of these are goals both Democrats and Republicans have endorsed. \nWe hope our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will therefore agree \nwith us that it is important for us to accommodate in this budget room \nto extend the important tax provisions for education, capital gains and \ndividends, and for the estate tax.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 507\n\n  Madam President, I understand the amendment about which I have just \nbeen speaking is actually at the desk. I would like to call it up at \nthis time, and I ask unanimous consent that Senator Graham be added as \nan original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself and Mr. \n     Graham, proposes an amendment numbered 507.\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Madam President, I really don't have much to add because \nSenator Kyl has done an outstanding job in explaining our amendment and \nthe benefits to the country if we pass this amendment.\n  To the people in South Carolina who might, by chance, be listening, \nthe reason I am so passionate about trying to extend the tax cuts and \nmaking sure this budget does not deal a death blow to tax cuts that \nhave been in place in some form or manner since 2003 is the evidence is \noverwhelming that they have helped our economy.\n  Just to kind of build on what Senator Kyl has said, my belief is the \nglobal economy of the 21st century is going to require America to \nrethink across the board how we engage our global competitors. \nAmericans have to ask themselves these questions: Is our tax structure \ngoing to be globally competitive? Are we going to have a tax structure \nthat will allow capital to be welcome in this country so that people \nwho take risk can be rewarded here or will we drive people somewhere \nelse?\n  The regulatory side of government, the litigation side of our \nAmerican experience here needs to be looked at anew out of a sense of a \nneed to fit into a global economy and to be fair to all our citizens. \nIn my opinion, the worst thing we can do is to create a tax structure \nthat drives jobs overseas.\n  In this economy, where anyone can do business anywhere in the world, \npeople do look at tax rates in making decisions about whether to invest \nhere or somewhere else. From the Government's point of view, the \nevidence is overwhelming that the tax reductions in dividends and \ncapital gains, particularly capital gains, have generated revenue to \nthe Federal Government. As we have lowered the rate down to 15 percent, \nin some cases to zero and other\n\n[[Page S3495]]\n\ncases 5 and 10 percent, with a maximum capital gains rate of 15 \npercent, people have generated a lot of capital gains transactions that \nhave been good for the economy and good for the Federal Treasury, and \nthey are due to expire.\n  This budget, the way it is drafted, is going to deal a death blow to \ntax reductions that have been beneficial to the economy--and without a \ngood reason, in my opinion. There is no good reason. The question is, \nDoes this budget deal a death blow to tax cuts? The answer has to be \nyes, simply because Senator Baucus is trying to extend tax cuts by an \namendment. And I wish to congratulate him. I am not here to play \n``gotcha'' politics. What he is trying to do in his amendment is a \nwonderful thing. He is trying to make sure the 10-percent tax bracket \nis extended for a couple more years in this budget. He is trying to \nmake sure the $1,000 child tax credit is extended as far as this budget \napplies and we don't revert back to a $500 per child tax credit. In \nSouth Carolina, a $1,000 per child tax credit for the families who have \nbeen eligible has made a world of difference to people.\n  My State, like every other State, has great success stories \neconomically and where you have people living paycheck to paycheck. The \nmarriage penalty relief has been good for families in my State. The \ndependent care credit has been good for people trying to work and raise \nkids. Adoption credits have been good, helping to create new families. \nThere is nothing more exciting as a lawyer than to be involved in an \nadoption where you get a child who has no home and you marry them up \nwith a family that wants a child. It is just a wonderful experience. \nThere is combat pay and the EITC exemption.\n  None of us disagrees with those. Why not go forward into the other \nareas where we have cut taxes that have benefited the Treasury and \nbenefited job creation? The only reason I can think of is there is a \nview that there are some Americans who are entitled to tax relief and \nsome who are not. The ones to whom we don't want to give tax relief in \nthis budget have been labeled ``the rich'' and are somehow unworthy of \nbeing included in this budget.\n  Class warfare is a time-tested political endeavor whose time has \npassed. We are in this together. There are about 270,000 people in my \nState who depend on capital gains income and dividend income. Senator \nKyl has gone through, in very detailed fashion, who benefits from \ncapital gains and dividend tax reductions, and there are a lot of \nseniors.\n  At the end of the day, though, we have a choice to make as a \nCongress. We can do what Senator Baucus wants, which I wholeheartedly \nsupport, and we can stop believing that people on the other side of the \nriver, when it comes to taxes, just make too much money or they do not \nneed the help. I would argue that if you are in business today, \ncreating a product for sale in the global economy, you need help when \nit comes to your taxes because some of your competitors have tax rates \na lot lower than the United States.\n\n  When it comes to lowering dividend tax rates, how does that help \nAmerica? People will invest in companies that pay dividends, they will \nbuy stock, which helps American corporations capitalize, if the tax \nrates are lower. It is not just a theory; it is a fact. When you are \ntrying to grow your business, you can get investors from the private \nsector or you can go to the bank and borrow money. It seems to me we \nwould want to create an environment so that corporate America, whatever \nthe size, could get money from the private sector to grow their \nbusinesses without being so debt laden, and the people who are \nreceiving dividends, that would be income to help them in their retired \nyears, which would be a win-win situation.\n  We can't afford to divide America any longer based on how much one \nmakes or this concept that some of us are more worthy of protection \nfrom the Tax Code than others. The Tax Code is not going to allow us as \na nation, in its current form, to survive in a global economy. But if \nwe extend the tax cuts in this budget, it would be a good signal to the \nprivate sector in America that they are going to be able to count on--\nfor at least a couple more years--some tax cuts that have worked to \nproduce jobs.\n  The real challenge of this Congress lies ahead; that is, trying to \nfind a way to simplify the Tax Code. That is a debate for another day. \nOur friends on the other side have been in charge of the Congress now \nfor a couple of months, and this is a test, in my opinion, of how the \nDemocratic Congress views the needs of America across the board in a \nglobal economy. Again, the evidence is overwhelming. There is \noverwhelming evidence that the dividend tax reductions and the capital \ngains tax reductions have been beneficial to the Treasury.\n  The amendment of Senator Baucus to extend tax cuts for working \nfamilies, to extend marriage penalty relief, and the $1,000 child tax \ncredit, to make sure it doesn't go to $500, should be applauded. I see \nthe need, as a Senator from South Carolina, for what he is doing. It is \nfrustrating that I cannot convince my friends on the other side that \nthe need exists in abundance in South Carolina and everywhere else in \nthe country to keep our tax rates low when it comes to the \nentrepreneurial spirit that has made us great, that the capital gains \nrates need not go up. They need to stay where they are, as long as we \ncan keep them that low, until we find a new Tax Code. The dividend tax \nrates need not go up or double in a few years. They need to stay low \nbecause America needs jobs. The way you create jobs is you leave as \nmuch money as reasonably possible in the private sector and you have a \ntax structure that rewards people who decide to take risk and invest.\n  What America needs more than anything else is some certainty as to \nthe death tax dilemma we created. There is a great debate going on in \nthis country about the role of the death tax in the 21st century. It is \nindefensible, apparently, to say that the current rates and the current \nexemptions are fair. I think we have won the argument that the death \ntax, without change, is going to put a lot of people at risk who have \nmade something of their lives, the family farm or the small business. \nAs Senator Kyl said, there is a lot of buy-in with our Democratic \ncolleagues that we need to increase the exemptions fairly dramatically \nbecause people can be land-rich and cash-poor. I know in South Carolina \nthere are a lot of people who have inherited tracts of land, and the \ndeath tax appraisal requires the family to break up the property and \nsell it. About 70 percent of small businesses, they tell me, never make \nit to the third generation--one of the reasons the business has to be \nbought back from the Government.\n\n  I think we have all bought into that as a body, that the exemptions \nneed to change. I hope we have bought into the idea that the rates need \nto be lower because they are oppressively high. But here is the dilemma \nwe have created for the country. It is my understanding, given the tax \npackages we have passed over the last several years, the death tax \nexemptions go up over time and eventually go to zero in 2010. In \nJanuary 2011, unless we do something as a body, they go back to the old \nsystem.\n  I have been a lawyer for a long time. There are going to be a lot of \nmysterious deaths on New Year's Eve 2010 because if you live the next \nday there is going to be a big hit to the family when it comes to tax \nrates. It is not right for us to put the American business community \nand the family in that position. We need to help straighten this mess \nout. I am very openminded to compromises, but it is not fair for \nsomeone, if they live 1 day longer than they should, half of what they \nhave worked for all their life goes to someone they don't know. We can \ndo better than that. That is the place we find ourselves in America. \nThe Congress has created the dilemma that if you die on New Year's Eve \n2010--I think that is the correct date--your family has absolutely no \nestate tax liability. If you die the next day, almost half of what you \nhave worked for in your entire life is gone through taxation. We can do \nbetter than that.\n  One way to start doing better is to pass a budget that would include \nwhat Senator Kyl has described on the list of Senator Baucus.\n  I do believe the country is dying for us to come up with a rational \nsystem of how we tax the American people, including low-income, middle-\nincome, and upper-income Americans. I am trying the best I can to \nexpress to a lot of\n\n[[Page S3496]]\n\npeople in South Carolina, who live paycheck to paycheck, that we are \nall in this together. If I overtax the business owner, your job is \nthreatened because his business may move offshore. People back home in \nSouth Carolina very much get that.\n  If you are in a manufacturing State, as I am, like Michigan, one of \nthe reasons our jobs are leaving this country is because you can go to \nplaces such as China and other places and not have the burdens you have \nhere. I do not want to chase China to the bottom, don't get me wrong. I \nwant to put a floor on what China does. I think we will make a mistake \nchasing China to the bottom. But I think we would make an even bigger \nmistake if we do not address, in this budget, tax relief that has \nworked for Americans across the board.\n  We have a chance in this amendment to do something about death taxes \nthat is extremely rational and would get America out of the dilemma of \ndying on the wrong day. We have something in this amendment that would \nallow the capital gains rate reductions to stay in place a couple of \nyears longer and keep the dividend taxes low because they more than \npaid for themselves, and we have some education tax relief.\n  If we add this amendment with what Senator Baucus has done, I think \nwe could say this budget does a very good job of trying to extend for \nthe life of this budget tax relief across the board that has worked for \nall Americans.\n  Finally, if we buy into the idea that there is a certain group of \nAmericans who are not worthy of tax relief, we are going to, over time, \nmake it very difficult for the American economy to survive globally, \nand we are going to create a dynamic in the 21st century that I think \nwill come back to haunt us over time.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Kyl-Graham amendment \nbecause when you marry it up with the Baucus amendment, we have done a \npretty good job of extending tax relief across the board in a way that \nwill help the American economy from top to bottom.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, might I inquire of the Senator from \nArizona what the cost of his amendment is?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, may I say to the Senator, the chairman of \nthe committee, our amendment is some four pages long, and it has the \namounts increased and decreased stated. I am sorry I have not totaled \nup the exact amount and then subtracted out the cuts. I will be happy \nto try to do that for the Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Does the Senator have some rough idea of what the \namendment costs?\n  Mr. KYL. All of the provisions that we have in this amendment are \naccommodated by the budget that has been provided to us by the \ncommittee. Let me get the exact number.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could the Senator tell us how he pays for the amendment?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, the so-called payment for this is the same \nas other things are paid for in this budget, by the assumption that \nrevenues will be available. As a result, there is no specific cost, if \nthat is what the Senator is asking.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is the problem. I am told this amendment costs in \nthe range of $75 billion and has no offset. Here is our problem. \nSenator Baucus has previously offered an amendment that extends the \nmiddle-class tax relief and also addresses the problem that the Senator \nfrom South Carolina addressed with the estate tax. We have this anomaly \nin the estate tax where we go to a 3.5-million-dollar-per-person \nexemption and then we drop down the next year to $1 million, going \nbackwards.\n\n  Senator Baucus, in the amendment he has offered, does a series of \nthings. The amendment addresses all the middle-class tax cuts--the 10-\npercent rate, the marriage penalty, the childcare credit. It extends \nthose. It does it within the budget room that we have for 2012, so we \nstill are able to achieve balance in 2012. It also deals with the \nproblem of the estate tax going backwards, going from $3.5 million per \nperson as an exemption back to $1 million. The Baucus amendment deals \nwith that. It actually is a little better than that because the Baucus \namendment also contains $4 billion that is not accounted for that would \nbe available to the Finance Committee to improve the estate tax \nprovisions. He also deals with the SCHIP, the need for us to fund \nSCHIP. He does that within the budget room that is available in 2012 so \nwe do not have a deficit.\n  As I understand the amendment of the Senator from Arizona, that would \ntake the budget into substantial deficit in 2012. And there is no pay-\nfor; there is no offset. The money that did exist in the budget \nresolution, the money that was available, has been taken by the Baucus \namendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I now have a number. The Senator from North \nDakota was very close in the estimate which he gave. I believe the \nnumber is $72.3 billion for 5 years, which is very close to the number \nthat the Senator had. Of course, since the budget raises taxes by $916 \nbillion, that more than accommodates what we provide.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The problem is, all the money is spoken for. So to add \nthe Kyl amendment would drive us back into deficit, substantial \ndeficit. I say to my colleagues, I think that would be a mistake. \nUnless the Senator provides an offset--there are things that are in his \namendment for which I might have some sympathy. I personally believe we \nought to have a goal of keeping rates low and having a broad base to \nour tax system so we can pay our bills and at the same time be a \nstrongly competitive economy. In fact, my own conclusion from all of \nthe debates on both sides is we need fundamental tax reform, and it is \nthat, in part, for which this budget resolution tries to create an \nincentive.\n  We have some time because we do not face any of these tax measures \nexpiring for the next 3 years. But during that time, I think we have to \nengage in a discussion of fundamental tax reform.\n  The bottom line is, I hope very much that colleagues will support the \nBaucus amendment. I hope very much they will resist the Kyl amendment \nat this point because it is not paid for, it is not offset, and it will \ntake us back to the deficit in a substantial way.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 6 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Does the Senator from Michigan request some time?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, to add to what the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota indicated, we have tax cuts built into this \nbudget. We are in a global economy. We need to be competitive. There \nare a number of ways in which we need to be competitive.\n  My friend from South Carolina and I are working together on the \nquestion of trade enforcement. That is a critical part of it--investing \nin education, a skilled workforce, innovation. That is a very big part \nof it. That is a big part of this budget, making education a top \npriority.\n  Changing the way we fund health care, getting it off the back of \nbusinesses, addressing health care costs is a big part of being \ncompetitive and is addressed in this budget.\n  We say every child in a family where the folks are working ought to \nhave access to health insurance, and this budget finds a way to do \nthat. We address other issues. Health information technology, that \nSenator Snowe and I and others are working on together, is addressed in \nthis budget. So we address a number of items, including tax cuts.\n  We address one of my biggest concerns, and I know my Democratic \ncolleagues share this concern, of what is happening with the \nalternative minimum tax and how it is going to be shifted more and more \nto middle-income taxpayers and is becoming the alternative middle-class \ntax. We address that.\n  Through this Baucus amendment we say when we get into surplus, when \nwe get out of the hole that has been dug in the last 6 years and \nactually begin to have a surplus, we are going to capture\n\n[[Page S3497]]\n\nthat $132 billion, both to make sure that children's health care is \nfunded and to expand on investments in tax cuts, including what has \nbeen talked about in terms of extending the exemptions on the estate \ntax for a certainty.\n  We want folks to know that once you get to 2010, you can keep living \na healthy life, continue, and, in fact, the same rates, at a minimum, \nwill continue. So the Baucus amendment is about making sure we can do \nthat. We all come together around the education cuts and making sure \nthat we have the child tax credit and the 10-percent tax rate and other \nareas that are very important to working families, middle-class \nfamilies. But we do this within the context of another very important \nvalue that Americans hold, and that is we pay the bills. We do it \nwithin a framework of fiscal responsibility.\n  In the last 6 years we have seen this tax policy, we have seen a war \nthat has not been paid for, we have seen other spending that has been \nrolled over onto the national debt creating the largest deficit in the \nhistory of the country. We are now trying--and with this budget we will \nsucceed--to dig our way out of that. But this amendment adds over $72 \nbillion back into the hole. It keeps on digging. That is what this \nbudget resolution is committed to stop: fiscal responsibility, and to \ninvest in the priorities of American families and American businesses \nand invest in middle-class tax cuts.\n  I have heard on the other side of the aisle over and over that we \nshould not pick who receives tax cuts. That is exactly what the current \npolicy has done. If you earned over $1 million last year, you received \nat least $118,477 worth of a tax cut. That is more than the average \nperson in Michigan makes in a year, and that was the tax cut.\n  I suggest, looking at this chart, for someone earning less than \n$100,000, it was $692. We can go on down. If someone was, in fact, \nearning less than that, those numbers go all the way down to less than \n$100.\n  I would suggest that the priority was set the previous Congress, the \nadministration deciding whom they wanted to get tax cuts--and they have \nbeen getting them--adding to the deficit, taking away from our ability \nto critically invest in those things that will allow us to be \ncompetitive; investments in science and education and changing the way \nwe fund health care and doing the other kinds of things we need to do, \nincluding balancing the budget, to be able to address the costs of \ninterest, et cetera.\n  So what we are saying is this picture of who receives tax cuts is not \nours. This is not ours. We reject that. This budget focuses on the \nfolks who have not been getting the tax cuts, it focuses on the folks \nwho not only have not been getting the tax cuts, but they have been \ngetting the wage cuts at the same time.\n  The average, the real median household income has declined by almost \n$1,300 in the last 5 years. Folks are working harder, the gas prices \nare going up, the cost of college is going up, health care costs are \ngoing up, maybe they lose their pension and hope and pray that they \nhave a job, their income is going down, and to add insult to injury, \nthey have not received the tax cuts that have been offered.\n  What we are about is changing that picture. This budget resolution is \nabout a new direction, a new set of priorities, focusing on middle-\nclass families who are working hard every day, businesses who are \ninvesting in America and want to keep the jobs here. That is what this \nis about. I hope we will reject the Kyl amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Can the chair inform us how much time remains on each \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes for the Senator from New \nHampshire, 7 minutes for the chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I think it is important to note what this \namendment does. First off, the chairman has said it is not paid for. \nWell, actually, the Baucus amendment hasn't passed, so you can argue it \nis paid for. If the Baucus amendment does not pass, this amendment \nwould have the same funds available to it.\n  But that is a specious argument. It is straw dogs because the issue \nis the extension of the tax rates, which we have heard from the other \nside of the aisle are not going to be affected, that they are in favor \nof extending the tax rates.\n  Well, if that is the case, then they cannot make the case that the \ntax rate can't be extended, which is the case they are making. I mean \nit is a little inconsistent, to say the least. So I think that is \ninside-the-park baseball but not even good baseball, by the way--bad \nbaseball.\n  But what is important to remember about these proposals which we have \nin this group is that first it addresses educational funding, tax \nbreaks which benefit especially teachers who help out in their \nclassrooms--very important.\n  It puts the death tax in a better position than what was proposed by \nthe Senator from Montana, and it basically takes the language which I \nbelieve was developed by the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, and \nuses that as the basis for the death tax. It does not go to full \nrepeal, as occurs under the present law, in 2011, but sets the ceiling \nmuch higher and makes it much more reasonable and I believe gives a \nstepped-up basis and capital gains treatment, essentially, to death \ntaxes, so that people do not get wiped out when somebody who owns a \nfarm dies; if the primary owner dies, the family does not get wiped out \nand have to sell the farm, or a small business does not get wiped out. \nThis mostly involves that issue, quite honestly, because high estates \nare not affected by this. We are not talking about the founder of some \ntechnology company who is worth hundreds of millions or potentially \nbillions of dollars avoiding estate taxes--just the opposite. That \nperson will still be subject to the estate tax.\n  We are talking about setting the threshold high enough so that the \nfamily farm, the small business is not put out of business by the \nuntimely death of an individual. You know, why should somebody be taxed \nfor getting hit by a car? It makes no sense at all, but we try to \nstraighten that out.\n  The most important element of this proposal, in my opinion--although \nI am sure others focus on education more than the death tax issue--is \nthe fact that it continues the very positive proposals which were put \nin place relative to the formation of capital in this country and, as a \nresult, the creation of economic activity and the creation of jobs. The \ndividend rate and the capital gains rate, as opposed to those which are \nin place today, have had a massive impact on creating economic activity \nin our society and as a result have created a huge number of jobs and \nas a result has caused the revenues of the Federal Government to jump \ndramatically.\n  The capital gains rate, for example, we have seen come in, and this \nchart shows it, at exceptionally high levels compared to what the \nestimates were going to be, dramatically high levels. We should have \nexpected this because this is human nature. What happens is someone has \nan asset they have had significant appreciation in. Boom. What happens \nif they have got to pay a high tax on that asset if they sell it? They \nare not going to sell it, they are going to hold onto the asset. But if \nthe tax rate is a fair tax rate, which is what we have in place today, \nthen the person sells that asset. That has two very good effects. \nFirst, it frees up the cash from that event, and the person ends up \npaying taxes, which we would not have otherwise had because the person \nwould have held onto the asset. Second, they will take that money and \nthey reinvest it in a much more productive way. That is human nature.\n  Also, as a result those dollars are being more productively used, \ncreating more entrepreneurial activity, so it works well.\n  The capital gains rate has produced dramatic increases in revenues. \nSo we should keep it in place because it is doing what it is supposed \nto do. It got the economy going, creating jobs. But something which \npeople do not focus on is that the cap disproportionately benefits \nsenior citizens. If you raise the capital gains rate, you are basically \nraising the taxes on seniors in America because it is seniors who take \nadvantage of the capital gains rate, because that, again, is human \nnature and logical.\n  Seniors basically are not earning money in the sense they are out \nworking daily. Most seniors or many seniors, the majority probably, a \nvast majority are retired, but they have assets. As they take those \nassets and they convert them, they pay capital gains.\n\n[[Page S3498]]\n\nThose assets are usually at a pretty low basis since they were acquired \nwhen they were young or during their working years. So when you raise \nthe capital gains rate, you are focusing a tax rate right on top of the \nseniors of this country. You have launched a torpedo at them. You are \ngoing to basically say to those seniors: You are going to have less \nmoney to use in order to make sure that your retired years work the way \nyou expected them. Not only does that work for captal gains rate, it \nalso works for dividends. The dividend rate is also disproportionately \nused by senior citizens. Well, that is again human nature; it tells you \nthat seniors do not have earned income, what they have is dividend \nincome because they have invested or their 401(k) has been cashed out \nor their IRA has been cashed out or their defined benefit plan is \nsuddenly getting them some revenue. They get dividend income.\n  When you raise the dividend income tax rate, you are taxing, again, \nseniors. So it is totally reasonable, from a standpoint of continuing \nstrong economic activity and from a standpoint of maintaining a \nreasonable tax burden on Americans, and especially seniors, that we \ncontinue these tax rates as they are. That is why this is a good \nproposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I understand I have 7 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, let me say briefly on this, you can \nextend all the tax breaks that have been described in this amendment if \nyou pay for them.\n  The problem with the Kyl amendment is he does not pay for it. Over \n$70 billion is not paid for, goes on the deficit, which will drive this \nbudget, which now balances in 2012, right out of balance. We will be \ngoing right back into the deficit ditch. Please, colleagues, let us \nresist this amendment. People could support it if it was paid for, but \nit is not.\n  I yield 3 minutes to Senator Schumer.\n\n\n                 White House Proposal on U.S. Attorneys\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you for yielding. I am going to talk a lit bit \nabout the U.S. attorneys in response to the comments that have been \nmade today from the White House.\n  The bottom line is very simple, to paraphrase ``The Godfather'': The \nWhite House has made us an offer that we cannot accept. We cannot \naccept it very simply because it is no way to get to the truth.\n  Mr. Snow said today that the White House wants to get to the truth. \nWell, if they want to get to the truth, what is wrong with testimony \nunder oath? Do we not have oaths to ensure that truth is given?\n  Karl Rove was mentioned by Mr. Snow himself at one point, who stated \nincorrectly Karl Rove's involvement and then corrected himself. No one \nis saying there was any prevarication there. But with so many \nmisstatements that have been out there, so many corrections, doesn't it \nmake sense to interview witnesses with a transcript, under oath?\n  Because if we do not, we will never get to the bottom of this. We \nDemocrats want to resolve this issue quickly. We want to get the facts. \nWe want to find out what went wrong--it is clearer and clearer that \nmany things did--and correct them and move on.\n  But when the President gives an offer that does not allow the truth \nto be gotten--no oaths, no transcript, no public testimony--it does not \nserve the purpose of finding out what happened, resolving it quickly, \nin a fair and nonpartisan way, and then moving on.\n  I hope the White House would reconsider its offer, would be willing \nto negotiate--they have stated they have not--and then we can finally \nget to the bottom of the matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I wish to thank the Senator from New York. I wish to go \nback, if I can, to the two amendments we will be considering soon, the \nBaucus amendment and the Kyl amendment. Let me, if I can, reframe this \nissue for my colleagues.\n  The Baucus amendment looked to the $132 billion surplus we had in \n2012, I use that term ``surplus'' advisedly, but that is what our \nbudget resolution shows, $132 billion in 2012. Senator Baucus fashioned \non amendment to extend the middle-class tax cuts, addressed the problem \nof the estate tax going from an exemption of $3.5 million per person \ndown to $1 million a person; in other words, going backward, and \nprevents that from occurring, as well as having some additional moneys, \nsome $34 billion to be able to improve that package and perhaps provide \nfor other measures, education tax credits or others, that the Finance \nCommittee might decide.\n  It also provides funding for SCHIP, the proposal that will allow \nevery child in America to receive health insurance. That amendment \ndeserves our support.\n  Senator Kyl then comes with an amendment to extend all of the other \ntax cuts, but unfortunately he does not pay for it. He does not have \nany offset. That would drive our budget back into deficit. Please, \ncolleagues, let's not do that. Let's not take the country--after all \nthis work of getting out of the deficit ditch, which this budget \nresolution does--right back into deficit. To me, it makes no sense. \nThat is going in the wrong direction. We could extend all the tax cuts \nmentioned by Senator Kyl if we pay for them, if we provide offsets for \nthem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I understand at this time we go to \nSenator Cornyn; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would ask Senator Cornyn to yield me 1 minute.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. GREGG. What the Senator from North Dakota did was make a very \ngood case for the Kyl amendment or a very bad case against the Baucus \namendment.\n  The Baucus amendment was $195 billion, not $132 billion amendment--\n$60 billion-plus is deficit spending. The allegation that the Kyl \namendment, under this present structure, is $70 billion of deficit \nspending matches apples to apples. The two amendments are essentially \nthe same in the area of deficit spending, so you cannot argue that one \nis not deficit and one is deficit. It is the opposite. They both have \nthe same practical effect on the deficit.\n  What the Kyl amendment does, however, is at least extend the tax cuts \nor tax rates that actually create significant economic activity, which \nwe have shown through the capital gains rate have generated significant \nrevenues to the Treasury. Whereas, although I agree with the Baucus tax \nrates, most of those taxes rates, in fact all of those tax rates, are \nsocially driven. They are good social policy, but they do not generate \neconomic activity.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 511\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I have an amendment and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 511.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To provide a deficit-neutral reserve fund for the \n   reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program \n                  (SCHIP) that will cover kids first)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR THE REAUTHORIZATION \n                   OF THE STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE \n                   PROGRAM (SCHIP) THAT WILL COVER KIDS FIRST.\n\n       In the Senate, if the Committee on Finance reports a bill \n     or joint resolution, if an amendment is offered thereto, or \n     if a conference report is submitted thereon, that--\n       (1) reauthorizes and improves the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program (SCHIP);\n       (2) emphasizes providing health insurance to low-income \n     children below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level;\n       (3) limits the use of SCHIP funds for coverage of non-\n     pregnant adults unless States are covering their low-income \n     children;\n       (4) allows parents to cover their children on their own \n     health insurance plan with SCHIP funds;\n       (5) increases State flexibility so that States can use \n     innovative strategies to cover kids; and\n\n[[Page S3499]]\n\n       (6) improves and strengthens oversight of Medicaid and \n     SCHIP to prevent waste, fraud and abuse,\n\n     then, provided that the Committee is within its allocation as \n     provided under section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act \n     of 1974, the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget may \n     revise allocations of new budget authority and outlays, the \n     revenue aggregates, and other appropriate aggregates to \n     reflect such legislation, to the extent that such legislation \n     would not increase the deficit for fiscal year 2007 and for \n     the period of fiscal years 2007 through 2012.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this amendment establishes a deficit-\nneutral reserve fund for the Finance Committee if it reports a bill \nthat reauthorizes the State Children's Health Insurance Program, better \nknown as SCHIP, but the important distinction is that this bill must \ncover children.\n  One might ask: Why in the world would a program known as the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, why would it be necessary to offer \nan amendment directing the Finance Committee to cover children? That is \nbecause the current proposal does not limit Federal funding to pay for \nhealth insurance for children. In fact, it creates a patchwork system \nwhich allows States to spend money that should go to cover children to \ncover adults and other individuals. While I certainly understand that, \nit leaves many children uncovered.\n  The chairman's mark, the base bill that is on the floor, states the \nSCHIP program of the budget is to expand coverage of the estimated 6 \nmillion children eligible but not enrolled in either SCHIP or Medicaid. \nThis is a more limited goal than covering every uninsured child, as has \nbeen stated on the floor as the goal. It assumes $15 billion in new \nSCHIP funding and includes an additional $35 billion in an allegedly \nbudget-neutral reserve fund for SCHIP authorization, for a total of $50 \nbillion for SCHIP reauthorization. This triples the size of the current \nprogram. There are no offsets outlined in the Democratic budget, and \nthey can either be from spending cuts or tax increases.\n  The Democratic reserve fund is for passage of legislation that meets \nthree conditions. Let me point out the problem. The original purpose of \nthe SCHIP program was to provide health insurance coverage for children \nbelow 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. However, today some \nStates have expanded their programs using Federal taxpayer dollars to \ninclude children up to 350 percent of poverty, not 200 percent and \nlower, but up to 350 percent, which is currently about $70,000 for a \nfamily of four. States have used this money without covering all their \nchildren to cover adults, parents, and even childless adults. Nine \nStates cover children at 300 percent and above of poverty level. Here \nagain, it is not an effort any of us could necessarily criticize in the \nabstract, but to take money that is designed for children at 200 \npercent of the poverty level and below and to cover children from \nfamilies with much greater income and to cover adults and other \nindividuals who are not part of the SCHIP purpose is off track.\n  Twelve States will spend almost $807 million of their SCHIP money on \nmore than 671,000 adults this year. The State Children's Health \nInsurance Program will cover 671,000 adults this year. Three States \nhave more adults as enrollees than children. This is a matter of false \nadvertising by the Federal Government. We have passed legislation, \nwhich I support, designed to cover low-income children, and the Federal \nGovernment has authorized a situation where now 671,000 adults are \nbeing covered, and people not from low-income families but middle-\nincome families are being covered.\n  Here again, I don't begrudge them the coverage, but to take a program \ndesigned for low-income children and use it for a purpose other than \nadvertised is simply not honest, and it is not what Congress intended.\n  Several States spend half of their SCHIP allotment on adults, so it \nis no surprise that more than one-third of the 14 States experiencing \nshortfalls have expanded coverage to adults. The other problem with the \nunderlying SCHIP provision is, with more than 6 million SCHIP and \nMedicaid-eligible children still uninsured, shouldn't States cover the \nintended population before they expand their program? Why in the world \nwouldn't Congress support an effort to cover low-income children before \nwe approve the use of that money to cover unintended and nontargeted \npopulations? The SCHIP match rate is more generous than Medicaid's \nmatch rate. The children eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP should be \ncovered by their respective programs.\n  The other feature in the underlying bill this amendment would correct \nis this underlying provision supports States in their efforts to move \nforward in covering more children, but it has no income level cutoff.\n  In other words, the stated objective of Chairman Dingell and Senator \nClinton to cover children up to 400 percent of poverty level, which \nwould translate to an income of $80,000 for a family of three, simply \nrepresents an unprecedented wealth transfer from the pockets of the \nAmerican taxpayers to these families who should be expected to pay a \nportion of their own health coverage.\n  The SCHIP amendment which I offer would instead focus the \nreauthorization of the SCHIP program on its original intent--low-income \nkids--by creating a budget-neutral reserve fund for the passage of this \nlegislation. It would reauthorize and improve the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. It would emphasize providing health insurance \nto low-income children below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. \nIt would limit the use of SCHIP funds for coverage of nonpregnant \nadults unless States are covering their low-income children first. It \nwould allow parents to cover their children on their own health \ninsurance plan with SCHIP funds. That is an important feature. Some \nparents have no alternative but to basically drop their own health \ninsurance for their children in order to get them to be eligible under \ntheir State SCHIP funds. This would allow parents to cover their \nchildren on their own health insurance if, in fact, they have health \ninsurance, by allowing the additional cost to cover their children to \nbe paid from SCHIP funds. It is important flexibility that I would \nthink all Members would support.\n\n  It increases State flexibility so States can use innovative \nstrategies to cover kids, and it improves and strengthens oversight of \nthe Medicaid and SCHIP programs to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I offered this same amendment in the Budget Committee last week, and \nit was opposed unanimously by my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. I think we need to make a clear statement that SCHIP is a \nprogram for low-income children. Otherwise we ought to call it \nsomething else. Let's be honest with the American people. Let's not \ntake something called the State Children's Health Insurance Program and \nmake it a program for adults. That is simply dishonest. I don't think \nit is appropriate. I am concerned that using SCHIP dollars to provide \ncoverage for childless adults diverts limited resources from covering \nchildren first, which is the original purpose of this program, a \nlaudable purpose which I support.\n  The fact is, more than 10 percent of those enrolled in SCHIP are now \nadults, approximately 639,000, according to the Government \nAccountability Office. These 639,000 adults are from nine States. The \nGAO agrees covering adults is not the point of SCHIP, certainly not \nwhat Congress said it intended to do. These State coverage expansions \nmean funds are being diverted from the needs of low-income children who \ngo uncovered because those States choose to use it for other purposes. \nAdults accounted for an average of 55 percent of enrollees in the \nshortfall States compared to 24 percent in the nonshortfall States.\n  Congress needs to make a firm statement that SCHIP is for children. \nIf States focused on covering kids, it would have been much easier for \nthem to stay within their allotments. This amendment makes clear that \nin the SCHIP program, our priority must be for low-income children.\n  In addition, as I noted a moment ago, my amendment would allow States \nto continue to use innovative strategies to cover kids and will improve \nand strengthen the oversight of the SCHIP program to weed out waste, \nfraud, and abuse.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote in favor of this amendment. I know the \nranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, wants\n\n[[Page S3500]]\n\nto use a portion of the time we have remaining on the amendment. I \ncertainly reserve the remainder of the allotted time for him.\n  I thank the Chair and the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I am happy to yield to the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 466, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I send a modification of the Sessions \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At the end of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. EXCLUSION OF TAX RELIEF FROM POINTS OF ORDER.\n\n       Sections 201, 202, 203, and 209 of this resolution and \n     sections 302 and 311(a)(2)(B) of the Congressional Budget Act \n     of 1974 shall not apply to a bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report that would provide \n     for the extension of the tax relief provided in the Economic \n     Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, the Jobs \n     and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, and \n     sections 101 and 102 of the Tax Increase Prevention and \n     Reconciliation Act of 2005.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 511\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I support the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Texas. He is basically getting at the essence of the SCHIP issue. \nSCHIP has become nomenclature. It has become a motherhood term. It is \nbeing used as a smokescreen to dramatically expand the amount of money \nwe spend as a Federal Government on health care and basically take a \nbig bite out of what I would call the nationalization effort in health \ncare because it has been expanded well beyond its purpose. Its purpose \nshould to be take care of children in need and make sure they have \nproper health insurance. We all agree on that. What the Senator from \nTexas is proposing is to do exactly that, make sure this program is \ndirected at children. However, we have seen State after State and some \nof our biggest States use this program for adults and for families up \nto $68,000 of income. That is not about low-income kids being taken \ncare of. That is about trying to nationalize the health care system. If \nwe are going to spend all this new money on SCHIP--and I think we need \nto spend some additional money on SCHIP--let's make sure it goes where \nit is supposed to go, to needy kids. That is why the amendment of the \nSenator from Texas is such a good amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the Senator from Texas is retaining his \ntime. Perhaps we could modify our previous unanimous consent request so \nwe stay on this question until the votes. The Senator has approximately \n15 minutes remaining and we would have 15 minutes on our side to \ndiscuss it.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes \nin relation to the following amendments occur beginning at 5 p.m., with \nthe votes occurring in the order listed and that there be 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided before each vote; and that after the first vote, \neach succeeding vote be limited to 10 minutes; that no amendments be in \norder to any of the amendments covered under this agreement: The first \namendment being the Baucus amendment No. 492; the second amendment \nbeing the Kyl amendment No. 507; the third amendment being the Cornyn \namendment No. 477; the fourth amendment being the Sessions amendment \nNo. 466, as modified; the fifth amendment being the Ensign amendment \nNo. 476; the sixth amendment being the Bunning amendment No. 483; and \nthe final amendment being the Bingaman amendment No. 486.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 511\n\n  Back to the issue of the most recent Cornyn amendment which is on the \nquestion of SCHIP. Frankly, I have some sympathy for the argument \nadvanced by the Senator from Texas. There may be some policy reason to \nhave very low-income adults covered with some SCHIP money, but this is \nsupposed to be a program directed at children. Whatever the merits of \nthe Cornyn amendment, there is a very serious problem with the Cornyn \namendment that leads me to oppose it, and I ask colleagues to oppose \nit. That is, this isn't the place for the Cornyn amendment.\n  The simple fact is, the budget resolution does not determine the \npolicy on SCHIP. It has nothing to do with the policy on SCHIP--\nnothing, zero. This is a policy question that will be before the \nFinance Committee.\n  Let us review what a budget resolution does and does not do. A budget \nresolution gives an instruction to the Finance Committee of how much \nmoney they need to raise to meet the budget. It tells them how much \nmoney they have to spend in the various categories under their \njurisdiction. It does not tell them one word of what the policy is \nrelated to those fundings. That is not the role of the budget \nresolution. So as well meaning as this amendment is, it has nothing \nwhatever to do with the policy determination that is to be made by the \nauthorizing committee.\n  The Budget Committee is not the committee of jurisdiction. We are not \nthe committee that makes these policy judgments. We are not the \ncommittee that makes these determinations. So this amendment is \neyewash. As well intended as it is, it simply will have no force and \neffect on the deliberations of the Finance Committee with respect to \nthis policy. That is the fact. Sometimes I wish the Budget Committee \ndid have that kind of authority and that kind of power, but we simply \ndo not.\n  So let's be honest with our colleagues. Let's be honest with the \npeople who are watching. This amendment will do absolutely nothing \nabout the question of who gets covered under SCHIP--nothing, zero. That \nis a determination that will be made by the Finance Committee.\n  At this point, Madam President, I recognize the Senator from Michigan \nand ask her, how much time would she like on this amendment?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I am happy to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the chairman.\n  Madam President, as a member of both the Budget Committee and Finance \nCommittee, I concur with our leader's comments in terms of the \njurisdiction of the Budget Committee. I look forward, frankly, to this \ndebate and working through all the specifics on children's health care \nin the Finance Committee because there are very important issues we \nneed to address.\n  The spirit of the Cornyn amendment is what we have addressed in this \nbudget resolution, which is making sure we have the resources to be \nable to cover every child. Right now, about 6 million children are \ncovered. There are another 6 to 7 million children who actually qualify \nfor the SCHIP program, for children's health care, but the funds are \nnot there. So this budget proposal will allow that to happen.\n  Now, in some States--such as my own State of Michigan, where Michigan \ndecided on its own to meet its moral obligation to cover children and \nbegan to reach out creatively using other funds to cover children--when \nthey have received the children's health care funds, they have found \nthat being creative, using what they were already using, they could \nstretch it a little farther to maybe cover moms and dads or very poor \nadults.\n  In the law we passed regarding children's health care, there was a \nwaiver provision put in that the administration could use--used by this \nadministration and the former administration--to waive the rules to \nallow a little more flexibility, if the States were able to work hard \nand be creative and be able to stretch their dollars.\n  That is what has happened in Michigan. I am very proud of the hard \nwork that has gone on in Michigan and by our current Governor who is \nvery committed to extending health care coverage not only for every \nchild but for\n\n[[Page S3501]]\n\nevery person in our State. I hope that is our goal, together, for our \ncountry. We should not be talking about how we limit health care but \nhow we make sure it is available for every individual. I believe health \ncare should be a right and not a privilege in the greatest country in \nthe world.\n  But in our case, we cover an individual making $4,500 a year--$4,500 \na year--certain individuals. So when we get to the Finance Committee \ndebate, I hope we are going to keep in there the ability and \nflexibility for States to receive, if approved, waivers that allow them \nto stretch their precious health care dollars a little bit farther.\n  This amendment would, in its policy--even though it has no effect \nultimately, it states we should not allow that flexibility for States, \nwe should not allow the ability for States to be creative. It also sets \na limit of 200 percent above poverty, which may sound--well, it may \nsound as though it is OK, but you are talking about basically two \nindividuals in a family each earning the minimum wage. That is about \nhitting that number of 200 percent of poverty. So if you get a minimum \nwage increase or maybe you get a little bit more money, and you still \ndo not have health care coverage in your employment.\n  Again, we would be saying, through this kind of amendment, they \nshould not be able to cover their children with health care, not be \nable to have access, even though they are working hard. The whole point \nof SCHIP is to say to those who are working: If you are working hard \nand in a low-income job, you should be able to know you can receive \nhealth insurance for your children. If you are working hard, you don't \nhave to go to bed at night saying: Please God, don't let the kids get \nsick--which is what happens every single night in America. So I hope we \nreject this amendment. It is not appropriate for the Budget Committee.\n  I also look forward to the debate on the policy once we get to the \nFinance Committee. We want to cover every child. The money in this \nbudget will allow us to cover those children who are currently eligible \nbut not covered. We will cover every child. That is our commitment. \nThat is part of the moral document we have put forward in this budget \nresolution. But we also, I believe, need to figure out a way to make \nsure in the process we are not taking away health care coverage from \nanyone in the country.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, in a brief response, because I see the \nranking member of the Finance Committee is here, the chairman of the \ncommittee has made the case we should not vote for the Cornyn amendment \nbecause it has policy in it. Well, actually the budget resolution has \npolicy in it. In its reserve fund, the budget resolution has three \nspecific policy directives relative to SCHIP which is just as specific, \njust as policy driven as the proposals of Senator Cornyn. So either you \nare pure or you are not pure. In this case, both sides are directing \npolicy. So I do not think that argument has a whole lot of credibility. \nBut the issue here is this: The Cornyn amendment tries to focus SCHIP \non kids. That is what it should be focused on. The problem we have \ntoday is that SCHIP is being used as a stalking-horse to basically \nensure all sorts of people who do not qualify in the concept of kids at \n200 percent of poverty. You have three States where they actually spend \nmore SCHIP money on adults than they do on children. You have 12 States \nthat are spending almost $1 billion annually of SCHIP money on adults. \nYou have nine States where they are covering up to 300 percent of \npoverty. You have other States where you are going up to $68,000 of \npersonal income and still qualifying people for SCHIP.\n  That is not the way SCHIP is supposed to be structured. SCHIP is \nsupposed to be structured for kids. The Cornyn amendment gets us back \nto the original purpose of SCHIP, thus giving probably more coverage to \nmore kids than the present program or even the expanded program which \nhas been put forward by the other side of the aisle.\n  Madam President, what is the time situation relative to the Members?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 13\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from North Dakota has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I yield such time as he may desire to the \nranking member of the Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I appreciate very much that the \nSenator from Texas has offered his amendment. I support it. I supported \nit during the Budget Committee's markup of the legislation that is \nbefore us right now, and I am happy to support it on the floor.\n  This amendment adds a new reserve fund which identifies some very \nimportant priorities that complement the reserve fund in the \nlegislation that has come out of the Budget Committee.\n  The reserve fund in the budget stipulates the legislation reported \nout of the Finance Committee must ``maintain coverage for those \ncurrently enrolled in [the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram].''\n  As my colleagues in the Senate know, this current population includes \nchildren, pregnant women, parents, and childless adults. The cost of \nextending coverage to these populations has been roughly estimated by \nthe Congressional Budget Office to require a net increase of budget \nauthority of approximately $8 billion.\n  The Cornyn amendment would put kids first--after all, wouldn't you \nthink that is what the State Children's Health Insurance Program ought \nto do, put children first--prioritizing lower income children and \nlimiting the use of State Children's Health Insurance Program funds for \nnonpregnant adults unless States are covering those children.\n  We will have to make some very difficult choices when it comes to the \nlimited funds available for the SCHIP. The cost of covering children \nwho are uninsured but eligible for SCHIP continues to rise.\n  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and their \nanalysis--and this was in a recent memo from the Congressional Budget \nOffice--it will take $47.5 billion to cover the estimated 6 million \nchildren who are uninsured but eligible for either SCHIP or the \nMedicaid Program. To quote the center, even this figure is ``too \nlow''--those are their words: ``too low''--because it does not include \nthe cost of the policies necessary to increase enrollment in Medicaid \nand SCHIP.\n  Given the priorities placed on pay-as-you-go and the limited offsets \navailable to pay for increased SCHIP spending, it appears some \npriorities have to be set. We are faced with that every day--setting \npriorities, that everybody cannot have everything they want.\n  Republicans have taken the position--and I emphasize that position--\nwe want to prioritize putting kids first. So I support Senator Cornyn's \nemphasis upon this key principle.\n  I also agree with the language in the budget that would support \nStates in their efforts to move forward in covering more children. \nHowever, this language can be improved by emphasizing that \nreauthorization should make State flexibility a priority. With State \nflexibility, we can get more bang with the State's money, we can get \nmore bang for the Federal dollars going into the program. We found that \nin Medicaid last year when a bipartisan group of Governors came to me, \nwhen I was chairman of the Finance Committee, and sat down and said: If \nyou can give us more flexibility in Medicaid, we can save State tax \ndollars, we can save Federal tax dollars, and we can serve more kids \nwho have need--because States know what their local situation is, they \nknow better than we do in Washington to get the most bang for the \ntaxpayers' dollars. So we can do the same thing for the SCHIP program \nby giving the States greater flexibility.\n  Much of the success we have seen relative to the SCHIP program is \nbecause the Congress gave States the authority to manage the SCHIP \ncaseloads, to control costs, and to experiment with innovative \nstrategies to increase access to health care.\n  This country is so geographically vast, our population is so \nheterogeneous that if you try to make all policy by pouring policy in \nthe same mold in Washington, DC, it is not going to fit New York City \nthe same way it might fit Des Moines, IA. But we ought to give those \nStates in the case of New York, Albany, and in the case of Iowa,\n\n[[Page S3502]]\n\nDes Moines, give those leaders, Governors and State legislatures, some \nleeway so we get more bang for our buck.\n\n  Reauthorization then should build on the State flexibility that was \nalready there and should be a key feature of the priorities set in the \nbudget.\n  Finally, given my zeal for oversight, meaning congressional oversight \nof what our bureaucracy does and how the taxpayers' money is spent, I \nmust also commend the Senator from Texas for including, as a priority \nfor the SCHIP reauthorization, improving and strengthening the \noversight of Medicaid and SCHIP to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. We \nhave made improvements to preventing waste, fraud, and abuse, but we \ncan certainly do more. We can always do more.\n  I commend the Senator for his amendment. It builds on the language \nalready in the bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it.\n  I reserve the balance of the time on our side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I am going to be yielding to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey in a moment on this amendment, but we wish to enter \ninto a unanimous consent request for what happens after the votes \ntonight. We have already entered into a unanimous consent request with \nrespect to the votes that will occur tonight. After those votes, there \nwill be a time for discussion and debate. I ask unanimous consent that \nduring that period, Senator Hutchison be allowed to offer an amendment \non sales and use tax, that Senator Sessions be able to offer an \namendment relating to the alternative minimum tax, that Senator Durbin \nbe permitted to speak, that Senator Sanders be permitted to speak, that \nSenator Lieberman be permitted to introduce and withdraw an amendment \non war costs, and that Senator Wyden be permitted to speak.\n  Perhaps we should go a step further and give an amount of time for \neach. Would the Senator have a thought with respect to wanting to give \nthem 10 minutes each?\n  Mr. GREGG. Why don't we give them 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Continuing, that each of the aforementioned Senators have \nup to 15 minutes, and that they be in the order indicated: Senator \nHutchison, Senator Sessions, Senator Durbin, Senator Sanders, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Wyden.\n  Mr. GREGG. And, Madam President, that the majority has the right to \nreserve an amendment in response to the Sessions amendment and in \nresponse to the Hutchison amendment, and that the order of voting on \nany amendments offered this evening as part of this unanimous consent \nwould be at the discretion of the chairman and the ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And, when the business of the Senate is concluded today, \nthat there be 25 hours left on the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We thank all colleagues. To revisit, so everybody \nunderstands what we will then face, after the votes tonight, Senator \nHutchison will be able to offer an amendment relating to sales and use \ntax, Senator Sessions on the alternative minimum tax; that both of \nthose can have a side-by-side Democratic amendment offered tomorrow if \nit is deemed necessary; that Senators Durbin, Sanders, Lieberman, and \nWyden all be recognized in that order, or if they seek to change the \norder among themselves they are able to do that; that each of them be \nlimited to 15 minutes; that there be no further votes after the votes \nthat have already been approved; and that at the conclusion of the \nSenate business tonight, there will be 25 hours remaining on the budget \nresolution.\n  We thank the excellent staff who have helped us keep track of all \nthis through the day, and we thank very much the occupant of the Chair \nas well for her attention and for her effort.\n  With that, I recognize the Senator from New Jersey.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes 42 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield that time to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Budget Committee for yielding, and let me get right to it. Only in \nWashington, with those who have some of the best health care coverage \nin the Nation, would there be a proposal to cut coverage to America's \nneediest children.\n  An example of what would happen if this were to be passed: In New \nJersey alone, more than a half million children depend upon our State's \nsuccessful SCHIP program. Providing less than what is required to keep \nthese children safe and healthy isn't only reckless, it is a \ndereliction of our duty here in Congress.\n  The President is spending a lot of time this week talking about \nCongress's role and responsibilities. The President had a \nresponsibility to send us a budget that took care of children in this \ncountry, and we have had members of his administration cite the \nsuccesses of what we have done in New Jersey and, therefore, in other \nplaces in the country.\n  Tom Scully, who is the CMS administrator, said:\n\n       Even in tight economic times New Jersey is setting an \n     example of how Federal waivers can help them cut into the \n     numbers of citizens with no health coverage.\n\n  That is what he said on January 31 of 2003.\n  If the Cornyn amendment is passed, as many as 30,000 children in New \nJersey could lose coverage for needed medical service. Worse still, it \nwould prevent another 75,000 children in New Jersey from even being \neligible for the critical health coverage they need. That is not only \nbad policy, it is downright reckless and it is flatout wrong.\n  We live in the greatest country in the world, and there is no reason \nour neediest children should go without the medical services they need. \nNo child in America should go to sleep at night in pain because they \ndon't have the health care coverage they need or, as we saw recently, a \nyoung boy in Maryland who had a toothache, and it abscessed and it \nended up getting infected and he died. No child in America should face \nthat reality.\n  We know the success of covering parents, because when we cover \nparents, we end up covering children. That is not because I say it, but \nlook at what the CMS administrator Mark McClellan said last year before \nthe Senate Finance Committee. He said:\n\n       Extending coverage to parents and caretaker relatives not \n     only serves to cover additional insured individuals, but it \n     may also increase the likelihood that they will take the \n     steps necessary to enroll their children. Extending coverage \n     to parents and caretakers may also increase the likelihood \n     that their children remain enrolled in SCHIP, and that is our \n     experience.\n\n  That is New Jersey's experience.\n  Who are we talking about, not only in New Jersey but across the \ncountry? We are talking about some of the children in our Nation who \ncome from communities that already have great health disparities. Yet \nwhen we see what SCHIP has done, we have seen those disparities narrow. \nHere is a chart that shows before enrollment in SCHIP what many \nchildren faced--White, African American, and Latino children--and after \nthe enrollment, the percentage of children lacking a regular source of \ncare dramatically reduces; dramatically reduces. Now, Latino and \nAfrican-American children in this country will represent over 40 to 45 \npercent of all of the Nation's schoolchildren. Would we leave 45 \npercent of any capital, human capital in this case, unhealthy, \nuneducated? That is what this amendment seeks to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, we need to defeat the Cornyn \namendment. We need to keep the reality of where SCHIP is today: \ninsuring our children and their families and making sure we are \npreserving that human capital.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes left.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I thank the Senator. That is very \ngracious and I appreciate it very much. I\n\n[[Page S3503]]\n\nwanted to come to the floor and say a few words. I will try to keep my \nremarks to 90 seconds or 2 minutes, because I know some other Senators \nwish to say a word.\n  First, let me thank my colleagues for working on a package of \nlegislation that includes the TRAC Act, making the TRAC Act permanent, \nthe tax relief for our soldiers in combat. We know we spotted this 3 \nyears ago where for some soldiers in combat, when they take their \ncombat pay, they lose the ability to get the earned income tax credit, \nthe child tax credit. I have had soldiers all around my State and other \nplaces tell me they appreciate the tax relief, and the last thing they \nneed to be worried about is their taxes and getting gypped out of some \ntax relief. So this makes it permanent. Thank you very much.\n  Secondly, I have included in this package one of these amendments we \nare going to vote on which is the daycare tax credit. In 2004, there \nwere 6.3 million taxpayers who used the child independent tax care \ncredit to cover daycare, afterschool care, summer day camp, elder care \nfacilities, and this is a tax that helps working families, middle-class \nfamilies, folks who are the bread and butter of our Nation and our \neconomy.\n  Also, I thank Senator Conrad and Senator Gregg for their great \nleadership on this budget. I know it has been very hard. I know we are \ngetting to the time to vote. I want to thank them publicly for their \nleadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, if I still have time, I yield it back.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, we have a series of votes starting at 5 \no'clock. We have the rest of the evening lined up. I apologize to the \ndesk crew who will be here late into the evening once again. I also \nwant to thank our staffs--my goodness, they have worked tirelessly--\nMary Naylor of my staff, Scott Gudes, and the staff director for \nSenator Gregg, and all of their assistants who have done a spectacular \njob of helping us to manage this difficult budget resolution.\n  Votes are to start at 5 o'clock. Why don't we start now. I think we \ncould begin the vote early. Is there a problem with that? I don't think \nthat hurts anything, because what that would allow us to do is we have \nagreed there would be 10-minute votes after that. I don't think there \nis any problem with that.\n  Does Senator Gregg have any other observations? Maybe one thing we \nneed to do is remind our colleagues--this may be a very good time to \nremind colleagues of what it is we are going to face tomorrow. Tomorrow \nwe are going to come in and we are going to have 25 hours left on this \nresolution. Then we go to vote-arama. We need to finish this by 4 \no'clock on Friday. We have a number of our colleagues on both sides who \nhave other obligations, so we need to finish this. So we are calling on \ncolleagues--and I will speak for myself. I am calling on colleagues on \nour side to please be disciplined about the amendments you insist on \ngetting votes on. We have had perhaps the most difficult year I can \never remember, because we have some of our colleagues on Presidential \ncampaigns, and there have been so many other events we have had to \nbreak for. It has made it very difficult to give colleagues the chance \nto get the votes they desire. We are going to have to ask for continued \ncooperation to get this done.\n  Senator Gregg, do you wish to say anything further?\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senator's comments. First, I join him in \nthanking the staff. We are about halfway through the timeframe here and \nthey are getting tired, but they are doing a great job and we very much \nappreciate all they do; not only our staffs on the committee but \nobviously the staff that operates the Senate itself, who end up being \nhere late into the night, and we very much appreciate their help.\n  As to amendments, we are going to have a lot of votes on Friday, and \nit is going to be a very extensive day of voting and people need to \nsort of get ready for that.\n  At this point I think we ought to start the votes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the hour of 5 o'clock having arrived, I \nthink it is the appropriate time to start the votes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am not sure the yeas and nays have been ordered on all \nof these amendments.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested en bloc.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes evenly divided between each amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nequally divided between the votes prior to the vote on the Baucus \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, nobody has used time on either side on \nthe first amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Maybe I will take the time because I am advised Senator \nBaucus will not be here until the vote has begun.\n  Let me recall for our colleagues that the Baucus amendment is to \nprovide for the middle-class tax cuts to also address this anomaly in \nthe estate tax, where it goes from $3.5 million per person of exemption \nback down to $1 million. It also contains additional funding for the \nChildren's Health Care Program.\n  There are other elements to the Baucus amendment, as well, that were \nenumerated by the Senator. I hope very much that our colleagues can \nsupport the Baucus amendment. It still leaves us with a slight balance \nin 2012 so that we are not back into deficit.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, claiming the minute on the Republican \nside, the Baucus amendment makes sense, but it does so in the context \nof also justifying the Kyl amendment. Both amendments basically make \nthe point that we should extend these tax rates, which have done so \nmuch to help people and create an economic boom in this country. Both \namendments are essentially the same, as far as the impact on the \neconomy, but the Baucus amendment is about 2\\1/2\\ times the Kyl \namendment. Both of them create issues of deficit financing.\n  As a practical matter, the Kyl amendment specifically will generate \neconomic activity. It creates jobs and, therefore, more revenue to the \nFederal Treasury. If you vote for one, you should vote for the other, \nif you happen to believe we have a tax policy that is making sense in \nthis country today and is generating a lot of revenue, which it is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n492 by the Senator from Montana.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) \nand the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 97, nays 1, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 82 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--97\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n[[Page S3504]]\n\n\n\n                                NAYS--1\n\n       \n     Feingold\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Dodd\n     Johnson\n       \n  The amendment (No. 492) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have six votes that are going to be \ncalled immediately; 10 minutes plus 5 minutes the roll will be called. \nEverybody should understand that and not run back to their offices. Ten \nminutes, fifteen minutes goes by very quickly. There will be six votes, \nand we have 15 minutes on each one of them.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 507\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally divided prior to \nthe next vote. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, could we have a little bit of order? A \ntouch, not too much. I don't want to get carried away.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if my colleagues voted for the last \namendment, they should vote for this amendment. Procedurally, they are \nessentially the same. They are treated the same, they have the same \nimpact, for all intents and purposes.\n  The last amendment, arguably, would increase the deficit by $60 \nbillion. This one would increase it by $70 billion. Both amendments are \nfocused on continuing the tax policy that we have in place, which is \ndoing such a good job of generating jobs. In fact, this amendment \nincreases the death tax to 35 percent--it reduces it, doesn't allow it \nto go over 35 percent. It allows the exemption to be applied to estates \nof $5 million; it permanently extends the tuition tax credit; it \npermanently extends the $250 deduction for teachers; it extends the \ntuition tax credit; it extends the capital gains and dividend tax rates \nwhich are so important to this economy and have had such a positive \nimpact on revenues to the Federal Treasury.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, however well intended the Kyl amendment \nis, it spends $72.5 billion with no offset. The surplus is gone under \nthe amendment we just adopted. The surplus is gone. So the effect of \nthis amendment is to take us right back into deficit.\n  This amendment blows the budget. This amendment takes us from a \nbalance in 2012 right back into deficit.\n  My colleagues can extend those tax cuts if they pay for them, if they \noffset them. The Kyl amendment does not pay for them; it does not \noffset them; it takes us back into deficit. It ought to be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. GREGG. Do I still have time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. Six seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Go ahead, quick.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from North Dakota is wrong. Vote for the Kyl \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n507. On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) \nand the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are now 2 minutes equally divided on the \nCornyn amendment.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, my amendment creates a 60-vote point of \norder against legislation that would increase the income tax rates on \ntaxpayers.\n  Yesterday, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee graciously \nindicated his support for this amendment. I hope nothing has changed \novernight, and so I would hope my colleagues would support this \ntaxpayer-friendly amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I find myself conflicted on this amendment \nin the following way: On the one hand, I don't think it is particularly \ngood tax policy to establish points of order on this matter. So as a \nmatter of tax policy, I don't think it is a particularly good idea. On \nthe other hand, I don't want to leave the impression that this \nresolution contemplates an increase in tax rates because it doesn't.\n  So I would say to those on my side, vote your conscience on this \namendment. It certainly will not do any damage to this resolution if \nthis were to pass.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes evenly divided on the Sessions amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, just briefly on this next amendment, I\n\n[[Page S3505]]\n\nthink it is a defining vote on the question of whether we intend to \nextend the current lower tax rates. The budget resolution that is \nbefore us has four points of order against tax cuts, but the way it is \nwritten, it even includes continuing our current income tax rates \nbeyond 2010 because that would be defined under this budget as a \nreduction in taxes. This means that this proposed budget resolution \nwould require 60 votes to extend the currently existing lower rates \nbeyond 2010. I believe that is a mistake. These reduced rates include \nthe $1,000 per child tax credit, the 10 percent bracket, the marriage \npenalty, the adoption tax credit, capital gains and estate tax repeal.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's not put a burden on our economy and on \nour constituents by allowing these current tax rates that are low now \nto surge upward when they expire at the end of 2010. Do not put a 60-\nvote requirement to extend current rates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, if you want to gut pay-go this is your \nopportunity. This amendment would completely overturn the pay-go \ndiscipline. The pay-go discipline, as all Members know, says: If you \nare going to have new mandatory spending, you have got to pay for it. \nIf you want more tax cuts, you are going to have to offset them.\n  This amendment would completely strip all of the points of order that \nexist under the pay-go discipline. This would be a return to deficits \nand debt as far as the eye can see at the worst possible time, just \nbefore the baby boomers retire.\n  This is a critical and defining amendment. I urge my colleagues to \nvote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 466, as modified, offered by the Senator from Alabama. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) \nand the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, on the Ensign amendment No. 476.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, this amendment is very simply a Defense \nfirewall amendment. We have had these in the past. The chairman of the \nBudget Committee will argue that they did not work very effectively in \nthe past. I would disagree. It made it more difficult to take money out \nof Defense and to spend it on other programs.\n  Our amendment is a little different. It says if you are going to take \nmoney out of Defense for social spending programs, then you must do it \nduring the budget process. It brings transparency into the budget \nprocess. In the last several years, folks have taken money out of the \nDefense Department during the appropriations process, put it in other \nsocial spending, and then during the emergency supplemental process \nthey backfill the Defense Department. This has cost our country an \nextra $84 billion over the last 5 years. The problem is the money gets \nbuilt into the baseline, which costs more money and more money and more \nmoney every year; last year alone it was $40 billion.\n  If you want to be fiscally responsible, you should vote for this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President and colleagues, I think this amendment is \nwell intended.\n  I believe it will actually make the situation worse with these \ndefense firewalls. What it means is that supposedly we are walling off \nnondefense money and defense money. But here is what is happening. We \nhave had these firewalls in the past. Before we had them, we had three \nmedical research earmarks in the defense budget. This is what happened \nafter defense firewalls. Here are the number of earmarks in the defense \nbudget for medical research. Does anybody believe we are better off \ndoing medical research at the Department of the Army rather than at the \nNational Institutes of Health? That is what this amendment is about. It \nwill be a mistake to adopt this amendment. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 476.

Madam President, this amendment is almost identical to \nthe language that was included in the fiscal year 2003 budget \nresolution Chairman Conrad authored. There are many reasons for this \namendment, but basically the amendment says that just\n\n[[Page S3506]]\n\nbecause we have been spending the Social Security surplus for decades \ndoes not mean we should continue to do so. That is why we have made a \nbudget point of order against continued spending of it.\n  We have dug ourselves into a big ditch. The budget before us just \nkeeps on digging. My amendment says: Stop digging. It forces Congress \nto make a plan to protect the Social Security surplus.\n  I urge my colleagues to think about the future Social Security \nretirees and support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, this is a happy moment. We can all vote \nfor this amendment. This is an amendment I offered a number of years \nago. I wish it would have passed then and been in effect because we \ncould have avoided some of the unpleasantness that has followed in \ntaking Social Security funds and using them for other purposes.\n  There is no reason not to support this amendment tonight to try to \nonce again impose the discipline that has been lacking, to prevent \nSocial Security funds from being used to pay other bills.\n  So I welcome colleagues voting for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Senator \nAlexander and I and many other Senators are cosponsoring this \namendment. It is to make room in this budget so we can fund what the \nPresident has requested in the various agencies that are essential to \nkeeping this country competitive.\n  It is to allow the provisions of the America COMPETES Act, which \nSenators Reid and McConnell earlier introduced, to actually be funded \nlater this year, if we can do that in the appropriations process. I \nyield the remainder of my 1 minute to Senator Alexander and urge all \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. \nHe is precisely correct. This is an amendment to help America keep its \nbrain power managed so we can keep our good jobs. It is necessary to \nmake room in the budget for the amount of money President Bush \nrecommended in connection with legislation that Senator Reid and \nSenator McConnell have introduced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my amendment is cosponsored by Senator \nCornyn, Senator Cantwell, and Senator Enzi. This is an amendment that \nalso has sponsors of bills to legislatively produce the same result: \nSenators Alexander, Ensign, Cornyn, Enzi, Corker, Martinez, Stevens, \nThune, Bill Nelson, Cantwell, Murray, and Reid. This is an amendment \nthat would extend the sales tax deduction in Federal income taxes for \nthe period of this budget. This would perpetuate the law that is today \nbut which expires at the end of this year. It is fully offset with the \n920 budget function allowances. It would cost $13 billion over the 5-\nyear period, and this account will absorb that loss.\n  My amendment provides for the extension of the sales tax deduction \nfor States that do not have an income tax. It is an issue of fairness. \nWe have fought for this since 1986, until 2004, when we corrected the \ninequity. I hope we will be able to correct this inequity on a \npermanent basis.\n  State and local governments have various options for raising \nrevenues. Some levy income taxes, some use sales taxes, and some do \nboth. Citizens of States that levy income taxes have long been able to \noffset some of what they pay by deducting their State income tax on \ntheir Federal tax returns. In essence, we are not making people pay \ntaxes on their taxes, which is fair.\n  Before 1986, all taxpayers had that capability, whether they were \ntaxed with sales taxes or income taxes. From 1986 until 2004, the \nresidents of States that didn't have a State income tax but had a sales \ntax were not allowed to deduct their State's revenue mechanism, thereby \npenalizing them because of their State's choice to collect revenues \nthrough sales taxes.\n  Eight States--Washington, Nevada, Wyoming, South Dakota, Alaska, \nFlorida, Tennessee, and Texas--have been penalized in those years for \nexercising their independence in choosing their method of collecting \ntaxes. It was unfair.\n  Congress rectified this unequal treatment when we passed the America \nJobs Creation Act of 2004, providing taxpayers with the option of using \nthe sales tax for their deduction or the income tax. If someone lives \nin an income tax State, they can also choose the sales tax instead of \ntheir income tax deduction, so it is a benefit for every taxpayer in \nAmerica to have this option. But it especially affects these eight \nStates that have no option, without the ability to deduct their sales \ntaxes. Why should they have to pay taxes on their taxes, when people \nwho pay income taxes do not? Of course, they should not.\n  A family of four in Texas that itemizes will save $310 a year in \nFederal income taxes, on average. This deduction, which we extended \nthrough this year, 2007, will expire if we don't provide for this \nextension in the budget.\n  Sales tax deductibility is not only an issue of fundamental tax \nfairness but is also an economic stimulus. It can create jobs in the \nStates, where lowering taxes does make a difference in the investments \nbusinesses make, which does create new jobs. Fifty-five million \nAmericans live in States which do not have income taxes but which have \nhefty sales taxes. Last Congress, three-fourths of this body voted \noverwhelmingly to make the sales tax deduction permanent.\n  My amendment is fully paid for through reductions in waste, fraud, \nand abuse. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so we can \nhave equity for all of our citizens and options for all of our citizens \nto choose which of the State and local taxes they would prefer to \ndeduct.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I may inquire of the Senator, for \nclarification purposes on her amendment, the amendment, as I understand \nit, on sales tax deductibility--what is the cost of that amendment?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It is $13 billion over 5 years.\n  Mr. CONRAD. As I understand it, the Senator funds it out of section \n920.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would it be out of the mandatory side of 920 or the \ndiscretionary side?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The discretionary side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me say to colleagues that while I have great sympathy \nfor the purposes of the Senator's amendment, the funding source gives \nme substantial heartburn. Let me explain why, if I may. The \ndiscretionary side would include things such as law enforcement and \nveterans. We already have, out of section 920, between $7.5 billion and \n$8 billion taken from that pot. The problem with taking another $13 \nbillion is it goes into an area where we don't have the resources in \nterms of this magnitude.\n  Let me say why that is the case. The President just sent up a message \nidentifying $7.5 billion in this area that could be cut. Congress, in a \nrecent legislative enactment, took out $6 billion. So we can probably \ndo some more out of 920 but, honestly, to take that additional amount \nout of 920 is going to have a real impact on these discretionary \naccounts that it affects--veterans, law enforcement, parks, and all the \nrest.\n  So I am going to be compelled to resist this amendment, not because I \ndon't favor the basic objective the Senator is trying to accomplish, \nwhich is entirely reasonable, but the pay-for presents a problem to \nthis budget. That would take us well over $20 billion out of section \n920, and I don't think there are sufficient resources there to \naccommodate that amount.\n  I want to give colleagues a heads up, and perhaps overnight we can \nfind some other way. Perhaps we can work together and see if there is \nanother way to fund it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate what the distinguished \nchairman of the committee has said. Let me say three things: First, I \nwould be happy to work with the chairman to find another offset that \nwould be acceptable, because I certainly want it to be offset, and I \nthink the basic fairness of treating every taxpayer in America fairly \nis one we should absolutely adhere to. I cannot imagine that we would \ngo forward next year and put eight States at such a disadvantage. So I \nwant to work with the chairman.\n  The second point is it doesn't have to be discretionary. The reason I \nsaid discretionary--and it is not in the amendment that it would be \ndiscretionary, and perhaps we can work in another area of spending that \nwould be acceptable. The reason I chose discretionary is my third \npoint, which is the OMB rating analysis--the PART assessment--working \nwith that PART assessment, Senator Allard said there was $88 billion in \nprogram spending that was rated as ``ineffective'' over the next 5-year \nperiod. So I thought the $88 billion provided plenty of leeway for \nprograms that were not fully operational to use what they have in the \nbudget.\n\n[[Page S3508]]\n\n  I don't think anyone would take from the veterans account, of course, \nbecause we have increased the veterans amount to make sure that \nveterans' health care is fully covered. I am the ranking member of the \nVeterans Appropriations Committee and I added $1.5 billion in emergency \nfunding last year to assure that the veterans accounts would be fully \nfunded. In the rating analysis of OMB, there are other funds that \ncannot fully utilize their line items and, therefore, I think there \nwould be leeway in this discretionary account.\n  I would be pleased to work with the chairman. I hope we can provide \nfor this in the budget, because I think we have to treat every American \ntaxpayer fairly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                           Campaign Financing\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, imagine a President coming before a joint \nsession of Congress and using his bully pulpit to call for a \nfundamental change in the way we fund political campaigns in America. \nImagine a President saying we need to buy back our democracy by \nreplacing special-interest-funded elections with publicly funded \nelections.\n  As hard as it may be to believe, that happened. An American President \ndid say that--100 years ago. His name was Teddy Roosevelt, and his call \nfor public financing of campaigns was the cornerstone of his 1907 State \nof the Union Address.\n  I know the Senate moves slowly, but a century is long enough to wait. \nCongress can pass all the lobbying and ethics reforms we want, but we \nwon't get to the heart of the problem when it comes to the confidence \nof the American public until we address the issue of campaign \nfinancing. Special interest money and influence will always find new \nloopholes, until we change this political system fundamentally.\n  Just yesterday, Senator Specter and I introduced a plan to do that. \nIt is called the Fair Elections Now Act. Our bill will create a pool of \npublic, accountable funds that qualified Senate candidates can use to \nfund their campaigns in place of special interest dollars and dollars \nfrom wealthy donors. The program we propose is strictly voluntary, and \nit is consistent with our Constitution.\n  For years, I have always resisted the idea of public financing of \npolitical campaigns. I used to have this kind of quick response when \npeople asked me about public financing. It was a pretty good one. I \nused to say I don't want a dime of Federal taxpayer dollars going to \nsome racist such as David Duke running for office. It was a pretty good \nresponse, but frankly, as I reflect on it now, it ignores the obvious. \nFor every miscreant like David Duke, there are thousands of good men \nand women in both political parties who were forced into a system that \nis fundamentally corrupting.\n  The stakes right now are too high in America not to change. A lot of \npeople in America on both sides of the fence have a sneaky feeling that \nour democracy is in real trouble. No wonder. Look around at all the \nscandal and suspicion, the so-called ``culture of corruption.'' Take a \ngood look at the political money chase that consumes more of our time \nevery year. That is time a Senator and a Member of Congress doesn't \nhave to devote to being a Senator. We can use that time talking to \npeople we represent, people who might not have $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 \nto give to us but people who are even more important than those donors. \nThat is time we could use to study and try to solve some of the big \nchallenges facing this country, such as our reliance on foreign oil.\n\n  There are many good, honest people in politics, and this Senate is \nguided by the best of intentions, but we are stuck in a terrible, \ncorrupting system.\n  Take a look, if you will, at the cost of running Senate campaigns. \nThis chart is an indication of what we are up against. This is the \naverage spent by candidates in the 10 most expensive Senate races \nbetween 2002 and 2006. Mind you, this is the average of the 10 most \nexpensive races. Go back to 2002, and you see the number is somewhere \nshort of $20 million. Now go to 2004 and the number is up to $25 \nmillion. Now come to 2006 and the number happens to be $34 million. \nThat is $34 million on average spent by the 10 most expensive Senate \nraces by both candidates--$34 million, the average amount.\n  The cost of running for the Senate is out of control. To think that \nthe cost of running a Senate race between 2002 and 2006 in the 10 most \nexpensive races has more than doubled tells us this is unsustainable.\n  Let me show this chart as well. It is a little hard to read because \nthe charts are smaller. Here is another figure that is hard to imagine. \nIt takes a mountain of money to lose a Senate campaign today. On \naverage, to run and lose a campaign for the Senate costs $7 million. \nThat is to lose. That figure, too, has doubled since 2002. Who knows \nwhat it is going to cost in 2008.\n  These figures are the averages spent by winners and losers for the \nSenate in each of these years, and one can see from these charts what \nis happening. Losers, $7 million to lose a Senate race; those running \nand winning, $12 million.\n  Then take a look at the total amount spent in Senate races between \n2002 and 2006. We have now broken through the $500 million barrier. We \nare on our way to spending in total for about 33 races every election \n$1 billion. We are on our way there. There is no doubt we are going to \nhit that and soon. That is the reality of what it means to be elected \nto this important body.\n  The costs increase dramatically with every election. I am up for \nreelection in 2008. Candidates, if they are honest with you, will tell \nyou they spend too many waking moments worrying about raising money, \ngetting on the telephone, setting up fundraisers, traveling around the \ncountry, where good people--I thank them for helping me--are asked to \ngive contributions. It becomes a consuming passion because you \nunderstand you are going to need that money to be reelected.\n  Mr. President, do you know why I am raising money? I am raising money \nto create a trust fund in Illinois for television stations. That is \nright. I am begging money from everybody I can find in order to buy \ntelevision time next year. I need millions of dollars because the cost \nof television is soaring.\n  Take a look at the amount spent on political TV advertising. To give \nyou a notion, political ad spending in millions of dollars, starting in \n2002, $995 million; 2004, $1.6 billion; 2006, $1.7 billion; and 2008, I \ncan't even guess where that figure is going to go.\n  Does anyone think our democracy is stronger and healthier because of \nthis explosion in drive-by political TV ads? Have you ever met a voter \nwho said: You know what the problem is with political campaigns? They \nare just too darn short. We need longer campaigns; we need to see more \nof your ads. I have never heard that. But I have heard the opposite. I \nhave heard people beg for mercy: Are you going to have another week of \nthose television commercials going?\n  The candidates hate raising the money for it, the people hate \nwatching it, but the TV stations love it.\n  I visit TV stations in my State when it gets close to election time, \nand I meet with the managers. I met with one in downstate Illinois in \nthis last election cycle. Nice fellow. I have seen him in Washington a \nlot. He runs a nice little station downstate. He had this big smile on \nhis face.\n  I said: Things going OK here?\n  Yes, they sure are.\n  I said: Lots of political ads?\n  He said: Senator, I am the luckiest guy in southern Illinois. My TV \nstation plays into Missouri. You know what is going on. We may not have \na big Senate race in Illinois, but in Missouri, there is a big red hot \ncontest between an incumbent Senator and a challenger, and they are \nbuying every single minute I will sell them. To be honest with you, I \nhave no time to sell to other advertisers because these political \ncandidates are here.\n  Senators are spending more and more time each year when they are up \nfor reelection creating these trust funds for wealthy broadcasting \ncorporations instead of doing the work the voters sent us here to do. \nThis is not good for our democracy. Our democracy cannot afford to let \nthis system continue.\n\n  The plan Senator Specter and I have introduced is simple and \nconstitutional. In order to receive Fair Election funds, candidates \nfirst have to prove they are real candidates. It isn't enough to think \nyou are going to run; you have to have some support. People\n\n[[Page S3509]]\n\nhave to believe you are a real candidate. You prove that by, as a \ncandidate, collecting a minimum number of small contributions.\n  What does it mean? You have to be a fundraiser, and in my State of \nIllinois, it would mean you would have to have 11,500 $5 contributions. \nI think that a person who is not a serious candidate would have a tough \ntime raising 11,500 contributions in a State such as Illinois, but it \nis worth the effort because if you can raise that to prove you are a \nviable candidate, you can qualify for these funds to run your election \ncampaign.\n  What happens if you are running against a millionaire or a \nbillionaire? And believe me, a lot of political parties spend time \nsearching for these so-called self-funders, people who pay for their \nown campaigns. Or what if you get caught in the crosshairs of some \nshadowy attack group that has decided they are going to take you on by \nrunning ads against you? In that case, the candidate who has agreed to \nbe part of the Fair Elections financing can receive additional funds to \nlevel the playing field. All candidates who voluntarily agree to abide \nby Fair Elections rules will receive vouchers for free TV time and \ndiscounts on additional TV-radio time.\n  That is a major way in which our plan will help slow the explosive \ngrowth of campaign spending. The only thing the Fair Elections \ncandidates cannot do is accept private, special interest or big-donor \nfunds. With the exception of those 11,500 contributions of $5, you are \nnot in the fundraising business. Maybe a few startup funds, but by and \nlarge, the qualifying $5 contributions is the end of your campaign \nfundraising.\n  This is not a naive, idealistic, over-the-Moon theory. Some of the \nprograms are already working in Maine and Arizona. They were enacted by \npublic referenda. They went to the voters of those two States and said: \nDo you want a shorter, cleaner, and fairer campaign? And the voters \nsaid ``yes.''\n  They were enacted by public referenda, and they have been sustained \nthrough election cycles because they are producing shorter and better \ncampaigns. They are producing better debates in place of a terrible \navalanche of political ads that we see almost everywhere. Fair \nElections in Maine and Arizona are helping those States pass the kinds \nof reforms Americans want, such as affordable health care.\n  Fair Elections are bringing new faces and new ideas into politics. \nThey are helping level the playing field between incumbents and \nchallengers because we see, under this system, the incumbent Senator \ndoesn't get any more money than the challenger. They get the same \namount of money, fair play.\n  Some may wonder why Senator Specter and I would support a system that \nweakens the incumbent advantage. The answer is simple: We believe that \nAmerica needs a system that rewards candidates with the best ideas and \nprinciples, not just the person who is the most talented in raising \nspecial interest money.\n  Supporters of the current system who don't want to change say the \npublic will never support Fair Elections. They are wrong. Take a look \nat these polling results when it comes to the idea of public financing \nof elections. Support is increasing for the idea of public financing in \nFair Elections: Seventy-four percent of all voters support public \nfinancing in Fair Elections; 80 percent of Democrats, 65 percent of \nRepublicans, and 78 percent of Independents.\n  This is an idea whose time has clearly come. These are the results of \na national survey conducted for Common Cause and a group called Public \nCampaign. Three-quarters of Americans--Republicans and Democrats and \nIndependents--support Fair Elections and public financing. It cuts \nacross party lines, regional lines, and gender. Public financing will \nonly cost us a fraction of what the current system costs. Make no \nmistake, if you are listening to this and saying: Why in the world \nwould we want any tax dollars to go to campaigns, let them pay for it \nthemselves, the harsh reality is America pays for the way we fund our \ncampaigns.\n  We are sustained on both sides of the aisle. Unless you are a self-\nfunding millionaire, we are sustained by special interest groups and \nwealthy donors.\n  I ask for those contributions because I am not a wealthy person. I do \nmy best to come and vote my conscience, but the fact is, there is \nalways a suspicion that when I cast a vote, it is because I received a \ncontribution.\n  How much will it cost? About $1.4 billion a year, $2.8 billion per \nelection cycle. About as much as we spend in 1 week on the war in Iraq \nis the amount it would cost us to publicly fund all House and Senate \ncampaigns.\n  People who say the public shouldn't have to pay for elections miss \nthe point. We are already paying for them in the hidden ways that favor \nincumbents and special interests. We pay when special interests are \nallowed to literally write their own bills. We pay every time a line is \nslipped into a bill anonymously, a big bill, behind closed doors giving \nsome well-connected corporation tens of millions of dollars in tax \nbreaks.\n  Fair Elections aren't just better than what we have now, ultimately \nthey are less expensive to the taxpayers.\n  It has been a century since Teddy Roosevelt challenged Congress to \nget to the heart of the problem and get the special interest money out \nof the public elections 100 years ago. The American people do \nunderstand what is at stake. They understand our democracy is in \ntrouble because special interests and big-donor money is choking the \nsystem and preventing us from facing up to the big challenges of our \ntime.\n  I wish to say for the record what I said on the floor before in the \nmidst of corruption and scandals: I want to make it clear, the \noverwhelming majority of men and women serving in Congress in both the \nHouse and Senate, those serving today and those I have served with over \nthe years, are honest, good people trying to do the best in public \nservice.\n  I am not suggesting otherwise, but the way we finance our campaigns \nis unfortunate, forcing many of us into compromising situations which \nare becoming increasingly difficult.\n  The American people are ready for Fair Elections. Fair Elections are \nalready at work in several States. After a century, it is time for the \nSenate to accept President Teddy Roosevelt's challenge: Buy back our \ndemocracy from big donors and special interests and make Fair Elections \nthe law of the land.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining under the previous \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Presiding Officer. I see another Senator on \nthe floor, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Chairman Kent \nConrad and his staff for the very hard work they have done in crafting \nthe important budget resolution that is before us. I know of their work \nbecause I am a member of that committee and have seen how much effort \nit has taken.\n  Mr. President, as you know, a budget is more than a long list of \nnumbers and this budget certainly has many numbers and it adds up to a \nhuge sum of money. But after all is said and done, a budget is a \nstatement about our values, about our priorities, and what we as a \nnation stand for. That is what a budget is about. In my view, the time \nis long overdue for the Congress in its budget to get its priorities \nright, and by that I mean to begin to stand up for the vast majority of \nour people--the middle class, the working families of this country--\nrather than just the large multinational corporations and the \nwealthiest people in our Nation who year after year have had their way \non budget initiatives.\n  Mr. President, when we analyze the merits of a Federal budget, we \nhave to begin by taking a very serious look at the economic reality \nwhich faces the American people. In other words, is the budget we are \nworking on now reflective of the needs of our people? Is that what we \nare doing?\n  On many occasions, members of the Bush administration have come \nbefore the Budget Committee, of which I am a member, and they have \ngiven us their view of how our economy is doing. I am astounded each \nand every time by their worldly view with regard to the budget. We have \nheard members of the administration telling us how wonderful the \neconomy is doing, how marvelous it is,\n\n[[Page S3510]]\n\nand how the economy is booming. I sit there, and I think millions of \nAmericans sit there, and they begin to scratch their heads and they \nsay: What world are these people living in?\n  I know that in my own State of Vermont, when we do town meetings, we \nalways talk about the economy; how well the middle class is doing. I \nalways ask people: How do you think the middle class is doing right \nnow--doing well, not so well? With very few exceptions, people tell me \nthat the middle class in this country, in the State of Vermont, in \ntheir own lives, that people are struggling economically to keep their \nheads above water. I find it hard to understand how people from the \nBush administration can come forward and tell us just how great the \neconomy is doing. I really wonder what world they are living in.\n  In my view, and I think the facts substantiate my view, the economic \nreality facing the vast majority of our working people is that the \nmiddle class is shrinking, that people today all over our country are \nworking longer hours for lower wages.\n  When I was a kid growing up, the expectation was that one person in a \nfamily--in those days, almost always the man--could work 40 hours a \nweek and earn enough money to pay the bills--one person, 40 hours a \nweek. How many middle-class families do we know today where one person \nis working 40 hours a week? The answer is, likely not very many. Most \nof the middle-class families we know are seeing husbands working very \nlong hours, wives working very long hours, and on occasion kids working \nto help save some money for college. In fact, at the end of the day, \nwhat we have to understand is that the American worker today is working \nlonger hours than the people of any other industrialized country. We \nsurpassed the Japanese a few years ago.\n  We also have to understand, when we talk about a shrinking middle \nclass, that many millions of American workers today are working longer \nhours for lower wages than used to be the case. In Vermont, and \nthroughout this country, in fact, parents are wondering why, despite a \nhuge increase in technology, despite huge growth in worker \nproductivity, there is a strong likelihood that for the first time in \nmodern American history our children will have a lower standard of \nliving than we do. The American dream has always been about parents \nworking hard with the hope that their kids, the next generation, will \ndo better than they have done. That was the case with my parents and in \nthe case of millions of families in this country.\n  Unfortunately, now we are in a situation unique in modern history \nwhere, unless we turn this economy around, what we will see is our \nchildren having a lower standard of living than we do.\n  I wonder how the Bush administration can tell us how great the \neconomy is doing when more than 5 million Americans have slipped into \npoverty since the President has been in office, including over 1 \nmillion children. That is not a booming economy.\n  How can the economy be doing well when median income for working-age \nfamilies has declined for 5 years in a row and when the personal \nsavings rate in this country now is below zero, something which has not \nhappened since the Great Depression?\n  How can our economy be doing well when almost 7 million Americans \nhave lost their health insurance since President Bush has been in \noffice and when, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 35 \nmillion Americans struggled to put food on the table last year and \nhunger in America is increasing? If hunger is increasing, that, to my \nmind, does not sound like a booming economy.\n  How can people talk about our economy doing so well when college \nstudents are graduating with about $20,000 in debt and some 400,000 \nqualified high school students don't go to college because they can't \nafford it? We all talk about education, education, education. Hundreds \nof thousands of young people cannot afford to go to college.\n  How can our economy be doing great when home foreclosures have \nskyrocketed to the highest level in nearly four decades, according to \nthe Mortgage Bankers Association, and when we have lost over 3 million \ngood-paying manufacturing jobs since President Bush has been in office?\n  How can our economy be doing so great when 3 million fewer American \nworkers have pension coverage today than when President Bush took \noffice, and half of private sector American workers have no pension \ncoverage whatsoever?\n  When the President of the United States and his administration tell \nus the economy is doing great, well, they are partially right. While \nthe economy is not doing well for the middle class or working families \nof our country, it is doing very well for the wealthiest people in \nAmerica. That is the truth.\n  Today, the wealthiest people in our country are becoming much \nwealthier. In fact, they have not had it so good since the 1920s. That \nis the reality. The middle class is shrinking, poverty is increasing, \nthe people at the top have never had it so good since the 1920s, and we \nhave, as a nation, the dubious distinction of now having, by far, the \nwidest gap between the rich and the poor of any major country on earth.\n  Today, the upper 1 percent of families in America have not had it so \ngood since the 1920s. According to Forbes Magazine, the collective net \nworth of the wealthiest 400 Americans increased by $120 billion last \nyear to $1.25 trillion. The 400 wealthiest Americans are now worth \n$1.25 trillion at the same time that hunger in America is increasing \nand 5 million more of our citizens have slipped into poverty.\n  I have given this broad overview of the economy in order to place the \ndiscussion of our budget in what I think is a sensible context; that \nis, if the wealthiest people in America are becoming wealthier while \nthe middle class is shrinking and poverty is increasing, what the \nbudget should be about is responding to that reality. That is the \nreality to which the budget should be responding.\n  The President of the United States, in his budget proposal, told us \nwhat he thought. He said in his budget that, despite the growing health \ncare crisis in our country, he was going to cut Medicare and Medicaid \nby $280 billion over the next decade and that he was going to \ninadequately fund the Children's Health Insurance Program. Today, the \nUnited States is the only nation in the industrialized world that does \nnot guarantee health care to all its people. We have millions and \nmillions of children who have no health insurance, and this President \nrefuses to adequately fund the health insurance program for children.\n  Despite the reality that we have 23,000 wounded coming home from Iraq \nand tens of thousands more who will be coming home with post-traumatic \nstress disorder or traumatic brain injury, the President, in his \nbudget, once again inadequately funded the needs of our veterans, as he \nhas done year after year. In fact, since President Bush has been in \noffice, an estimated 1 million veterans have been denied access to \nhealth services at the VA.\n  Despite a horrendous crisis in childcare access and affordability for \nworking families, so that all over this country working people are \ndesperately trying to locate quality, affordable childcare while they \nare at work, the President, in his budget, reduced the number of \nchildren receiving childcare assistance by 300,000 and he cut funding \nfor the Head Start Program.\n  Despite millions of homeowners paying outrageously high property \ntaxes, the President has, in his budget, further retreated from the \nFederal commitment to special education and he has cut funding for that \nprogram. This will result in a lowering of the quality of education for \nall of our children, including those with disabilities, and an increase \nin property taxes. This is a very serious problem in my State of \nVermont, where towns are divided every March when they go over the \nbudget.\n  People understand the needs of the schools. They understand the high \ncost of mainstreaming kids with disabilities. Yet people cannot afford \nhigher and higher property taxes. We as a Congress have to fully fund \nspecial education and keep the commitment we have made to school \ndistricts all over this country. Yet the President, in his budget, cuts \nfunding for special education.\n  Interestingly enough, while cutting programs for the middle class and \nworking families of our country, while inadequately funding the needs \nof our veterans, of our children, and of our senior citizens, the \nPresident has\n\n[[Page S3511]]\n\nreached the conclusion in his budget that we do have enough money as a \ngovernment to provide enormous tax breaks to the wealthiest people in \nour society--$739 billion in tax cuts for households earning more than \n$1 million per year over the next decade. We can't fund the needs of \nour kids, the President wants to eliminate a wonderful nutrition \nprogram for low-income seniors, we can't fund special education, we \ndon't have enough money to put into sustainable energy, we can't take \ncare of our veterans--we just don't have enough money--but somehow the \nPresident did manage to find in his budget $739 billion in tax cuts for \nhouseholds earning more than $1 million per year over the next decade.\n  Part of the President's budget calls for a complete elimination of \nthe estate tax, a tax which now applies only to the wealthiest three-\ntenths of 1 percent of our population. The elimination of this tax \nwould provide an estimated $1 trillion in tax breaks for millionaires \nand billionaires between 2012 to 2021. One, just one multibillionaire \nfamily, the Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, would receive an \nestimated $32 billion in tax relief--for one family. But we just don't \nhave the money to take care of hundreds of thousands of veterans or our \nchildren or our seniors. Now, that may make sense to somebody, but that \nis not my sense of what moral values are about.\n  While the budget resolution, introduced by Chairman Kent Conrad, \nwhich we are debating now is far from perfect, it is much more \nresponsive to the needs of ordinary Americans than the President's. \nInstead of cutting back on the educational needs of this country, this \nbudget resolution provides over $6 billion more than the President's \nrequest for education, including significant increases for Pell grants, \nHead Start, title I, and special education.\n  Instead of cutting back on health care, this budget resolution \nprovides an increase of $2.8 billion over the President's request for \nhealth care, including strong funding for a program that I think is \nenormously important for rural America and that is Community Health \nCenters and the National Health Service. Instead of cutting back or \ninadequately funding the needs of our veterans, this budget resolution \nprovides over $3 billion in increases over the President's budget for \nour Nation's veterans--one of the priorities that I regard most \nimportant as a member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  But I think over the long run we can and must do much better in \nestablishing our budget priorities than this budget does. This budget \nis much better than President Bush's budget, but in my view we have a \nlong way to go to create a budget which responds to the needs of \nordinary Americans.\n  As an example of where I think we should be going as a nation in \nterms of our budget, last week I introduced the National Priorities Act \nwhich would expand the middle class, reduce the gap between the rich \nand the poor, and lower property taxes all over America as well as \nreduce the level of poverty. The basic premise of this legislation is \npretty simple: We raise $130 billion in new revenue by rescinding the \ntax breaks that President Bush gave to the most wealthy 1 percent.\n  I know a lot of my colleagues do not agree with me, but I think that \nat a time when we have a $8.5 trillion national debt, at a time when \nthe middle class is being squeezed, at a time when the wealthiest \npeople in our country have never had it so good, I believe that it is \ntime to rescind the Bush tax breaks that have been given to the \nwealthiest 1 percent.\n  What we also do is ask the Pentagon to take a hard look at their \nbudget and cut out the waste, the fraud, the unnecessary weapons \nsystems that currently exist. When you do that, you end up raising $130 \nbillion of new revenue. We propose that $30 billion go to deficit \nreduction and we propose the other $100 billion go to address the \nlongtime unmet needs of the middle class and working families of this \ncountry.\n  If as a nation we are serious about addressing the long neglected \nneeds of the working people of America and creating a more just \nsociety, we have to change our national priorities. The wealthiest \npeople in this country are doing just fine. They are doing really well. \nIt is time we pay attention to working families, to the middle class, \nto the people who are struggling.\n  I appreciate very much the hard work that Senator Conrad has done and \nI applaud his efforts. In the coming days I will be offering several \namendments that I think will make the budget bill a stronger bill. One \nof the amendments is pretty simple. I hear a whole lot on the floor of \nthe Senate about the need for deficit reduction, and I share that \nconcern. The fact that we have a $8.5 trillion national debt should be \nof concern to every Member of the Senate and every Member of the House. \nSo our proposal is going to be a pretty simple one--very simple.\n  What we are going to propose is that we rescind all of the tax breaks \ngiven to people who earn $100 million or more--a tiny fraction of 1 \npercent--and that we use those savings for deficit reduction. That is \nit. Pretty simple. If you are in favor of deficit reduction, I hope you \nwill support that amendment.\n  There is another amendment that we will also be offering. We have not \nworked out all the details but again what this amendment would do is \nrescind tax breaks for upper income people and use all of those savings \nto start the process of fully funding special education. All over \nAmerica, people are paying higher and higher property taxes. It is \ncertainly true in Vermont; it is certainly true in many States. The \nquestion is, Do we continue to maintain tax breaks for the most wealthy \npeople in this country while property taxes are soaring? I say no. I \nsay we lower property taxes, provide quality education for our kids \nincluding the kids with disabilities, and we do that by rescinding tax \nbreaks for the wealthiest people in this country.\n  I think we are making some progress in terms of the budget, the \nbudget before us today, far better than what the President presented to \nCongress. But we still have a long way to go. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport amendments which will strengthen the middle class and working \nfamilies of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, before I address the proposed funding for \nVA in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2008, I applaud Chairman \nConrad and his colleagues on the Budget Committee for their hard work \non this resolution. The measure before us today clearly reflects the \nright priorities and directions for our Nation.\n  For a number of years, I have made the case for the President to \ninclude funds for VA health care as part of the war supplemental \npackages he has submitted to Congress, and every year, my colleagues \nand I fought to get those funds included in the budget resolution to no \navail.\n  The pending budget resolution finally recognizes that caring for \nreturning service members and veterans is part of the cost of war and \nin turn proposes to fund VA health care appropriately for this effort.\n  Right now, a great deal of attention is being paid to the needs of \nour men and women in uniform--attention that Chairman Conrad, myself, \nand other Members of this Chamber have been talking about for quite \nsome time. I am proud to stand with Chairman Conrad in support of our \nservice members and veterans.\n  One of the harshest realities of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is \nthe number of service members who have sustained complex and multiple \ninjuries in combat.\n  In stark contrast to past conflicts, significant improvements in \nbattlefield medicine have enabled very seriously wounded service \nmembers to survive their injuries. Subsequently, these men and women \nare coming home with extraordinarily complex health care needs.\n  We know that right now, there have been 1,882 identified and \nregistered cases of service members who have suffered from traumatic \nbrain injuries, or TBI, alone. This does not include those who have \nsuffered from a milder form of this injury and may not even be aware of \nit. While TBI is becoming the signature wound of the current conflicts, \nmany of these soldiers also have been rendered blind or lost a limb as \na result of their injuries and the numbers of those who are coming back \nwith serious and multiple wounds continues to grow.\n  In recognition of the emerging medical and rehabilitative needs of \nveterans with traumatic brain and other\n\n[[Page S3512]]\n\ninjuries, Congress directed VA to establish specialized centers for \nrehabilitative care. VA's four lead Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers \nare essential to meeting the needs of the most severely injured \nveterans and their families.\n  In the budget before us today, Chairman Conrad and his colleagues \nhave provided over $300 million specifically for meeting the needs of \nthese veterans and service members who are in need of the comprehensive \nhealth care and rehabilitative services VA delivers through their \nPolytrauma Centers.\n\n  This level of funding will enable VA to conduct assessments and \nscreenings of troops for traumatic brain injury, provide veterans with \nintensive comprehensive TBI/polytrauma rehabilitation, and most \nimportantly, support intensive case management for veterans with TBI \nand other injuries when they return to their communities and continue \nthe rehabilitation process.\n  Recent reports by the VA inspector general and others have \nillustrated that case management is a key element in the process of \nassisting these veterans achieve the fullest possible recoveries. \nFunding VA so that it can provide the continuum of care needed by the \nmost severely injured service members is imperative if we are to truly \nfulfill our obligation to take care of our troops and veterans.\n  I am also very pleased that the budget resolution before us is making \na long-overdue investment in mental health care.\n  Studies published in some of the most prestigious journals have found \nthat a third of those seeking VA care are coming for mental health \nconcerns, including PTSD, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. We \ndo not know the full magnitude of this need, as many returning service \nmembers have yet to seek care from VA.\n  As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, my goal is to make \nsure that VA is doing everything possible to guarantee that each and \nevery veteran who needs mental health care--whether in North Dakota, \nVermont, or Hawaii--can receive that care.\n  I remind my colleagues that so much of the time, battle wounds \nmanifest themselves as invisible wounds--wounds which cannot be seen \nbut are every bit as devastating as physical wounds. PTSD affects not \nonly a veteran's mental status, it affects his or her physical well-\nbeing as well. It impacts the veteran's relationships, his or her \nability to work, and to interact in society. VA must catch readjustment \nissues early before they turn into full-blown PTSD, and this budget \nresolution would enable VA to take a serious approach towards making \nthis happen.\n  When we talk about the mental health needs of veterans, we cannot \ndeny the reality that substance abuse is prevalent among many veterans. \nWe know that many veterans with PTSD turn to drugs or alcohol in order \nto self-medicate. Yet the administration does not seem to want to be in \nthe business of helping veterans with substance abuse problems. VA used \nto provide an intensive month-long program to treat substance abuse. \nToday, most VA substance abuse programs run for 2 weeks--not nearly \nenough time to put a veteran truly on the road to recovery. Again, this \nbudget resolution provides funds for comprehensive inpatient substance \nabuse care. This is a very real investment in VA mental health care.\n  On the benefits side, the current claims inventory and the time it \ntakes to process a claim is unacceptable. Veterans deserve a timely and \naccurate response to their claims. It is obvious that Chairman Conrad \nagrees, as this budget resolution takes a major step toward responding \nto this very real problem by providing appropriate funding for VA to \nuse to employ additional claims adjudicators.\n  There are 30,000 more claims pending right now than last year this \ntime. This constitutes an 8 percent increase. As the veterans \npopulation continues to age and new veterans come home from Iraq and \nAfghanistan, this trend of increased claims will continue. Given that \nit takes nearly 2 years for a new VA employee to start fully \ncontributing to the bottom line, now is the time for new staff to be \nhired and trained to help reduce this caseload.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing \non the VA claims adjudication process. During the hearing, VA witnesses \ntestified to the nearly 400,000 ratings claims inventory and the 175 \ndays it takes to process a claim for benefits. We must insist that VA \nhave no more than 250,000 claims in the pipeline at once, and that it \ntake not more than 125 days to adjudicate a claim. VA clearly needs \nadditional resources to hire the employees needed to adjudicate claims \nin a timely manner, which this budget resolution certainly provides.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased with the investment in veterans \nprograms that is made in this budget resolution. I again commend \nChairman Conrad and the Budget Committee for sending the right message \nto our Nation's veterans--that we are honoring our commitment to them \nby making a real investment into their care. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport swift passage of the resolution before us today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/21/senate-section/article/S3512-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Mr. President, I rise to honor the centennial celebration \nof the Elko Area Chamber of Commerce, which will be held April 1. \nAlmost 100 years ago, 37 citizens and business owners gathered to form \nthe Elko Chamber. Their motto was progress, and their goal was to \nadvertise the many resources that Elko County had to offer. Today, the \nChamber claims more than 500 members, but their values are still the \nsame--economic diversification, continued prosperity, and forward \nprogress into the future.\n  During a recent celebration of the Elko Area Chamber of Commerce, \nboard members reminisced about the history of the chamber. They \ncertainly have many accomplishments to celebrate. One of the most \nsuccessful programs undertaken by the chamber has been their Chamber \nChecks Program. This effort has encouraged residents to shop at local \nbusinesses and kept more than $4 million in the community. The chamber \nalso took the lead in relocating the landmark Sherman Station more than \n60 miles to the heart of downtown Elko. Each part of the homestead was \ncarefully deconstructed and rebuilt by chamber members and volunteers. \nToday it serves as the home of the Elko Chamber.\n  Over the years, I have been privileged to work with the Elko Chamber \nand the Western Folklife Center to promote and honor cowboy poetry. \nThis rich tradition is an important part of Nevada's western heritage. \nEvery year, Elko hosts the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering, attracting \nvisitors from across the country. The event would not be possible \nwithout the dedication of many volunteers and community leaders, \nincluding the Elko Chamber.\n  The Elko Chamber of Commerce embodies the best principles of the \nresidents of northeastern Nevada. It is my great pleasure to honor \ntheir centennial celebration before the Senate. I am confident in the \ncontinued success of the Elko Chamber of Commerce, and I look forward \nto working with them for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/21/senate-section/article/S3512-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3512-S3513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS INVESTMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today in the United States of America \nthere are 47 million people who are without health insurance and 35 \nmillion Americans who are completely without access to the most basic \nhealth care services. As a result, in the richest country in the world, \n18,000 Americans die each year because their basic health care needs \nare not met. Despite the fact that we spend twice as much per person on \nhealth care than any other industrialized nation, Americans have a \nlower life expectancy and a higher infant mortality rate than Canada, \nJapan, and most of Europe.\n  We are also faced with an alarming dental care crisis in this \ncountry. The Surgeon General has reported that tooth decay has become \nthe single most common chronic childhood disease in this country--five \ntimes more common than asthma and seven times\n\n[[Page S3513]]\n\nmore common than hay fever. Surveys have also shown that dental \nproblems cause children to miss more than 51 million hours of school \nand adults to miss more than 164 million hours of work each year.\n  This health care and dental care crisis bears down particularly hard \non those who live in rural communities where there are few local health \ncare centers and patients must travel many miles to seek the care that \nthey need. Those living in inner-city neighborhoods also often have \ndifficulty receiving the care they need because they lack health \ninsurance and have no means to pay for regular doctors visits. As a \nresult, far too many Americans do not have a primary care doctor or \ndentist and do not seek preventative care.\n  This means the only time they see a doctor is when their situation \nhas become so advanced and so dire that they must seek treatment at a \nhospital emergency room. This is a result that is bad for patients, bad \nfor doctors, and bad for American taxpayers.\n  Providing underserved patients with better access to primary care \nwill allow doctors to catch problems before they become advanced and \nrequire invasive and expensive procedures. It will also, of course, \nbenefit the patient--in many cases saving their lives. Studies have \nshown that patients with a primary care provider are far more likely to \nreceive appropriate preventative care, need fewer prescription drugs, \nand spend less time in hospitals and emergency rooms.\n  The good news is that we have a program in this country that provides \nprimary health care services to those who need it most. Forty years \nago, Senator Kennedy had the foresight to author legislation creating \ncommunity-based health care centers that treat underserved patients. \nThese centers, now called Federally Qualified Health Centers or FQHCs, \nprovide high-quality primary health care for millions of Americans, \nregardless of their income.\n  In addition to treating those who have Medicare, Medicaid, and \nprivate insurance, FQHCs primarily serve those who have no health \ninsurance and charge fees on a sliding scale basis. That means that \nwhether you make $50,000 per year or $15,000 per year, you will be able \nto afford treatment. No one who walks into one of these centers is \nturned away because he or she lacks payment.\n  In addition to providing the quality care that patients expect to \nreceive when they visit their local doctor's office, these centers also \nmake sure that patients are able to afford the drugs they need by \nproviding them with significant discounts on their prescriptions. The \ncenters also provide critical dental and mental health care--often \noffering the only available services for those in need.\n  FQHCs provide primary, dental, and mental health care that is not \nonly high quality but also tailored to meet the needs of the local \ncommunity. In order to create an FQHC, Federal law requires not only \nthat there be substantial community input in the development of the \ncenter, but also that a majority of the members on the governing board \nof directors are actual users of the facility.\n  In other words, those who know the most about the needs of their \nlocal community are responsible for overseeing the centers. It is a \nmodel that has been highly successful throughout the country, including \nmy own State of Vermont, which has five of these health center \norganizations serving more than 10 percent of Vermont's population at \n18 different locations.\n  These community health care centers serve as the family doctor for 16 \nmillion Americans in more than 5,000 communities across the country. \nTheir success has been well documented with studies repeatedly showing \nthat these centers are a highly cost-effective method for ensuring that \nunderserved patients receive quality health care. In fact the Office of \nManagement and Budget has reported that FQHCs use Federal taxpayer \ndollars more efficiently than any other federally funded health care \nprogram. In addition, studies have found that FQHCs save the Medicaid \nProgram 30 percent or more in annual spending by providing preventative \ntreatment that reduces the need for specialty care referrals and \nhospital admissions.\n  There are not many issues on which President Bush and I agree, but \nthe importance of community health care centers is one area where we \nhave found some common ground. The success of this program has earned \nsupport and praise from the White House, as well as members of this \nbody on both sides of the aisle. With congressional support, over the \npast 5 years, nearly 900 underserved communities were able to establish \nor expand a health center, bringing the number of Americans served by \nthese centers to more than 5 million patients.\n  Unfortunately, during that same period more than 800 centers were \ndenied FQHC status, and the Federal funds that go with it, not because \nthey were not qualified but simply because there was not sufficient \nfunding to incorporate them. That is 800 communities throughout this \ncountry that are left desperately in need of the quality, low-cost \npreventative care that these centers provide.\n  Existing centers throughout this country are also in jeopardy. Over \nthe past 2 years, Federal grant support for these centers has been \nreduced, threatening their ability to serve all of those in need.\n  It is for that reason that I introduced a bill yesterday, along with \nSenator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, to increase Federal support for \ncommunity health centers over the next 8 years and ensure that millions \nof Americans living in medically underserved areas receive the care \nthey need. This legislation would start by authorizing a funding level \ncommensurate with our current need--an increase of $575 million for the \nupcoming year and increases between $400 and $600 million for the \nfollowing 7 years. That will provide enough resources to fund not only \nthe backlog of the 800 approved but unfunded health centers, but also \nfuture applicants who meet the criteria for FQHC status. It would also \nmake sure that existing centers are able to grow with the communities \nthat they serve by giving them annual funding increases that are \ncommensurate with the number of patients they serve and the increased \ncosts they incur.\n  This legislation would also correct the unfair and outdated system \nthese centers are forced to contend with for Medicare reimbursements. \nWhile health centers provide care to more than 1 million medically \nunderserved Medicare beneficiaries, their Medicare payments are subject \nto an arbitrary payment cap that was established in 1991 and adjusted \nonly marginally since. The result is more than $50 million in lost \nMedicare reimbursement funds that health centers now are forced to find \na way to subsidize. This legislation would eliminate the inaccurate \npayment cap and ensure that these centers are reimbursed fairly for the \ncare they provide to seniors and disabled patients.\n  Finally, this important legislation would also ensure that our \nNation's community health centers have the workforce they need by \nexpanding the National Health Service Corps. Currently, health centers \nrely on the National Health Service Corps for more than 20 percent of \ntheir physician workforce. Unfortunately, last year, health centers \nexperienced a 15 percent physician vacancy rate and a 19 percent \ndentist vacancy rate nationally. This legislation would more than \ndouble funding for the National Health Service Corps over the next 8 \nyears in order to train and send more primary care doctors and dentists \ninto rural and inner-city communities.\n  In the richest country in the world, no American should have to go \nwithout basic primary health care. Federally Qualified Health Centers \nserve as a lifeline for millions of low-income Americans, and we should \nbuild on their success by expanding this program for all those in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/21/senate-section/article/S3513-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3513-S3514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IDAHO'S PROUD WARRIORS\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure and is a \ntremendous honor to call attention to the brave and honorable soldiers \nof Company B, 1st Battalion, 183rd Aviation Army National Guard unit \nfrom Boise, ID. In a letter to Idaho Governor Butch Otter from \nLieutenant Colonel S.G. Fosdal, stationed at Forward Operating Base \nBermel in Afghanistan, Company B's highly respected and renowned \nreputation is made clear. The heroism displayed in support of Army \nspecial forces, Marine, and Afghan troops\n\n[[Page S3514]]\n\nalong the exceedingly dangerous and remote border between Afghanistan \nand Pakistan was remarkable, commendable, and in every way worthy of \nnote to this body. In a self-described ``unusual letter,'' Lieutenant \nColonel Fosdal praises the many accomplishments and reputation of \nCompany B, calling them ``proud warriors.'' I ask unanimous consent \nthat Lieutenant Colonel Fosdal's letter, as part of my statement, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Embedded Training Team 2-4,\n\n\n                                    3d Marine Division (Rein),\n\n                                        FPO AP, February 15, 2007.\n     Office of the Governor,\n     Boise, ID.\n       Governor Otter, I apologize for this somewhat unusual \n     letter, but I feel it's important to let you know about the \n     selfless courage and exceptional performance of one of \n     Idaho's National Guard units.\n       I'm currently deployed to a Forward Operating Base located \n     on the Afghanistan's border with Pakistan. Our mission is to \n     mentor the Afghan National Army battalion responsible for the \n     Bermel District of Pakistan Province in one of Afghanistan's \n     most restive and remote regions. Within days of our arrival \n     last October we found ourselves in a 4-hour running gun fight \n     through the mountains in response to an insurgent attack on \n     an American convoy. We had less than a full company of Afghan \n     soldiers but managed a significant victory largely due to the \n     brave men of Company B, 1st BN, 183rd Aviation out of Boise, \n     Idaho. Despite heavy ground fire and a chaotic battlefield \n     they provided precise and timely fires against the enemy, \n     killing many and saving the lives of Afghans and U.S. forces \n     alike. On November 7th we found ourselves in another serious \n     fight, this time with a wounded Marine and Afghan soldiers \n     pinned down by enemy fire. Once again the men from Boise came \n     to our aide--staying on station and working with the Marines \n     on the ground to suppress the enemy and save the wounded. \n     Lesser men would have declared the area too dangerous and \n     flown away leaving us to fend for ourselves, but not Company \n     B. They stuck with the troops in the fight and as a direct \n     result of their heroic efforts a Marine is now at home with \n     his family, healing and thankful to be alive.\n       There were numerous other occasions when the Afghans were \n     apprehensive about venturing into steep valleys or mountain \n     passes. I only had to mention to the Afghan Commander that \n     the Apaches from Boise would be there and his response would \n     inevitably be, ``The helicopters that saved my life? We will \n     win then. Come, we go now.'' This respect did not stop with \n     the Afghans, the U.S. Army and Special Forces were also \n     imbued with confidence knowing that your unit had their back. \n     In my time on the border, I have not witnessed any other \n     single unit that had the amount of respect and whose mere \n     presence boosted morale like that of Company B.\n       Company B is now on its way back to Boise. I'm sure the \n     awards have been written, welcomes planned and everyone is \n     just eager to see their families and loved ones. I would only \n     ask that if you have the opportunity, please thank them and \n     let the citizens of Idaho know that they should be proud of \n     these brave warriors. As a state rich in natural resources I \n     thank you and the people of Idaho for sending your most \n     precious resource, its citizens, to serve here in \n     Afghanistan. I hope that you are as proud of them as I am for \n     having served along side them.\n           Thank you.\n                                                      S.G. Fosdal,\n                                                      LtCol, USMC.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. It makes me proud to hear fellow Idahoans described this \nway. Our military men and women from every State and territory continue \nto stand strong for freedom and uphold their solemn commitment to \n``support and defend the Constitution of the United States of \nAmerica.'' This is simply my opportunity to thank and pay deep respect \nto the men and women of Company B, part of Idaho's esteemed military \ntradition, current and past.

Mr. President, today Senator Lugar and I wish to recognize \nthe Indy Racing League, IRL, for its decision to use 100 percent \nethanol in its race cars and the impact that decision will have on \nethanol's viability as a major fuel source for Americans. With its \ndecision to use ethanol as the fuel for the IndyCar series, the IRL is \nleading the way to encourage greater public use of renewable fuels. If \nthe world's fastest cars can run on ethanol, then there is no doubt \nthat America's cars, trucks and SUVs can, too.\n  This year all of the IndyCars will race on 100 percent ethanol that \nis available right here in America--produced by American workers. With \nthis change, the corn harvested on farms across the country will power \nthe fastest cars in the world.\n  The ethanol that will power the IRL racecars will deliver the same \nhigh-performance capabilities that drivers rely on, only without \nharmful air pollution. It also represents an important step toward \nreducing America's dependence on foreign oil by providing a renewable \nenergy source grown in our own fields. By tapping the energy potential \nof America's farms, we can ensure a reliable domestic energy supply to \nmeet our Nation's needs, end our reliance on unstable countries like \nSaudi Arabia, Russia, and Venezuela, and create jobs for Hoosier \nfarmers.\n  This Saturday, March 24, millions of Americans and sports fans from \naround the world will not only watch the opening race of the IndyCar \nSeries and see first-hand the power of ethanol, but they will also \nwatch the future of American energy unfold at 220 miles per hour.\n  Reducing our dependence on foreign oil is one of the great challenges \nof this generation, and the IRL is playing a key role in this effort by \nhelping inform Americans about this important alternative fuel. Since \n1911, Indiana has been the center of the auto-racing world, setting the \nstandard in racing for drivers and fans alike. And now, the Indy Racing \nLeague is setting a new standard, this time for greater energy \nindependence.\n  Earlier this year, we introduced the DRIVE Act, legislation that is \nsupported by both Democrats and Republicans to reduce our dependence on \noil by 7 million barrels per day in 20 years--more than twice the \namount we currently import from the Middle East. It achieves this goal \nthrough a combination of steps, including increased use of ethanol, tax \ncredits for manufacturers to produce advanced diesels, hybrid, and \nplug-in hybrid vehicles, and greater funding for the research and \ndevelopment of energy efficient technologies.\n  We applaud the Indy Racing League for leading the way in this effort \nand, along with thousands of other Hoosiers, look forward to this \nyear's ethanol-powered races.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/21/senate-section/article/S3514-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3514-S3515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN MEMORY OF SENATOR THOMAS EAGLETON\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to add to the praise of \na great statesman and a great friend: Senator Thomas Eagleton of \nMissouri.\n  Those of us who knew Tom remember him as a man of nearly endless \ndrive and boundless energy. Those qualities carried him to a career in \nMissouri politics unmarked by a single defeat: the youngest St. Louis \ncircuit attorney, the youngest Missouri attorney general and Lieutenant \nGovernor, U.S. Senator at the age of 39.\n  Tom spent his political career, as his hometown paper put it, as ``a \nforce of nature. He worked crowds with a fervor, sweating like a mill \nworker, chain-smoking Pall Malls, shaking hands, trading insults, \ntelling jokes, remembering names and pet causes.'' As he conceded \nhimself, ``I campaigned myself right into the hospital.''\n  Thankfully, Tom emerged to serve as one of the most eloquent liberal \nvoices in Congress. His achievements should make his constituents proud \nand his fellow Senators a little envious.\n  He was crucial to the enactment of the Clean Air Act and the Clean \nWater Act, legislation that still forms the backbone of our \nenvironmental defense today.\n  Tom sponsored the amendment that ended American bombing of Cambodia \nand helped bring an end to the Vietnam war.\n  He was a longtime opponent of unchecked Presidential powers to wage \nwar; and I am sure I speak for many of my colleagues when I say that we \ncould sorely use his example and his counsel in the months ahead.\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\n  But fairly or not, news of Tom Eagleton's death brought many of us \nback to 2 tumultuous weeks in 1972.\n  Every piece of social progress has a melancholy side: the memory of \nthose born too soon to profit by it. The career of Senator Eagleton, \ndistinguished as it was, was just such a case.\n  Today we recognize depression as a physical illness, as treatable as \nan ulcer. But in 1972, when Tom Eagleton ran on the Democratic ticket, \nit was a mark of shame. Exposure of his psychiatric hospitalization \ncost him his place on that ticket, and part of me wishes he had had his \nchance in a slightly wiser time. What a difference it would have made \nfor our country.\n  ``If had it to do over again, I'd have kept him,'' said George \nMcGovern, the Democratic candidate that year. ``I didn't know anything \nabout mental illness. Nobody did.'' Thanks in part to Tom Eagleton, our \nknowledge today is much deeper.\n  We know, as Abraham Lincoln learned from his own experience more than \n160 years ago, that ``a tendency to melancholy is a misfortune, not a \nfault.'' And we know that it can be the dark obverse side of our \nbrightest virtues.\n  One memory of Tom stands out the clearest. We were in a meeting of \nDemocratic Senators, talking about the upcoming agenda. As we went \naround the room, each stood up to speak of some interests in our own \nStates. But Tom interrupted and gave an impassioned, impromptu speech \non the importance of representing the entire Nation. I wish someone \ntaped it; but whenever I am afraid my range of vision is narrowing, I \nremember Tom's words and remember his wide view of the common, national \ngood. To me, those words symbolize Tom's greatest strength, something \none of our colleagues called his ``moral passion.''\n  Those who knew Tom will remember that passion first of all, his \nguiding spirit for 77 years. Our thoughts are with his wife Barbara, \nhis entire family, and all those who looked up to this bold and \nsteadfast leader.\n  I shall miss a remarkable public man, but more personally, a \ndelightful, warm, loyal friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/21/senate-section/article/S3515-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL ROGER E. COMBS\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to honor and recognize the \nimmeasureable contributions MG Roger E. Combs has made to the U.S. \nMarine Corps, the U.S. Army, the National Guard Bureau, his family, and \na grateful nation.\n  When people talk about the ``Spirit of America'' and the people who \nhelped make this country great, all one really has to do is mention the \nname of GEN Roger Combs. General Combs has dedicated his life to \nserving his country both in the military and as a civilian. His \nexperiences, hard work, and honest counsel have gained him the respect \nof his peers and his community.\n  Born and raised on a small dairy farm in Stanberry, MO, to Ruby Fern \nand H.H. Combs, General Combs studied genetics and productive \nphysiology at the University of Missouri-Columbia. While he planned to \ngo into the family business and become a veterinarian, fate and the \nVietnam War intervened and he joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1968. \nGraduating with honors from the USMC Basic Officer's Infantry School \nand selected for the U.S. Army Rotary wing's flight school, General \nCombs served a combat tour as a CH-46 helicopter pilot from 1969 to \n1970 with HMM-364, ``The Purple Foxes'' at Marble Mountain Air \nFacility, Republic of Vietnam. Flying over 500 combat missions, he \nearned a Distinguished Flying Cross, two single mission air medals, and \n37 ``strick/flight awards.'' After returning from active duty in \nVietnam, General Combs served in many positions, including as an \noperations officer and aircraft maintenance officer with HMM-263 at \nMarine Corps Air Station, Quantico, VA.\n  General Combs' work in Missouri merits special recognition and is the \nreason I felt compelled to make a statement on his behalf in the \nCongressional Record. After leaving active duty in 1973, General Combs \njoined the Missouri Army National Guard and flew UH-1 ``Huey's'' with \nthe 635th Aviation Company, from Whiteman, AFB, MO. He transferred to \nthe Missouri Air National Guard in 1978 and later became the director \nof intelligence for the 139th Tactical Airlift Group in St. Joseph, MO. \nYet it was at the Missouri Air National Guard Headquarters in St. \nJoseph, MO that General Combs become nationally recognized for his \nexpertise in developing long-range strategic planning. As first a \nplanner, then general officer and member of the Air Reserve Forces \nPolicy Committee, General Combs was instrumental in analyzing the \nfuture needs of the National Guard and advising senior policy makers on \nthe best course of action.\n  General Combs' footprint extended outside of the military. Upon his \nreturn to Missouri after serving in Vietnam, Combs returned to law \nschool at the University of Missouri and upon graduation became a \npartner in a law firm, a prosecuting attorney, and was elected a judge \nin 1990. This past December he retired from the bench and returned to \nbeing a part time prosecutor and general practitioner.\n  Perhaps the best measure of General Combs' legacy comes from those \nwho have worked along side him. ``Judge Combs,'' as he is \naffectionately known by his peers and military associates, is an \nexcellent lawyer and military strategist with impeccable character and \nintegrity. The ``Judge'' was effective in both the military and \njudicial branches in encouraging parties to seek arbitration and \ndispute resolution instead of litigation. One good friend and colleague \nrecalled that it was not only General ``Judge'' Combs, dry humor which \nendeared him to his peers but his sincere interest in caring and \nprotecting those who served under him. ``He goes to extraordinary links \nto ensure they are cared for, ``said one colleague.\n  I cannot conclude these remarks without commending the dedicated and \nloving support of General Combs' wife, Gloria, and his three children \nDavid, Matthew, and Susan. Married almost 35 years ago at Conaway Hall \nat Andrews Air Force Base, Gloria has remained General Combs' most \nloyal supporter and confidant.\n  General ``Judge'' Combs has led an extraordinary life in which he has \nanswered his Nation's call to duty and served courageously in war and \nadmirably from the bench. It is my hope and prayer that ``Judge'' Combs \nwill continue to thrive alongside Gloria in whatever endeavor he opts \nto pursue. If his former, and current, success is any indicator, I am \ncertain that the years ahead will be both fruitful and rewarding. God \nbless you, ``Judge'' and best wishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/21/senate-section/article/S3515-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3515-S3516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORY OF BOB HATTOY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, Senator Dianne Feinstein and \nI pay tribute to Bob Hattoy, a cherished friend and one of America's \nmost passionate warriors for the environment and human rights. We will \nmiss him dearly.\n  We first met Bob during his decade of service to the Sierra Club as \nits regional director for California and Nevada. He was an outspoken \nadvocate in the campaigns to protect our precious coast and desert, \nalways increasing awareness about threats to California's environment \nwith a unique mixture of inspiration and irreverence.\n  It was only fitting that he was tapped by then-Governor Bill Clinton \nto serve as his Presidential campaign's top environmental adviser. But \njust as he was set to join the campaign, Bob's doctor discovered a lump \nunder his arm that signaled his HIV had progressed.\n  His instinct was always to fight on, so between agonizing treatments, \nBob traveled the country relentlessly to speak out against AIDS.\n  Taking on this fight--both privately and publicly--was a remarkable \nchoice. But for those who were blessed to know him, it was not \nsurprising.\n  We will never forget the historic and moving address he gave at the \nDemocratic National Convention in 1992. The first openly gay American \nwith HIV/AIDS to speak at a political convention, Bob brought so many \nof us to tears and action by showing the real costs of AIDS and the \nreal meaning of courage.\n  He said that day: ``You see, I have AIDS. I could be an African-\nAmerican woman, a Latino man, a 10-year-old boy or girl. AIDS has many \nfaces. And\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\nAIDS knows no class or gender, race or religion, or sexual orientation. \n. . .''\n  Over the next 15 years, as many other activists moved on to other \nchallenges, Bob never gave up the battle to make sure America truly \nlived up to its ideals. Sometimes that meant working tirelessly to \nelect progressive candidates.\n  Sometimes it meant standing up and speaking out, whether it was \ntaking on a bureaucrat or a President. Most recently, it meant moving \nto Sacramento to devote more time to serving as president of \nCalifornia's Fish and Game Commission.\n  The last time we saw Bob was 2 months ago in Washington, DC, as we \nall celebrated the new majority in Congress and the historic election \nof Speaker  Nancy Pelosi.\n  If Bob was sick or struggling that day, he certainly didn't let on. \nHe wanted to reminisce about the past and toast the future with that \nsame larger than life personality that made him so special.\n  Now, as so many friends mourn his passing, we also celebrate his \nlife. We celebrate his candor and compassion, his sense of humor and \nsense of purpose, his ability to amuse and inspire us all. And we \ncelebrate his lasting legacy in the relationships he forged, the rights \nhe championed, and the natural resources he protected for generations \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/21/senate-section/article/S3516-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO TOM CARNEGIE\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I congratulate a legendary \nHoosier sports broadcaster, Tom Carnegie, on his retirement.\n  Born Carl Kenagy in Connecticut in 1919, he displayed an enormous \npassion for sports even as a child. When polio ended Carl's dream of \nplaying professional sports, he refocused his energy on building a \ncareer in broadcasting, which he launched in 1942 at WOWO in Fort \nWayne, IN. There, at the suggestion of his station manager, Carl \nadopted the name Tom Carnegie and used it throughout the remainder of \nhis remarkable career.\n  Tom came to Indianapolis in 1945 where he quickly made a name for \nhimself as the most recognizable voice in Indiana sports. In addition \nto his decades of work in radio, television and print, Tom announced \nthe Indiana State high school basketball championships for 24 years, \nco-founded the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 1962, and was \ninducted in the Hall of Fame in 1975.\n  Race fans from around the world have come to know Tom as the voice of \nthe Indianapolis Motor Speedway. A racing novice at the time, Tom began \nannouncing the Indianapolis 500 in 1946. Over the years, Tom's rich, \nbaritone voice called to millions of fans over the public address \nsystem as he announced 61 Indianapolis 500 races, 12 Allstate 400 at \nthe Brickyard races, and 6 United States Grand Prix races. He has also \nproduced two major film documentaries on racing.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to congratulate Tom on a remarkable \nlife of exciting achievements, and to recognize his wife D.J. for the \nrole she has played in his many accomplishments. I am hopeful that each \nof my colleague will join me in wishing Tom continuing success, good \nhealth, and happiness as he enjoys his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/21/senate-section/article/S3516-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 6:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 759.

A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of \n2002 to reauthorize the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education \nand Child Nutrition Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and \nChild Nutrition Program. I would like to thank Senator Dole for leading \nthis effort in the Senate with me.\n  This is a critical piece of legislation. The McGovern-Dole Program \nprovides healthy, nutritious meals to children living in some of the \nmost impoverished countries in the world. By combining food aid and \neducation, this program has a dramatic effect on the health and \ndevelopment of millions of young children each year.\n  I first became interested in this program in 2000 when I read an \neditorial written by former Senator George McGovern titled Lunch for \nAll Schoolchildren Is a Big Thing We Can Do. In that editorial, Senator \nMcGovern laid out his reasoning for an international school feeding \nprogram and left us all with a challenge by asking, ``is there any \nhigher purpose under the heaven than feeding all God's children the \nworld around?''\n  It was his work alongside Senator Bob Dole that inspired President \nClinton in 2000 to create the Global Food for Education Initiative \n(GFEI) pilot program and fund it at $300 million. Since then, funding \nfor the program has fluctuated but it has never again reached the level \nat which it started. Still, in a relatively short period of time, the \nMcGovern-Dole Program, as it appropriately came to be called after the \nexpiration of the GFEI pilot program, has benefited more than 26 \nmillion boys and girls in 41 countries around the world. Last year \nalone, the program served more than 2.5 million children living in a \ntotal of 15 countries, including Afghanistan, Senegal, Laos, Guinea-\nBissau, and Bolivia.\n  The program is a tremendous investment in the lives of the world's \nchildren. For just 19 cents per day, or 34 dollars per year, we are \nable to provide a healthy meal to a hungry child. This relatively \nmodest investment does more than provide a meal--it also creates an \nincentive for children to come to school and learn and for families to \ncontinue to send their child to school rather than to work in a field \nor a factory. This is especially important for young girls in \ndeveloping countries who are often not given the same educational \nopportunities as their male peers and therefore fall behind them in \nterms of literacy rates and educational attainment.\n  In its effect on girls, the McGovern-Dole Program has performed \nexceedingly well. Young girls who participate in the program have a 17 \npercent higher school attendance rate than similar girls who do not \nparticipate in school feeding programs. We know that educating young \ngirls is one of the most cost-effective methods of achieving \ndevelopment goals. Compared to similarly situated girls who haven't \ngone to school, young girls who have been given the opportunity to go \nto school tend to get married later in life, have fewer children, earn \nmore, and educate their children longer. It has a multiplier effect on \na range of development goals.\n  A healthy, nutritious meal gives all students a greater opportunity \nto take advantage of their learning environment. A stomach full of \nnutritious food has a significant effect on a child's academic \nperformance, enjoyment of learning, and overall health.\n  The United Nations estimates that there are 300 million chronically \nhungry school-age children around the world. We are falling far short \nof the need. When the American people provide our bountiful harvests to \nthe most vulnerable among us, the poorest school-age children around \nthe world, it represents the best of the American spirit.\n  For these reasons, I am happy to be introducing legislation to \nreauthorize the McGovern-Dole Program and increase the authorized level \nof funding in an incremental fashion up to the $300 million level at \nwhich it was first funded.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 946\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \nfunding for the establishment of a program on children and the media \nwithin the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to \nstudy the role and impact of electronic media in the development of \nchildren; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenators Brownback, Clinton, Durbin, and Casey, the Children and Media \nResearch Advancement Act, or CAMRA Act. This bill is identical to S. \n1902 that passed the Senate unanimously last year except that it houses \nour program at the National Institute of Child Health and Human \nDevelopment.\n  Children today live and develop in a world of media. Electronic \nmedia, including DVD's, video games, digital music, the Internet, \ntelevision, motion pictures, and cell phones, are now everywhere and \nunder constant change. Research needs to keep up with the technology, \nfrom its positive impacts such as language development in children with \ndelays, to possible adverse effects, from obesity to muscular-skeletal \ndisorders. The CAMRA Act supports exploration and analysis on the \nimpact of electronic media in children's and adolescents' development. \nBased on recommendations from a National Academy of Sciences panel, \nresearchers will look at both the positive and negative impacts on \nchildren's cognitive, social, emotional, physical and behavioral \ndevelopment.\n  Electronic media, in all its forms, influences and affects young \npeople. It has the potential to produce benefits and harms. Numerous \nstudies show increased aggressive behavior in children following \ninteraction with violent video games. We need to move research beyond \nthese studies to learn, for example, how new interactive technologies \ncan best support and enhance traditional learning while making certain \nthat these new technologies, and marketing increasingly targeted at \nchildren through these technologies, do not damage children's long-term \nhealth.\n  Televisions have been common in households for half a century and \ntelevision still dominates the total amount of time children devote to \nelectronic\n\n[[Page S3520]]\n\nmedia. One report links television viewing at an early age with later \nsymptoms that are common in children with attention deficit disorders. \nHowever, we don't know the direct relationship, if any. Does television \nviewing cause attention deficits, or do children who have attention \ndeficits find television viewing experiences more engaging than \nchildren who don't have attention problems? Or do parents of children \nwith attention disorders let them watch more television to encourage \nmore sitting and less hyperactive behavior? How will Internet \nexperiences, particularly those where children move rapidly across \ndifferent windows, influence attention patterns and attention problems? \nCan interactive media positively influence those with attention \ndeficits? Once again, we don't know the answers.\n  Does television cause autism? That's the title of a recent Cornell \nUniversity study showing a correlation between the alarming rising \nincidence of autism and increases in television viewing. Again, we \ndon't know the direct relationship, if it exists. If early television \nexposure does alter normal brain development, we need to understand \nthis to protect children in the future.\n  Half of the Nation's children live in homes with three or more \ntelevisions with access, in many cases, to hundreds of channels ranging \nfrom Fashion TV to Spike TV. The American Academy of Pediatrics \ndiscourages television watching for children under two, promoting \ninstead other activities, for example reading together and playing, for \nproper brain development. Yet three in five children under one year of \nage watch TV, or other screen media such as DVD players, for an average \nof one and one-third hours a day. For four to six year olds, these \nnumbers increase to 90 percent watching TV for an average of over two \nhours a day.\n  Young people over 8 years old use electronic media, on average, for \nover 6 hours each day. How does this investment of time affect \nchildren's physical development, their cognitive development, or their \nmoral values? Unfortunately, we still have very limited information \nabout how media, particularly the newer interactive media, affect \nchildren's development.\n  American advertisers spend $15 billion a year on marketing to \nchildren under 12, twice the amount from a decade ago. Most of the \nadvertising to kids is for candy, soda, cereal and fast food; and most \nof the food brands advertising to children on TV use branded websites \nto market to children online. These sites most often include online \ngames, access to the TV commercials, and encouragement for kids to \ncontact their peers about the products. Is this affecting the health of \nAmerica's children?\n  Consider our current national health crisis where about one in six \nchildren are overweight. The number of overweight children and \nteenagers in the U.S. has more than tripled over the last four decades. \nThe public, through Medicare and Medicaid, pays about $39 billion per \nyear for medical care relating to childhood and adult obesity. In 2000, \nthe Surgeon General estimated the total economic cost of obesity in the \nUnited States to be $117 billion. And the number of overweight children \ncontinues to increase.\n  Beyond the enormous medical costs come later health problems and \nperhaps reduced life expectancies. We think that media exposure is \npartly the cause of this epidemic. Is it? A recent 2007 study from the \nHarvard Medical School found that more time for three year olds in \nfront of a TV leads to more sugary drinks and calories. Is this true \nfor younger and older children? Is time spent viewing screens and its \naccompanying sedentary lifestyles contributing to childhood and \nadolescent obesity? Or is the constant bombardment of advertisements \nfor sugar-coated cereals, snack foods, and candy that pervade \nchildren's television advertisements the culprit? What will happen when \njunk food advertisements begin to pop-up on children's cell phones? How \ndo the newer online forms of ``stealth marketing'', such as food \nproducts packaged with computer games, affect children's and \nadolescents' consumption patterns? We have more questions than answers.\n  On another subject, many of us believe that our children are becoming \nincreasingly materialistic. Does exposure to commercial advertising and \nthe ``good life'' experienced by media characters partly explain \nmaterialistic attitudes? We're not sure. Recent research using brain-\nmapping techniques finds that an adult who sees images of desired \nproducts demonstrates patterns of brain activation that are typically \nassociated with reaching out with a hand. How does repeatedly seeing \nattractive products affect our children and their developing brains? As \nInternet access expands from the desktop computer to other devices, \nincluding televisions, what will happen when our children will be able \nto click on their television screen and go directly to sites that \nadvertise the products that they see in their favorite programs or use \ntheir cell phones to pay immediately for products marketed directly at \nthem? Exactly what kind of values are we cultivating in our children, \nand what role does exposure to media content play in the development of \nthose values?\n  We want no child left behind in the 21st century. Many of us believe \nthat time spent with computers is good for our children, teaching them \nthe skills that they will need for success in the 21st century. Are we \nright? How is time spent with computers different from time spent with \ntelevision? What are the underlying mechanisms that facilitate or \ndisrupt children's learning from these varying media? Can academic \ndevelopment be fostered by the use of interactive online programs \ndesigned to teach as they entertain?\n  In the first six years of life, Caucasian more so than African \nAmerican or Latino children have Internet access from their homes. Can \nour newer interactive media help ensure that no child is left behind, \nor will disparities in access result in leaving some behind and not \nothers?\n  Interactive computer programs may be of enormous benefits to English \nlanguage learners. In addition, electronic media can allow children \nwith disabilities to learn, discover, and interact with others in ways \nnot before possible. What are the best ways to help English language \nlearners and children with various disabilities learn?\n  The questions about how media affect the development of our children \nare clearly important, abundant, and complex. Unfortunately, the \nanswers to these questions are in short supply. Such gaps in our \nknowledge limit our ability to make informed decisions about media \npolicy.\n  We know that media are important. Over the years, we have held \nnumerous hearings in these chambers about how exposure to media \nviolence affects childhood aggression. We passed legislation such as \nthe Children's Television Act, which requires broadcasters to provide \neducational and informational television programs for children. Can we \ncultivate children's moral values through prosocial programs resulting \nfrom the Children's Television Act, that promote helping, sharing, and \ncooperating?\n  We acted to protect our children from unfair commercial practices by \npassing the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which provides \nsafeguards from exploitation for our youth as they explore the \nInternet. Yet the Internet is providing new and evolving ways to reach \nchildren with marketing, making our ability to protect our children all \nthe more difficult.\n  We worry about our children's inadvertent exposure to online \npornography and about how that kind of exposure may undermine their \nmoral values and standards of decency. In these halls of Congress, we \nacted to protect our children by passing the Communications Decency \nAct, the Child Online Protection Act, and the Children's Internet \nProtection Act to shield children from exposure to sexually explicit \nonline content that is deemed harmful to minors. While we all agree \nthat we need to protect our children from online pornography, we know \nvery little about how to address even the most practical of questions \nsuch as how to prevent children from falling prey to adult strangers \nwho approach them online.\n  To ensure that we are doing our very best for our children, the \nbehavioral and health recommendations and public policy decisions we \nmake should be based on objective scientific research. Yet no Federal \nresearch agency has responsibility for overseeing and setting a \ncoherent media research agenda that can guide these policy decisions. \nInstead, Federal agencies fund electronic media research in a piecemeal \nfashion,\n\n[[Page S3521]]\n\nresulting in a patch work of findings that often do not span \ndisciplines and address complex questions. We must do better than that.\n  The bill we are introducing today remedies this problem. The CAMRA \nAct will provide an overarching view of media effects by establishing a \nprogram devoted to Children and Media within the National Institute of \nChild Health and Human Development. This program of research, to be \nvetted by the National Academy of Sciences, will fund and energize a \ncoherent program of research that illuminates the role of media in \nchildren's cognitive, social, emotional, physical, and behavioral \ndevelopment. The research will cover all forms of electronic media and \nwill encourage research involving children of all ages--even babies and \ntoddlers. The bill also calls for a report to Congress about the \neffectiveness of this research program in filling this void in our \nknowledge. To accomplish these goals, we are authorizing $90 million \ndollars to be phased in gradually across the next five years. The cost \nto our budget is minimal and can well result in significant savings in \nother budget areas.\n  Our Nation values the positive, healthy development of our children. \nOur children live in the information age, and our country has one of \nthe most powerful and sophisticated technology systems in the world. \nWhile this system entertains them, it is not always harmless \nentertainment. Media have the potential to facilitate the healthy \ngrowth of our children. They also have the potential to harm. We have a \nstake in finding out exactly what that role is. We have a \nresponsibility to take action. Access to the knowledge that we need for \ninformed decision-making requires us to make an investment: an \ninvestment in research, an investment in and for our children, and an \ninvestment in our collective futures. The benefits to our youth and our \nNation's families are immeasurable.\n  By passing the Children and Media Research Advancement Act, we can \nadvance knowledge and enhance the constructive effects of media while \nminimizing the negative ones. We can make future media policies that \nare grounded in solid, scientific knowledge. We can be proactive, \nrather than reactive. In so doing, we build a better nation for our \nyouth, fostering the kinds of values that are the backbone of this \ngreat nation of ours, and we create a better foundation to guide future \nmedia policies about the digital experiences that pervade our \nchildren's daily lives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 948\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to develop and maintain an integrated system of \ncoastal and ocean observations for the Nation's coasts, oceans, and \nGreat Lakes, to improve warnings of tsunami, hurricanes, El Nino \nevents, and other natural hazards, to enhance homeland security, to \nsupport maritime operations, to improve management of coastal and \nmarine resources, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coastal and \nOcean Observation System Act of 2007. This bill will enhance our \nNation's existing ocean observation infrastructure and drastically \nimprove our understanding of the marine environment.\n  Oceans cover nearly three-quarters of the Earth's surface, and have \ngreat influence over our lives. They shape our weather and climate \nsystems, provide highways for international and domestic commerce, \nsustain rich living and non-living resources on which many of our \nlivelihoods are based, and provide our Nation over 95,000 miles of \nshoreline which is the backbone of tourist and recreational activities \nin many of our coastal States. Despite the constant, intricate \ninteraction between our lives on land and the natural systems of the \nocean, we know woefully little about the physical properties of the \noverwhelming majority of our planet. What lies over the horizon \nremains, by most accounts, a mystery.\n  And yet, the effects of those mysterious systems can be devastating. \nIn recent years, we have experienced first-hand the destruction the \nocean can\n\n[[Page S3522]]\n\nbring through disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita here in the \nUnited States, and the Indian Ocean tsunami felt in Indonesia and parts \nof Asia. We have the technology to monitor a wide range of ocean-based \nthreats, from destructive storms to quieter dangers such as harmful \nalgal blooms and manmade pollution. The purpose of this legislation is \nto put that technology to work predicting these threats more accurately \nand, when possible, mitigate their impacts.\n  This bipartisan, science-based bill would authorize the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, to coordinate an \ninteragency network of ocean observing and communication systems around \nour nation's coastlines. This system would collect instantaneous data \nand information on ocean conditions--such as temperature, wave height, \nwind speed, currents, dissolved oxygen, salinity, contaminants, and \nother variables--that are essential to marine science and resource \nmanagement and can be used to improve maritime transportation, safety, \nand commerce. Such data would improve both short-term forecasting that \ncan mitigate impacts of major disasters, and prediction and scientific \nanalysis of long-term ocean and climate trends.\n  My home State of Maine currently participates in an innovative \npartnership known as the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System, or \nGoMOOS. Launched in 2001, GoMOOS takes ocean and surface condition \nmeasurements on an hourly basis through a network of linked buoys. \nThese data are subsequently made available via the GoMOOS website to \nscientists, students, vessel captains, fishermen, and anyone else with \nan interest in our oceans. The system continues to expand, with the \n11th buoy in the system launched in December of 2006. The vast \ngeographical range and frequency of measurements has led to \nunprecedented developments in scientific analysis of ocean conditions \nin the Gulf of Maine. It has also contributed invaluable information to \nour region's assessments of fisheries, weather conditions, and \npredictions of other ocean phenomena.\n  Of course, the need to access this type of information is not limited \nto the Gulf of Maine. Similar observing systems have been developed in \nother coastal regions as well. Data from these various systems, \nhowever, are often incompatible with one another, making it difficult \nto compile, manage, process, and communicate data across networks. As a \nresult, these disparate systems may be unable to link their data and \ndevelop a comprehensive national picture of coastal and ocean \nconditions.\n  The Coastal and Ocean Observation System Act of 2007 would rectify \nthis situation by establishing, in cooperation with NOAA, an integrated \nsystem of ocean observing efforts. The bill would encourage creation of \nsystems in areas that do not currently have one in place or in \ndevelopment, enable the data from all systems to be integrated and \naccessible through a national network, and facilitate timely public \nwarnings of hazardous ocean conditions or events. Oversight of the \nprogram would be the responsibility of the National Ocean Research \nLeadership Council, a group comprised of the heads of fifteen Federal \nagencies that play roles in formulation of ocean policy. The Council \nwould establish an interagency partnership to plan and coordinate \nactivities, with NOAA serving as the lead Federal agency ensuring that \nthe national network effectively integrates, utilizes, and publicizes \nocean data to the benefit of the American public.\n  In June 2006, the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative, made up of \nmembers from the Pew Ocean Commission and the U.S. Commission on Ocean \nPolicy, presented to Congress a list of the ``top ten'' actions \nCongress should take to strengthen our ocean policy regime. One of \nthose priorities was ``enact legislation to authorize and fund the \nIntegrated Ocean Observing System.'' Ocean and coastal observations are \na cornerstone of sound marine science, management, and commerce. This \nbill will save lives by allowing seafarers to better monitor ocean \nconditions and providing timelier and more accurate predictions of \npotentially catastrophic weather and seismic phenomena. It will save \ntaxpayers' dollars by reducing the emergency spending that comes in the \nwake of unanticipated storms, and it will enhance the appreciation and \nunderstanding of our oceans and coastal regions to benefit all \nAmericans.\n  I am very proud to introduce this bill, and I would like to thank my \nco-sponsors, Senators Cantwell, Inouye, Stevens, Boxer, Cardin, Kerry, \nMenendez, Collins, Lautenberg, Lott, Feinstein, Nelson, and Murkowski \nfor contributing to this legislation and supporting this national \ninitiative. Of course, our current and expanding ocean observation and \ncommunication system would not be possible without the work of \ndedicated professionals in the ocean and coastal science, management, \nand research communities--they have taken the initiative to develop the \ngrassroots regional observation systems as well as contribute to this \nlegislation. Thanks to their ongoing efforts, ocean observations will \ncontinue to provide a tremendous service to the American public.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 950\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Coastal and Ocean \n     Observation System Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States Commission on Ocean Policy recommends \n     a national commitment to a sustained and integrated coastal \n     and ocean observing system and to coordinated research \n     programs which would provide vital information to assist the \n     Nation and the world in understanding, monitoring, and \n     predicting changes to the ocean and coastal resources and the \n     global climate system, enhancing homeland security, improving \n     weather and climate forecasts, strengthening management and \n     sustainable use of coastal and ocean resources, improving the \n     safety and efficiency of maritime operations, and mitigating \n     the impacts of marine hazards.\n       (2) The continuing and potentially devastating threat posed \n     by tsunami, hurricanes, storm surges, and other marine \n     hazards requires immediate implementation of strengthened \n     observation and communications, and data management systems \n     to provide timely detection, assessment, and warnings and to \n     support response strategies for the millions of people living \n     in coastal regions of the United States and throughout the \n     world.\n       (3) Safeguarding homeland security, conducting search and \n     rescue operations, responding to natural and manmade coastal \n     hazards (such as oil spills and harmful algal blooms), and \n     managing fisheries and other coastal activities each require \n     improved understanding and monitoring of the Nation's waters, \n     coastlines, ecosystems, and resources, including the ability \n     to provide rapid response teams with real-time environmental \n     conditions necessary for their work.\n       (4) The 95,000-mile coastline of the United States, \n     including the Great Lakes, is vital to the Nation's \n     prosperity, contributing over $117 billion to the national \n     economy in 2000, supporting jobs for more than 200 million \n     Americans, handling $700 billion in waterborne commerce, and \n     supporting commercial and sport fisheries valued at more than \n     $50 billion annually.\n       (5) Ensuring the effective implementation of National and \n     State programs to protect unique coastal and ocean habitats, \n     such as wetlands and coral reefs, and living marine resources \n     requires a sustained program of research and monitoring to \n     understand these natural systems and detect changes that \n     could jeopardize their long term viability.\n       (6) Many elements of a coastal and ocean observing system \n     are in place, but require national investment, consolidation, \n     completion, and integration among international, Federal, \n     regional, State, and local elements.\n       (7) In 2003, the United States led more than 50 nations in \n     affirming the vital importance of timely, reliable, long-term \n     global observations as a basis for sound decision-making, \n     recognizing the contribution of observation systems to meet \n     national, regional, and global needs, and calling for \n     strengthened cooperation and coordination in establishing a \n     Global Earth Observation System of Systems, of which an \n     integrated coastal and ocean observing system is an essential \n     part.\n       (8) Protocols and reporting for observations, measurements, \n     and other data collection for a coastal and ocean observing \n     system should be standardized to facilitate data use and \n     dissemination.\n       (9) Key variables, including temperature, salinity, sea \n     level, surface currents, and ocean color, should be collected \n     to address a variety of informational needs.\n\n[[Page S3523]]\n\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to establish an \n     integrated national system of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes \n     observing systems to address regional and national needs for \n     ocean information and to provide for--\n       (1) the planning, development, implementation, and \n     maintenance of an integrated coastal and ocean observing \n     system that provides data and information to sustain and \n     restore healthy marine, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems \n     and manage the resources they support, aid marine navigation \n     safety and national security, support economic development, \n     enable advances in scientific understanding of the oceans and \n     the Great Lakes, and strengthen science education and \n     communication;\n       (2) implementation of research, development, education, and \n     outreach programs to improve understanding of the marine \n     environment and achieve the full national benefits of an \n     integrated coastal and ocean observing system;\n       (3) implementation of a data, information management, and \n     modeling system required by all components of an integrated \n     coastal and ocean observing system and related research to \n     develop early warning systems to more effectively predict and \n     mitigate impacts of natural hazards, improve weather and \n     climate forecasts, conserve healthy and restore degraded \n     coastal ecosystems, and ensure usefulness of data and \n     information for users; and\n       (4) establishment of a network of regional associations to \n     operate and maintain regional coastal and ocean observing \n     systems to ensure fulfillment of national

Mr. President, I'm pleased to join Senator Snowe in \nintroducing the Coastal and Ocean Observation Systems Act of 2007, \nwhich will make needed improvements to our national and regional ocean \nobserving systems.\n  The Coastal and Ocean Observation Systems Act would establish a \nnational program to focus on national and international ocean observing \npriorities, and provide needed support for a network of regional \nassociations that already collect and manage information in ocean and \ncoastal areas across the nation.\n  Currently, most long term ocean observing and data collection is \ncarried out on a regional basis. While these regional ocean observing \nsystems provide valuable data, lack of coordination at the national \nlevel and a lack of sustained resources have limited their \neffectiveness for advancing a comprehensive understanding of our oceans \nand coasts. The Coastal and Ocean Observation Systems Act of 2007 would \nhelp to rectify this by organizing regional activities under a federal \ninteragency committee within NOAA.\n  Improving long-term ocean observing and monitoring is a key \nrecommendation of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and will provide \nthe information needed to restore and sustain healthy ocean and coastal \necosystems. Specifically, this bill would bolster the Nation's ability \nto observe and monitor ocean conditions in order to improve tsunami \nwarnings, better understand the impacts of climate change on the \noceans, track ocean conditions that could impact human health, improve \nhomeland security, and support maritime operations.\n  Fishermen and mariners rely on accurate forecasts of ocean conditions \nfor safety and navigation. An integrated ocean observing system would \nimprove these forecasts and will save lives at sea. Ocean observing \nwill also help authorities understand the link between ocean conditions \nand human health. For example, improved tracking of harmful algal \nblooms can minimize the risk of shellfish poisoning by warning people \nwhen the conditions exist that make harvesting shellfish dangerous.\n  An integrated ocean and coastal observing system will prove an \ninvaluable tool as we work to understand and overcome the challenges of \nclimate change. The ocean covers 70 percent of\n\n[[Page S3525]]\n\nthe globe and plays a critical role in regulating our climate. \nScientists are finding that the ocean environment is often the first of \nthe earth's ecosystems to display the impacts of climate change.\n  We've already detected some of these impacts, from ocean \nacidification's impacts on North Pacific food chains and coral reefs in \nthe tropics, to seasonal ocean dead zones that are forming off the \ncoast of Washington and Oregon. The effects of climate change will be \nfelt by our fishermen and coastal communities, and ocean observing will \ngive them the information they need to mitigate impacts.\n  As we seek a better understanding of our oceans and coasts and the \necosystems that form the basis of life for much of the Earth's \npopulation, an integrated ocean observing system. will be an essential \ninvestment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Webb):\n  S. 951. A bill to provide a waiver from sanctions under the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 for certain States, \nlocal educational agencies, and schools; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nmy Virginia Senate colleague, Senator Webb, related to the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. This legislation simply tries to hold certain schools \nharmless, for one year, from the sanction provisions under NCLB when \nsuch sanctions result solely because of bureaucratic problems with the \nimplementation of the law.\n  I am pleased to note that Congressman Tom Davis, Congressman Jim \nMoran, Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Congresswoman Davis, and Congressman \nRick Boucher have joined Senator Webb and me in introducing the same \nbill in the House of Representatives.\n  While I firmly believe that the goals behind NCLB are solid, there \nhave been some challenges with the regulatory implementation of this \nnew law, particularly in Virginia. Most recently, the Commonwealth of \nVirginia and the U.S. Department of Education have reached an impasse \nwith respect to how best to test students with limited English \nproficiency. While, at this moment, I do not cast blame for how we came \nto this impasse, the simple fact is that it could result in a number of \nschools in Virginia being sanctioned under the Federal law--not because \nour schools are underperforming, but rather as a consequence of \nbureaucracy. This is clearly not the intent of No Child Left Behind.\n  No Child Left Behind was intended to put in place a strong \naccountability system by which the Federal Government would receive \nfavorable results for the billions of Federal dollars it spends on \neducation. The law was structured to ensure that all students are \nincluded in States' accountability systems, and was designed to reward \nthose systems that achieve goals under the accountability system, and \nto sanction those that do not.\n  Regrettably, in my view, if legislation is not passed and signed into \nlaw that recognizes the unique situation faced in Virginia, and perhaps \nother States, then public schools in Virginia, and perhaps around the \ncountry, will be punished through no fault of their own.\n  Let me be more specific about what has occurred in my State. On June \n28, 2006, the Virginia Department of Education received notice from the \nU.S. Department of Education that the assessment that Virginia had used \nfor years to test certain limited English proficiency students would no \nlonger meet Federal requirements. The 2006-2007 academic school year \nstarted shortly thereafter, and, at that time, no alternative \nassessment had been approved.\n  On December 11, 2006, representatives from the Virginia Board of \nEducation and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction met with \nthe U.S. Department of Education officials to discuss a one-year \nextension, by which Virginia would be permitted to use the same \nassessment it had used in prior years for testing LEP students. On \nJanuary 4, 2007, the entire Virginia Congressional delegation sent a \nletter to Secretary Spellings supporting Virginia's request for a one-\nyear extension for using an alternative assessment for testing LEP \nstudents.\n  On January 29, 2007, Secretary Spellings wrote back to me denying \nVirginia's request. On February 8, 2007, Deputy Secretary Ray Simon \nwrote to Virginia clarifying that, while the previous test may not be \nused, another assessment is expected to obtain approval.\n  Well, today is March 21, 2007. To date, Virginia still does not have \nan approved alternative assessment, and our State assessments are \nscheduled to be given in less than a month. With no appropriate test \napproved for students to take this April, how can Virginia schools be \nexpected to meet federal standards? How can our State and schools \ndevelop, prepare for, and administer a new test when we are well past \nthe middle of the school year? Common sense begs for a reasonable \nsolution.\n  In the interim, several school divisions in Virginia have voted not \nto test the LEP students at all. In turn, the U.S. Department of \nEducation has threatened to withhold from Virginia millions of Federal \neducation dollars.\n  The legislation that we introduce today is designed to allow the \nparties involved to take a step back, develop an acceptable assessment, \nappropriately train and educate students on it, and allow the Virginia \neducational system to move forward without being sanctioned in a way \nthat is inconsistent with the NCLB Act.\n  This legislation accomplishes these goals by holding schools, local \neducation agencies, and States harmless for one year from the sanctions \nprovisions of NCLB if they meet certain criteria. Specifically a state \nmust: (1) have had one or more approved academic assessment plans for \nthe 2005-2006 school year; (2) have had one or more of such plans \nsubsequently held invalid by the Department of Education for the 2006-\n2007 school year; and (3) have the Governor of the State certify, in \nwriting, to the Secretary of Education that the State cannot \neffectively train its educators on a new or alternative assessment \nprior to the date the assessment is to be administered, and that the \nadministration of a new or alternative assessment is not in the best \ninterest of the public school system and the children the system \nserves.\n  This ``hold-harmless'' provision would only apply to those schools \nand school divisions that fail to meet the Federal standards solely \nbecause of these logistical problems.\n  Unlike other proposals that have recently been introduced with \nrespect to No Child Left Behind, this measure would not exempt states \nfrom accountability, nor exempt States, school districts and schools \nfrom the requirements of NCLB. Our bill simply calls for the suspension \nof penalties for one year for those schools and districts that, through \nno fault of their own, are being set up for potential failure because \nof bureaucratic logistical problems. This will give the Commonwealth of \nVirginia and the Federal Government ample time to address the testing \nsituation effectively for the 2007-2008 school year.\n  I would like to submit for the Record several letters expressing \nsupport for this legislation. The first letter is from Governor Kaine. \nThe second letter is from Dr. Billy Cannady, the Superintendent of \nPublic Instruction in Virginia; the third letter is from Dr. Mark \nEmblidge, President of the Virginia Board of Education; and the fourth \nletter is from the Virginia School Boards Association.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Commonwealth of Virginia,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                     Richmond, VA, March 20, 2007.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: I would like to thank you for taking a \n     leadership role in efforts to resolve some of the immediate \n     difficulties states and local educational agencies are facing \n     in implementing testing provisions of the No Child Left \n     Behind Act (NCLB). I strongly support your proposed \n     legislation to provide a waiver from sanctions under certain \n     circumstances for the current academic year.\n       As you know, Virginia takes the academic achievement of all \n     students and the accountability of all schools and school \n     divisions very seriously. Our accountability system\n\n[[Page S3526]]\n\n     predates NCLB by several years, and is widely recognized as \n     one of the best in the nation. Our standards are ranked #5 in \n     quality by the Fordham Institute, which also lists us as #1 \n     in achievement based primarily on NAEP scores. We were \n     recently named by Education Week as the state with the \n     highest ``chance for success'' index for children. In \n     achievement of Hispanic students, Virginia ranks number 2, 3 \n     and 4 nationally for percent of students proficient in 8th \n     grade mathematics, 8th grade science and 4th grade reading, \n     respectively.\n       Meanwhile, we are challenged by the short time frame \n     afforded us to revise our assessment practices for the \n     current year, given the decision this same year by the U.S. \n     Department of Education to hold our academic assessment plan \n     invalid. The proposed legislation would allow us and other \n     states in similar situations a more reasonable amount of time \n     to revise assessment practices.\n       I believe the role you propose for Governors to certify \n     that schools or local educational agencies meet the criteria \n     specified in the legislation is appropriate and practicable. \n     I applaud your thoughtful solution, and thank you for keeping \n     in mind the best interests of children, school divisions and \n     states as we continue to make progress in raising educational \n     achievement and closing achievement gaps.\n           Sincerely,\n     Timothy M. Kaine.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Commonwealth of Virginia,\n\n\n                                      Department of Education,\n\n                                     Richmond, VA, March 21, 2007.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: I strongly support your introduction \n     of legislation in the Senate of the United States on behalf \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia and other states that will \n     provide a waiver from sanctions of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 as a result of having an \n     approved 2005-2006 state assessment plan held invalid by the \n     U.S. Department of Education for the 2006-2007 school year. \n     The Commonwealth of Virginia meets all of the qualifying \n     criteria in the proposed legislation, and certain eligible \n     schools and school divisions will benefit from the hold \n     harmless waiver provision.\n       I sincerely appreciate the leadership you and other members \n     of Virginia's congressional delegation are providing in \n     seeking additional flexibility for states in implementing the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), otherwise \n     known as No Child Left Behind (NCLB). The Virginia Department \n     of Education remains committed to the goals of NCLB and \n     implementing the federal law with fidelity while advocating \n     for assessment policies based on research and sound practice.\n       The Department will provide the Governor with valid and \n     reliable data for certifying that the commonwealth, schools, \n     and school divisions meet the qualifying criteria in the \n     proposed legislation.\n       The Department of Education appreciates your continued \n     support. We are committed to moving all Virginia children \n     from competence to excellence. It is our hope that the \n     introduction of this legislation also will inform the \n     reauthorization process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Billy K.

John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: I am writing to express strong support \n     for your introduction of legislation in the Senate of the \n     United States on behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia and \n     other states seeking a waiver under the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 from certain sanctions and \n     financial penalties as a result of having had an approved \n     state academic assessment plan for 2005-2006 held invalid by \n     the U.S. Department of Education for the 2006-2007 school \n     year. We understand the proposed legislation will apply only \n     to states, local educational agencies, and schools if the \n     state meets the qualifying criteria identified in the \n     proposed legislation. The Commonwealth of Virginia meets all \n     of the qualifying criteria and will benefit from the \n     additional flexibility being proposed.\n       On behalf of the Virginia Board of Education, please accept \n     our gratitude for the leadership you are providing in \n     preventing sanctions to our state, schools, and school \n     divisions as a result of having to implement testing policies \n     that are not in the best interest of all the students we \n     serve. The legislation you are introducing in the Senate \n     reflects the growing impatience with the rigidity that has \n     characterized the U.S. Department of Education's \n     implementation of No Child Left Behind. This impatience is \n     most acute in states like Virginia with effective \n     accountability programs predating the federal law.\n       The achievements of Virginia's students and schools under \n     the Standards of Learning program have brought the \n     commonwealth national recognition as a model of successful \n     reform. I am grateful to you and the other members of \n     Virginia's congressional delegation for their efforts to \n     secure additional flexibility so our public schools can \n     implement NCLB in a manner that puts children first and \n     reflects sound instructional and assessment practices.\n       The Board of Education remains committed to the goals of \n     NCLB and holding schools accountable for closing achievement \n     gaps between minority and non-minority students while \n     improving teaching and learning for all children. This \n     commitment, which has made the commonwealth an acknowledged \n     leader in the implementation of standards-based reform, \n     includes accountability for student achievement and testing \n     policies based on research and sound practice.\n       The Board of Education appreciates your continued support \n     of the Standards of Learning accountability program. It is my \n     hope that the introduction of this legislation also will \n     inform the reauthorization process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mark E.

Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Subject: Support for Emergency Waiver Bill under No Child \n         Left Behind.\n\n       Dear Senator Warner: I write to express the support of the \n     Virginia School Boards Association on behalf of its members, \n     all 134 of Virginia's school boards for legislation you plan \n     to introduce this week, to grant relief from certain aspects \n     of No Child Left Behind. That legislation, which will be \n     effective for this year's testing cycle, acknowledges that \n     schools, school divisions, and states need time to develop \n     certain alternative assessments, field test them, and train \n     teachers to administer them, before the U.S. Department of \n     Education imposes onerous sanctions. It would provide the \n     additional time needed to develop assessments that work for \n     children, not only in Virginia, but across the United States.\n       On March 16, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Virginia \n     School Boards Association voted unanimously to support this \n     legislation. We stand ready to assist in any way in its \n     enactment into law in time for this year's testing cycle. \n     Finally, we thank you and your office for your steadfast \n     support of Virginia's 134 school boards, our teachers and \n     administrators and, most importantly, the 1.1 million \n     children we serve.\n       If you have any questions, please contact Frank E. Barham, \n     VSBA Executive Director.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Eddie H.

A bill to amend the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and \nExcellence in National Environmental and Native American Public Policy \nAct of 1992 to provide funds for training in tribal leadership, \nmanagement, and policy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that \nwould authorize the Native Nations Institute, NNI, for Leadership, \nManagement and Policy. Congressman Grijalva introduced similar \nlegislation in the House of Representatives last week.\n  In 2000, Congress reauthorized the Morris K. Udall Foundation, an \nindependent Federal agency established in 1992, to expand its \norganization by providing tribal governments with leadership and \nmanagement training services. In response, the Morris K. Udall \nFoundation founded the NNI to serve as a self-determination, self-\ngovernment and development resource to native nations. Over the past 5 \nyears, the NNI has operated in partnership with the University of \nArizona and the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development \nto provide practical leadership and management training as well as \npolicy analysis in a variety of fields for native people. Approximately \n1,700 individuals representing 250 tribes have attended training \nsessions at the Institute to date.\n  The Native Nations Institute performs an important role in upholding \nthe Nation's trust obligations to Native Americans by encouraging \ntribes to move towards self-governance and engaging them in nation \nbuilding. Although authorization for the NNI expired last year, popular \ndemand for its executive education services now exceeds the \norganization's resources. The bill I am introducing today would \nauthorize funding for the institute's programs for a period of 5 years \nbeginning in fiscal year 2008.\n  The Native Nations Institute for Leadership, Management and Policy is \nan organization of great importance for Native Americans. I urge my \ncolleagues to support passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n        Vitter, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Tester, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \n        Baucus, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 953. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to ensure \ncompetition in the rail industry, enable rail customers to obtain \nreliable rail service, and provide those customers with a reasonable \nprocess for challenging rate and service disputes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to join with \nmy colleagues Senators Craig, Dorgan, Vitter, Klobuchar, Tester, \nLandrieu, Crapo, Baucus, and Cantwell to introduce the Railroad \nCompetition and Service Improvement Act of 2007. This legislation \nstands for the very basic premise that businesses should serve their \ncustomers, and do so at reasonable rates.\n  This essential concept of capitalism is what our economy is based \nupon. Those ideas, plus promoting competition and protecting consumers, \nwere prime motivating factors when Congress in 1980 passed the Staggers \nAct. The Staggers Act provided a government agency--now the Surface \nTransportation Board (STB)--with the ability to prevent monopoly abuses \nof those shippers left ``captive'' to just one railroad, and to make \nsure that the railroads in competitive situations were able to operate \nin such a way that they could be profitable. Somewhere along the way \nthe part of the STB mandate calling on the agency to protect shippers, \nand by extension consumers, has been ignored, or at least subsumed into \nthe STB's fervor to see the railroads profitable.\n  And profitable they are. What is important for my colleagues to \nrecognize is that neither I nor any of my cosponsors want the railroads \nto fail. We want, and this country needs, a healthy freight rail \nindustry. From coal to chemicals to plastics to forest products to \ngrain and potatoes, America's shippers depend on the railroad industry \nto carry their products to customers across the country to keep our \neconomy moving.\n  What no member of Congress should want to see is a freight rail \nsystem dominated by four regional carriers whose business plans are \nbased on bleeding their captive customers dry. Meanwhile, these \ncompanies invest none of their profits in infrastructure expansion to \nhandle current traffic, much less the expected need in the decades to \ncome.\n  This is by no means the first time my colleagues have seen me \nintroduce legislation in this vein. In fact, this is at least the \neighth time that I have asked my colleagues to look into the problems \nin our freight rail network and to work with me to fix it. Businesses \nin my home State of West Virginia have been describing problems with \nthe railroads to since before I came to the Senate in 1985. Like \nbusinesses anywhere, West Virginia industries depend on efficient and \ndependable rail service at fair prices to move their products to \nmarket.\n  Well, what was a troubling situation 22 years ago for about 20 \npercent of rail shippers captive to the more than 40 Class I railroads \nthen is a nightmare now for hundreds of companies in almost every \nindustry and in virtually every part of the United States that are \nbeing underserved and overcharged by the five remaining Class I \nrailroads. I have worked for years in a bipartisan and regionally \ndiverse coalition of members of Congress to change a system that just \nis not working. Our goal is to improve the economic situation for rail \nshippers and retail shoppers. And, I hasten to add, we seek to \nstrengthen and improve the economic vitality of the Class I railroads, \nas well.\n  I am sure that my colleagues will hear from railroads that we are \n``re-regulating.'' My colleagues should carefully review our bill and \nfind where we would regulate anything that is not already regulated. \nThis is, of course, the point. The railroads have touted the success of \nthe deregulation, but what they fail to mention is that the Staggers \nAct never deregulated the railroads where shippers had no competitive \ntransportation options. The railroads can have all the opinions about \nour legislation that they want, but they are not entitled to their own \nset of facts.\n  What has happened while the railroads have consolidated and \nmischaracterized this effort on behalf of shippers? Shippers and end-\nuse consumers have paid increasingly high prices for electricity, food, \nmedicine, paper products; the chemicals to protect our water supply and \ncrops, and the basic ingredients of the plastics in many of the goods \nwe purchase. It was not supposed to be this way.\n  In 1980, when Congress passed the Staggers Act, it was seeking to \nrescue the railroads from a burdensome and counterproductive regulatory \nscheme overseen by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). In the \ndecades leading up to passage of the Staggers Act the freight rail \nsituation was bloated with unprofitable railroads forced to make un-\neconomic choices regarding track, routes, and countless other business \ndecisions. The Staggers Act was an attempt to let the marketplace \ncreate a more workable system. Where rail shippers were already captive \nto one railroad, the ICC was supposed to continue to protect shippers' \nrights and to require railroads to meet their responsibilities.\n  As the marketplace evolved, the ICC, and its successor agency the \nSTB, were supposed to make sure that railroad consolidation and \nindustry policy did not harm rail customers. The only reason the \nrailroads in 2007 can say that my colleagues and I are attempting to \n``re-regulate'' them is that the regulatory agencies charged with \nregulating them all along largely have abdicated their \nresponsibilities, and have been sadly ineffective on the rare occasion \nwhen they purport to be carrying out the part of their mission that \nincludes maintaining the advantages of competition.\n\n[[Page S3528]]\n\n  To the extent that the Staggers Act has been successful in fulfilling \nits promise, that success has been completely one-sided. Railroads are \nno longer struggling to be profitable. Neither are they struggling to \nserve their customers. The STB, which should be working to make the \nsystem work, is more of a problem than it is a solution. The only \nparties still struggling are the shippers, and our bill is designed to \nmake it a fair fight.\n  The title of our bill, the Railroad Competition and Service \nImprovement Act, really says it all. Cosponsors of this legislation \nseek a freight rail system envisioned in the drafting of the Staggers \nAct. We hope to remind the STB of its responsibilities, and give its \nenforcement the teeth successive Chairmen have told Congress the Board \nneeds.\n  As I have said, this legislation is about making capitalism work for \nall parties in the freight rail marketplace, not just for the monopoly \nrailroads. Shippers need Congress to remind the STB that good service \nat reasonable rates is not an outrageous demand. Congress must demand \nthat shippers that ask for a rate quote are given one. Unbelievably, \nthe STB's reading of the Staggers Act allows shippers no such right.\n  In addition to that most basic right of business negotiations, our \nlegislation would do the following: clarify and restate the STB's \nresponsibility to shall promote competition among rail carriers, as \nwell as requiring reasonable rates and dependable service in keeping \nwith the railroads' common carrier obligation; remove so-called ``paper \nbarriers,'' contractual restraints on short-line and regional railroads \nthat prevent them from providing improved service to shippers; modify \nthe rate challenge process, and implement real-world evidentiary \nstandards and burden of proof requirements; authorize STB to require \n``reciprocal switching,'' the transfer of traffic between railroads, \nwhere it is in the public interest; affirm the railroads' obligation to \nserve; cap filing fees for STB rate cases at the level of federal \ndistrict courts; allow Governors to petition the STB for declarations \nof ``areas of inadequate rail competition,'' with appropriate remedies; \ncreate position of Rail Customer Advocate in the Department of \nTransportation; and establish a system of ``final offer'' arbitration \nfor disputes over agriculture, forest product, and fertilizer \nshipments.\n  Solutions to these problems are long overdue. I commend to my \ncolleagues the Railroad Competition and Service Improvement Act as a \nset of common-sense solutions to unresolved problems that are putting \nAmerican competitiveness at risk.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce very \nimportant bipartisan legislation S. 953, the Railroad Competition and \nService Improvement Act of 2007. This bill will improve America's \nrailroad system by ensuring increased rail competition and enabling \nrail customers to obtain more reliable service. Today, I introduce S. \n953, the Railroad Competition and Service Improvement Act of 2007 along \nwith my colleagues Senators Rockefeller, Craig, Dorgan, Klobuchar, \nTester, Landrieu, Crapo, Baucus and Cantwell.\n  The lack of healthy competition in our national rail system is \nstifling rail customers from our petrochemical manufacturers to utility \nproviders to agriculture and forest product providers. The extreme \nprices these rail customers are charged and the service challenges they \nface have a direct impact on jobs and prices for consumers. We must \nreform our railroad system to foster more competition and provide \nrelief to consumers.\n  The Surface Transportation Board, which is supposed to oversee rail \npricing and practices, has not proactively addressed rail problems, and \ngovernment accountability reports have noted a lack of competition in \nthe railroad industry. The Railroad Competition and Service Improvement \nAct will direct STB to do its job and foster a free marketplace for our \nrail system by addressing the inadequacies in the rate reasonableness \nprocess of the STB and directing the STB to actively investigate and \nsuspend unreasonable practices.\n  I would like to share with you a bottlenecking example of how the \nlack of railroad competition impacts rail customers in Louisiana. The \ncity of Lafayette's electricity customers have faced $6 million or more \nannually in rate increases because of the lack of railroad competition. \nThe Rodemacher Plant that provides electricity to the Lafayette \nUtilities System gets its coal from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. \nThis coal is transported by rail for more than 1,500 miles. Currently, \ntwo railroads travel from the Basin to Alexandria, LA. However, the \nlast 19 miles of travel distance to the Rodemacher Plant only has one \nmajor railroad provider. Present law allows the current rail provider's \ncontrol of the last 19 miles to push its pricing monopoly all the way \nback to the Powder River Basin, which in essence, turns a 19 mile \nmonopoly into a 1,500-mile monopoly.\n  This monopoly forces the Lafayette ratepayers to pay much higher \nrates than if the Rodemacher Plant had access to both railroads that \nserve the Powder River Basin. When enacted, the Railroad Competition \nand Service Improvement Act would address bottlenecking issues like \nthis and the lack of competition saving the Lafayette ratepayers money.\n  I look forward to the consideration of S. 953, the Railroad \nCompetition and Service Improvement Act by the Senate Committee on \nCommerce, Science and Transportation, on which I serve, and the full \nSenate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 954. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a technical correction to the amendments made by section \n422 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization \nAct of 2003; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Feingold, I am \nintroducing the Medicare Residency Program Technical Correction Act of \n2007. This legislation will fix an unintended consequence of Section \n422 of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 that has resulted in a \ndecrease of family medical residents slots in Wisconsin's Fox Valley \nand potentially other family medicine practices across the Nation. Our \nbill would provide for an adjustment to the reduction of Medicare \nresident positions based on settled cost reports.\n  For the last 2 years, I've been working with the University of \nWisconsin School of Medicine and the Fox Valley Family Medicine \nResidency Program to urge CMS to restore funding for its residency \ntraining positions that was taken away as a result of an audit that \nincorrectly determined that the positions weren't used. Now, a Final \nMediation Agreement between Appleton Medical Center and United \nGovernment Services demonstrates that the positions were being used and \nthat the program met the Medicare requirement for those positions. I \nbelieve it is only fair that Appleton Medical Center's residency \npositions be reinstated.\n  The Fox Valley Family Practice Residency Program is an important \ncontributing member to the Fox Valley and surrounding community, \nproviding health care services to some 10,000 families. This is exactly \nthe type of program that we should be supporting, not reducing. My \nlegislation will right this wrong and provide for the same opportunity \nfor any other family medicine program that can demonstrate that its \nresidency slots were erroneously de-funded by CMS. I ask that my Senate \ncolleagues join me by supporting this bill. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 954\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Residency Program \n     Technical Correction Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REINSTATEMENT OF FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT RESIDENT SLOTS \n                   THAT WERE ERRONEOUSLY ELIMINATED.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1886(h)(7) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(h)(7)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraph (D) as subparagraph (E); \n     and\n       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (C) the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(D) Adjustment based on settled cost report.--In the case \n     of a hospital for which--\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\n       ``(i) the otherwise applicable resident limit was reduced \n     under subparagraph (A)(i)(I); and\n       ``(ii) such reduction was based on a reference resident \n     level that was determined using a cost report that was \n     subsequently settled, whether as a result of an appeal or \n     otherwise, and the reference resident level under such \n     settled cost report is higher than the level used for the \n     reduction under subparagraph (A)(i)(I),\n\n     the Secretary shall apply subparagraph (A)(i)(I) using the \n     higher resident reference level and make any necessary \n     adjustments to such reduction. Any such necessary adjustments \n     shall be effective for portions of cost reporting periods \n     occurring on or after July 1, 2005.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect as if included in the enactment of section \n     422 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \n     Modernization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-173).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 955. A bill to establish the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage \nArea, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 955\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as ``Abraham Lincoln National \n     Heritage Area Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area is a \n     cohesive assemblage of natural, historic, cultural, and \n     recreational resources that--\n       (A) together represent distinctive aspects of the heritage \n     of the United States worthy of recognition, conservation, \n     interpretation, and continuing use; and\n       (B) are best managed through partnerships between private \n     and public entities;\n       (2) the Heritage Area reflects traditions, customs, \n     beliefs, folklife, or a combination of those attributes that \n     are a valuable part of the heritage of the United States;\n       (3) the Heritage Area provides outstanding opportunities to \n     conserve natural features, historic feature, cultural \n     features, or a combination of those features;\n       (4) the Heritage Area provides outstanding recreational and \n     interpretive opportunities.\n       (5) the Heritage Area has an identifiable theme, and \n     resources important to the theme, that retain integrity \n     capable of supporting interpretation;\n       (6) residents, nonprofit organizations, other private \n     entities, and units of local government throughout the \n     Heritage Area demonstrate support for--\n       (A) designation of the Heritage Area as a national heritage \n     area; and\n       (B) management of the Heritage Area in a manner appropriate \n     for the designation;\n       (7) there is a compelling need to educate and cultivate \n     among the citizens of the United States, particularly youth, \n     an understanding appreciation for, and a renewed commitment \n     to integrity, courage, self-initiative, and principled \n     leadership in public and private life;\n       (8) few individuals in the history of the United States \n     have as broadly exemplified such qualities, and so profoundly \n     influenced the history and character of the United States, as \n     Abraham Lincoln;\n       (9) the story and example of the life of Abraham Lincoln, \n     including his inspiring rise from humble origins to the \n     highest office in the land and his decisive leadership \n     through the most harrowing and dangerous time in the history \n     of the United States, continues to bring hope and inspiration \n     to millions in the United States and around the world;\n       (10) the great issues during the lifetime of Abraham \n     Lincoln, including national unity, equality and race \n     relations, the capacity for democratic government, and the \n     ideals to address those and related issues, continue to this \n     day to define the challenges facing the United States;\n       (11) the ideals espoused by Lincoln, and the sentiments \n     expressed by Lincoln with respect to keeping the United \n     States together, are as relevant today as the ideals and \n     sentiment were in Lincoln's troubled time;\n       (12) Illinois is known throughout the world as the land of \n     Abraham Lincoln;\n       (13) unquestionably, the physical, social, and cultural \n     landscape of Illinois helped mold the character of Lincoln;\n       (14) ``Here I have lived a quarter of a century, and have \n     passed from a young to an old man,'' Lincoln remarked on \n     leaving Illinois. ``To this place and the kindness of these \n     people I owe everything'';\n       (15) Lincoln, in turn, left his own traces across the \n     Illinois landscape;\n       (16) the traces remain today in the form of stories, \n     folklore, artifacts, buildings, streetscapes, and landscapes;\n       (17) though scattered geographically and in varying states \n     of development and interpretation, together the traces of \n     Lincoln bring an immediacy and tangible quality to the \n     powerful Lincoln legacy;\n       (18) individually and collectively, the traces of Lincoln \n     in Illinois constitute an important national cultural and \n     historic resource;\n       (19) in particular, the stories and cultural resources of \n     the Lincoln legacy of the region--\n       (A) reflect the values and attitudes, obstacles and \n     ingenuity, failures and accomplishments, human frailties, and \n     strength of character of the men and women who made up the \n     diverse people of Lincoln's generation, including upland \n     Southerners and Northeastern Yankees, Anglo-settlers and \n     American Indians, ``free'' blacks, abolitionists, and critics \n     of abolitionists;\n       (B) reflect the material culture and relative levels of \n     technical sophistication in the United States in the lifetime \n     of Lincoln;\n       (C) recreate the physical environment during the lifetime \n     of Lincoln, revealing the impact of the environment on \n     agriculture, transportation, trade, business, and social and \n     cultural patterns in urban and rural settings; and\n       (D) interpret the effect of the democratic ethos of the era \n     on the development of the legal and political institutions \n     and distinctive political culture of the United States;\n       (20) 3 previous studies entitled ``Abraham Lincoln Research \n     and Interpretive Center Suitability/Feasibility Study'' by \n     the National Park Service (1991), ``Looking for Lincoln \n     Illinois Heritage Tourism Project'' commissioned by the State \n     of Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs in \n     cooperation with the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency \n     (1998), and the ``Feasibility Study for the Proposed Abraham \n     Lincoln National Heritage Area'', revised in 2003, help \n     document a sufficient assemblage of nationally distinctive \n     historic resources to demonstrate the feasibility of, and \n     need to establish, the Heritage Area;\n       (21) the National Park Service--\n       (A) operates and maintains the Lincoln Home National \n     Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois; and\n       (B) is responsible for--\n       (i) advocating the protection and interpretation of the \n     cultural and historic resources of the United States; and\n       (ii) encouraging the development of interpretive context \n     for those resources through appropriate planning and \n     preservation;\n       (22) the Heritage Area can strengthen, complement, and \n     support the Lincoln Home National Historic Site through the \n     interpretation and conservation of the associated living \n     landscapes outside of the boundaries of the historic site;\n       (23) there is a Federal interest in supporting the \n     development of a regional framework and context to partner \n     with and assist the National Park Service, the State of \n     Illinois, local organizations, units of local government, and \n     private citizens to conserve, protect, and bring recognition \n     to the resources of the Heritage Area for the educational and \n     recreational benefit of the present generation and future \n     generations;\n       (24) communities throughout the region--\n       (A) know the value of their Lincoln legacy; but\n       (B) need to expand upon an existing cooperative framework \n     and technical assistance to achieve important goals by \n     working together;\n       (25) the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity \n     and Bureau of Tourism of the State of Illinois--\n       (A) officially designated ``Looking for Lincoln'' as a \n     State Heritage Tourism Area; and\n       (B) has identified the story of Lincoln as a key \n     destination driver for the State;\n       (26) the Looking for Lincoln Heritage Coalition, the \n     management entity for the Heritage Area--\n       (A) is a nonprofit corporation created for the purposes of \n     preserving, interpreting, developing, promoting, and making \n     available to the public the story and resources relating to--\n       (i) the story of the adult life of Abraham Lincoln in \n     Illinois; and\n       (ii) the contributions of Abraham Lincoln to society; and\n       (B) would be an appropriate entity to oversee the \n     development of the Heritage Area; and\n       (27) the Looking for Lincoln Heritage Coalition has \n     completed a business plan that--\n       (A) describes in detail the role, operation, financing, and \n     functions of the Looking For Lincoln Heritage Coalition as \n     the management entity for the Heritage Area; and\n       (B) provides adequate assurances that the Looking For \n     Lincoln Heritage Coalition is likely to have the financial \n     resources necessary to implement the management plan for the \n     Heritage Area, including resources to meet matching \n     requirement for grants.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 956\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Land Between the Rivers \n     Southern Illinois National Heritage Area Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) southern Illinois has a cohesive, distinctive, and \n     important landscape that distinguishes the area as worthy of \n     designation as a National Heritage Area;\n       (2) the historic features of southern Illinois reflect a \n     period during which the area was the strategic convergence \n     point during the westward expansion of the United States;\n       (3) the geographic centrality of southern Illinois ensured \n     that the area played a pivotal military, social, and \n     political role during the Civil War, which resulted in the \n     area being known as the ``Confluence of Freedom'';\n       (4) southern Illinois is at the junction of the ending \n     glaciers and 6 ecological divisions;\n       (5) after the expeditions of Lewis and Clark, the land \n     between the rivers became known as ``Egypt'' because of the \n     rivers in, and the beauty and agricultural abundance of, the \n     area;\n       (6) Native Americans described the area in southern \n     Illinois between the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers as the \n     ``Land Between the Rivers'';\n       (7) a feasibility study led by the Office of Economic and \n     Regional Development at Southern Illinois University \n     Carbondale that was revised in April 2006 documents a \n     sufficient assemblage of nationally distinctive historic \n     resources to demonstrate the feasibility of, and the need \n     for, establishing the Land Between the Rivers National \n     Heritage Area; and\n       (8) stakeholders participating in the feasibility study \n     process for the Heritage Area have developed a proposed \n     management entity and financial plan to preserve the natural, \n     cultural, historic, and scenic features of the area while \n     furthering recreational and educational opportunities in the \n     area.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 114\n\n       Whereas National Agriculture Day is an annual celebration \n     during which government agencies, community members, and \n     agricultural groups work with agricultural producers to honor \n     the importance of the agriculture industry;\n       Whereas agriculture is a pillar of the economy of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and many other States across the \n     country;\n       Whereas agriculture is the number one industry in \n     Pennsylvania and has contributed more than $45,000,000,000 to \n     the economy of the Commonwealth;\n       Whereas agricultural producers in Pennsylvania export a \n     considerable amount of food and agricultural and forest \n     products, earning more than $1,500,000,000 annually in \n     profits;\n       Whereas dairy cattle from Pennsylvania are used as breeding \n     stock in a number of countries around the world;\n       Whereas Pennsylvania is the home of over 58,000 farms, \n     covering more than 7,700,000 acres of land;\n       Whereas Pennsylvania is a leading producer of mushrooms, \n     eggs, pumpkins, apples, grapes, freestone peaches, ice cream, \n     milk cows, chickens, and other agricultural products and \n     livestock;\n       Whereas each agricultural producer in the United States \n     feeds more than 144 people and Pennsylvania's agricultural \n     producers are responsible for feeding more than 8,000,000 \n     mouths worldwide;\n       Whereas agricultural producers in Pennsylvania and \n     throughout the Nation provide the people of the United States \n     with food, clothes, and many other staples; and\n       Whereas the contribution of agricultural producers in \n     Pennsylvania and throughout the United States should be \n     honored with highest praise and respect: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes--\n       (A) that agriculture is the number one industry in \n     Pennsylvania;\n       (B) the outstanding contribution of Pennsylvania's \n     agricultural producers to the economy of the Commonwealth and \n     the Nation; and\n       (C) that agriculture in Pennsylvania is diverse and \n     provides important nutrition to the people of the United \n     States; and\n       (2) pays tribute to agriculture and agricultural producers \n     in Pennsylvania and throughout the United States on the \n     occasion of National Agriculture Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/21/senate-section/article/S3532-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3532-S3533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 115--URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA TO END THE \n                          COMMERCIAL SEAL HUNT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 115\n\n       Whereas on November 15, 2006, the Government of Canada \n     opened a commercial hunt for seals in the waters off the east \n     coast of Canada;\n       Whereas an international outcry regarding the plight of the \n     seals hunted in Canada resulted in the 1983 ban by the \n     European Union of whitecoat and blueback seal skins and the \n     subsequent collapse of the commercial seal hunt in Canada;\n       Whereas the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. \n     1361 et seq.) bars the import into the United States of any \n     seal products;\n       Whereas in February 2003, the Ministry of Fisheries and \n     Oceans in Canada authorized the highest quota for harp seals \n     in Canadian history, allowing nearly 1,000,000 seals to be \n     killed over a 3-year period;\n       Whereas more than 1,000,000 seals have been killed over the \n     past 3 years;\n       Whereas harp seal pups can be legally hunted in Canada as \n     soon as they have begun to molt their white coats at \n     approximately 12 days of age;\n       Whereas 95 percent of the seals killed over the past 5 \n     years were pups between just 12 days and 12 weeks of age, \n     many of which had not yet eaten their first solid meal or \n     taken their first swim;\n       Whereas a report by an independent team of veterinarians \n     invited to observe the hunt by the International Fund for \n     Animal Welfare concluded that the seal hunt failed to comply \n     with basic animal welfare regulations in Canada and that \n     governmental regulations regarding humane killing were not \n     being respected or enforced;\n       Whereas the veterinary report concluded that as many as 42 \n     percent of the seals studied were likely skinned while alive \n     and conscious;\n       Whereas the commercial slaughter of seals in the Northwest \n     Atlantic is inherently cruel, whether the killing is \n     conducted by clubbing or by shooting;\n       Whereas many seals are shot in the course of the hunt, but \n     escape beneath the ice where they die slowly and are never \n     recovered, and these seals are not counted in official kill \n     statistics, making the actual kill level far higher than the \n     level that is reported;\n       Whereas the commercial hunt for harp and hooded seals is a \n     commercial slaughter carried out almost entirely by non-\n     Native people from the East Coast of Canada for seal fur, \n     oil, and penises (used as aphrodisiacs in some Asian \n     markets);\n       Whereas the fishing and sealing industries in Canada \n     continue to justify the expanded seal hunt on the grounds \n     that the seals in the Northwest Atlantic are preventing the \n     recovery of cod stocks, despite the lack of any credible \n     scientific evidence to support this claim;\n       Whereas 2 Canadian government marine scientists reported in \n     1994 that the true cause of cod depletion in the North \n     Atlantic was over-fishing, and the consensus among the \n     international scientific community is that seals are not \n     responsible for the collapse of cod stocks;\n       Whereas harp and hooded seals are a vital part of the \n     complex ecosystem of the Northwest Atlantic, and because the \n     seals consume predators of commercial cod stocks, removing \n     the seals might actually inhibit recovery of cod stocks;\n       Whereas certain ministries of the Government of Canada have \n     stated clearly that there is no evidence that killing seals \n     will help groundfish stocks to recover; and\n       Whereas the persistence of this cruel and needless \n     commercial hunt is inconsistent with the well-earned \n     international reputation of Canada: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate urges the Government of Canada to \n     end the commercial hunt on seals that opened in the waters \n     off the east coast of Canada on November 15, 2006.\n\n  Mr. Levin. Mr. President, Canada's commercial seal hunt is the \nlargest slaughter of marine mammals in the world. According to the \nHumane Society of the United States (HSUS), over one million seals have \nbeen killed for their fur in the past three years. In 2006 alone, more \nthan 350,000 seals were slaughtered, most of them between 12 days and \n12 weeks old.\n  Canada officially opened another seal hunt on November 15, 2006, \npaving the way for hundreds of thousands of baby seals to be killed for \ntheir fur during the spring of 2007. Today, I am joined by Senator \nCollins and Senator Biden in submitting a resolution that urges the \nGovernment of Canada to end this senseless and inhumane slaughter.\n  A study by an independent team of veterinarians in 2001, found that \nthe seal hunt failed to comply with basic animal welfare standards and \nthat Canadian regulations with regard to humane killing were not being \nenforced. The study concluded that up to 42 percent of the seals \nstudied were likely skinned while alive and conscious. The United \nStates has long banned the import of seal products because of \nwidespread outrage over the magnitude and cruelty of the hunt.\n  It makes little sense to continue this inhumane industry that employs \nonly a few hundred people on a seasonal, part-time basis and only \noperates for a few weeks a year, in which the concentrated killings \ntakes place. In Newfoundland, where over 90 percent of the\n\n[[Page S3533]]\n\nhunters live, the economic contribution of the seal hunt is marginal. \nIn fact, exports of seal products from Newfoundland account for less \nthan one-tenth of one percent of the Province's total exports.\n  Canada is fortunate to have vast and diverse wildlife populations, \nbut these animals deserve protection, not senseless slaughter. \nAmericans have a long history of defending marine mammals, best \nevidenced by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. Polls show that \nclose to 80 percent of Americans and the vast majority of Europeans \noppose Canada's seal hunt. In fact, close to 70 percent of Canadians \nsurveyed oppose the hunt completely, with even higher numbers opposing \nspecific aspects of the hunt, such as killing baby seals.\n  The U.S. Government has opposed this senseless slaughter, as noted in \nthe attached, January 19, 2005, letter from the U.S. Department of \nState, in response to a letter Senator Collins and I wrote to President \nBush, urging him to raise this issue during his November 30, 2004, \nvisit with Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin.\n  The clubbing of baby seals can not be defended or justified. Canada \nshould end it, just as we ended the Alaska seal hunt more than 20 years \nago.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the January 19, 2005, letter from the \nU.S. State Department be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          Department of State,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 19, 2005.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: This is in response to your letter to \n     the President of November 24, 2004, regarding Canadian \n     commercial seal hunting. The White House has requested that \n     the Department of State respond. We regret the delay in \n     responding. Unfortunately, this letter was not received in \n     the Department of State until mid-December, well after the \n     referenced meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister \n     Paul Martin of Canada.\n       We are aware of Canada's seal hunting activities and of the \n     opposition to it expressed by many Americans. Furthermore, we \n     can assure you that the United States has a longstanding \n     policy opposing the hunting of seals and other marine mammals \n     absent sufficient safeguards and information to ensure that \n     the hunting will not adversely impact the affected marine \n     mammal population or the ecosystem of which it is a part. The \n     United States policy is reflected in the Marine Mammal \n     Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) which generally prohibits, with \n     narrow and specific exceptions, the taking of marine mammals \n     in waters or lands subject to the jurisdiction of the United \n     States and the importation of marine mammals and marine \n     mammal products into the United States.\n       The United States has made known to the Government of \n     Canada its objections and the objections of concerned \n     American legislators and citizens to the Canadian commercial \n     seal hunt on numerous occasions over recent years. The United \n     States has also opposed Canada's efforts within the Arctic \n     Council to promote trade in sealskins and other marine mammal \n     products.\n       We hope this information is helpful to you. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact us if we can be of assistance in this or \n     any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Nancy Powell,\n         (For Paul V.

Mr. President, I am happy to join the esteemed Congressman \nfrom New York, Rep. Steve Israel, and submit a resolution today to \ndeclare May 2007 as ``National Autoimmune Diseases Awareness Month.''\n  The purpose of the resolution is to raise awareness of autoimmune \ndiseases and the need for aggressive research to learn the root causes \nof autoimmune diseases, as well as the best diagnostic methods and \ntreatments for people with autoimmune diseases.\n  Autoimmune diseases are chronic, disabling diseases in which \nunderlying defects in the immune system lead the body to attack its own \norgans and tissues. Autoimmune diseases can affect any part of the \nbody-blood, blood vessels, muscles, nervous system, gastrointestinal \ntract, endocrine glands, and multiple-organ systems--and can be life-\nthreatening.\n  Researchers have identified over 80 different autoimmune diseases, \nincluding multiple sclerosis, juvenile diabetes, Crohn's disease, \nscleroderma, polymyositis, lupus, Sjogren's disease and Graves' \ndisease, and suspect at least 40 additional diseases of having an \nautoimmune basis. The National Institutes of Health estimates that \nautoimmune diseases afflict more than 23 million people in the United \nStates. Seventy five percent of the people affected with autoimmune \ndiseases are women, and the prevalence of autoimmune diseases is \nrising. However, the family of autoimmune diseases is under-recognized, \nand this poses a major health care challenge to the United States.\n  Diagnostic tests for autoimmune diseases are not standardized, which \nmakes autoimmune diseases very difficult to diagnose. Because \nautoimmune diseases are difficult to diagnose, treatment is often \ndelayed, resulting in irreparable organ damage and unnecessary \nsuffering.\n  There is a significant need for more collaboration and cross-\nfertilization of\n\n[[Page S3534]]\n\nbasic autoimmune research, with a particular focus on the etiology of \nall autoimmune-related diseases in order to increase understanding of \nthe root causes of these diseases rather than treating the symptoms \nafter the disease has had its destructive effect.\n  As such, I am submitting this resolution to designate May 2007 as \n``National Autoimmune Disease Awareness Month'' to help educate the \npublic about autoimmune diseases and the need for research funding, \naccurate diagnosis, and effective treatments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/21/senate-section/article/S3534-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 22--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \n  THAT THE CITIZENS' STAMP ADVISORY COMMITTEE SHOULD RECOMMEND TO THE \n  POSTMASTER GENERAL THAT A COMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE STAMP BE ISSUED TO \n               PROMOTE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF DOWN SYNDROME\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Cochran) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 22\n\n       Whereas Down syndrome affects people of all races and \n     economic levels;\n       Whereas Down syndrome is the most frequently occurring \n     chromosomal abnormality;\n       Whereas 1 in every 800 to 1,000 children is born with Down \n     syndrome;\n       Whereas more than 350,000 people in the United States have \n     Down syndrome;\n       Whereas 5,000 children with Down syndrome are born each \n     year;\n       Whereas as the mortality rate associated with Down syndrome \n     in the United States decreases, the prevalence of individuals \n     with Down syndrome in the United States will increase;\n       Whereas some experts project that the number of people with \n     Down syndrome will double by 2013;\n       Whereas individuals with Down syndrome are becoming \n     increasingly integrated into society and community \n     organizations, such as schools, health care systems, work \n     forces, and social and recreational activities;\n       Whereas more and more people in the United States interact \n     with individuals with Down syndrome, increasing the need for \n     widespread public acceptance and education; and\n       Whereas a greater understanding of Down syndrome and \n     advancements in treatment of Down syndrome-related health \n     problems have allowed people with Down syndrome to enjoy \n     fuller and more active lives: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the United States Postal Service should issue a \n     commemorative postage stamp to promote public awareness of \n     Down syndrome; and\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend \n     to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit legislation \nexpressing support for the creation of a commemorative stamp to promote \npublic awareness of Down syndrome. I start by saluting those who are \ncelebrating World Down Syndrome Day, and by thanking Senator Cochran \nfor his support, as well as the National Down Syndrome Society, the Arc \nof the United States, the National Association for Down Syndrome, and \nthe Central Illinois Down Syndrome Organization.\n  Awareness begins with facts. According to the National Association \nfor Down Syndrome, Down syndrome is a genetic condition that causes \ndelays in physical and intellectual development. Individuals with Down \nsyndrome have 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46. It is the most \nfrequently occurring chromosomal disorder. Down syndrome is not related \nto race, nationality, religion, or economic status. It is a condition \nthat impacts our entire society.\n  Children with Down syndrome are prone to health complications such as \ncongenital heart defects, infection, respiratory, vision and hearing \nproblems, and other medical conditions. Yet, they have their own gifts, \nand can often lead independent lives. While children with Down syndrome \nmay face relatively greater challenges in areas such as memory, they \noften have particular strengths in areas such as social knowledge.\n  A testament to the fighting spirit and abilities of individuals \nliving with Down syndrome resides near me in Springfield, IL. Diana \nBraun is an amazing woman. She survived an abusive family, scattered \nsiblings, and institutional living to emerge as an Illinois leader and \nadvocate for people with intellectual disabilities. She is president of \nPeople First and a member of the Illinois Council on Developmental \nDisabilities. She currently serves on the board of the Illinois Arc and \nworks as a personal assistant to her friend and fellow activist, Kathy \nConour. Together, they travel to Washington almost yearly to meet with \ntheir elected officials. She is a remarkable human being by any \nstandard, and we in Illinois are proud that she has chosen to lead and \nadvocate in our State. She and those for whom she advocates deserve our \nsupport.\n  The United States Postal Service has done a remarkable job of raising \nawareness, and in some cases money, for many worthy causes. This cause \ncould not be more worthy, or in greater need of attention. There are \nmore than 350,000 people living with Down syndrome in the United \nStates. One in every 733 babies is born with Down syndrome. These \nbirths impact millions more--parents, siblings, friends, educators, and \nemployers.\n  A commemorative stamp is the least that we as a body can do to spread \nawareness and provide support for this universal issue. Many Down \nsyndrome support groups make a point of noting that people with Down \nsyndrome are more like other people than they are different. They are \ndifferent in that they are gifted with that rare strength that comes \nfrom adversity, and the compassion that comes from understanding the \nfight. I salute these individuals, their families, and everyone who \nsupports them. I hope that the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Commission will \ndo the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/21/senate-section/article/S3534-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3534-S3535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 481.

Mr. DODD submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the concurrent resolution S. Con. Res. 21, setting forth the \ncongressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year \n2008 and including the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years \n2007 and 2009 through 2012; which was ordered to lie on the table; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR NATIONAL GUARD \n                   FORCE READINESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In his testimony before the Commission on the National \n     Guard and Reserves, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, \n     Lieutenant General Blum, warned about equipment shortfalls \n     for the Army National Guard and Air National Guard stating \n     that ``88 percent of the forces that are back here in the \n     United States are very poorly equipped today in the Army \n     National Guard. And in the Air National Guard for the last \n     three decades, they have never had a unit below C2 in \n     equipment readiness''.\n       (2) In the March 1, 2007, report of the Commission on the \n     National Guard and Reserves, the Commission observes that--\n       (A) while the operational tempo of the reserve components \n     of the Armed Forces has increased substantially, resourcing \n     has not kept pace;\n       (B) the lack of sufficient and ready equipment is a problem \n     common to both the active and reserve components of the Armed \n     Forces;\n       (C) the equipment readiness of the Army National Guard is \n     unacceptable and has reduced the capability of the United \n     States to respond to current and additional major \n     contingencies, whether foreign and domestic; and\n       (D) while the budget of the President for fiscal year 2008 \n     includes large increases in funds for equipment for the \n     National Guard, historical practice in the Department of \n     Defense indicates that Army plans for projected funding \n     increases for equipment for the Army National Guard are not \n     reliably carried through.\n       (3) According to the Commission on the National Guard and \n     Reserves, procurement for the Army National Guard during the \n     period from 1999 through 2005 has been reduced significantly \n     from amounts proposed for such procurement before that \n     period. The budget for fiscal year 2001 indicated that the \n     Army planned to expend $1,346,000,000 in fiscal year 2004 for \n     procurement for the Army National Guard, but the budget for \n     fiscal year 2006 revealed that the Army expended only \n     $578,400,000 for procurement for the Army National Guard in \n     fiscal year 2004. Similarly, the budget for fiscal year 2001 \n     indicated that the Army planned to expend $1,625,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2005 for procurement for the Army National Guard, \n     but the budget for fiscal year 2006 revealed that the Army \n     planned to expend only $660,900,000 for procurement for the \n     Army National Guard in fiscal year 2005.\n       (4) According to the Commission on the National Guard and \n     Reserves, the difference between the amounts proposed for \n     procurement for the Army National Guard for fiscal years 2003 \n     through 2005 and the amounts actually expended for such \n     procurement in such fiscal years was atypical and extreme.\n       (5) According to a January 2007 report of the Government \n     Accountability Office, inventories of equipment for the \n     National Guard in the United States have decreased because of \n     overseas operations, particularly inventories of the Army \n     National Guard. The Comptroller General found that State \n     officials expressed concerns about having enough equipment to \n     respond to large scale natural or man made disasters such as \n     Hurricane Katrina.\n       (6) The Comptroller General found that before current \n     overseas operations began, the majority of the combat forces \n     of the Army\n\n[[Page S3536]]\n\n     National Guard were supplied with approximately 65 to 79 \n     percent of their required equipment. As of November 2006, \n     nondeployed Army National Guard forces nationwide still had \n     approximately 64 percent of the total amount of authorized \n     dual-use equipment, including authorized substitute items, \n     based on their warfighting missions even as overseas and \n     domestic missions have expanded.\n       (b) Reserve Fund.--The Chairman of the Senate Committee on \n     the Budget may revise the allocations, aggregates, and other \n     appropriate levels in this resolution for a bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     provides for National Guard Force Readiness, by the amounts \n     provided by that legislation for that purpose, but not to \n     exceed $8,760,000,000 in new budget authority for fiscal year \n     2008 and the outlays flowing from that budget authority and \n     $7,235,000,000 in new budget authority for each of the fiscal \n     years 2009 through 2012 and the outlays flowing from that \n     budget authority, provided that such legislation would not \n     increase the deficit over the total of the period of fiscal \n     years 2008 through 2012.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 483.

An affirmative vote of \n     three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and \n     sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling \n     of the Chair on a point of order raised under this \n     subsection.\n       (f) Budget Year.--In this section, the term ``budget year'' \n     shall have the same meaning as in section 250(c)(12) of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 484.
