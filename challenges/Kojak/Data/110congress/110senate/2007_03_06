It is with a heavy heart that I finished my exercise \nthis morning and came into my home and got ready to come to work.\n  Nine American soldiers were killed in Iraq yesterday. I don't know \nhow many were wounded. I don't know how many were grievously wounded. \nBut I have to focus on those nine soldiers and their families.\n  I am fortunate. I am one of four sons. My brother Dale died as a \nyoung man, and I still have not gotten over my brother Dale dying at \n46, 47 years old. I know his death is not comparable, of course, to \nthese valiant soldiers who were killed in Iraq yesterday, but he is \nstill my brother and I still feel very badly.\n  I can't imagine how the nine soldiers' families feel today. Some of \nthem have not yet been notified that their loved one has been killed, \nbut most of them by now have been notified. This is a reminder of what \nis happening in Iraq thousands of miles from here but affecting the \nlives of everyday Americans. The current approach isn't working. We \nneed to change course in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/06/senate-section/article/S2650-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2650]]\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I listened to the majority leader talk a \nfew minutes ago about going out to do his morning exercise and hearing \nonce again of nine soldiers who were killed today in Iraq and the heavy \nburden all of us have as we sit and listen to the debate about Iraq and \nhow we should proceed and how we cannot ever forget the burden it \nplaces on so many families and will continue to be on so many families \nfor years to come.\n  I have been out on this floor several times to talk about the \nadministration's failure to care for our troops. I am sure it is not \ngoing to be my last time; in fact, I am positive it will not be my last \ntime. I am going to keep talking about these men and women and their \nfamilies who have been impacted so dramatically and what we are doing \nas a nation to make sure we are there for them every step of the way. \nUnfortunately, the list of failures is very long--too long. Recently, \nwe heard about the obstacles of service men and women with traumatic \nbrain injuries when they return home from battle. I have seen these men \nand women. I have watched what happens to them. It is not a couple of \ndays. It is not a couple of months. It is a lifetime of dealing with a \ntraumatic brain injury and how it impacts them, their families, their \nability to be able to be productive, their family's ability to be able \nto put food on the table and continue to care for the person. It is a \nlong-term cost. It is part of the cost of the war, and it is a burden \nwe should all be sharing and as of yet have not been sharing.\n  We have heard about the shameful treatment of patients at Walter Reed \nHospital. We have all felt so compassionate as we listened to these men \nand women and the squalid conditions they lived in. I am here to tell \nmy colleagues, this is a syndrome, the ``Walter Reed'' syndrome. It is \nnot just at Walter Reed. We are hearing from men and women across the \ncountry who have been impacted by this war and have been sort of the \nforgotten stepchildren of this war, left in a facility somewhere, and \ntheir families are struggling every single day, every single minute to \ndeal with these young men and women. Sometimes they are older. I have \ntalked to men and women who are in their 50s who are members of the \nGuard and Reserve who have been impacted. Some are grandparents.\n  This morning the President announced that one of our former \ncolleagues, Senator Bob Dole, will join with former Secretary of Health \nand Human Services Donna Shalala, who will cochair a panel to look into \nthe problems at the Department of Defense and the veterans health care \nsystem. I am pleased the President finally, after 4 years, is putting \nan emphasis on this crisis. I think he has chosen two very well-\nqualified individuals to lead this panel, but I remain very concerned.\n  First of all, let me remind everybody that the President received \nrecommendation after recommendation from panel after panel during this \nadministration, and time and time again he refused to implement their \nsuggestions or simply ignored them. We see that on the Senate floor \ntoday. We are out here debating the 9/11 Commission. They released \ntheir findings years ago. Few of them have been implemented. It has \ntaken a shift in power from Republicans to Democrats to finally \nimplement the 9/11 Commission recommendations.\n  Even more recently, the Iraq Study Group, another bipartisan, highly \nregarded commission, released its findings on a path forward in Iraq. \nThe President applauded the members of the group, said they were great, \nbut he has ignored their recommendations. Instead, he has left it up to \nus in Congress to try to bring a new direction to the war in Iraq.\n  So we are right, I believe, to be wary of this new step from the \nPresident--two good people, Bob Dole, Donna Shalala, and another highly \nregarded commission to look into this. I know those members will take \ntheir time and evaluate everything. But once they make their \nrecommendations, my question to all of us is: What will the President \ndo with them? The President knows how to talk the talk, but I am pretty \nworried he doesn't know how to walk the walk.\n  I am here this morning to say our troops don't need any more \nrhetoric. They do need a lot of action. That is why the Senate \nDemocrats are determined to address these problems, not just at Walter \nReed--of course at Walter Reed but beyond that--through comprehensive \naction aimed at taking care of the men and women who serve us from the \nbattlefield all the way to their local VA and for a lifetime, if that \nis what it takes.\n  We need decisive action, not commission after commission and report \nafter report that the President can simply choose to ignore. I hope \nthis commission will, as well as the group actually who has been set up \nby Secretary Gates, who has responded, I believe, in a strong manner, I \nhope they come forward with positive ideas that will benefit our \ntroops. But I also promise to our troops, to our men and women, to our \nveterans, and to all their families that we in this body are not going \nto sit idly by and wait for another commission report or for this \nPresident to act.\n  Lost in the news coverage last week of this whole Walter Reed fiasco \nwas a report on the President's failure to provide adequate mental \nhealth care for our Armed Forces. That report which was lost in all of \nthis was a military psychologist-led task force, and they told us 30 \npercent of our troops meet standards for having a mental disorder, but \nless than half of them ever receive care. Thirty percent of the men and \nwomen we send to Iraq and Afghanistan come home with what is termed a \nmental disorder. Yet less than half of them ever receive care. The \nstories I hear from these troops and from their families and the people \nwhom I talk to are heartbreaking.\n  My staff this past week spoke to one soldier who returned from his \nsecond tour in Iraq and is suffering from a severe case of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder. He said that at his hospital, if you are not \nmissing a limb, you are virtually invisible. If you are not missing a \nlimb, you are virtually invisible. To me, that is appalling, and I fear \nthat is not an isolated case. Sometimes those in need choose not to \nseek help, but for many of them, the ones who want and need mental \nhealth care or who their families know need mental health care and are \ntrying to get them into the system, the services haven't been \navailable.\n  Amazingly, only 40 percent of the Army and Navy's Active-Duty, \nlicensed clinical psychologist positions are filled. Only 40 percent of \nthem are even filled. The psychologists who are on staff report being \nworked to the bone and having a low motivation for work. I talked to a \npsychologist myself recently on a visit, and he told me he was doing \nthe same thing he did during the Vietnam war, and he said to me: I \ndon't know if I can do this anymore. These psychologists are worked to \nthe bone and they are tired. They are tired because they see men and \nwomen who are not getting the care and they are worried they can't keep \nup--almost 4 years into this war, 4 years into this war. To me, this is \nso unacceptable.\n  It is unacceptable that there are severe staffing shortages in mental \nhealth care when men and women need help. An equally troubling \nconclusion of the report--that was lost last week because we are so \nfocused on Walter Reed, but I think we need to focus on it--was that \nour National Guard and Reserve Forces are being particularly hit hard \nby the shortage in mental health care. We know that Guard and Reserve \nmembers come from some of our smallest communities, and they have \nsacrificed so much for this country. They have left loved ones and left\n\n[[Page S2651]]\n\ntheir jobs for months to go over and police an Iraqi civil war. For the \nPresident's escalation plan, now we are seeing many of them being \nforced to go back a second, third time--and I even talked to one \nsoldier who is going back the fourth time--without the necessary break. \nThese brave men and women accepted these realities without complaint. \nTwo to one, they say to me: I am honored to serve my country.\n  Despite all that has been asked of them and all they have given, this \nadministration is not providing the mental health care they need.\n  However disturbing these findings are--and they are horribly \ndisturbing--the worst aspect is that there has been report after report \nafter report, year after year after year, detailing the lack of mental \nhealth care.\n  Last year, as I have said on the floor before, the Government \nAccountability Office found similar problems. Last spring, in an \nunusually candid interview--almost a year ago now--the VA's Under \nSecretary for Health Policy Coordination, Dr. Frances Murphy, said \nmental health care services are inadequate and that when services are \navailable, ``waiting lists render that care virtually inaccessible.''\n  This is the President's administration, his Veterans' Administration \nand Under Secretary there, who has been telling us for almost a year \nnow that waiting lists render mental health care services virtually \ninaccessible. What has this President's response been? Total silence. I \nask: How does that fall on the ears of these soldiers and their \nfamilies?\n  This administration has known about these problems for years. But we \nhave seen no changes and no improvements.\n  With minimal amounts of sleep, our service men and women work longer \ndays than you and I can imagine. They see things none of us should ever \nwitness: bodies blown to pieces, mutilation, the blood of their fellow \nsoldiers on the streets of a country we have no place being.\n  All of this is for a war we were misled into supporting. There were \nno weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was never connected to \nal-Qaida, and nobody can say we are spreading democracy to Iraq today. \nIn truth, we are fighting a war with no cause.\n  These stresses and images from a pointless conflict take a toll on \nour troops. It takes a toll on their families. They suffer mental \nstress, which is no surprise to anybody; it ought to be expected. As \nAmericans across this country--but especially Senators--it is our \nsolemn duty, as those who have not seen the horrors of battle, to care \nfor those who have. Even more so, as the one who sent Americans to \nIraq, it is the duty of the President.\n  Providing mental health care for our children falls under this duty--\na duty that, sadly, this President has failed to fulfill.\n  So I came to the floor this morning to remind my colleagues--my \nRepublican colleagues and this President--actions speak louder than \nwords. Talk does not improve the quality of the living conditions, and \nit doesn't make adequate mental health care available. Talk is cheap. \nEventually, after a lot of talk and no action, words catch up with you. \nThat is what we are seeing today. The Bush administration says they \nhave provided for our Active-Duty warriors and our veterans, but story \nafter story, report after report proves otherwise.\n  Unfortunately, it is pretty clear to all of us now that from \nenlistment to retirement, this administration has failed our troops. It \nis time for us to take action. I look forward to working with all of my \ncolleagues on this floor to have action and not just words. I don't \nwant to see report after report, all this year long and a year from \nnow, stories that continue. We have a responsibility, when we send men \nand women overseas to fight for us, that we are on this floor fighting \nfor them.\n  This Congress, so far, has failed to do that in many ways. This White \nHouse has done it day after day. I call on all of my colleagues to step \nup at every step of the way as we approve bill after bill, supplemental \nbudgets, authorization bills, to stand up and speak out for our troops \nand no longer ignore the reality of this war.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Cuban \npatriot--Mario Chanes de Armas.\n  When we speak of individuals who have spent their lives fighting for \nthe fundamental right of people to live in freedom, we often think of \nindividuals like Nelson Mandela and Natan Sharansky.\n  However, today I want to share with you the story of Mario Chanez de \nArmas. He spent 30 years as a prisoner of conscience in Castro's gulag. \nHe was the longest serving political prisoner the world has known--30 \nyears imprisoned for his political views.\n  Sadly, Mr. Chanes died last week at the age of 80 before his one true \ndream could be fulfilled--freedom for the people of Cuba.\n  I want to extend my condolences to the members of his family and his \nmany friends.\n  He was a man of great conviction and held a true love for humanity. \nMario Chanes was a freedom fighter in the truest sense of the words. \nOriginally a labor leader, Chanes de Armas demonstrated leadership and \ncharisma and was an early ally of the then perceived ``reformer'' Fidel \nCastro. They had worked together for democracy and against the Batista \ndictatorship. He and Castro shared a cell in Batista's prison until \nthey were both released.\n  Shortly after the Castro take over Mario began to see the true nature \nof the individual that was his former cell mate. He realized that \nCastro did not care about civil liberties and human rights or democracy \nas he once claimed but rather Castro became what he remains today--\nirrational, a devoted communist, and an enemy of freedom, a brutal \ndictator. For pointing out the danger Castro posed to Cubans, Chanes de \nArmas was jailed as a counter-revolutionary.\n  He served for 30 years in deplorable conditions.\n  Human Rights Watch reports that Cuban political prisoners spend \nmonths in isolation cells, sometimes without light or ventilation. They \nare often provided no beds--no mattresses. Their rations of food and \nwater are barely enough to sustain life. Sanitation and medical \nconditions are so bad that inmates often leave prison with serious \nailments--if they are allowed to leave at all.\n  Chanes de Armas suffered these conditions. For his continued \nresistance against the dictatorship, he was put in tapiadas, steel \nisolation cells, and gavetas, ``drawers'' so narrow that he only had \nroom to stand. And for what? For refusing to change his political \nbeliefs and for rejecting communism. They never broke his spirit in \nspite of all the punishment.\n  Mr. President, Today I want us to take a moment to remember Mario \nChanes de Armas--to honor him, his legacy, our continued battle for \nfreedom and the ideals in which he believed and tried so hard to bring \nto Cuba--liberty, democracy, human rights, rules of law. His dream \nlives on and his legacy lights the way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/06/senate-section/article/S2651-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2651-S2652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRANSPORTATION SECURITY OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, there are 43,000 men and women working as \ntransportation security officers, or TSOs, for the Transportation \nSecurity Administration. They deserve our respect, not our \nindifference.\n  The McCaskill amendment is straightforward. It provides TSOs basic \nrights and protections in the workplace.\n\n[[Page S2652]]\n\n  The DeMint amendment, however, strips away those rights and \nprotections. Proponents have raised specious arguments about the \nconsequences of providing worker protections to people whose job it is \nto protect us. In fact, the opposite is true.\n  The McCaskill amendment helps ensure that a screening system intended \nto prevent acts of terrorism actually prevents acts of terrorism. If we \nwant TSOs to protect our health and safety, we should protect theirs. \nFor the sake of screeners and travelers both, TSOs should not be \noverworked.\n  For the sake of screeners and travelers both, TSOs should not fear \nretaliation if they report security breaches.\n  For the sake of screeners and travelers both, TSOs should have \nsomewhere to turn if they are being harassed or bullied at the \nworkplace or if there are health and safety issues in the workplace.\n  Basic rights, basic common sense. That is what the McCaskill \namendment is about. It doesn't give TSOs the right to strike. It does \nnot compromise the public safety. Actually, it promotes the public \nsafety.\n  I urge every Member of this body to allow TSOs the same basic rights \nand privileges and protections as other Federal employees. Vote yes on \nthe McCaskill amendment because you care about these workers, and vote \nyes because you care about all of us, the people they are protecting.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I take the floor today to speak on two \nsubjects and very briefly to address my colleague from Ohio. Mr. \nPresident, I wish to make an important point about why these collective \nbargaining provisions are, in fact, harmful to the United States of \nAmerica and to the American people. It is a pretty simple point.\n  Terrorists don't have collective bargaining agreements. I will say \nthat again. Terrorists don't have collective bargaining agreements. \nTerrorists don't go on strike. Terrorists don't call their unions to \nnegotiate before they attack. They are always plotting and, because of \nthis, we must be always working vigilantly to protect our homeland.\n  Today we are debating how quickly we are going to respond to threats \nfrom terrorists who are eager to strike us, and some in this body are \nsuggesting that we should give the ability of the people who are on the \nfront lines to collectively bargain. It is absurd. It is absolutely \nabsurd. But I assure my colleagues, if this collective bargaining \nlanguage stays in, we risk doing exactly that--accepting something \nabsurd.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burr pertaining to the introduction of S. 765 are \nprinted in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/06/senate-section/article/S2652-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2652-S2653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RISK-BASED FUNDING\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I wish to speak this morning in favor of \nFeinstein-Cornyn amendment No. 335 and highlight how important it is \nthat our homeland security grants be awarded on the basis of risk.\n  As we have debated and discussed on the floor of this Chamber on \nnumerous occasions, the smartest and most pragmatic approach to funding \nfor homeland security grants is based on the level of risk faced by \ncommunities, not by some arbitrary formula.\n  It is a simple approach. Places that face more risk and are more \nattractive targets to terrorist attacks should receive more funding. \nThis was the approach articulated and supported by the 9/11 Commission, \nand it is one that this body should have approved.\n  As we all know, the way homeland security funds are distributed now \nreflects a political compromise. It does not reflect a realistic \nassessment of our Nation's security needs. Some money will be based on \nrisk, but all States are guaranteed of receiving some funding.\n  It makes very good sense to create a structure whereby first \nresponder funds are allocated based on risk of a terrorist attack. In \nmy home State of Florida, we have ports, tourism, and population \ncenters. We have major cities, such as Miami, Tampa, and Jacksonville, \nall with stadiums, professional sports franchises, and busy downtowns.\n  As a former mayor of Orange County, I recognize the critical need for \nrisk-based funding of homeland security grants.\n  If you look at the population of Orlando, it appears to be a \nmoderately sized city. However, if one considers the interests of the \ngreater Orlando area with tourist attractions, amusement parks, and \nresorts, at any one time, there can be millions of Americans and \nforeign visitors in the Orlando area.\n  According to the Orlando County Visitors Bureau, roughly 45 million \nvisitors come to central Florida each year--45 million visitors. There \nis no way our current funding system accounts for this reality. Across \nFlorida, we have significant roadways, railways, and some of the \nbusiest ports in the world. We are told all are potential targets, but \nour current method of funding does not reflect the needs of my State or \nthat of many other States. We need to correct this problem. The \nAmerican people expect us to correct this problem. That is why I am \nsupporting the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment.\n  Following the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, this amendment \nwould, first of all, ensure that homeland security grants are allocated \non a risk-based formula built on assessment of threat, vulnerability, \nand consequence to the maximum extent practicable. Secondly, it would \nassure a guaranteed minimum funding for homeland security grants, \nwithout turning the program into another grant system for \nredistributing Federal funds arbitrarily. The amendment also directs \nthe DHS Secretary to consider transient and tourist populations as risk \ntargets for deciding the disbursal of funding for homeland security \ngrants. Finally, it sets minimum performance requirements for homeland \nsecurity grants and a 2-year audit cycle for grant recipients by the \nDHS inspector general.\n  Under this amendment, every State would continue to receive some \nfunding; it is just that now the cities and States most at risk would \nreceive most of the funding. This amendment certainly makes sense to \nFlorida's new Governor, Charlie Crist, who believes it to be the best \noption for Florida. I feel the same way. I know other Senate colleagues \nof mine believe Senators Feinstein and Cornyn have put together a \ncommonsense amendment that helps the cities and States most at risk. I \nwill vote in favor of this amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  Our Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, also thinks it \na prudent move and said as much during a debate on the homeland \nsecurity grants during 2005. Secretary Chertoff remarked then:\n\n       Funding our first responders based on risk and need gives \n     us the flexibility to ensure our finite resources are \n     allocated in a prioritized and objective manner.\n\n  What this means is communities across this Nation--whether they are \nlarge or small; whether or not they would appear to be high-risk \nterrorist targets--are receiving precious resources that are going to \nlocal law enforcement agencies so they can upgrade their equipment and \nother resources. We should not be allocating, in some formulaic method, \nthe limited money set aside for first responders. We need to take a \nmore direct approach.\n  There is a reason terrorists struck New York and Washington on \nSeptember 11: They wanted to strike two of our most powerful cities. \nThey wanted to cripple our Government and sabotage our economy. It is \nfor these reasons that cities such as New York and Washington should \nreceive homeland security grants that are commensurate with that risk. \nA spending formula does not speak to this basic reality.\n  I support the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment and ask my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment as well.\n  As we continue this important debate, the heart of our efforts should \nbe on making America safer, not rewarding particular communities or \ninterest groups. It is disheartening to me that\n\n[[Page S2653]]\n\nso much of the debate thus far has been about granting additional \nrights to unions. Is this going to make us any safer? Is it worth all \nthe time we are spending on it? Of course not.\n  Rather than debating all aspects of union rights associated with our \nnational security, we should be considering some other proposals that \nhave been offered, such as increasing penalties for those found to be \nfinancially supporting the families of suicide bombers or granting \nadditional subpoena authority to Federal terrorism investigators so \nthey can find individuals who wish to do us harm and then bring them to \njustice. This debate should be about strengthening our national \nsecurity; it should not be about strengthening unions. This should not \nbe about political payback; it should be about making America safer. \nAnything less would be a disservice to this body and do little to \nfurther the safety and security of those we are elected to represent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, is there a pending amendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The pending amendment is amendment \nNo. 347.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 333 to Amendment No. 275\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask to set that aside and call up \namendment No. 333.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself, Mr. \n     Thomas, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Sanders, and \n     Mr. Enzi, proposes an amendment numbered 333 to Amendment No. \n     275.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase the minimum allocation for States under the State \n                    Homeland Security Grant Program)\n\n       On page 69, lines 19 and 20, strike ``0.45 percent'' and \n     insert ``0.75 percent''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I can explain this easily. It is a \nbipartisan amendment. I offer it on behalf of myself and Senators \nThomas, Stevens, Roberts, Pryor, Sanders, Enzi, Hatch, and Whitehouse \nto restore the minimum allocation for States under the State Homeland \nSecurity Grant Program. Right now, in the underlying bill, it is \nproposed at .45 percent. Our amendment would restore it to current law \nwhich is .75. That means that every State would have, of the homeland \nsecurity money, at least .75 percent of it.\n  I should point out, incidentally, as with current law, our State \nminimum, under our amendment, would apply only to 40 percent of the \noverall funding of this program. This may sound somewhat tricky, but \nwhat it means is\n\n[[Page S2654]]\n\nwe have special funding for certain unique areas--ports areas, large \ncities and all--but this applies to only 40 percent of the overall \nfunding. The majority of the funds would continue to be allocated based \non risk assessment criteria--again, the idea of a major port, or \nsomething like that, as are the funds under the several separate \ndiscretionary programs which Congress has established for solely urban \nand high-risk areas. These are also governed by risk assessment \ncalculations. That is not something that is going to be affected by the \nso-called small State minimum.\n  The underlying bill before the Senate would reduce the all-State \nminimum for SHSGP in the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program \nto .45 percent. In the other body it is reduced even further, to .25 \npercent. So we know this is going to be a matter in conference under \nany circumstances. In fact, due to the formula differences--it is \nsomewhat complicated, but as a result, there is no guarantee that the \nminimum would not even be further reduced during conference \nnegotiations.\n  Small- and medium-sized States face a loss of millions of dollars for \nour first responders if the minimum is lowered. If you reduce the all-\nState minimum to .45 percent, the underlying bill would reduce the \nguaranteed dollar amount for each State by 40 percent. With the \nappropriations for the formula grants having been cut by 60 percent \nsince 2003--it was $2.3 billion in 2003; it is $900 million in fiscal \nyear 2007--if you have a further reduction in first responder funding, \nit is going to hinder, actually, every State's effort to deal with \npotential terrorist attacks. That applies to fiscal year 2007 homeland \nsecurity and law enforcement terrorism grants which were funded at $525 \nmillion and $375 million, respectively, for a total of $900 million.\n  Under the current all-State minimum, the base amounts States receive \nis $6.75 million. Under the 2007 levels, each State would face a loss \nof an estimated $2.7 million or 40 percent under this new formula, and \nthis is assuming we do not go even lower when we go to conference with \nthe other body. For small States--one that comes to mind is Montana. \nWhy that particular one came to mind I don't know. Maybe looking at the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer made me think of it. But the cuts would \nbe even deeper should the President's budget requests for next year be \napproved. He requested only $250 million for these two important first \nresponder grant programs.\n  Under the .45 percent minimum proposed by the underlying bill and the \n.25 percent minimum proposed by the Feinstein-Obama amendment, the \nguaranteed amount for each State would drop to $1.125 million and \n$625,000 respectively.\n  Again, these are all numbers and percentages you talk about. But what \nit means is it would be a loss of millions of dollars in homeland \nsecurity funding for fire, police, and rescue departments in small and \nmedium-sized States. At the same time we are being told, you have got \nto prepare to be able to do this and do that; we have to be able to \nhave a unified response around our Nation, we are going to have to call \non you first and foremost; you have got to have your radios, your \nequipment, your training. Oh, by the way, find the money somewhere. You \nare part of a national effort, but find the money somewhere in your \nsmall communities or States to do it.\n  It deals a crippling blow to launch federally mandated multiyear \nplans for terrorism preparedness. Basically we can say from Washington \nwhat you should do in these multiyear plans. We tell you how to \ncoordinate, how you train and plan, and it may be a small town on the \nborder, the Federal border, you could be on a major waterway, but find \nthe money somewhere. We want you to do this because the Nation needs \nyou, we just cannot help you.\n  Now, I understand there is a budget crunch. We need a lot of money to \nsend over to Iraq so the Iraqis can prepare for national defense. We \nneed a lot of money to send over to Iraq so they can spend it on their \npolice departments. We need a lot of money to send over to Iraq so they \ncan spend it on their fire departments. I don't know, maybe I am old-\nfashioned in this regard, but I think maybe we kind of ought to look at \nour police departments first, our fire departments first. If I have a \nburglar in the middle of the night, I am not going to call the Iraqi \npolice department, I am going to call my local police department. If we \nhave a fire, I am not going to call the Iraqi fire department, I am \ngoing to call my own fire department. If we have a terrorist attack, if \nwe have a terrorist attack coming across our border or on one of our \nmajor waterways, I am not going to call the Iraqi fire department or \npolice department, I am going to call our own. We are going to be the \nfirst responders. It is not going to do much good to say, sorry, we do \nnot have the money for you because we needed it for your counterparts \nin Iraq.\n  Even if the current .75 percent minimum is applied to the President's \nbudget request, as my amendment does, States would still see a major \ndrop. They would be guaranteed a minimum amount of $1.875 million. That \nis a drop of $4.875 million from the fiscal year 2007 guaranteed \nminimum amount.\n  Now, I have voted for, I have supported, antiterrorist efforts for \nour large States. We have seen what terrorism can do in larger States. \nIn Oklahoma, it was, of course, homegrown. In Oklahoma City it was an \nAmerican, former member of our armed services who attacked. But the \ndamage to our people was as great as somebody coming from outside.\n  In New York City, it was from outside our Nation, the Twin Towers, \nand every one of us who goes to work in this building that was targeted \nfor destruction by the terrorists. I have no problem in giving special \nfunding to places that might be seen as being possible high-profile \ntargets. But I wrote the current all-State minimum formulas as part of \nthe USA PATRIOT Act in 2001 to guarantee each State receives at least a \nfraction of 1 percent, three-quarters of 1 percent of the national \nallotment to help meet their national domestic security needs. Some \nStates may have many times that, of course. But each State receives \nsome kind of a minimum amount because every State--rural, urban, small \nor large--has basic security needs. They are going to have basic \nsecurity requests from the Federal Government, and they deserve to \nreceive Federal funds under this partnership to meet both those needs \nand the new homeland security responsibilities the Federal Government \ndemands.\n  As I said before, high-density urban areas have even greater needs, \nand that is why this year alone we provided $1.3 billion for homeland \nsecurity programs which Montana cannot apply for, Vermont cannot apply \nfor. I don't have any problems with that. There is only a small number \nof urban areas that can, and we have a special pot of money for that.\n  Those needs deserve and need to be met. We are talking about the \namount of money for homeland security which is a fraction of what we \ncurrently are spending in Iraq anyway. At some point we have to talk \nabout what our needs are here inside the homeland.\n  I worked very hard over the years to help address the needs of larger \nStates and high-density areas. I have done it on the Appropriations \nCommittee, I have done it in the Judiciary Committee, and I have \nopposed the administration's efforts to pit our States against each \nother as they have tried to mask their efforts, the administration's \nefforts, to cut overall funding for first responders.\n  Smaller States especially would never be able to fulfill the \nessential duties they are asked to do by the Federal Government on top \nof their daily responsibilities without some Federal support, such as \nDHS currently suggesting that States will have to pay for REAL ID \nimplementation, this idea they have come up with, which is basically \nhaving a national identification card. No matter what you call it, it \nis the first time in our history that we have a national identification \ncard. But you know that is going to cost the States, this idea that was \ncooked up out of an office here in Washington. It is going to cost our \nindividual States $16 billion. If you cut down the minimum even more at \nthe same time you are making substantial drops in overall first \nresponder funding, then small and medium-sized States are not going to \nbe able to meet these Federal mandates for terrorism prevention, \npreparedness, and response.\n  Some from urban States argue that Federal money, the Federal money to\n\n[[Page S2655]]\n\nfight terrorism, is being spent in areas that do not need it; it is \nwasted in small towns. They claim the formula is highly politicized and \ninsist on the redirection of funds to urban areas that they believe \nface these heightened threats of terrorist attacks.\n  Well, what the critics of the all-State minimums seem to forget is \nthat since the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Federal Government \nhas asked every State, every State and every local first responder, \nevery local first responder, to defend us as never before on the front \nlines in the war against terrorism.\n  Emergency responders in one State have been given the same \nobligations as those in any other State to provide enhanced protection, \npreparedness, and response against terrorists. The attacks of 9/11 \nadded to the responsibilities and risks of first responders across the \ncountry.\n  In recent years, due to the .75 all-State minimum allocation for \nformula grants, first responders have received resources to help them \nmeet their new responsibilities. They have made their neighborhoods \nsafer. They made our communities better prepared. A lot has been done.\n  I hope my colleagues will support my amendment to restore the .75 \npercent minimum base and give us the kind of support and resources for \nour police, fire, and EMS services in every State if we want them to \ncarry out the responsibilities.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Utah, one of our \ncosponsors on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing my remarks, Senator Coburn be given an opportunity to make \nhis comments, and then immediately following him Senator DeMint be \ngiven his opportunity to speak here on the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the distinguished President of the Senate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last week I shared some of my thoughts and \nconcerns regarding section 803 of S. 4. I am referring to the section \nthat was inserted into this important piece of legislation during the \ncommittee consideration; this section would permit TSA's Transportation \nsecurity officers, our Nation's airport security screeners, to engage \nin collective bargaining--a change that was not recommended by the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  During those remarks, as a former union member, I argued that \ncollective bargaining would adversely affect one of the greatest \nweapons that our Transportation security officers employ: the \nflexibility to change tactics quickly.\n  Why? Because we all know that one of the central aspects of any \ncollective bargaining agreement is a determination of the conditions by \nwhich an employee works; when a person works, where he or she works, \nand how he or she works are all matters which are open to negotiation. \nObviously, efficiency and productivity can be dramatically affected--\nfor better or worse--by a collective bargaining agreement.\n  In my last address on this issue, I also pointed out that flexibility \nhas been one of the central tenets of our Nation's successful \nantiterrorism response, as was shown so well last August when the \nsecurity services of the United Kingdom discovered a well-organized \nconspiracy that reportedly sought to blow up commercial aircraft in \nflight using liquid explosives disguised as items commonly found in \ncarry-on luggage.\n  As that case showed only too well, quick and decisive action was \nrequired to protect our citizens and commerce from a very real threat. \nThat action was taken by our Transportation security officers, who, \nwithin 6 hours of learning of the plot, made quick use of this highly \nclassified information and trained and executed new security protocols \ndesigned to mitigate this threat.\n  What would have been the result if collective bargaining had been in \neffect? Very real questions and uncertainties can be raised about the \nimpact that a TSA subject to collective bargaining could have had on \nthe discovery of that plot. Should the Government have to bargain in \nadvance over what actions it can or cannot take when dealing with an \nemergency situation? If so, how would we know what to bargain for? \nWould there be time to conduct this negotiation? I think not.\n  One of the TSA's great strengths in responding to the U.K. plot was \nthe fact that a fundamental change in our tactics was accommodated in a \nshort period of time. Would not the vital capability of a uniform \nresponse to emerging threats be drastically curtailed if Transportation \nsecurity officers were permitted to join different unions at various \nairports? Think about that. There would be separate collective \nbargaining agreements at various locations which would force TSA to \nimplement dissimilar procedures in order to meet the legal requirements \nof each agreement. That obviously will not work.\n  I can see the posters now: ``Defend America, but only during the \nhours and under the conditions that my union negotiated.''\n  What about the relationship that will be created between supervisors \nand Transportation security officers? Might not collective bargaining \ncreate an atmosphere of us-versus-them? During a war, is this the \nattitude that we wish to foster? Rather, should we not attempt every \nday to enhance all of our agency's capabilities by building a team \nmentality?\n  What about training?\n  What about training? One of TSA's great successes took place in 2005 \nwhen the agency, in fewer than 6 weeks, was able to train 18,000 \ntransportation security officers in new methods to discover explosives.\n  What would have occurred if a collective bargaining agreement had \nbeen in place? Rules governing training are often found in collective \nbargaining agreements--rules that require further negotiation as to the \nneed, method, and time of training. It is common to hear in other \nsituations that these negotiations require 60 to 180 days before \ntraining is implemented. Would that be a change for the better? I think \nnot.\n  As I mentioned before, during the U.K. plot transportation security \nofficers were retrained in 6 hours, and in fewer than 6 weeks they \nreceived new explosive training. Are we to sacrifice this impressive \ncapability for an ad hoc system that might work after 60 or 180 days of \nnegotiation? I would think not. Now, that would be a true gift to al-\nQaida.\n  Additionally, many collective bargaining agreements require that an \nemployer only judge if a worker has learned a new technical skill on a \n``pass or fail'' basis. Imagine that. Would you feel safe traveling in \nan aircraft knowing that all a security screener had to do was get 1 \npoint above failing to be certified in a technical skill or would you \nfeel safer under the current system that rewards technical skill, \nreadiness for duty, and operational performance? I know which system \ngets my vote.\n  Then there is the question of the law. Can the Federal Government \nprevent employees, especially those with national security functions, \nfrom engaging in collective bargaining? The law and decisions reached \nby our Federal courts are clear. Under section 111(d) of the Aviation \nand Transportation Security Act, the Under Secretary of Transportation \nfor Security--which is the position now held by the Assistant Secretary \nof Homeland Security for the Transportation Security Administration--\nhas the discretion:\n\n       To employ, appoint, discipline, terminate, and fix the \n     compensation, terms and conditions of employment of the \n     Federal service for such a number of individuals as the Under \n     Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out screening \n     functions.\n\n  In 2003, the then-Under Secretary signed an order that stated:\n\n       In light of their critical national security \n     responsibilities, Transportation Security Officers shall not, \n     as a term or condition of their employment, be entitled to \n     engage in collective bargaining.\n\n  Unions, of course, challenged this law before the Federal Labor \nRelations Authority and the Federal courts, charging that it violated \nthe transportation security officers' constitutional rights and Federal \nlaw that allow workers to join unions.\n  The Federal Labor Relations Authority upheld the opinion that:\n\n       There is no basis under law to reach any result other than \n     to dismiss the union's petitions. Congress intended to treat \n     security screeners differently than other employees of the \n     agency.\n\n\n[[Page S2656]]\n\n\n  On appeal to the Federal courts, the D.C. Circuit Court affirmed the \ndecision of the district court that the Federal Labor Relations \nAuthority was the correct venue for the union's complaint and that the \nunion's constitutional claims should be dismissed.\n  As I have said on many occasions, I support collective bargaining, \nbut I will not support collective bargaining under these conditions.\n  We are at war. The decisions we make will mean the difference between \nlife and death. I will not risk the lives of Americans so that an \nimportant constituency of the other party--or both parties, for that \nmatter--can receive a political reward.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this section and \nsupporting the DeMint amendment that will remove it from that bill.\n  Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma \nwishes to speak next, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe section of S. 4, our committee's legislation, which will extend to \ntransportation security officers--so-called TSOs who screen passengers \nand baggage at airports throughout our country--the same employee \nrights most everybody else in TSA and most everybody else in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security already has.\n  I am going to stop for a moment. I note the presence on the floor of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma. I believe there was an order for him to be \ncalled on next. I want to ask him if he intends to address the motion \nto table that will be made at noon.\n  Mr. COBURN. I do.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am going to yield the floor to him, and I hope I can \ntake some time back after he is finished.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the unanimous consent request was for \nmyself, followed by Senator DeMint, and I will be happy to yield if I \nhave remaining time.\n  I need to do a little housekeeping first. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the pending amendment be set aside to call up amendment No. 345.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I object, Mr. President. I don't know which amendment \nthe Senator wants pending. I need to have a conversation with the \nSenator from Oklahoma about which amendment this is.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut objects.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have had a conversation with the \nSenator from Oklahoma, and I remove my objection to his request.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 345\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

Is there objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a little bit of time \ntalking about the process.\n  Yesterday, curiously, we had a hearing on the opportunity for labor \nrepresentation for TSO officers. It is curious in that we had the \nhearing after the bill was on the floor because we didn't have the \nhearing before to know what we were talking about before we formulated \nthe bill. That is because we wanted to rush this bill, and rather than \ndo it right, we did the process backward.\n  But I think it is very instructive for us to hear what the testimony \nwas yesterday. Kip Hawley is the Administrator of TSA. Some very \nimportant things were brought out in that hearing that most Americans \nprobably don't think of often. Let me quote some of the things he said:\n\n       The job of the Transportation Security Officer is one in \n     which you don't know whether you have an emergency until it \n     is over, and in the aviation business, that is too late. \n     There are a bedeviling array of dots out there and we have \n     the responsibility to make sure that not one of them is \n     allowed to progress and become an attack on the United \n     States. So we constantly try to move and adjust and change \n     and you cannot be sure until it is too late that you have had \n     an emergency. You do not get an advanced warning.\n\n  In response to Senator Akaka regarding TSA's collaboration with \nemployees on the decision to double the amount of bonus money that \nwould be made available under their bonus performance plan, the \nquestion by Senator Akaka was:\n\n       Did you invite any union representatives to the initial \n     development efforts?\n\n  In response to his question, he said:\n\n       No, sir. Our employees didn't have to pay union dues to get \n     that service.\n\n  One of the other key points Secretary Hawley made is his concerns \nabout his ability to move and sustain their strategy and flexibility.\n  Also coming out of that was the note that the union which would \nrepresent security officers won't be negotiating for pay. Well, what \nwill they be negotiating for? They will be negotiating over everything \nelse other than pay. Why is it important? Everything else is what \nmatters.\n  What matters is--and specifically the reason this was not allowed \nwhen the 9/11 Commission Report was written and when the bill \nestablishing TSA was set up--there is a moving target, and that \nflexibility in work rules, in relationships, in movement of people, in \ntier job training, and in multifaceted interface of those officers with \nany situation on the ground has to be able to be done and done on the \nmove, all the time--not in an emergency because every day has to be \nthought of as an emergency. What we do know is all that is what they \nwant to negotiate. That is the last thing we should be negotiating.\n  It comes down to this point, and the point is this: Do people who \nwork for the Federal Government have rights? Absolutely. Should they be \ntreated fairly and have the opportunity to have a good wage, a good \nappeal process, whistleblower protection? Yes. But is that right \ngreater than the right of the American people to have secure and safe \nair travel? I would put forth for this body that it is not, that the \nbetterment of the whole and the protection of the whole far outweighs \nany individual right within TSA to collectively bargain on the very \nthings that are going to keep the flying American people safe.\n  What we do know is there are only 1,300 members out of 42,000 \nscreeners now. They can all join a union, and they can have that \nrepresentation in terms of their interface with management. What we \nalso know is that the people who really want this opportunity are not \nthe transportation security officers. Who wants this opportunity is the \nunion and the politics of payback.\n  So this isn't really about responding. As a matter of fact, all of \nthe claims that have been made, we fleshed all those out yesterday in \nthe hearing. As to severance rates, as to work injury, as to movement, \nas to wage rates, as to bonus, as to productivity--all that was fleshed \nout. It should have been fleshed out before this bill ever came to the \nfloor but, unfortunately, it wasn't. All that was fleshed out \nyesterday, and what came down is we have a very responsive agency that \nin the vast majority of the cases is doing a great job with their \nemployees. We have great transportation security officers who are being \nremunerated properly and don't want to pay $360 a year for something \nthat wants to negotiate the very thing that will take away the safety \nof our air transport system.\n  With that, I yield to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from South Carolina to \nyield briefly so I can offer an amendment and then return to the \nregular order.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, if he is offering the amendment without an \nattached speech, I am fine with that. The majority leader limited our \ntime and he will take the floor at 12. I will yield for the offering of \nan amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 352\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the present \namendment be set aside and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 352.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To improve the security of cargo containers destined for the \n                             United States)\n\n       On page 219, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 804. PLAN FOR 100 PERCENT SCANNING OF CARGO CONTAINERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall develop an \n     initial plan to scan 100 percent of the cargo containers \n     destined for the United States before such containers arrive \n     in the United States.\n       (b) Plan Contents.--The plan developed under this section \n     shall include--\n       (1) specific annual benchmarks for--\n       (A) the percentage of cargo containers destined for the \n     United States that are scanned at a foreign port; and\n       (B) the percentage of cargo containers originating in the \n     United States and destined for a foreign port that are \n     scanned in a port in the United States before leaving the \n     United States;\n       (2) annual increases in the benchmarks described in \n     paragraph (1) until 100 percent of the cargo containers \n     destined for the United States are scanned before arriving in \n     the United States;\n       (3) the use of existing programs, including the Container \n     Security Initiative established by section 205 of the \n     Security and Accountability For Every Port Act of 2006 (6 \n     U.S.C. 945) and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against \n     Terrorism established by subtitle B of title II of such Act \n     (6 U.S.C. 961 et seq.), to reach the benchmarks described in \n     paragraph (1); and\n       (4) the use of scanning equipment, personnel, and \n     technology to reach the goal of 100 percent scanning of cargo \n     containers.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 314\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be added as cosponsors of the DeMint amendment: Senators \nVitter, Craig, Roberts, Bunning, Enzi, Hatch, and Graham.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I want to speak about the DeMint amendment \nand make sure all of my colleagues are clear on what is about to \nhappen.\n  The majority leader has said at 12 o'clock today he will make a \nmotion to table or to kill the DeMint amendment to the 9/11 bill. It \nwould be a large mistake for this body to kill this amendment, because \nit enables our airport security personnel to keep Americans safer.\n\n[[Page S2658]]\n\n  One of the biggest threats we have now as a nation is we are \nbeginning to forget 9/11 and what happened and what could happen. We \nare forgetting we are under a constant threat, that we live under \nalerts every day. It is not a matter of saying one day is an emergency \nand one day is not. It is not a matter of saying one passenger is an \nimminent threat but the other one might not be.\n  Our transportation security agency is charged with making sure we \nscreen every passenger, every bag, and that we have an alert system \nbased on intelligence and other information that allows them to move \ntoward possible threats.\n  Unfortunately, we have heard Members of this Senate saying the war on \nterror is not an emergency, that al-Qaida is not a new imminent threat, \nwhen we know that every day al-Qaida may have a new plan to attack \nAmericans at different points.\n  When the Homeland Security agency was formed, we had a debate about \nwhether the transportation security agencies, the officers working for \nthem, the screeners, should have collective bargaining. It was agreed \nat the time, because of the need for flexibility and constant change, \nthat screeners would have the freedom to join a union, and a number of \nworkers' rights and protections were put into place, but that they \nwould not have collective bargaining arrangements as some of our other \nagencies do.\n  I point out we have heard some in this Chamber use border security as \nan example of collective bargaining working. What I hold in my hands is \nonly one example of a collective bargaining agreement for our Customs \nService.\n  We cannot make a case that our border security has worked well. We \nhave over 12 million illegals in this country that testify it is not. \nOur customs system is becoming well known as being one of the slowest \nin the world. Collective bargaining will not work for our airports. I \nam afraid, again, we are beginning to forget we are in an emergency \nsituation. The 9/11 Commission didn't recommend we change current \nairport security.\n  My amendment is designed to keep current law the same. The majority \nleader will ask this Chamber to kill that bill, which would mean we \nwould lose the 9/11 security bill we have all worked on.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several items be printed in the Record. \nFirst is a letter from the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security, \nKip Hawley, who tells us if collective bargaining is implemented with \nthe transportation security agency, it will significantly reduce their \nability to keep our country safe. Next is a letter with over 36 \nSenators signing it, saying they will sustain the President's veto of \nthe 9/11 bill if it hampers our security by injecting collective \nbargaining into the process. Next is a letter from the House of \nRepresentatives, with 155 signatures, saying they will sustain the \nveto.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of the \n           Assistant Secretary,\n                                                    Arlington, VA.\n     Hon. Jim DeMint,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeMint: In the aftermath of 9/11 when the \n     Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was created, \n     Congress gave the TSA extraordinarily flexible human resource \n     tools. Congress recognized--and the 9/11 Commission \n     reinforced--that the terrorist threat is adaptive and that in \n     the post-9/11 era, our security systems must be fast and \n     flexible.\n       The Senate is now considering legislation to replace these \n     effective human resources tools with collective bargaining. \n     Its effect would have serious security consequences for the \n     traveling public.\n       In the post-9/11 environment, TSA's mission requires that \n     its Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) be proactive and \n     constantly adaptive, able to quickly change what they do and \n     where they do it. After the liquid explosives incident in the \n     United Kingdom, TSOs reported for work on August 10 and, \n     without prior notice, trained for and implemented the most \n     extensive security changes rolled out since 9/11--and they \n     did it in real time, literally live and on television.\n       Implementing an outdated system that brings bargaining, \n     barriers, and bureaucracy to an agency on whom travelers \n     depend for their security does not improve security. A system \n     that establishes outside arbitrators to review TSA's constant \n     changes after the fact--without the benefit of classified \n     information that might explain the rationale--would be \n     ineffective, unwieldy, and detract from the required focus on \n     security. Today, TSA is able to make necessary personnel \n     changes to ensure topnotch performance; under collective \n     bargaining, ineffective TSOs could be screening passengers \n     for months while the process runs its course.\n       The TSO position itself has been improved recently. \n     Training has been more professional so TSOs can exercise \n     independent judgment in their work. TSOs are accountable for \n     their performance--with significant pay raises and bonuses \n     available ($52 million just awarded for 2006), and a clearly \n     defined path to promotions and career development.\n       TSA depends on the capabilities granted by Congress to \n     mitigate the real and ongoing terrorist threat. Dismantling \n     those tools and replacing them with a cumbersome, ineffective \n     system would have a troubling, negative effect on security. I \n     urge you oppose provisions that remove from TSA's arsenal the \n     resources and tools that so significantly contribute to our \n     ability to fulfill the security mission.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Kip Hawley.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     President of the United States,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are concerned that one of the \n     provisions in S. 4, the 9/11 Commission Rccommendations bill, \n     will undermine efforts to keep our country secure. Like you, \n     we believe we need an airport security workforce that is \n     productive, flexible, motivated, and can be held accountable. \n     S. 4 would introduce collective bargaining for Transportation \n     Security Administration (TSA) workers, which would reverse \n     the flexibility given to TSA to perfonn its critical aviation \n     security mission. Removing this flexibility from TSA was not \n     recommended by the 9/11 Commission and it would weaken our \n     homeland security. If the final bill contains such a \n     provision, forcing you to veto it, we pledge to sustain your \n     veto.\n           Sincerely,\n     (Signed by 36 Senators).\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2006.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Bush: One of the provisions in S. 4 will \n     severely complicate efforts to keep the traveling public safe \n     and secure.\n       We believe that providing a select group of federal airport \n     security employees with mandated collective bargaining rights \n     could needlessly put the security of our Nation at risk. \n     Moreover, nowhere in the 9/11 Commission Report did the \n     Commission recommend that Transportation Security \n     Administration (TSA) employees be allowed to collectively \n     bargain. We need an airport security workforce that is \n     productive, flexible, and accountable.\n       TSA employees at our Nation's airports currently enjoy the \n     ability to unionize and are afforded a fair and balanced \n     working environment.\n       If a bill is sent to you with such a provision, forcing you \n     to veto the bill, we pledge to sustain your veto.\n           Sincerely,\n                              (Signed by 155 Members of Congress).\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, a vote to kill the DeMint amendment is a \nvote to kill the 9/11 bill we have all worked on. Let there be no \nquestion about it, the vote should be no. There is no reason to change \nthe operation of the transportation security agency and to inject third \nparty negotiations, particularly when it involves sensitive \ninformation.\n  So let us be clear that the motion to table my amendment is a motion \nto make our airports less secure. I urge my colleagues to vote no on \nthe motion to table.\n  Mr. President, I see our minority leader is here. I will yield to him \nfor comments at this time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the leader yield for a parliamentary procedure?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. The Senator from Oklahoma wants to modify an \namendment, I believe.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 294\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, earlier we called up an amendment that was \npending. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside for the moment while we call up amendment No. 294.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 294.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with, and I ask that we return to the \npending amendment.\n\n[[Page S2659]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide that the provisions of the Act shall cease to have \n     any force or effect on and after Dcember 31, 2012, to ensure \n             congressional review and oversight of the Act)\n\n       After title XV, add the following:\n\n         TITLE XVI--TERMINATION OF FORCE AND EFFECT OF THE ACT\n\n     SEC. 1601. TERMINATION OF FORCE AND EFFECT OF THE ACT.\n\n       The provisions of this Act (including the amendments made \n     by this Act) shall cease to have any force or effect on and \n     after December 31, 2012.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 314\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one thing I have learned in my years in \npublic service is that if you want answers to the big problems in our \nsociety, you have to ask the people who work with those problems every \nday. When there is a meth crisis in my State, the first people I want \nto talk to about it are the police chiefs and sheriffs because they are \nthe ones that have to think every day about how a meth distributor \nmight think, where they hide, and how they operate. When I want to know \nhow education policy is affecting children in the classrooms, I talk to \nteachers and parents.\n  So it only stands to reason that if we want to know where the holes \nin our TSA screening processes are, then we ought to be talking to the \ntransportation security officers, or TSOs. These are the people who are \nresponsible for screening airline passengers. A good way for the \nscreeners to band together and share their collective thoughts on how \nto improve safety in our airports is by allowing them to collectively \nbargain. I realize that some members of this body have antiunion \nsentiments. They think that if folks come together and try to negotiate \nfor better pay and working conditions that we won't be able to expect \nconsistently high results.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that before we created a Department of \nHomeland Security, we routinely heard horror stories about the non-\nFederal airport screeners making near minimum wage pay and working in \nterrible conditions resulting in high turnover and a lack of experience \nand dedication to our shared goal of keeping our airways safe.\n  So we created a Federal workforce. We knew that the pay and benefits \nthat the Federal Government provides can attract top notch workers. I \nstrongly feel that Federal TSOs are the first people to care about \nsafety in our airports.\n  I would remind my colleagues that many Federal workers who are \ncritical to our Nation's security, such as Capitol Police, Border \nPatrol agents, Customs agents, and immigration enforcement officers are \nall allowed to collectively bargain while ably serving our Nation's \nsecurity interests. We are simply saying that TSOs should have the same \nrights and responsibilities as other Federal workers performing similar \nfunctions who also are allowed to collectively bargain but not to \nstrike or disclose information that would somehow jeopardize national \nsecurity.\n  I would also like to point out that last fall, the United Nations \nInternational Labor Organization opined that TSOs should have the right \nto organize. This is a disgrace, that we are allowing fear to override \nrationality in supporting our need for a well-trained, well-compensated \nworkforce that can more ably make suggestions about how to improve \nsecurity in our Nation's airports.\n  One of the most critical protections that the DeMint amendment would \nstrip is protection from retaliation against whistleblowers. \nWhistleblowers are some of our most valuable assets in identifying and \neliminating systemic fraud. I, for one, want to see a vigilant Federal \nworkforce ready to shed as much sunlight as possible on any practices \nat any agency that are in contradiction to our goal of promoting the \nnational defense. I don't see a need to explicitly limit TSO \nwhistleblower authority when the Administrator already has the ability \nto expressly prevent TSOs from divulging information that jeopardizes \nnational security. Most notably, FBI whistleblower Coleen Rowley's \ninvaluable information about failures in our intelligence system led to \na reworking of the agency in a way that can hopefully help the flow of \ninformation that could prevent another September 11-type attack. One \nwhistleblower can change the world. Stifling that activity can and will \ndo more harm than good.\n  Here is the irony--administration officials threatening out of one \nside of their mouths to halt legislation containing important homeland \nsecurity improvements over an irrational disposition against unions, \nwhile out of the other side of their mouths calling supporters of the \nright to organize enemies of security. I ask this: Is it so important \nto strip away TSO collective bargaining rights that we must sacrifice \nall of the other important components of this legislation? The truth is \nthat we all want more security. This is precisely why we want TSOs to \nhave fair pay and benefits and a channel for their concerns for \neveryone's safety. We need seasoned personnel with reasonable work \nhours and benefits. A good way to keep good people on the job is by \ngiving them a voice at work. What we are fighting for is a security \nenhancement, not a detraction.\n  The truth is that there is nothing in the collective bargaining \nprocess that would make TSOs less capable of serving the public. We \nhave nothing to lose and everything to gain by giving them collective \nbargaining rights and the clear ability to communicate their concerns \nabout screening protocols with the TSA.\n  I ask my colleagues to defeat the DeMint amendment--to support our \nconstitutionally granted freedom of association, and to protect the \nmillions of Americans who rely on TSOs to protect their safety every \nday.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the men and women who serve as \ntransportation security officers, TSOs, are on the front lines of our \neffort to keep America safe. They do backbreaking, difficult work, day \nand night, to preserve our national security. Yet for years they have \nbeen treated as second-class citizens.\n  These officers do not have the same rights and protections enjoyed by \nmost Federal employees, including other employees at the Department of \nHomeland Security. They don't have a voice at work. They don't have \nprotections if they speak out about safety conditions or security \nissues. And they have no right to appeal if they are subject to \ndiscrimination or unfair treatment.\n  Because they lack these basic protections, TSOs often labor in \ndisgracefully poor working conditions. In 2006, they had the highest \nrate of injury among all DHS agencies--more than twice that of any \nother security agency. Inadequate staffing means TSOs are often forced \nto work mandatory, unscheduled overtime, leaving them exhausted and \ncreating unsafe conditions. They can be fired for speaking out about \nunfair treatment, unsafe working conditions, or national security \nissues, and they have no effective way to appeal such unfair treatment.\n  As a result, TSOs have the lowest morale and highest rate of turnover \namong Federal agencies. In 2006, the attrition rate for TSOs was 16 \npercent--more than 3 times that of any other security agency, and more \nthan 6 times the national average for the Federal government. They have \na higher attrition rate than even high turnover private sector \nemployers. The chances are good that the person preparing your coffee \nat the airport has more experience than the screener who checked your \nbags for bombs.\n  These sky-high attrition rates are alarming. The lack of experienced \nsecurity screeners threatens our national security. Constant turnover \nreduces institutional knowledge and undermines the agency's ability to \nimplement effective security procedures. It also has a high financial \nprice--the cost of training new employees has risen so high that TSA \nhas had to request an additional $10 million in funds from Congress for \nthis year to address these turnover concerns.\n  Low morale and high turnover at a front-line security agency is a \nrecipe for disaster. We have to solve the problem. Our Nation, and \nthese hard-working federal employees, deserve better.\n  TSOs have earned the right to be treated with respect. They deserve \nthe same fundamental workplace rights as other Federal security \nemployees, including whistleblower protections, appeal rights, and \ncollective bargaining rights. The issue is one of basic respect for \nthis valuable workforce.\n\n[[Page S2660]]\n\n  I have heard some deeply disturbing rhetoric from my Republican \ncolleagues about the effect of restoring these collective bargaining \nrights. It has been suggested that if these rights are restored, \nworkers will try to hide behind their contracts and not respond in an \nemergency. It has been suggested that collective bargaining rights keep \nsecurity workers from performing their jobs effectively.\n  These suggestions are an insult to every man and woman in uniform who \nworks under a collective bargaining agreement across this country. To \nsuggest that union workers will not do what is best for our country in \nthe event of an emergency is scandalous, particularly in light of \nrecent history.\n  Every New York City firefighter, EMT and police officer who responded \nto the disaster at the World Trade Center on 9/11 was a union member \nunder a collective bargaining agreement. No one questions these \nemployees' loyalty or devotion to duty because they are union members.\n  On 9/11, Department of Defense employees were required to report to \nwherever they were told, regardless of their usual work assignments. No \nFederal union tried to hold up this process in any way to bargain or \nseek arbitration. Not a single grievance was filed to challenge the \nassignments after the fact.\n  Other Federal security employees already have the protections that \nthe bill would provide, including Border Patrol agents, Capitol police \nofficers, Customs and Border inspection officers, and Federal \nProtective Service officers. Many of these officers--particularly \ncustoms and border inspection officers who work at airports, seaports, \nand border crossings--perform fundamentally similar tasks to TSOs and \nhave been performing them effectively with collective bargaining rights \nfor years. It is an insult to each of these men and women to suggest \nthat they will not be capable of fully performing their important \nduties if they are given a voice at work.\n  Collective bargaining is the best way to bring dignity, consistency, \nand fairness to the workplace. It will make our TSO workforce safer and \nmore stable, and enhance our security. Restoring these essential rights \nis long overdue, and I urge my colleagues to oppose the DeMint \namendment that would remove these valuable protections from the bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the \namendment offered by Senator DeMint that would continue to deny basic \nemployee rights and protections to transportation security officers, \nTSOs, at the Transportation Security Administration, TSA.\n  Yesterday, I chaired a hearing of the Senate Oversight of Government \nManagement Subcommittee to review TSA's personnel system. Very quickly, \nthe discussion turned to collective bargaining. Despite claims that \ncollective bargaining would be a threat to national security, TSA \nAdministrator Kip Hawley said that the San Francisco International \nAirport, which uses private sector screeners who engage in collective \nbargaining, is safe. In addition, Mr. Hawley cited the London bombing \nplot and how TSA needed the flexibility to move TSOs to respond to that \nsituation. When asked, he also admitted that the airports in the United \nKingdom, which have screeners who engage in collective bargaining, are \nalso safe.\n  I, along with every other American, want TSA to have the flexibility \nto move staff and resources as necessary to keep air travel safe. \nHowever, I do not believe that this flexibility precludes workers from \nhaving basic rights and protections. In 2002, when Congress created the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, we debated this very issue. The \nPresident argued that he needed flexibility in the areas of pay, \nclassification, labor relations, and appeals in order to prevent and \nrespond to terrorist attacks. While the Homeland Security Act gave the \nPresident that flexibility, it also explicitly provided for full \nwhistleblower protections, collective bargaining, and a fair appeals \nprocess. I fail to see why TSA employees should be denied these same \nprotections.\n  Since 2001, TSA has faced high attrition rates, high numbers of \nworkers compensation claims, and low employee morale which, in my \nopinion, are a direct result of a lack of employee rights and \nprotections. Without collective bargaining, employees have no voice in \ntheir working conditions, which could drastically reduce attrition \nrates. Moreover, without a fair process to bring whistleblower \ncomplaints, employees are constrained in coming forward to disclose \nvulnerabilities to national security. At our hearing yesterday, Mr. \nHawley said that he knew of only one TSO whistleblower case that was \ninvestigated by the Office of Special Counsel, OSC, in the past 2 \nyears. For non-TSOs, the number of whistleblower cases is 12. However, \nOSC informs me that it has received 124 whistleblower complaints since \nOSC began investigating TSO whistleblower cases. This demonstrates to \nme that even without full rights and protections, employees are trying \nto come forward and disclose wrongdoing and threats to public health \nand safety. However, a lack of protections may keep others from coming \nforward when only one TSO has seen a positive resolution to their case.\n  Granted, TSA has made improvements in managing the screening \nworkforce, but we must build upon these efforts and give employees a \nreal place at the table. Protecting employees from retaliatory action \ncomplements efforts to secure our nation. Strong employee rights and \nprotections ensures that we have a screener workforce focused on their \nmission and not preoccupied by fear of retaliatory treatment by \nmanagement. As such, I urge my colleagues to ensure that TSOs, who work \nto provide safe air transportation for all Americans, receive basic \nworker rights and protections.\n  I have a letter from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association \nwhich opposes the premise that collective bargaining could adversely \naffect national security. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Federal Law Enforcement\n\n\n                                         Officers Association,\n\n                                    Lewisberry, PA, March 2, 2007.\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka, Chairman,\n     Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the \n         Federal Workforce and the District of Columbia, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Akaka: As the President of the Federal Law \n     Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), representing over \n     25,000 Federal law enforcement officers, I am writing to you \n     regarding a potential threat of a veto of vital law \n     enforcement legislation (H.R. 1 and S. 4) that Congress is \n     about to pass, because of the provision giving TSA employees \n     collective bargaining rights.\n       We have sat back in silence and watched the on-going debate \n     over collective bargaining rights for TSA employees, since \n     this does not directly impact our members. However, now that \n     this issue has the potential to stop implementation of the \n     final 9/11 Commission Recommendation Bill, we deem it \n     appropriate to weigh in.\n       The absurd premise put out by both DHS and TSA that being a \n     union member precludes someone from serving our country in a \n     national security capacity is unacceptable. There are \n     currently hundreds of thousands of law enforcement officers \n     on a Federal, State and local level who are all members of a \n     union and have collective bargaining rights. This has never \n     impacted their ability to react to terrorist threats, respond \n     to terrorist incidents or impaired their ability to fulfill \n     their critical mission of homeland security. This was quite \n     evident on September 11, 2001.\n       FLEOA supports and agrees with the recent statement of AFGE \n     President John Gage, when he stated, ``The notion that \n     granting bargaining rights to TSOs would result in a less \n     flexible workforce is just plain nonsense, and is also an \n     insult to the hundreds of thousands of dedicated public \n     safety officers with collective bargaining rights from Border \n     Patrol Agents to firefighters to Capitol Hill Police.''\n       Senator Akaka, thank you for your support in this matter \n     and your continued support for the entire Federal workforce. \n     You truly are a friend to all of us in Federal law \n     enforcement and we appreciate all of your efforts on our \n     behalf.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Art Gordon,\n                                               National President.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the vote we are about to have should \ngive all Members of the Senate a sense of deja vu; we have been here \nbefore. We are about to vote on an amendment that is reminiscent of a \nrather significant debate we had in the fall of 2002 in connection with \nthe creation of the Department of Homeland Security. The\n\n[[Page S2661]]\n\nissue at that time, as is the issue this morning, is the question of \nwhether we are going to have collective bargaining for the \ntransportation security agency.\n  The public spoke rather loudly in the fall of 2002 in the form of \nSenate elections that year. They thought collective bargaining for \ntransportation security workers was not a good idea. The public was \ncorrect then, and I think that is the public view today. In the ongoing \ndebate over Iraq, it is easy to forget the success we have had in \nfighting terrorism, and chief among that is the fact that America has \nnot seen a terrorist attack at home in 5\\1/2\\ years since 9/11. There \nis one reason, and that is the heroic work of our soldiers in \nAfghanistan and Iraq and the tireless efforts of our homeland defenders \nin detecting, preventing, discouraging, and disrupting those attacks in \nour country. Yet, today, these two pillars of our post-9/11 security \nare being put at risk by those who have the audacity to put union work \nrules above the national security.\n  It is no secret that big labor expects something in return for last \nNovember's elections. But America's security should not be on the \ntable. It is ironic that Democrats who campaigned on the pledge that \nthey would implement all of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission \nare now forcing us to consider something that wasn't in the report at \nall. This measure was not in the report and they are blocking us from \nconsidering something that was in the report. I am talking about the \nproposal to give all 43,000 airport screeners the ability to \ncollectively bargain. Not only was this proposal not in the 9/11 \nreport, it would end up undermining the commission's recommendation.\n  A key recommendation of the 9/11 Commission said:\n\n       The United States should combine terrorist travel \n     intelligence, operations, and law enforcement in a strategy \n     to intercept terrorists, find terrorist travel facilitators, \n     and constrain terrorist mobility.\n\n  That is in the 9/11 report. We saw this during the U.K. bombing \nthreat in August. TSA workers who showed up for work at 4 a.m. that \nmorning in the United States were briefed on the plot and trained \nimmediately in the new protocol. Within 12 hours, we had taken \nclassified intelligence and adapted to it. There was no noticeable \nimpact on U.S. flights.\n  It was a different situation over in Great Britain, where \nunionization is the norm. Dozens of flights had to be canceled as they \nworked out an understanding on how they would respond to the new \nthreat, travelers were delayed, and backups ensued literally for days. \nWe saw the importance of mobility earlier that year when TSA acquired \nnew technologies for bomb detection. It trained nearly 40,000 airport \nscreeners in the new methods in less than 3 weeks. The TSA says that \nunder collective bargaining the same training would take 2 to 6 months.\n  We are not going to let big labor compromise national security. The \nPresident has said he will veto a 9/11 bill if it includes collective \nbargaining. We have the votes to sustain that veto. The House has just \nannounced it has the votes to sustain a Presidential veto.\n  This bill will not become law with this dangerous provision in it. \nThe only question now is why we are being kept from passing a 9/11 bill \nthat focuses on security alone. The President made it clear he will \nveto the bill if it includes a provision that compromises security. The \nAmerican people have already made clear where they stand on collective \nbargaining.\n  Remember, as I stated, we have been down this road before. We had a \nhuge debate in Congress over collective bargaining when we created the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Americans didn't like the idea of \nlabor slowdowns among security personnel in 2002. They said so at the \npolls in November of 2002. The answer, I am afraid, is clear: This new \nattempt to insert this into the 9/11 bill is a show that was meant to \nappease a voting bloc. We know how this charade is going to end. \nRepublicans won't let security be used as a bargaining chip. We are not \ngoing to let it happen.\n  It is too bad Americans will have to wait even longer for this bill \nto be signed into law because of the efforts to satisfy organized \nlabor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to table amendment No. 314, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 352\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, just a little while earlier, I offered \nan amendment that deals with trying to move us forward in a middle \nground on the question of cargo screening.\n  Last week, this body voted down an amendment that I offered with \nSenator Schumer that would have set some strong, clear deadlines to \nachieve 100 percent scanning of cargo coming into our Nation's ports. \nWhile I wish we could have persuaded more of our colleagues to support \nthis framework for expanding scanning of our cargo containers, I \nunderstand a number of our colleagues have serious concerns about the \nconsequences of setting a strict timeline to achieve 100 percent \nscanning. I hope this body will take a step forward toward achieving \nthat goal rather than take no action at all.\n  With that in mind, the amendment I have offered I hope will find a \nmiddle ground. This amendment would ensure that we are indeed on the \nroad to 100 percent scanning of cargo, but it would not do so within \nthe confines of any strict deadline. Instead, it builds upon the \nframework of the SAFE Port Act to call for a plan to meet the goal of \n100 percent scanning. The SAFE Port Act already requires the Department \nof Homeland Security to report on the lessons learned from the pilot \nprogram currently underway at six ports. This amendment would simply \nexpand that reporting requirement by calling on the Department to \nsubmit a plan for achieving 100 percent scanning of cargo before it \nreaches U.S. ports.\n  I think all of us agree that we want to obtain the goal of 100 \npercent scanning of cargo containers. We may disagree on how to \nimplement that goal or what timeline we should set, but at the end of \nthe day I think we all know that 100 percent scanning is the ideal that \nwe should strive for. That is essentially what this amendment is\n\n[[Page S2662]]\n\nabout. It simply prods the Department to come up with a plan to take \nthe lessons learned from the pilot project and submit a proposal for \nreaching 100 percent scanning.\n  We have to look at a few contradictions in our national security. Not \neveryone who walks into the White House is a high threat. Yet we screen \n100 percent of people. We need to apply the same understanding to other \naspects of our security. We must recognize that the terrorists will \ncome to understand what we consider as high-risk cargo. As we say we \nare looking at high-risk cargo and we do 100 percent of that, that \nstill leaves 95 percent of all the cargo unscanned. Eventually, the \nterrorists will adapt and they will determine that they should go and \ntry to place their device in that which is not considered high-risk \ncargo. Without 100 percent scanning, we will not be able to adapt to \nterrorists as they change their tactics.\n  We have seen in aviation security how they have changed their \nstrategy from box cutters, to shoes, to liquids. The methods they use \nto infiltrate our security continue to evolve. So must we. We are naive \nto think only high-risk cargo should be scanned. We need to be able to \nbe as adaptable as they are so we can stay one step ahead.\n  My colleagues, in noting their opposition to the Schumer-Menendez \namendment last week, did not object to the goal of reaching 100 percent \nscanning. In fact, the distinguished Senator from Maine stressed the \nimportance of moving forward with vigorous implementation of the SAFE \nPort Act, including the requirement that 100 percent of all high-risk \ncargo be scanned. I would argue this amendment helps achieve that goal \nand will ensure that we continue to move forward toward 100 percent \nscanning.\n  Last year, I offered an amendment that would have required the \nDepartment to develop a similar plan to achieve 100 percent scanning, \nand there were a few provisions my colleague from Maine took issue \nwith, and so we have amended this version. In the scheme of things, \nthis is a very small additional requirement for the Department, but in \nmy opinion it takes us a significant step forward toward a very crucial \ngoal.\n  Finally, this amendment does not ignore the progress we are making \nbecause of the SAFE Port Act. In fact, it would build upon the SAFE \nPort Act's goal of expanding scanning at foreign ports on a reasonable \ntimeline.\n  I also hope my colleagues will not look at the 9/11 Commission Report \nas a way to argue that improving security of our cargo is not in line \nwith the 9/11 Commission recommendations. There is no doubt our ports \nremain one of the most vulnerable transportation assets. The 9/11 \nCommission recognized this. Let's take a step back and look at what the \nCommission actually said.\n  First, I think it is important to keep the Commission's report in \ncontext. It runs nearly 600 pages and covers an incredible amount of \nmaterial, from a factual accounting of the events leading up to \nSeptember 11, an assessment of the weaknesses of our national security, \nand, finally, what the Commission itself calls a limited number of \nrecommendations. The recommendations are wide ranging in scope, and \nthere is no way we can expect each recommendation to carry out each \ndetail of what that recommendation should entail and the action that \nshould be carried out.\n\n  In discussing cargo security, the Commission lumped it together with \naviation and transportation security. Given the nature of the attacks, \nwe understand the obvious focus on aviation security. However, the \nCommission also noted the vulnerabilities in cargo security and \nlamented the lack of a strategic plan for maritime security.\n  In making its recommendations on transportation security, the \nCommission called on Congress to do two very specific things: Set a \nspecific date for the completion of these plans, and hold the \nDepartment of Homeland Security accountable for achieving them.\n  I could not agree more. We come to the floor calling for the \nopportunity to work our way, building upon the present port security \ninitiative--to work our way to see the Department of Homeland Security \ngive us a plan to achieve that final goal, recognizing all of the \nchallenges. In doing so, we move closer and closer to that day in \nwhich, in fact, we will be adaptable to the reality that at some point \nthe terrorists will come to understand that only going after high-risk \ncargo leaves them a huge opening, 95 percent of all the other cargo, to \nget in their weapon of mass destruction.\n  That is not a risk that we can afford. We need to be right all the \ntime. They only need to be right once. Therefore, I believe this is an \namendment that creates a middle ground and moves us forward to that 100 \npercent scanning opportunity and therefore improves our national \nsecurity. I hope when the time comes to vote on it we will have the \nsupport of our colleagues in this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/06/senate-section/article/S2662-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, it was a typical fall day in New York City. \nPeople were headed to work, cars were stuck in traffic, the subways \nwere packed, and the construction crews were busy rebuilding at Ground \nZero. Nearby, Con Ed personnel were at work in a manhole, and they made \na tragic discovery: ID tags and human remains not seen since that other \nfall day 5 years earlier. The city paused again. It launched another \neffort to recover and identify those taken from us on that dark \nSeptember day.\n  The recovery is continuing after all this time. The recovery \ncontinues 5\\1/2\\ years later, and just last week more victims were \nunearthed. After all this time, we are still recovering from September \n11. Our prayers remain with the family members and friends who still \nmourn and miss the fathers and mothers and children who made their \nlives complete. During the Homeland Security Committee meeting to \ndiscuss the underlying bill, I met with some of those loved ones.\n  That is why we are here today. We are here to do the work that \nensures no other family members have to lose a loved one to a terrorist \nwho turns a plane into a missile, a terrorist who straps a bomb around \nher waist and climbs aboard a bus, a terrorist who figures out how to \nset off a dirty bomb in one of our cities. This is why we are here: to \nmake our country safer and make sure the nearly 3,000 who were taken \nfrom us did not die in vain; that their legacy will be a more safe and \nsecure Nation. That is what lies at the heart of this 9/11 bill. It is \nnot just\n\n[[Page S2664]]\n\nabout how we send the money from Washington to States and local \ngovernments; it is about saving lives and doing everything in our power \nto prevent another attack, to prevent another tragedy, to ensure no one \nclimbs down a manhole expecting to do their work only to find the \ndeceased left in darkness 5 years earlier. That is why we are here--to \nprotect our people.\n  Most of us had hoped these steps would have already been taken, would \nhave been taken many years ago, that we would have capitalized on the \nunity and national spirit we shared after the towers fell, the Pentagon \nwas hit, and the Pennsylvania field smoldered. It is never too late to \ndo, however, what is right for our country.\n  It has been more than 2\\1/2\\ years since the 9/11 Commission issued \nits report. Not only did the panel of dedicated American researchers \nfind out what happened that day, but they also gave a list of serious \nrecommendations about how to make our country safer in the future. The \n9/11 Commission showed us how to move beyond the politics of division \nin order to achieve the solemn task of better protecting our country.\n  In its report, the Commission said the following:\n\n       Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an \n     assessment of risks and vulnerabilities [and] federal \n     homeland security assistance should not remain a program for \n     general revenue sharing.\n\n  This is one of the goals of the 9/11 Commission. My amendment that I \njust introduced moves us closer to a true system of risk-based \nallocation of State homeland security grants and ensures that funding \ngoes to areas most at risk of terrorist attacks.\n  This is not an issue of big States versus little States or urban \nStates versus rural States. It is about good policy and about \nmaximizing our use of the people's money.\n  Today, the system is set up so that all States receive at least .75 \npercent of the State Homeland Security Grant Program dollars. After \neach State receives that minimum level of funding, the dollars are then \nallocated according to risk. As a result, the current amount of State \nminimum funding eats up approximately 40 percent of that funding.\n  While the new bill does attempt to address this problem--and I \napplaud Chairman Lieberman and Senator Collins for trying to bring the \n.75 percent down to .45 percent--the bill does not go far enough. It is \na good first step, but we are already 50 yards behind, sending too much \nmoney to areas where there are not real risks, threats, and \nvulnerabilities. That is why we must use the most dollars in those \nareas which are at the greatest risk of attack. We cannot afford to \nwaste a single cent on places that do not need immediate help when \nfirst responders in major cities still lack the basic communications \nequipment they need to talk to one another if, Heaven forbid, tragedy \nstrikes again.\n  That is why the families of 9/11 recently issued a statement saying:\n\n       Reports of air conditioned garbage trucks being purchased \n     with homeland security funds are indicative of the frivolity \n     that results from non risk-based methods. When the threat \n     against our Nation is so real, we cannot afford not to take \n     it seriously.\n\n  That is why the 9/11 Commission said Congress should not use this \nmoney as porkbarrel. That is why in 2005 the Commission issued a report \ngiving the Nation an ``F'' for risk-based funding. That is why 9/11 \nCommission Chairman Lee Hamilton recently sent me a letter. He wrote:\n\n       Since 9/11 and since the issuance of our report, the United \n     States has not allocated homeland security resources wisely. \n     Resources for homeland security are not unlimited, so it is \n     thus essential that they be distributed based on a careful \n     analysis of the risk, vulnerability and potential \n     consequences of a terrorist attack. Adopting such a risk-\n     based approach would make the best use of our homeland \n     security resources, and would make the American people safer.\n\n  That is why 9/11 Commissioner Tim Roemer wrote in support of this \namendment, saying:\n\n       We cannot afford to waste any more money, time or effort.\n\n  That is why the amendment I offer today, a bipartisan amendment with \nthe support of Senators Warner, Coburn, Landrieu, Kennedy, Menendez, \nClinton, and Schumer, reduces the guaranteed State minimum to .25 \npercent and allows those States on our northern and southern borders to \nsee an increased minimum of .45 percent. This basic framework was \nadopted by a wide bipartisan margin in the House in January.\n  It is time for all of us to approach homeland security funding not as \nsomething we can bring home to the States we represent but funding we \ncan use to better protect the United States of America. As we lower the \nguaranteed amount, we increase the funding available to protect those \nplaces most at risk, and 40 States will receive either the same amount \nor an increase in the funding they need to better protect our borders, \nour ports, our railways, our subways, our chemical plants, our nuclear \npowerplants, our food supply, and our firefighters, police officers, \nand EMTs.\n  We have waited more than 5 years to better develop our approach to \nfunding our security in a post-9/11 world. Sometimes division and \npolitics have prevented us from doing what we need to do. But I believe \nthose days are finally behind us. We have a real chance to not only \nlearn from our mistakes but to get the job done and better protect our \npeople. That is why we are here--to make our country as safe and secure \nas we can. That is the common cause we all share. The American people \nneed to see that in us today. The 9/11 Commission experts that from us. \nThe families and friends of the 9/11 victims are owed that from us--\nthat we will never forget those who died. We will never forget those \nwho are suffering and sick because of their heroism that day. We will \nnever forget that 60 percent of the victims were never identified. We \nwill never forget that we are still recovering from 9/11--and that is \nwhy our work goes on.\n  Mr. President, let me add one last point.\n  I recognize it is difficult for some to see any shift of funding \nbecause it is difficult if that State potentially sees their funding \nreduced. But even within Illinois, I confront some of these same \nissues.\n  The fact of the matter is I have fought at the State level and have \nsaid publicly we should make sure risk assessments entirely determine \nhow money within Illinois is allocated. That is the same approach we \nneed to take for the Nation as a whole. Keep in mind my home city of \nChicago is actually doing quite well under the current formula. So this \nis not something that is based solely on any parochial concerns.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statements of the 9/11 families, the \n9/11 Commission chairman, Lee Hamilton, and 9/11 Commissioner Tim \nRoemer be printed in the Record, as well as a chart showing how each \nState would fare under my amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Woodrow Wilson International\n\n\n                                          Center for Scholars,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2007.\n     Senator Barack Obama,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Barack: Thank you for inquiring about my position with \n     regard to risk-based homeland security funding.\n       In our report, the 9/11 Commission issued the following \n     recommendation:\n       ``Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on \n     an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities. Now, in 2004, \n     Washington D.C. and New York City are certainly at the top of \n     any such list. We understand the contention that every state \n     and city needs to have some minimum infrastructure for \n     emergency response. But federal homeland security assistance \n     should not remain a program for general revenue sharing. It \n     should supplement state and local resources based on risks or \n     vulnerabilities that merit additional support. Congress \n     should not use this money as a pork barrel.''\n       Since 9/11, and since the issuance of our report, the \n     United States has not allocated homeland security resources \n     wisely. Resources for homeland security are not unlimited, so \n     it is thus essential that they be distributed based upon a \n     careful analysis of the risk, vulnerability, and potential \n     consequences of a terrorist attack. Adopting such a risk-\n     based approach would make the best use of our homeland \n     security resources, and would make the American people safer.\n       With best wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lee H.

By reducing \n     the amount of funding available through the ``minimum \n     allocation,'' this amendment increases the availability of \n     funding for our most at-risk facilities and infrastructure.\n       As you know, the bi-partisan National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, said:\n       ``We understand the contention that every state and city \n     needs to have some minimum infrastructure for emergency \n     response. But Federal homeland security assistance should not \n     remain a program for general revenue sharing. It should \n     supplement state and local resources based on risks or \n     vulnerabilities that merit additional support. Congress \n     should not use this money as a pork barrel.''\n       Two years ago, the Commission gave Congress and the \n     administration failing grades in their implementation of our \n     recommendations: five Fs, twelve Ds, and 2 Incompletes. On \n     homeland security, the government received an F because too \n     many of our vulnerabilities received too few resources. We \n     cannot afford to waste any more money, time or effort.\n       Obviously, there is much more to accomplish to make America \n     safer. I commend these efforts to move the Senate in a better \n     direction and believe this amendment creates the opportunity \n     for the full spirit of the 9/11 Commission's recommendation \n     to be realized in conference with the House.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                Timothy J.

There \n     are limited funds to protect our homeland--each and every \n     dollar should be spent effectively on protecting the areas at \n     most risk as a first priority. None should be used for \n     general revenue sharing or political purposes.\n       The 9/11 Commission recommends that homeland security \n     assistance be based ``strictly on an assessment of risks and \n     vulnerabilities.'' They continue to say that ``Congress \n     should not use this money as a pork barrel.'' We stand in \n     complete agreement.\n       Reports of air-conditioned garbage trucks being purchased \n     with homeland security funds are indicative of the frivolity \n     that results from non risk-based allocation methods. When the \n     threat against our nation is so real, we cannot afford not to \n     take it seriously.\n       Congress has a duty to spend taxpayer dollars wisely to \n     protect the homeland. Sometimes the right choices are not \n     easy--we understand that. But the stakes are too high not to \n     make them. We ask Congress to do what is right and to \n     legislate that all homeland security grants be allocated \n     strictly on appropriately-assessed risk.\n

Mr. President, I wish to commend Chairman Lieberman and \nSenator Collins for their hard work on this issue. I acknowledge that \nthe underlying bill is an improvement over the status quo. It is just \nthat we can do so much better. I ask that we ensure this amendment be \nincluded in the final package we vote on.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for \nhis thoughtful statement on his amendment. I rise to respectfully \ndisagree with it.\n  In our committee, we work very hard to not just balance the political \ninterests, but to balance the needs of all parts of our country for a \nreasonable amount of homeland security funding, which we, consider, I \nthink, consistent with the most progressive thinking on this subject \nwhich is to be not just terrorist-related funding but all-hazards-\nrelated funding.\n  In other words, when we send homeland security funding to a State or \na municipality, we are trying to help them not only prepare for the \npossibility, God forbid, of a terrorist attack but also to be ready to \nrespond to the much more common occurrence, which is to say a natural \ndisaster. The funding formula we have presented, which was part of our \nbill that came out of our committee with strong bipartisan support, \nincluding the support of the\n\n[[Page S2666]]\n\ndistinguished occupant of the chair, the Senator from Delaware, is I \nthink a balanced proposal.\n  This distributes, in fact, most of the homeland security grant money \nbased on risk, as the 9/11 Commission called for, but respectfully \ndisagrees with the Commission that the money should all be distributed \nbased on only risk because our conclusion is not based on theory but \nreality. Terrorists may strike anywhere in this country, not just in \nthe big cities or the highest visibility targets, and we base that on \nwhat has happened around the world, what has happened here, in fact, \nwith domestic terrorism, striking at the Murrah Federal Building in \nOklahoma City, as we all remember some years ago, but around the world, \nterrorists striking at apartment buildings, discos, schools, in \ncommunities large and small.\n  Unfortunately, in this age we are living in post-9/11, we can all \nimagine, and I use that term in the way the 9/11 Commission did, that \npart of our failure as a nation before 9/11 was a failure of \nimagination, which is to say that we could not imagine that human \nbeings would do what the terrorists did to us on 9/11.\n  After that, we started to imagine, and one can imagine the various \ntargets in this open society of ours that terrorists who want to create \nhavoc and fear can strike all around the country.\n  The other point is this, that everyplace in the country, as we saw in \nthe case of Katrina, most visibly and movingly, can be struck by \nnatural disasters. So the funding formula in the committee bill learns \nboth from the tragic lessons of 9/11 and Katrina.\n  We have different grant programs. The Urban Area Security Initiative, \nthe so-called UASI Grant Program, is totally and strictly, in terms of \nthe 9/11 Commission, distributed based on risk. In fact, the State \nHomeland Security Grant Program which Senator Obama's amendment deals \nwith, we think 95 percent of that will be given out based on risk.\n  Let me give a brief explanation of what is happening. This is in the \nweeds, but under current law, .75 percent is guaranteed--of the total \nfunding for the State Homeland Security Grant Program--is guaranteed to \neach State. That is a minimum for each State for the reasons I have \nstated.\n  The House of Representatives, in their judgment, altered that and \nwent to a minimum amount of .25. They did not literally respond to the \n9/11 Commission recommendation for total risk, which is to say, \nwhatever the Department of Homeland Security decided is a risk \nassessment formula for distribution, they lowered it to .25, as the \namendment from the Senator from Illinois would do. The committee \ndecided to reach for a compromise on this one and set a minimum of .45 \npercent of the total funding for every State.\n  We have done some runs on this. The formula says that, distribute the \nfunds first based on risk, but then if States fall below the .45 \npercent, then give them that minimum. By our run of the numbers, \nbased on the risk assessment standards the Department has been using, \nwe think 95 percent of the money will, in fact, be distributed based on \nrisk.\n\n  I wish to make this point, something that I think is sometimes \noverlooked in the discussion. Take the existing formula which has .75, \nthree-quarters of 1 percent of the total, going to each State. The fact \nis, even under that formula, which only Senator Leahy, in his wisdom, \nwould preserve in his amendment--even under that formula, the lion's \nshare of the money, or a very large share of the money, has gone to a \nvery few States.\n  This graph shows that. The fact is, this is fiscal year 2006 funding. \nIn fiscal year 2006, the State of California received $226 million in \nhomeland security grant funding. That is more than the total received \nby the 22 States at the bottom that received the least funding, the \nminimum.\n  Now, as you can see in this chart, that is California. Next is New \nYork. Next is Texas. The fact is almost half of the entire distribution \nof funding went to five States: California, Florida, Texas, Illinois, \nand of course New York. So what I am saying is that we are lowering \nthat. I think the big States, the high-visibility potential targets are \nreceiving a lot of money. It would be unfair to cut that even more. \nNow, Senator Feinstein does not only do what Senator Obama does, she \ncuts into the minimums we have established in the new dedicated grant \nfunding program for interoperability communications.\n  There I think we have a very strong argument that we want people, our \nfirst responders, to be able to communicate with one another, not only \nin acts of terrorism--in times of terrorism--but in times of natural \ndisaster. The interoperability grants are important for that reason.\n  We have placed a chart on the desks of all the Senators, and it lists \nall the States. It shows that under the amendment the Senator from \nIllinois has introduced, 32 of the States will receive less guaranteed \nfunding than they receive now.\n  Ironically, the District of Columbia is one of the entities that \nsuffers the greatest cut. Of course, most anybody would say that the \nDistrict of Columbia is a high-visibility target, in fact, was targeted \nthrough the Pentagon on 9/11/2001.\n  Respectfully, I will oppose the amendment of the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nColeman and Senator Coburn be added as cosponsors to the Collins \namendment No. 342.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Illinois to reduce the minimum guarantee to \nStates under the State Homeland Security Grant Program.\n  My colleague and friend from Connecticut has done an excellent job \nexplaining the problems with this amendment. Let me reinforce a few of \nthe points he has made. As my colleagues can see from the chart behind \nme, under Senator Obama's amendment, 32 States and the District of \nColumbia would have a decrease in the guaranteed funding. Under the \nObama amendment, two previous targets of attack, both the District of \nColumbia and Oklahoma, would receive less guaranteed funding than 18 \nother States. Indeed, Senator Obama's own projections show that the \nDistrict of Columbia, presumably one of the highest risk areas in the \ncountry, would lose almost 45 percent of its total funding under his \nproposal\n  I think we need to keep in mind that assessing risk is not an exact \nscience. Who would have guessed that Portland, ME, would have been the \ndeparture point for two of the hijackers on 9/11? Who would have \nguessed that four of the hijackers would train and live in Norman, OK? \nWho would have guessed that two of the hijackers would have spent \nconsiderable time in Stone Mountain, GA? My point is the evidence is \nclear that terrorists train, hide, and transit through more rural \nareas, which is one reason that the chairman and I have put such \nemphasis on preventing terrorist attacks and have allocated a \npercentage of funds to be used specifically for that purpose.\n  Now I wish to specifically address the chart that is being circulated \nby the distinguished Senator from Illinois. The breakdown of the \nwinners and losers under his amendment on his chart relies upon the \nDepartment of Homeland Security allocating future risk-based funding in \nthe same manner as it did in 2006. We know that is not going to happen. \nThe process by which the Department allocated funding based on its risk \nanalysis was denounced all around. I could quote the Senators from New \nYork and California, as well as the Senator from Connecticut, \nMinnesota, and myself. All of us believed that whether we represented \nbig States, small States or medium-sized States, the methodology was \nflawed.\n  Indeed, the Department has moved away from that methodology. So it is \na false assumption to assume the exact same risk analysis is going to \nbe used in future years, when, in fact, we know it would not be. I wish \nto point out, in fiscal year 2006, 60 percent of the Homeland Security \nGrant funds were allocated based on risk. We are requiring that an \nestimated 95 percent be allocated based on risk, but we want that risk \nformula reported to Congress. We want to take a look at it. We are \nworking with the Department on it. If we\n\n[[Page S2667]]\n\nare going to become better prepared as a nation, all States must have a \npredictable, steady stream of homeland security funding. We need to \nbring all States up to reach minimum levels of preparedness, because \notherwise the terrorists will exploit the weak links.\n\n  We also know many of the parts of our critical infrastructure are \nlocated in more rural areas. Nuclear powerplants are a prime example. \nMilitary bases are yet another example. So the problem is one cannot \nassume the only targets are in large urban areas. That is not true.\n  There was another point the Senator from Connecticut made that is a \nvery important point, and that is this is an all-hazards approach to \nfunding. As the Presiding Officer well knows, because he participated \nso actively in the investigation held by the Homeland Security \nCommittee into the failed response to Hurricane Katrina, there is \nvirtually no area of our country that is immune from natural disasters. \nThe same kinds of communications equipment that come into play when \nthere is a terrorist attack are also needed when a hurricane or an ice \nstorm or an earthquake strikes. So I think we have struck the right \nbalance in our proposal.\n  Now, I would note the Senator's proposal does not hit my home State. \nIt does not hurt Maine, because he has additional funding for border \nStates, so I am not arguing out of a parochial interest. I am arguing \nfor the formula in our bill because it takes an all-hazards approach. \nIt understands all States have vulnerabilities. It recognizes we need \nto improve every link in the chain, that we need to bring all States up \nto minimal levels of preparedness, and they are simply not there now. \nIt recognizes we need predictable funding streams so that States, \nregions, and communities can enter into multiyear projects, because a \nlot of these projects, such as with interoperable communications, \nrequire more than 1 year to get to the goal.\n  The potential of terrorist attacks against rural or at least nonurban \ntargets is increasingly recognized as a national security threat. Our \ncommittee held hearings on the threat of agri-terrorism--an attack on \nour food supply. That would be devastating for our Nation. A study \nconducted by the Harvard School for Public Health shows rural areas \nface profound homeland security challenges. A great many power and \nwater supplies, as well as virtually our entire food supply, are \nlocated outside of urban areas.\n  The RAND Corporation has repeatedly warned:\n\n       Homeland security experts and first responders have \n     cautioned against an overemphasis on improving the \n     preparedness of large cities to the exclusion of smaller \n     communities or rural areas.\n\n  Again, that report recognized much of the Nation's infrastructure and \npotential high-value targets are located in rural areas.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us in voting against the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Illinois. I truly believe it would not \nadvance the goal we all share of strengthening our homeland security.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. If the Senator from Maine will yield, I want to ask a \ncouple of questions based on my understanding. Maybe I am confused.\n  We based our assessment of which States see an increase, which States \ndo not see an increase, and which States see a decrease under our bill \non the CRS analysis, assuming $913 million appropriated. They tell us \n34 States will see an increase in funding, 6 States will see the same \namount of funding under my amendment to S. 4, and 10 States will see a \nloss. We have not had the benefit of the analysis that was just \npresented on that chart indicating 32 States would see a decrease, so I \nam curious if either the chairman or the Senator from Maine would tell \nme where they got that statistic. Because I understand the statement \nwas made: Well, the formulas may change, and this was based on the \nprevious formula.\n  I have no problem with changing the formula so it is more risk-based \nassessed. But I don't understand how it is that simply because we are \ngoing to eliminate some of the flaws of the previous formula that \nsomehow--or the risk assessments, that somehow that is going to change \nthe basic assessment that was made by the Congressional Research \nService.\n  I am happy for either Senator to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will start a response. Senator Obama has circulated \na document which indicates if this formula is applied, I believe 34 \nStates will get more money than under our proposal. We have a chart we \nare circulating which says that, in fact, 32 States lose. That is \ntranslated into the map here. Here is what the difference is, because \nin some sense we are measuring different things. In our chart, we are \nmeasuring the guaranteed funding of .45 under ours and .25 under that \nof the Senator from Illinois. The reason we are doing that is because \nthat is all we can say with certainty that is guaranteed. We are both \nin fact using the same bottom line or top line, which is $913 million, \nwhich is the level the bill, S. 4, authorizes for the State Homeland \nSecurity Grant funding. The reason this says 32 States and the District \nof Columbia will lose guaranteed funding under the amendment of the \nSenator from Illinois is because that is what we have studied: the \nguaranteed minimum. Because the rest is an assessment of risk that is \nleft to the Department of Homeland Security which it applied this year \nand it has already said it would never apply again because it was so \ncriticized by New York and others.\n  So let me in fairness yield--it takes two of us to equal the Senator \nfrom Illinois on this.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Very briefly----\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. We will roundrobin. I yield to my friend from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Thank you very much. I want to make clear now, it sounds \nto me as if we are comparing apples and oranges. Assuming we--which is \nwhat CRS did--apply the same formula on my amendment, my amendment \nwould have 34 States see an increase in funding, and 6 States would \nremain the same. Now, if the funding formula changes, it might change 1 \nor 2 States, depending on what the risk assessments were, but it is not \ngoing to result in 32 States suddenly seeing a decrease in funding. \nThis is a decrease in funding based on the bare minimums without \napplying any of the additional funding which we know is going to be \ncoming. So it strikes me that chart does not describe at all the \nreality of what would happen under my amendment. I want to make sure I \nam clear in terms of what we are preparing here, because the best \nestimate of how this funding will be impacted is based on the CRS's own \nassessment of what would have happened this year.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. OBAMA. It is their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I certainly yield to the distinguished Senator from Maine \nto respond to my inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Madam President. I thank the Senator from \nIllinois so that I may respond to his questions.\n  The only thing we can count on is what the minimum is going to \nproduce. CRS, the same as the Senator from Illinois, used last year's \nDHS risk assessment--a risk assessment we already know DHS has \nabandoned; a risk assessment that resulted in significant cuts in \nfunding to New York City; a risk assessment that was roundly criticized \nby virtually every member of our Homeland Security Committee. What we \nare trying to do is to share with our colleagues what we know for sure, \nand what we know for sure is what the impact of the minimum funding \npercentage is under our proposal versus under the proposal of the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  What we did is we looked at what the guaranteed funding--that is why \nit says guaranteed funding--would be under Senator Obama's amendment, \nand as you see 32 States and the District of Columbia would lose under \nthe amendment. I say to my friend from Illinois that I am surprised he \nwould want to cut funding for the District of Columbia when that is a \nhigh-risk area that did not do well under the Department's formulation \nof applying risk\n\n[[Page S2668]]\n\nand thus does not do well under the formula of the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, I want to be exactly clear on what we are \ntalking about here so there is no confusion among my colleagues. No one \ndisputes that under my amendment, the minimum funding changes. That is \nthe whole point of the amendment, is to change the minimum funding \nlevels and shift more of the money into the risk-based assessment. So \nto state that 32 States lose on the minimum funding levels is to state \nthe obvious. That is the point of the amendment.\n  The point is more money then goes into the risk-based funding, and \nwhen you factor that in, unless there is going to be no risk-based \nfunding--I mean I suppose that is a possibility, but I don't think so--\nall that money, when you factor it in, will result in, under last \nyear's formula, 34 States gaining and 6 States staying the same.\n  Now, I also agree with the distinguished Senator from Maine that \nthere were problems with last year's formula, and I am fine with \nchanges to that formula. I have actively supported changes to that \nformula, including any possible shortchanging of high-risk areas such \nas Washington, DC or New York.\n  The point of my amendment is very simple, and that is more money is \nallocated on the basis of risk. I am not concerned about predetermining \nwhere those risks are. That is the job of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and that is the purpose of our amendment.\n  I want to be clear. Under your chart, Illinois loses money that is \nguaranteed under the minimum funding, as does New Jersey, Oklahoma, and \nLouisiana. But I would note that Senators Menendez, Coburn, and \nLandrieu were all cosponsors because they understand when the money is \nallocated based on risk, then wherever we live throughout the United \nStates, we are going to be potentially better off.\n  I am going to make one last point and then I am happy to listen to a \nresponse. Both Senators Lieberman and Collins talked about an all-\nhazards funding approach. I have no objection to that either. But keep \nin mind, we are talking here about the State Homeland Security Grant \nProgram, which is not supposed to be targeted at all hazards. We have a \nseparate program--the Emergency Management Grant Program--that is \nsupposed to be addressing all hazards and that is why this amendment \ndoes not touch that portion of homeland security funding that is \ndirected at all hazards. That is not the purpose of the State Homeland \nSecurity Grant Program. The purpose of that is supposed to be to deal \nwith potential terrorist threats. That is why the 9/11 Commission and \nChairman Lee Hamilton of the 9/11 Commission and the 9/11 families, all \nof whom I think have great concern about the safety of all Americans, \nindicate it makes sense for us to allocate this as much on the basis of \nrisk as possible.\n  It is for that reason that the House allocated funding on the basis \nof the formula we are discussing. I wish to make sure that anybody who \nis listening understands, yes, the guaranteed minimum funding might be \nless for 32 States, but that is because more of the money goes into the \npot based on risk. When you add the funding that will be allocated on \nthe basis of risk, then we can assume that at least 34 States would see \nan increase under my amendment, and 6 States would see about the same \namount of funding. If the formula changes, it is conceivable that \ninstead of 34 States, it may be 32 States or 36 States that see an \nincrease in funding; instead of 6 States with the same amount under \nboth amendments, it might be 4 States or 8 States. But the basic \nprinciple is that the funding is going to be allocated on risk. The \nEmergency Management Planning Grant Program deals with all-hazards \nfunding.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, very briefly, this is an important \ndebate. I say this to my friend from Illinois about the CRS estimate of \nhis amendment.\n  If you take the risk analysis the Department of Homeland Security \napplied for this year, those numbers look correct. But what we are \nsaying is we know the Department of Homeland Security would not use \nthat same risk analysis because they have said so. We also know the \nrisk analysis has changed year by year through the Department of \nHomeland Security. I am going to be real local about this. My hometown, \nNew Haven, CT, in the fiscal year 2004 grant, got a grant under the \nHomeland Security Grant Funding Program, specifically the Urban Area \nSecurity Initiative. In the years since then, because the risk analysis \nchanged, New Haven has received zero UASI money. So that is the basis \non which we contend that the Senator's amendment would amount to 32 \nStates getting less money than they would under our proposal.\n  Our proposal is evaluated based on the guaranteed minimum because \nthat is all we will know for sure after we adopt the law.\n  My friend from Illinois is good, but he has not reached the level of \nprophet. None of us can know--perhaps Secretary Chertoff--what the \nDepartment of Homeland Security will use as a risk analysis formula in \nthe years ahead. The top five States are getting about half of the \nhomeland security grant funding now at the .75 level, and we are coming \nin, in the spirit of compromise, at .45. So they will probably get a \nlarger share of that money--California, Florida, Texas, Illinois and, \nof course, New York.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I think it has been a good debate. The \nSenator from Illinois offered a thoughtful amendment, raised some \nquestions, and I think the managers of the bill, the Senators from \nConnecticut and Maine, have defended well the language in the bill.\n  For our colleagues who may be watching this--or if they are at \ncommittee hearings, perhaps their staffs are watching--I ask a couple \nof rhetorical questions as we decide how to vote on Senator Obama's \namendment.\n  Should most of the funds for homeland security be allocated on the \nbasis of risk? Sure. Should the lion's share of the funding be \nallocated on the basis of risk? Certainly, it should. Should all the \nfunding for homeland security be allocated on the basis of risk? No.\n  What Senator Obama is trying to do is thread the needle and get us \ncloser to somewhere between the lion's share and all the funds being \nallocated on the basis of risk. We have all heard the old adage that \nbeauty is in the eye of the beholder. So is risk. Senator Collins \ntalked about some staging that was done by the perpetrators of violence \non 9/11 from places such as Stone Mountain, GA; Portland, ME; and maybe \nNorman, OK. Maybe Senator Lieberman talked about the kinds of targets \nthat terrorists have chosen in this country and others that maybe would \nnot have come to mind, such as the Federal courthouse in Oklahoma City, \nin a disco or a bus or a train.\n  I don't think most people think of Delaware as a very high-risk \nState. As we think what is a target for terrorists, in my State we have \na lot of chemical plants. Delaware used to be known as the chemical \ncapital of the world; I don't know if it still is. We have a lot of \ninviting targets for people who want to do mischief. There are nuclear \npowerplants across the river in New Jersey, and they are closer to my \nhome than to the Senator's from New Jersey. We have northeast corridor \ntrain tracks, not just for passengers, that run up and down my State on \nwhich all kinds of hazardous cargo is carried by Norfolk Southern and \nCSX Railroad. We have a busy Delaware River; hazardous cargo goes down \nthat river every day.\n  Some people might look at those in my State and say there is not much \nrisk there and, as a result, they don't need extra money. In my \njudgment, those are risky targets, which invite some mischief. We don't \nneed an enormous amount of money to help prepare for some harm that may \ncome to those targets and the people who live around them, but we need \na reasonable amount. The idea that .45 percent of one program, among \nseveral that are funded through this bill, is somehow too much, I don't \nbuy that. The real compelling point is that, if you do the math, \nmultiply .45 percent times 50 percent, you come up with .22, .23 \npercent on the basis allocated by the fact that your State is under the \nminimum.\n\n[[Page S2669]]\n\nWhen you run through the numbers, as the Senators have said, 95 percent \nof the money under this funding program, the State Homeland Security \nGrant Program, would be allocated on the basis of risk. For the Urban \nArea Security Initiative, I think all the money is allocated on the \nbasis of risk.\n  That having been said, we can have ``food fights,'' I call them, and \ndebates all day trying to figure out should the minimum be .75 or .45 \nor .25 percent. Our committee said .75 percent is too much. We believe \n.25 percent as a minimum is too little. We believe .45 percent, which \nleads to about 95 percent of the funding under this specific grant \nprogram being allocated on the basis of risk, is about right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, I have a very quick comment, and then I \nwill yield to the Senator from New Jersey, who wants to speak on this \namendment. I wish to make perfectly clear that the statement made by \nthe Senator from Delaware is absolutely right. Every State has some \nrisks. I have no doubt that Delaware has chemical plants and there are \nports and various facilities that constitute real risk. Under the \nformula I am advocating, the funding is allocated on the basis of risk \nthat will take into account such infrastructure. The notion somehow \nthat the Department of Homeland Security will not take chemical plants \ninto account is simply incorrect.\n  Rural States, small States, large States--for all states, all of the \nallocations that are made, other than the .25 percent guaranteed level \nof funding, would be made on the basis of risk. The Department of \nHomeland Security will presumably make an educated, expert assessment \non the risk that exists in Delaware, Maine or Connecticut. So it is not \nas if those States would not be getting money under this amendment. It \nis simply that the judgment of those experts, who are paid to determine \nwhat the threats are and what the risks are, would be the guiding basis \nupon which we make these decisions.\n  Mr. CARPER. Before the Senator yields, I have one further comment. I \ntake far greater comfort in the words of my friend from Illinois. But \nwhat we heard about Washington, DC,--this place was a target. We had \npeople who lost their lives not many miles from where we are. There was \nanother plane trying to get here. Somehow this place, our Nation's \ncapital, which we acknowledge was a prime target on 9/11, and probably \nis today, should somehow be allocated less funding under the formulas--\nnot the one in the bill but allocated less funding--doesn't make sense \nto me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois still has the floor.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, I would like to yield the remaining time \nto the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no controlled time.\n  Mr. OBAMA. The Senator from New Jersey has been waiting for quite \nsome time.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily laid aside for the purpose of resubmittal of a \ntechnical correction to an existing amendment and laying down a second \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 317, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KYL. First, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 317 be \nmodified, and I send the modification to the desk. The minority has \nbeen given a copy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 317), as modified, is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the rewarding of suicide bombings and allow \n  adequate punishments for terrorist murders, kidnappings, and sexual \n                               assaults)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Madam President, I rise today to address an amendment that I \nhave filed to the 9/11 recommendations bill, amendment no. 317. This \namendment would prohibit rewarding the families of suicide bombers for \nsuch attacks, and stiffen penalties for other terrorist crimes.\n  The first part of the amendment would create a new offense of aiding \nthe family or associates of a terrorist with the intent to encourage \nterrorist acts. This provision is targeted at those individuals who \ngive money to the families of suicide bombers after such bombings. The \namendment would make it a Federal offense to do so if the act can be \nconnected to the United States, and if die defendant acted with the \nintent to facilitate, reward, or encourage acts of international \nterrorism.\n  Let me offer an example of why this amendment is necessary. In August \n2001, a Palestinian suicide bomber attacked a Sbarro pizza parlor in \nJerusalem. He killed 15 people. Among those killed was an American \ncitizen, Shoshana Greenbaum, who was a schoolteacher and who was \npregnant at the time.\n  Shortly after this bombing took place, the family of the suicide \nbomber was told to go to the Arab Bank. The bomber's family began \nreceiving monthly payments through an account at that bank, and later \nreceived a lump sum payment of $6,000.\n  According to accounts in the press, this is not the only time that \nthe Arab Bank has funneled money to the families of suicide bombers. \nOne news account describes a branch of the bank in the Palestinian \nterritories whose walls are covered with posters eulogizing suicide \nbombers.\n  According to other news accounts, suicide bombers in the Palestinian \nterritories are recruited with promises that their families will be \ntaken care of financially after the attack. Saudi charities, the \nPalestinian authority, and even Saddam Hussein have rewarded suicide \nbombers' families for their acts. According to the BBC, Saddam Hussein \npaid a total of $35 million to terrorists' families during his time.\n  Obviously, Saddam Hussein's actions are no longer a concern, but we \nshould all be deeply concerned about other wealthy individuals and \nfinancial institutions who continue to pay out these rewards. It is \nundoubtedly the case that in some instances these payments make the \ndifference in whether an individual will commit a suicide bombing.\n  My amendment would make it a Federal crime, with extraterritorial \njurisdiction in cases that can be linked to U.S. interests, to pay the \nfamilies of suicide bombers and other terrorists with the intent to \nfacilitate terrorist acts.\n  My amendment also makes several other needed improvements to our \nantiterrorism laws.\n  The amendment increases the maximum penalties for existing material \nsupport offenses. The material-support statutes have been the Justice \nDepartment's workhorse in the war against terrorists, accounting for a \nmajority of prosecutions. These statutes are also very effective at \nstarving terrorist groups of resources. My amendment increases the \npenalty for giving material support to a designated foreign terrorist \norganization from a maximum of 15 years to a maximum of 25 years. The \npenalty for providing material support to the commission of a \nparticular terrorist act is increased from a maximum of 15 years to a \nmaximum of 40 years. And the maximum penalty for receiving military-\ntype training from a foreign terrorist organization is increased from \n10 years to 15 years. The amendment also adds attempts and conspiracies \nto the substantive offense of receiving military-type training, and \ndenies Federal benefits to persons convicted of terrorist offenses.\n  Finally, my amendment expands existing proscriptions on the murder or \nassault of U.S. nationals overseas for terrorist purposes, so that the \nlaw punishes attempts and conspiracies to commit murder equally to the \nsubstantive offense. The amendment adds a new offense of kidnapping a \nU.S. national for terrorist purposes, regardless of whether a ransom is \ndemanded. And the amendment adds sexual assault to the definition of \nthe types of injury that are punishable under the existing offense of \nassault resulting in serious bodily injury.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a number of news articles be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Federal News Service, May 11, 2005]\n\n                 Program Transcript--Funding Terrorism\n\n       BRIAN WILLIAMS: Following the money in the war on \n     terrorism.

Our NBC News senior investigative \n     correspondent, Lisa Myers, has our exclusive report in depth.\n       LISA MYERS: August 2001. A suicide bomber hits the Sbarro \n     pizza parlor in Jerusalem, killing 15, including an \n     American--Shoshana Greenbaum, a pregnant schoolteacher.\n       The Palestinian bomber? Izz Ad-Din Al-Masri. His parents \n     told NBC News that soon after the bombing a group which helps \n     families of suicide bombers told them they'd be compensated \n     for their son's `sacrifice.'\n       `They told me to go to the Arab Bank and open an account \n     and you will receive a salary.'\n       He says almost immediately he began receiving $140 a month. \n     And after the Israelis leveled his house, he says he was told \n     to go the bank and pick up more money.\n       (Myers' question to Shuhail Ahmed Al-Masri, Izz Ad-Din Al- \n     Masri's father): So you went to the Arab bank, and they gave \n     you $6,000?\n       SHUHAIL AHMED AL-MASRI: Yes. Six thousand dollars.\n       MYERS: This is the branch of the Arab Bank where Al-Masri's \n     father says he was told to open an account, where he says \n     received money almost every month for the last three years.\n       The branch, plastered with posters eulogizing suicide \n     bombers, isn't the only one allegedly paying bombers' \n     families. This ad in a Palestinian newspaper told dozens of \n     martyrs' families to pick up money at the nearest branch of \n     the Arab Bank.\n       Jimmy Gurule was a top U.S. official in charge of cutting \n     off money to terrorists.\n       JIMMY GURULE (former U.S. Treasury official): Those types \n     of payments were aiding and abetting terrorism.\n       MYERS: The FBI tells NBC News that it's now conducting a \n     criminal investigation into the Arab Bank's alleged movement \n     of funds for suspected terrorists. The investigation was \n     triggered after U.S. regulators examined Arab Bank operation \n     in New York City, here in this building on Madison Avenue.\n       U.S. officials tell NBC News that regulators found that the \n     bank had as customers 40 to 60 suspected terrorists and \n     groups allegedly associated with al Qaeda, Hamas and \n     Hezbollah. Officials say all had accounts with the bank or \n     had moved money through the NEW YORK office.\n       GURULE: I'm not aware of another situation involving a bank \n     operating in the United States that has conducted itself in \n     such a manner.\n       MYERS: The Arab Bank, headquartered here in Jordan, turned \n     down repeated requests for an interview, so we visited bank \n     headquarters in Amman.\n       (Myers at the bank): Lisa Myers with NBC News.\n       MYERS: We only got as far as the lobby.\n       OMAR AL-SHEIK (Arab Bank official): Of course not.\n       MYERS: Does the bank believe it's proper to move money to \n     help terrorists'?\n       OMAR AL-SHEIK: Of course not.\n       MYERS: In a statement, the Arab bank denies ever knowingly \n     doing business with terrorists. And officials insist the bank \n     has never moved money for anyone officially designated a \n     terrorist by the U.S. government.\n       However, NBC News provided the bank with these documents \n     showing it dealt with three Hamas terror groups, even after \n     they were blacklisted by the U.S. It's against the law for \n     banks in the U.S. to handle transactions for terrorists on \n     the blacklist.\n       The bank says these three transactions still were legal \n     because they occurred outside the U.S., but that in the \n     future it will honor the U.S. blacklist worldwide.\n       As for suicide bombers, the Arab Bank strongly denies ever \n     knowingly handling payments for bombers' families. 'Arab Bank \n     considers suicide bombings an abominable human act.'\n       Then what about the ad telling bombers' families to collect \n     money at the Arab Bank?\n       The bank says it didn't place the ad.\n       After NBC provided account numbers for the Al-Masris, the \n     bank froze their account, which the bank claims was opened \n     before the bombing.\n       Shoshana Greenbaum's father, who moved to Israel after her \n     death, is now suing the bank.\n       ALAN HAYMAN (Greenbaum's father): This organization, if \n     allowed to continue in business with a mere slap on the \n     wrist, would be sending a message that it's perfectly all \n     right to support terrorism.\n       MYERS: The Arab Bank, which Israeli officials call `the \n     Grand Central Station of terrorist financing,' has been \n     forced down much of its U.S. operation but remains a dominant \n     player in the Middle East.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Arab Bank's Terror Trial Hit\n\n       A Federal judge in Brooklyn ordered Jordan's Arab Bank to \n     stand trial in New York on charges that it knowingly financed \n     the Palestinian suicide bombers who have killed and maimed \n     thousands, including many American citizens.\n       The survivors of suicide attacks in Israel and family \n     members of Americans killed or wounded in the attacks sued \n     Arab Bank last year.\n       The suits argue the bank had full knowledge of the acts \n     committed by their clients from Hamas, Palestinian Islamic \n     Jihad and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs brigades.\n       The victims also charge Arab Bank's distribution of \n     payments to the families of suicide bombers was a part of the \n     terror recruiting process.\n       ``[The charges] support an inference that Arab Bank and the \n     terrorist organizations were participants in a common plan \n     under which Arab Bank would supply necessary financial \n     services to the organizations which would themselves perform \n     the violent acts,'' wrote U.S, District Judge Nina Gershon in \n     an opinion released yesterday.\n       In July, The Post broke the story that the bank required \n     intricate and official so-called Martyr's Kits to process the \n     payments, concrete proof that the bank knew where its \n     payments were destined.\n       A bank spokesman said ``Arab Bank remains confident that it \n     will prevail at trial. The bank abhors terrorism and has not, \n     and would not, knowingly or willfully support terrorism.'' \n     Judge Gershon dismissed the bank's argument that these were \n     ``ordinary banking services.''\n       She said ``there is nothing routine about the services the \n     bank is alleged to provide.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n Sick `Martyr Kits'--Secret Files Finger Bank in Mideast Terror Payoffs\n\n       Secret documents known as ``martyrs' kits'' obtained by The \n     Post provide a startling glimpse into the world of suicide \n     bombers, who are recruited with promises that their families \n     will be well taken care of financially.\n       These kits ensure that the families of Hamas, PLO and \n     Palestinian Islamic Jihad killers get generous ``charitable \n     donations'' from Saudi Arabia-based organizations and, while \n     he was in power, Saddam Hussein.\n       The documents reviewed by The Post include a martyr kit for \n     Maher Kamel Hbeishe, a Hamas fanatic who blew himself up on a \n     Haifa bus Dec. 2, 2001, killing 15 Israelis and wounding 40.\n       Much of the kit's paperwork carries the corporate logo of \n     the Arab Bank--the Middle East's most important and \n     influential financial institution--and the numbers of the \n     accounts through which his family was paid.\n       The cover on Hbeishe's file--in the records of Saudi relief \n     committees--proclaims: ``the martyrs receive reward from \n     their Lord, they and their light.''\n       Replete with florid Arabic tributes to dead terrorists, the \n     paperwork explains the manner of death, making it clear that \n     the bank knew exactly whom it was giving money to and why.\n       If the terrorist were successful, the family would receive \n     $5,316; being wounded or captured would earn them a lesser \n     amount.\n       Though small by Western standards, the payments are more \n     than six times the West Bank's average annual income of $850.\n       To get its money, Hbeishe's family was most likely \n     contacted by the so-called ``social welfare arm'' of Hamas \n     and instructed to open up an Arab Bank account. Then \n     representatives of Hamas would use the information in the \n     martyrs' kit to provide the bank with the name of the \n     attacker and the beneficiaries getting checks.\n       The Saudi charities--called relief committees--that provide \n     the funding for the terrorists make no secret of their \n     activities, even taking out full-page ads in newspapers. One \n     such ad listed more than 1,000 individuals who had been \n     wounded or captured by the Israelis during the intifada and \n     whose families were eligible for benefits.\n       Every ad explicitly directs the family members to go to \n     Arab Bank.\n       A bank spokesman said, ``Arab Bank abhors terrorism. The \n     bank would never do business with individuals or \n     organizations it knows to be terrorists.''\n       It said that the documents obtained by The Post proved only \n     that relatives of the two suicide bombers had accounts there, \n     which is not surprising given the bank's 50 percent market \n     share in the West Bank.\n       Lee Wolosky, a lawyer suing the bank on behalf of families \n     murdered in terrorist attacks, said, ``New Yorkers would be \n     outraged if a bank on Madison Avenue was alleged to have \n     provided financial support to the families of al Qaeda \n     terrorists. These allegations are no different.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                          [From the BBC News]\n\n                     Palestinians Get Saddam Funds\n\n       Saddam Hussein has paid out thousands of dollars to \n     families of Palestinians killed in fighting with Israel.\n       Relatives of at least one suicide attacker as well as other \n     militants and civilians gathered in a hall in Gaza City to \n     receive cheques.\n       ``Iraq and Palestine are in one trench.

Charles Krauthammer \n     recently observed that ``the more than four-year-long \n     intifada, which left more than 1,000 Israelis and 3,000 \n     Palestinians dead, is over. And better than that, defeated.'' \n     Krauthammer believes that Israel's Gaza withdrawal was a \n     success and that the electoral campaigns underway in both \n     Israel and the Palestinian Authority can fairly be attributed \n     to Israeli unilateralism and Palestinian maturation.\n       All of which may be true. Yet the news from Israel isn't \n     all good. Far from it. The terror war against Israel \n     certainly continues. Every day Israeli security forces \n     receive 10 to 30 security alerts regarding prospective \n     attacks within Israel. Only the successful attacks make the \n     news, such as the December 5 bombing that took five lives at \n     the mall in Netanya.\n       More worrisome is that the terror groups operate at will \n     within the Palestinian Authority. Among them are Hamas, \n     Hezbollah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad--all groups with \n     foreign bases of support in Syria, Iran, or Saudi Arabia. \n     These groups parade openly and operate with impunity within \n     the territory of the Palestinian Authority. The numerous \n     security services of the Palestinian Authority have yet to \n     disarm them. Other terror groups actually operate as militias \n     under the umbrella of Fatah, the party over which Palestinian \n     Authority President Mahmoud Abbas presides. Among them, for \n     example, is the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade.\n       The Palestinian Authority has also taken action to support \n     terrorists within its jurisdiction. Rachel Ehrenfeld reported \n     on the Palestinian Authority's continuing financial support \n     of terrorists in a November 29 Jerusalem Post column. \n     Ehrenfeld cited a senior PA official explaining that the \n     Palestinian Authority has created a special committee to \n     determine the pension eligibility of all members of armed \n     organizations. Earlier reports indicate that the Palestinian \n     Authority contributes $4 million a month to support \n     terrorists held in Israeli jails. (For those looking to see \n     the glass as half full, PA finance minister Salam Fayad \n     resigned over this issue--which is a truly optimistic \n     development.)\n       Earlier this month Israel National News reported that \n     President Abbas approved a law providing financial support to \n     the families of ``shahids'' (martyrs)--including suicide \n     bombers. Abbas's approval of the law was announced in the \n     pages of the semi-official PA newspaper, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida \n     the day of the Netanya bombing. (In addition to the sums \n     indicated in the linked story, the law provides for a lump \n     sum payment of $2,200 to the surviving family of \n     ``martyrs.'')\n       The law would allow the Palestinian Authority to step into \n     the role--recently vacated by Saddam Hussein--of providing \n     financial support to the families of suicide bombers \n     attacking Israel. Asked for comment, a U.S. State Department \n     Near East spokesman noted that Abbas had not signed the law \n     and that the State Department had expressed its concern to \n     Abbas regarding it.\n       That's technically true: The law has been passed twice by \n     the PA legislative council. Abbas's signature and a third \n     approval of the law by the PA legislative council are \n     necessary for final enactment. Perhaps the State Department's \n     expression of concern will head off its final enactment. Yet \n     that the law that reached President Abbas's office--and that \n     he appears to have announced his approval of it--seems \n     telling.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, July 31, 2006]\n\n      Islamist Terror Twins; Shi'ite, Sunni Jihadists Pose Danger\n\n                         (By Rachel Ehrenfeld)\n\n       It took the United States four years after September 11 to \n     develop a useful working definition of the gravest danger to \n     world peace. Last October President Bush finally identified \n     our enemies: ``Islamic Radicals . . . empowered by helpers \n     and enablers . . . strengthened by front operations who \n     aggressively fund the[m].'' Making no distinction between \n     Sunni or Shi'ite radicals, he concluded that defeating ``the \n     murderous ideology of the Islamic Radicals,'' is the ``great \n     challenge of our century.''\n       Mr. Bush keeps addressing the turmoil in the Middle East \n     focusing on Hezbollah as a regional struggle. Yet, defeating \n     Israel and controlling the Middle East is only part of the \n     global mission of both Sunni and Shi'ite terrorists. Their \n     goal is to establish the Caliphate, extending the rule of \n     Shariah to the entire world.\n       Israel is now fighting two of radical Islam's most virulent \n     versions--the Shi'ite Hezbollah and the Sunni Hamas. Israel \n     fights not only for its own survival. Its ability to defeat \n     Hamas and Hezbollah will determine the survival of the United \n     States and all Western-style democracies.\n       When Hezbollah attacked Israel over two weeks ago, Mr. Bush \n     accused Syria of being the primary sponsor of Hezbollah, \n     providing it with shipments of Iranian-made weapons. The \n     president added: ``Iran's regime has also repeatedly defied \n     the international community with its ambition for nuclear \n     weapons and aid to terrorist groups. Their actions threaten \n     the entire Middle East and stand in the way of resolving the \n     current crisis and bringing lasting peace to this troubled \n     region.''\n       One wonders what the leader of the free world needs to \n     witness before he connects the dots. Radical Islam, or \n     Islamofascism, as he himself described it on other occasions, \n     is not limited to the Middle East, or promoted and advanced \n     only by Iran, Hezbollah and Syria. Sunni radicals such as \n     Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the numerous offspring of al Qaeda \n     pose similar threats to Israel, the region, the United States \n     and the rest of the world.\n       All radical Muslims, according to the president, are \n     terrorists ``target[ing] nations whose behavior they believe \n     they can change through violence.'' Their goal, he said, is \n     to ``establish a radical Islamic empire that spans from Spain \n     to Indonesia.'' Then, they ``would be able to advance their \n     stated agenda: to develop weapons of mass destruction, to \n     destroy Israel, to intimidate Europe, to assault the American \n     people, and to blackmail our government into isolation.''\n       ``Against such an enemy there is only one effective \n     response,'' concluded Mr. Bush: ``We will never back down, \n     never give in, and never accept anything less than complete \n     victory.'' Yet, Israel is pressured for restraint by most \n     U.S. allies, including the Saudis.\n       Nonetheless, the White House, politicians and the \n     international media fall all over themselves to praise the \n     Saudis for admonishing Hezbollah as yet more evidence of \n     their commitment to ending extremism. In fact, the Saudis \n     demonstrate their commitment only to end Shi'a extremism. In \n     typical double-talk, while lambasting Hezbollah, the Saudis \n     refrain from condemning Hamas, and in fact, they are its \n     principal financiers from the beginning.\n       On Tuesday, the Saudi Government announced generous \n     financial contributions to rebuild Lebanon and Palestine. The \n     Saudis also held a well-advertised ``popular fundraising \n     campaign,'' urging Saudis, all Arabs and Muslims ``to show \n     the usual generosity and commitment towards the Arabs and \n     Muslim Nation.'' Last week's Saudi Telethon raised $32 \n     million, and an additional $13.5 million was raised in the \n     UAE. There is little doubt that some of this money would find \n     its way to the families of ``martyrs'' from Hezbollah, Hamas \n     and Islamic Jihad carrying out the ``mission'' of Jihad.\n       This fundraiser brings back memories of previous Telethons \n     such as the April 2002 King Fahd-sponsored fundraiser for the \n     Palestinian intifada, and the August 2005 Saudi fundraiser \n     for the Palestinian cause, aired on Iqra TV. The organizers \n     then stated: ``Jihad is the pinnacle of Islam. A person who \n     cannot wage Jihad with his soul is required to wage Jihad \n     with his money . . . our brothers in Palestine desperately \n     need financial support, which goes directly to this cause, \n     and helps them to carry out this mission.'' On July 27, $29 \n     million were raised in the latest Saudi telethon. Some of \n     this money would surely find its way to the families of \n     ``martyrs'' from Hamas and Islamic Jihad carrying out the \n     ``mission'' of Jihad.\n       The radical Sunni modus operandi differs not at all from \n     that of Hezbollah's Shi'ite terrorists. Al Qaeda and Hamas \n     also provide social services, jobs, medical care and schools \n     to the needy. And like Iran and Hezbollah, the Saudis use \n     their fortunes both to fund radical terrorist groups and to \n     develop vast international Islamic communications networks \n     which they leverage in order to expand their anti-American \n     and anti-Israel propaganda, while aptly manipulating U.S. \n     leaders and the media.\n       The Saudi fears of a nuclear Iran are behind their \n     condemnation of Hezbollah. However, since Hassan Nasrallah is \n     now the leading figure of the Arab world, supported by\n\n[[Page S2673]]\n\n     The Muslim Brotherhood, and ``the most prominent cleric in \n     the Arab world, [Sheikh Yousef Al] Qaradhawi,'' the Saudis \n     can not afford to ignore Nasrallah's popularity. That is why \n     the Saudis publicly asked the United States to pressure \n     Israel into ceasefire. But the growing violence of and anti-\n     American propaganda by Sunni radical groups worldwide funded \n     by Saudi paymasters should serve as potent reminder for the \n     U.S. to demand that our Saudi ``ally'' stop their own \n     terrorist financing and the propagation of their own version \n     of radical Islam, Wahhabism, around the world. Moreover, the \n     United States should focus on developing alternative energy \n     sources, consequently reducing billions of dollars now \n     available to fund terrorism.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 338\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment by my distinguished colleague from Illinois. His effort is \nnot about Illinois or any of the other significant States. His effort \nultimately culminates in 34 States getting additional funds and moving \nfar closer to the 9/11 Commission's unanimous bipartisan recommendation \nthat funding for homeland security should follow risk and risk alone.\n  Having said that, he still doesn't deny to other States the \nopportunity to have some baseline of homeland security funding. He \nstill preserves an element for all States. But I think here is how we \ndetermine the equation. It is very interesting that one chart says 32 \nStates and the District of Columbia will lose, but that depends upon \nthe factor you are using.\n  The reality is, under Senator Obama's amendment, which I am proud to \ncosponsor, when you include the totality of homeland security funds, 34 \nStates receive an increase--that is a significant majority of the \nStates--and we move closer to the public policy recommendation the 9/11 \nCommission made that all homeland security funding should be based on \nrisk and risk alone.\n  Now, whether you were on the street below at the World Trade Center \nor across the river in New Jersey watching the towers burn or halfway \nacross the country watching the horrific events unfold on television, \nwe all experienced the blow our Nation suffered that day.\n  I say to my distinguished colleague from Maine who mentioned a \nstone--I forget exactly--a location in Georgia and some other locations \nin rural parts of America where supposedly some of the terrorists were, \nbut where were their targets? Not where were they hiding, but where \nwere their targets? Their targets are very clear.\n  We all suffered a blow that day, but there is something unique about \nthe locations that were chosen by the terrorists to strike. Thousands \nwork in the Pentagon. Roughly 50,000 people worked in what was the \nWorld Trade Center, and 200,000 visitors used to go there on any given \nday, including many of the people from my home State of New Jersey who \nperished that day. Where were the planes coming from? They were coming \nfrom major airports--Logan, Newark, Dulles. To where? To major cities \nin California--Los Angeles, San Francisco.\n  So the terrorists made calculations about where and how they could \ninflict the most damage on our Nation because while New York and the \nPentagon were the epicenters of that act, the reality is the ripple \neffect came across economically as well as in terms of the loss of \nlives across the whole country. But they understood the unavoidable \nfacts of where their targets were. Their targets were not in rural \nparts. They may have hidden there as they got ready to commit their \ndastardly act. Their targets were in the places they could make \nunavoidably the greatest impact. The fact is, these targets are \nconsistently in some of the most densely populated areas of the Nation \nwhere the greatest risk lies.\n  This debate should not be about fighting to maintain a certain level \nof funding as general revenue sharing. At issue is how to best allocate \nlimited resources to those parts of our Nation facing the greatest \nrisk. Senator Obama does that by having 34 States enhance their \nposition and 6 being unchanged.\n  We cannot deny that some States simply have more risk than others. \nSome States simply have more risk than others. Just as I would not \nargue for the same share of agricultural funding for New Jersey as \nIowa, or I could not possibly make an intellectually honest fight for \nthe same level of hurricane preparedness as Florida, neither can many \nof my colleagues argue that some States have the same risks as other \nStates throughout the Nation. If we had unlimited funds, that would be \ndifferent. That is not the case. The case is, we have limited funds.\n  Senator Obama's amendment clearly drives us closer and closer to risk \nbeing the determining factor. That is what the 9/11 Commission \nunanimously said, that is what the 9/11 families have said, that is \nwhat the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the 9/11 Commission said, that \nis what the amendment of the Senator from Illinois ultimately does, and \nthat is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of the amendment and one that \nultimately understands that there clearly are greater risks in certain \nparts of the Nation. The terrorists know that. They understand the \ngreatest consequences they can strike at and create the greatest horror \nfor their efforts, and that is going to be a continuing truth. It is a \ncontinuing truth I hope the Senate will acknowledge in voting for \nSenator Obama's amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nNew Jersey for an eloquent summation of what this amendment is about. \nWhat I would like to do is reiterate my response to some of the issues \nthat were raised by the distinguished Senators from Connecticut and \nMaine.\n  No. 1, we are talking about real money. We don't have exact figures, \nbut let's assume we are talking about around $80 million that would be \nshifted from guaranteed funding to the States and instead would be \nallocated on the basis of risk. That $80 million will mean firefighters \nare getting the equipment they need in States that have higher risks. \nIt will mean more money will be available for interoperability systems. \nIt means this money will be allocated to States that have chemical \nplants and nuclear plants in higher proportion than those States that \ndo not. In each case, this money, under my amendment, will be allocated \non the basis of the risk assessments made by experts, as recommended \nunder the 9/11 Commission Report, and will not be allocated simply on \nthe basis that every State gets a piece of the pie regardless of risk, \nthreats and vulnerabilities.\n  To go back to the issue of how many States benefit or lose, my main \npoint is that we all win when the money is allocated on the basis of \nrisk. We all win. Every State wins. But in terms of the estimates of \nwhich States gain and which States lose, I reiterate, the chart that \nwas put up by the Senator from Maine is only talking about the amount \nof money that is allocated on the basis of guaranteed funding, not \nbased on risk. The additional funding, the lion's share of the funding, \nas the Senator from Delaware stated, will be allocated on the basis of \nrisk, and once you factor that in, then you can be assured that the \noverwhelming majority of States will get more money under my amendment \nthan they will under the underlying bill. That is the central point. \nDon't get confused when it is stated that 32 States stand to lose money \nunder this amendment. They stand to lose the guaranteed money because \nmore money goes back into risk assessment, and once it is put back into \nthe States, then you will see a majority of States gaining under my \namendment.\n\n  Madam President, there is one last point I wish to reiterate. One of \nthe seemingly plausible arguments made by the Senator from Connecticut \nand the Senator from Maine was that we want an all-hazards funding \napproach--hurricanes, natural disasters. We want to make sure that \nmoney is fairly allocated. I reiterate, that is not the point of this \nprogram. We have another program that allocates on the basis of all \nhazards. That is the Emergency Management Planning Grant Program.\n  So if they want to make an argument that money should be allocated to \nall States at a certain percentage to guarantee minimum funding for all \nhazards funding, that is entirely sensible, but that is not what this \nfunding stream is all about. This funding stream is supposed to address \nthe specific risks and\n\n[[Page S2674]]\n\nthreats of terrorism. So if we want to follow the recommendations of \nthe 9/11 Commission Report, then we must protect against those \nparticular risks for which the program is designed.\n  I appreciate the healthy debate. This does not always happen on the \nfloor of the Senate. I thank my colleague from Connecticut, the \nchairman of the committee, for entertaining as many questions as he \ndid, and I thank him for his patience.\n  I reiterate that the underlying bill is an improvement over the \nstatus quo, but the same principles that drove the Senator from \nConnecticut and the Senator from Maine to change and reduce the amount \nof minimum funding each State obtains is the same principle of my \namendment. I just take it a step further.\n  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised that if you applied the manner of \ncalculating funding that was up on the chart behind the Senator from \nMaine, it is not clear to me you wouldn't see a whole bunch of States \nlosing under the change the Chairman has proposed as well. But what he \nrealizes and the reason he thinks the underlying bill makes sense is \nbecause that money is going to be distributed based on risk, and in the \nend a lot of States will do better. This amendment is no different. It \nsimply takes it a step further in line with what the House has done and \nin line with what the 9/11 Commission Report recommends.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join on this amendment. I believe it will \nbe an improvement not just for some States but for the entire country.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Illinois. It \nhas been a good debate. Again, we don't have these often enough on the \nfloor.\n  I hope our friends understand the difference. Again, we know we are \nbasing our comparison of the two formulas on the guaranteed minimums, \nwhich are the only things we can be sure about. My friend from Illinois \ntakes the risk assessment from this year and projects it forward. It \nhappens to have underfunded the District of Columbia, which is why they \nlose under this proposal as well. I will leave that for the moment and \nsimply say that we are having a good debate about how to distribute the \nmoney.\n  One thing I believe we all agree on--I know my friend from Illinois \nand I certainly do--is that the Federal Government has been \nunderfunding the State Homeland Security Grant Program and all the \nothers. So while we have these significant arguments about how to \ndivide the pie, the other part of this debate--which, fortunately, we \nhave an agreement on--is that the pie should be bigger.\n  In this bill, for State homeland security grants, we go back to the \nhigh level of fiscal year 2004, $3.1 billion. Quite shockingly, the \nadministration has lowered the money in each of the years since then, \nthough no one's estimate would say the threat to homeland security is \nless than it was in 2004. That agreement we have, though we have a \nmutually respectful disagreement about how to divide the pie.\n  While we are on this subject, there was a reference earlier on the \nquestion of how the money is being spent. We hear references to this \nnow famous air-conditioned garbage truck from New Jersey. Likewise, \nthere was apparently a police department that is purported to have \npurchased leather jackets for its officers. Presumably, allegedly, \nthese items where purchased with State homeland security grant funds. \nIf, in fact, that is what happened--although there is some suspicion \nthat the air-conditioned garbage truck was bought with funds that came \nthrough the Department of Justice, not the State homeland security \ngrant funding--it was, obviously, wrong and unacceptable. This has been \nused to undercut support for the program generally.\n  I assure my colleagues, however they vote on the funding formula--\nand, incidentally, New Jersey is one of the States, as the Senator from \nNew Jersey indicated, that would gain under the amendment of the \nSenator from Illinois high-risk States can misspend money just as \neasily as low-risk States. In fact, they have more money to spend, so \nthe probability is higher.\n  Here is what I want to assure my colleagues: S. 4, the underlying \nbill, is designed to make sure the money we send back to the States and \nlocalities is spent for homeland security. Under Homeland Security \nPresidential Directive No. 8, the Department of Homeland Security has \nissued target capabilities for prevention, preparedness, and response \nthat all communities must be able to achieve. What are target \ncapabilities? They include risk management, citizen preparedness, \ninformation sharing, intelligence gathering, and medical triage--all \nnecessary elements of homeland security and disaster response.\n  Under the Post Katrina Act that stemmed from our committee's \ninvestigation of Government failures during Hurricane Katrina, the \nSenate and the House and the President implemented these target \ncapabilities as statutory requirements. So S. 4 requires that all \nhomeland security grants must be spent in a way that works to reach the \nspecific target capabilities stipulated by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and the national preparedness goal. Obviously, this air-\nconditioned garbage truck would be an illegal expenditure, as would the \npurported purchase of leather jackets for a police department somewhere \nin America. In turn, each of these expenditures, whether at the State, \nlocal, or tribal level, must be consistent with a State homeland \nsecurity plan that is required by S. 4.\n  S. 4 authorizes specific uses for the grants; among which are the \nfollowing:\n\n  Developing plans and risk assessments, which are essential for the \noptimal and most efficient allocation of resources;\n  Designing, conducting, and evaluating training and exercises, \nincluding for mass evacuations, as we learned was so essential in \nHurricane Katrina;\n  Purchasing and maintaining equipment, such as interoperable \ncommunications devices that are critical to responding to a disaster;\n  Additional measures, including overtime personnel costs, when \nrequired to respond to an increase in the threat level under the \nHomeland Security Advisory System;\n  The protection of critical infrastructure and key resources; and\n  Establishing fusion centers that comply with specific information-\nsharing guidelines as described in title I of this bill.\n  S. 4 also ensures that the Department has the flexibility to approve \nactivities funded by the grants, but again, all expenditures must be \ntied to the achievement of target capabilities.\n  Additionally, S. 4 contains explicit restrictions on the use of \nhomeland security grants: We prohibit funds from being spent on \nrecreational or social purposes.\n  These provisions, backed up by extensive accountability and audit \nrequirements, will ensure that funds are spent in the most efficient \nand effective way possible. Some have suggested that the misuse of \ngrant funds in the past has been a result of extraneous funds being \ndistributed in the form of a State minimum. But, in fact, I point out \nthat the air-conditioned garbage trucks were purchased by New Jersey--a \nState which my colleagues have pointed out is one of the higher-risk \nStates, and has, in fact, received a significant portion of \nantiterrorism funding. Likewise, the leather jackets were purchased by \nthe D.C. Police Department--again, one of the areas of the country with \nthe highest risk assessments. So no State should be considered immune \nfrom such expenses, and it is wrong to imply a link to State minimums. \nS. 4 will ensure that each grant awarded is tied to a carefully \nanalyzed homeland security plan, and is expended for a specific target \ncapability.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, earlier today, the Senate tabled an \namendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint, that \nwould have struck all of the provisions in the bill related to the \nemployment rights of the employees of the Transportation Security \nAdministration,\n\n[[Page S2675]]\n\nTSA. Last night, I filed an amendment on behalf of myself, Senator \nVoinovich, Senator Warner, Senator Sununu, Senator Coleman, and Senator \nStevens that seeks to strike a middle ground in this area.\n  Through our committee's work on homeland security, it has become \nclear that the ability to respond quickly and effectively to changing \nconditions, to emerging threats, and to crisis situations is essential. \nFrom the intelligence community to our first responders, the key to \nthis response is flexibility, putting assets and, more importantly, \npersonnel where they are needed, when they are needed.\n  My question about giving TSA employees the right to collectively \nbargain is whether this additional right would hamper flexibility at \nthis critical time.\n  I have been a strong supporter of Federal employees throughout my \ntime in the Senate. I very much appreciate the work they do not only in \nthe Department of Homeland Security but throughout the Federal \nGovernment. It is my hope that we will be able to work cooperatively to \nforge a compromise that preserves the needed flexibility that has been \ndescribed to us in both classified sessions and open hearings while \nprotecting the rights of TSA employees. These are employees who are \nworking hard every day to protect us.\n  The TSA is charged with great responsibility. In order to accomplish \nits critical national security mission, the Aviation Transportation \nSecurity Act provided TSA with the authority to shift resources and to \nimplement new procedures daily--in some instances hourly--in response \nto emergencies and changing conditions. This authority enables TSA to \nmake the best and fullest use of its highly trained and dedicated \nworkforce.\n  We have already seen the benefit of this flexibility. In both the \naftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the thwarted airline bombing plot in \nGreat Britain last year, TSA was able to change the nature of its \nemployees' work and even the location of their work in response to \nthese emergencies. Last December, when blizzards hit the Denver area \nand many local TSA officers were unable to get to the airport, the \nagency acted quickly, flying in voluntary TSOs from Las Vegas to cover \nthe shifts and covering the Las Vegas shifts with officers transferred \ntemporarily from Salt Lake City. Without the ability to rapidly ask for \nvolunteers and deploy them to Denver, the Denver airport would have \nbeen critically understaffed while hundreds, perhaps thousands, of \ntravelers were stranded. This flexibility is essential.\n  The legislation before the Senate is designed to implement the \nunfulfilled recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Most of those \nrecommendations were enacted in 2004, but when we look at this report \nwe don't see recommendations about changing the employees' conditions \nat TSA. Before we so dramatically change the TSA personnel system, we \nmust ensure that we do not interfere with TSA's ability to carry out \nits mission.\n  That doesn't mean the status quo is adequate. I believe we know \nenough now that we should proceed with providing TSA employees \nimportant protections enjoyed by other Federal employees. Let me \nmention two such important protections with which we should proceed. \nThe first is to bring them under the Whistleblower Protections Act. \nThere is simply no reason TSA employees should not enjoy the formal \nprotections and procedures set forth in that act.\n  Second, these TSA employees should have the same kinds of rights as \nother Federal employees to appeal adverse employment actions--\ndisciplinary actions, for example, demotions, even firings--to the \nMerit System Protection Board. That would give them an independent \nagency to review their complaints, and that is an important protection \nas well.\n  In addition to these two very important provisions, the amendment \nmakes clear that TSOs have the right to join labor unions. My amendment \nalso requires TSA to establish a pay-for-performance system. That \nalready exists in the agency, but we want to codify that.\n  Finally, the amendment would require TSA and the Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, to report to Congress in 1 year to assess \nemployment matters at TSA, indicating what further changes, if any, \nshould be made in the TSA personnel system.\n  I believe this takes the right approach. This is not an all-or-\nnothing debate, and yet that is what we seem to have boiled it down to. \nI urge my colleagues to take a look at the amendment. I am very pleased \nto have the cosponsorship of several Senators, and I hope that we will \nhave the opportunity to vote on it, if not today, tomorrow.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 294\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I want to discuss an amendment that has \nbeen previously called up, amendment No. 294. This is an amendment on \nthe \n9/11 bill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I have no objection, obviously, to the Senator from \nOklahoma proceeding to the discussion. I want him to know that Senator \nCollins and I are negotiating a consent agreement on votes on the \nfunding formulas and we may, with the Senator's permission, interrupt \nhim as he goes forward if we reach that agreement.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be more than happy to be interrupted by the \nchairman.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am a member of the Homeland Security and \nGovernment Affairs Committee, as is the Presiding Officer today. We \nhave gone through this bill--this is the second time--looking at 9/11 \nand what we need to do in terms of our risk, in terms of how we protect \nthe homeland.\n  As this bill is drafted, its implementation authority never expires. \nIt never stops. So what we have is approximately $4 billion a year from \nnow on. Actually, what we say is: however much money is needed in year \nfour of the bill to be spent on homeland security, whether or not we \nneed to or whether it is time to relook at the priorities of the bill.\n  This is an amendment that I offered in committee. I got one \nDemocratic vote for it and my own. But what this amendment does is \nsunset this bill in 5 years and says it is time to take a look at it \nagain.\n  One of the critical things we did following 9/11 was the PATRIOT Act, \nand we sunset it. Last year we took it up again and we sunset a good \nportion of it again. So we will look at it again.\n  This bill is never sunset. It is like the hundreds of other bills \nthis body has passed, that we pass and we never look at again. We never \ndo oversight. We never make the decisions. We just let the money keep \nrolling out the door and charging it to our grandchildren. This is a \nvery simple, straightforward amendment.\n  All this amendment says is that 5 years from now, this one goes \n``time out,'' it is over, do it again with a fresh look at the problems \nthat we face in this very dangerous world, a fresh look at the success \nwe have made, the accomplishments today, and ask where we need to go.\n  The bill, as written, assumes that nothing in the future, in terms of \nour risk, is going to change. I would put forward 5 years from now \neverything will have changed in terms of the risks that we are going to \nface. If we have done our jobs right with this bill, many of the areas \nof preparedness that we are attempting to direct funds to in this bill \nwill be solved. Why should we continue to have money going to areas \nthat we have solved rather than redirect money to areas that we have \nnot solved, or maybe for our children's sake, not spend any money \nbecause there is no need other than the need for politicians to tell \npeople at home that we sent money to them.\n  So this is a very simple, very straightforward amendment that says \nimproving America's security by implementing the unfinished \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission\n\n[[Page S2676]]\n\nAct of 2007 will cease having an effect on December 31, 2012.\n  Good government is what the American people both expect and desire. \nThey also deserve good government. They deserve the wisdom of knowing \nwe cannot know what is in the future today, so let's limit what we do \nuntil we can relook at it again.\n  Having held 46 hearings with Senator Carper in the last 18 months on \nthe Federal Financial Management Subcommittee of the Homeland Security \nand the Government Affairs Committee, what we know is what Congresses \nhave done in the past have created about $200 billion worth of waste \nper year in this country.\n  Now, sadly, the Congress refuses to address those duplications, the \nfraud and the waste that is associated with that $200 billion worth of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. We should not add to that. We should not have \na program that goes on ad nauseum addressing needs of today and saying \nit is OK.\n  All I am asking with this amendment, and I think most commonsense \nAmericans would ask, what is so hard about saying this ends and we have \nto look at it again in 2012? Make the decision again based on what the \nvery real risks are and, oh, we might even consider what our financial \ncondition is when we decide what we are going to spend on security and \nwhat else might ought not be paid for by the Federal Government as we \nfund homeland security and protect this Nation.\n  This provision will cause us to review the needed programs and \nauthorize spending. It will cause us to make better decisions 5 years \nfrom now than we can make today.\n  I will draw the corollary as a primary care physician, what I know \nabout my 55-year-old patients with hypertension and high cholesterol. \nAnd I am going to have an example today. I said: Here is what you need \nto do for the next 5 years. Do not come back and see me. Your risks \nprobably are not going to change. I can predict exactly what you are \ngoing to need. Do not worry. I will just give you prescriptions for the \nnext 5 years.\n  That is what we are doing on this bill. We are not doing it for just \n5 years, we are doing it for the rest of the patient's life. We would \nnever go to a physician who treated us that way. Yet that is the way \nthis bill approaches the future.\n  What are the reasons to oppose this bill? One is lack of a desire to \ntackle the hard job of looking at this again in 5 years. One is \narrogance; we know what we are going to need. There is no way we can. \nPolitical expediency, that might have something to do with it, to be \nable to tell the special interest groups and our campaign donors that \nwe have got them taken care of for the next 10 years.\n  I quote my chairman for whom I have the utmost respect. Here is what \nhis quote was on the PATRIOT Act.\n\n       The best thing we did with the PATRIOT Act was to sunset \n     it, was to say that it needs to be reauthorized or it will go \n     out of existence. And we are going to look back and see what \n     happened with the PATRIOT Act so we can make a better \n     decision in the future.\n\n  I have trouble not understanding why that same wonderful logic and \ngreat common sense should not be applied to this bill.\n\n  Senator Reid in 2005:\n\n       But we are currently considering renewal of those \n     provisions that were considered so expensive or so vulnerable \n     that Congress wisely decided for a 4-year sunset.\n\n  The author of the act wanted Congress to reassess in a more \ndeliberative manner with the benefit of experience. We are presented \nwith an opportunity again now, 4 years later, to get it right. Why \nwould we not want to sunset this bill? I have even a bigger one. Why do \nwe not want to sunset every bill, to go back and look at it and \nreassess it so we get rid of the waste, the fraud and duplication, to \ndo the very things that we were sent to do?\n  I will not spend a great deal more time. I recognize that the ranking \nmember, Senator Collins, and Senator Lieberman have some business they \nwant to consider. I would remind Senators there is no score on this \nbill. CBO hasn't scored this bill. We know the one from the House was \n$20 billion. Should we not look at $20 billion worth of spending again \nin 5 years and ask if it is under our priorities? Were we wise? What \nhave we learned? What can we do better? What worked? What did not work?\n  Why would we not want to do that? I think it is a no-brainer to \nsunset this bill so that we, in fact, can learn from our mistakes, \nlearn from our priorities, look at the world the way it will be 5 years \nfrom now rather than the way the world is today, and also, yes, \nconsider the fiscal situation in which we find ourselves.\n  I also am adamantly opposed to any piece of legislation that says, \n``such sums.'' Well, does this legislation mean we want to spend $100 \nbillion 6 years from now? That is what we are saying if we are giving \nto the Appropriations Committee all our power to make the decision on \nareas that are under our purview 6 years from now. Don't we believe we \nought to do that? I believe we ought to maintain that power, and \nactually it is not 6 years, it is 4 years from now because in the \nfourth year is when we do that.\n  Congress needs more sunsets, not fewer sunsets. We have an \ninexcusable situation that we have seen today with much of the \nGovernment operating on expired authority--expired authority. Madam \nPresident, $170 billion of what was appropriated last year was under \nexpired authority.\n  Congress has not done its job to reauthorize those programs. So let's \nlook at this again in 5 years, in 2012. We can start with January 2012. \nBy the end of that year we can have said: Here is what we need to do \nfor 2013. We will do it with wisdom; we will be able to do it with \ninsight. We also will be able to do it with competence that we know \nwhat is best for our country, which we cannot predict today under this \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:10 \np.m. today the Senate resume debate on the following amendments, and \nthat the time until 5:30 p.m. run concurrently: Feinstein amendment No. \n335, Obama amendment No. 338, and Leahy amendment No. 333; that all \ntime be divided and controlled between the chairman and ranking member \nof the Homeland Security Committee and the sponsors of the amendments; \nthat no amendments be in order to any of the amendments covered under \nthis agreement prior to the vote; that there be 2 minutes of debate \nbetween each vote; that the amendments be voted in the order listed \nunder this agreement, and that at 5:30 p.m., without further \nintervening action or debate, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to \neach amendment covered under this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I would ask unanimous consent that after \nthe three votes I be recognized on the floor for another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would object for the moment pending a conversation \nbetween the Senator from Oklahoma and the managers of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask that the time be charged equally between both parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes of my time to the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I want to make a comment or two about \nthe distribution of funding for homeland security. Of course, there has \nbeen a great deal of discussion about it, but we haven't heard much \nfrom small States.\n  I am from Wyoming and I suggest to my colleagues that we have needs--\nperhaps at a different level but we have needs--like everyone else for \nhomeland security. So I have been a little disappointed with my \ncolleagues' comments yesterday and some today with respect to securing \nAmerica. I actually hadn't heard anything about rural areas, as they \nare at risk as well. I know we have fewer people. But what I\n\n[[Page S2677]]\n\ndid hear is that rural America doesn't need homeland security funding, \nand that is not the case.\n  Most people don't know that Wyoming, which I guess is probably at the \nmoment our smallest populated State, is the largest exporter of energy \nin the United States. We have oil reserves, we have gasfields, we have \ncoal mines, we have powerplants, we have uranium mines, all of which \ncontribute to the rest of the country and to the security of the rest \nof the country. If folks don't believe our rail lines and transmission \nlines and refineries and pipelines are not targets, then we need to \nreevaluate that. We need to think about it again. As a matter of fact, \nif you were someone seeking to do damage, you might think it is easier \nto go into a rather rural area and stop some of the energy development \nthan to go into an urban area and have to go through all the network \nthat is involved.\n  This energy we talk about is the very same energy that drives our \neconomy; it turns on the lights in Los Angeles and New York City. So \nthere are important factors to keep in mind, to keep in perspective as \nwe go about this idea of homeland security and as we think about where \nthe homeland security risks are.\n  Certainly I will tell my colleagues that Wyoming is not as at risk as \nWashington and New York, but, nevertheless, there is a fairly high \nlevel of risk on rural States that provide these kinds of resources. \nOur State is nearly 100,000 square miles in size. It is a State of \ndiverse topography and harsh weather. Major railroads and interstate \nhighways that connect the east and the west coasts of this country \ntraverse the State. Whether it is ships that come into the east and \nwest coasts or whatever, they go through this area and therefore that \nmakes it certainly subject to various kinds of events that could happen \nin terms of homeland security.\n  The movement of hazardous waste by train and vehicle puts the \ncitizens I represent in harm's way every day. When homeland security \ngrants first began, Wyoming initially received roughly $20 million. \nWyoming's share has dropped to $9 million over the course of time.\n  Let me put this debate in context. My State stands to receive roughly \n$10 million out of $3 billion under the plan that has been suggested \nthat we have. I certainly understand that cities such as New York need \nmore than my State; no one is questioning that. I also recognize that \nlarge urban areas have more resources to draw upon than rural areas do. \nWe have less resources to protect the things we have that are not only \nfor our State but that are for our Nation. Congress has debated and \nestablished a fair system. Every State should be provided with baseline \nfunding.\n  I fully support allowing the Department of Homeland Security to \ndetermine who has the greatest risk to qualify for the urban area \nsecurity funding as current law provides. Big-city States have their \nown urban programs so I cannot understand the uproar and anger \nofficials from large populated States have toward their rural \nneighbors.\n  Wyoming generally doesn't ask for a lot, of course, but my State has \na lot more to offer than just wide open country for people on the coast \nto fly over.\n  Let me repeat for my colleagues that Wyoming is the largest exporter \nof energy in the lower 48. Protecting Wyoming's infrastructure and \nsecuring our resources is critical not only to our State but to \nnational well being. I would remind my colleagues who have directly and \nindirectly criticized small States that the States they represent are \nnot the only ones that have risks that need to be addressed.\n  I strongly support Senator Leahy's amendment to put fairness back \ninto the process. Protecting rural America is something that should be \nimportant to all of us. It is all a part of our Nation. No one wins by \nthe current effort to pit big cities against rural America.\n  I hope we can come to an agreement that does deal with national \nsecurity and gives us an opportunity to secure all of the resources in \nour Nation for national benefit.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes of the time \nallocated to me to the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, who \nwill speak on another matter than the three amendments but is \nsympathetic to the position I am taking on the three amendments.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, there is a procedural process that \nis missing.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, was the time running under the quorum \ncall being charged equally or just to one side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for this quorum call has been counted \nagainst Senator Lieberman. The Thomas quorum call counted against \nSenator Collins.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that any \nfurther quorum calls between now and the beginning of the votes at 5:30 \nbe counted equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, to \nbe charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 375\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 20, S. \n372, the Intelligence authorization, 2007; that the Rockefeller-Bond \namendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as \namended, be read the third time and passed; that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that a statement by Senator \nRockefeller be printed in the Record as if read, without intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, on behalf of another Senator--not \nmyself--I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, let me take this opportunity to \nthank many people but not the particular Senator who is objecting--1 \nout of 100. Nevertheless, Senators Reid, Bond, myself, and others have \nworked very hard to move this fiscal year 2007 Intelligence \nauthorization bill forward. All parties have been enormously supportive \nin this effort. It is one of the more embarrassing efforts I have been \nassociated with in my 24 years in this body. I must express my dismay, \nmy absolute dismay. I will hold it to that.\n  Despite considerable efforts on the part of the chairman and Vice \nChairman Bond and extensive efforts and negotiations to get agreement \non this bill, there is still an objection from one Senator for its \nconsideration. Is it just another bill? Not quite. The Senate's failure \nto pass this critical national security legislation for the past 2 \nyears is remarkably shocking and inexcusable.\n  In 2005, the Senate failed, for the first time since the \nestablishment of the congressional intelligence committees, to pass an \nannual Intelligence authorization bill. That means for 27 years we \npassed authorization bills for the Intelligence Committee. It is not an \ninconsequential committee. It instructs how intelligence is to be done. \nThere are a number of changes that have been agreed to. All of that \nfailure was followed by a repeat failure in 2006--in 2005 and then in \n2006.\n\n[[Page S2678]]\n\n  So from 1978 through 2004, the Senate had an unbroken 27-year record \nof completing its work on this critical legislation. You cannot move to \nappropriations until you go through authorization, particularly in a \nfield such as intelligence authorization that has an unbelievably \nimportant role. The Intelligence authorization bill has been considered \nmust-pass legislation for many years--until recently. Now, in the midst \nof the war on terror, with things going downhill in Iraq, going \ndownhill in Afghanistan, and our continued military involvement in both \nplaces, when good intelligence is not just vital but a matter of life \nand death--and I emphasize the second--we have been prevented from \npassing that bill that provides the legislative roadmap for our \nintelligence programs.\n  Similar to the Defense authorization and appropriations bills, the \nIntelligence authorization bill is at the core of our efforts to \nprotect America. That is why it is simply incomprehensible, shocking, \nand debasing that we cannot find a way to bring up and pass this \ncritical legislation.\n  The result of this continued obstruction will be diminished authority \nfor intelligence agencies to do their job in protecting America. I hope \nthe Senator involved takes satisfaction in that. I am not sure his \nconstituents--if it is a he--would. Yes, I am angry.\n  The authorization bill contains 16 separate provisions enhancing or \nclarifying the authority of the Director of National Intelligence. The \nbill includes major improvements in the way we approach and manage \nhuman intelligence, information sharing, protection of sources and \nmethods, and even the nominations process for key intelligence \ncommunity leaders.\n  I came to the floor several times last year to explain those \nprovisions in detail. Today, I reiterate how important this legislation \nis to the war on terrorism and to every other aspect of our national \nsecurity, including the ongoing fight in Iraq and Afghanistan. This \nshould have happened years ago. Somebody objects and, of course, it \ncannot happen; the rules of the Senate prevail.\n  There is no reason the Senate cannot pass this bill quickly, so that \nwe can confer with the House before the committee is required to turn \nits attention to drafting and reporting out what will be another \nexperiment, the 2008 authorization, which we should already be halfway \ntoward completing. If there is objection to passing this bill by \nunanimous consent, we have been--the vice chairman and I, who worked \nvery well together--more than willing to negotiate a time agreement and \nquickly debate and pass this long-overdue national security bill.\n  It is essential we assist the men and women of the intelligence \nagencies to continue their vital work on the frontlines of Iraq and \nAfghanistan and something called the war on terror.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I conclude by simply saying we need \nthis bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont will state his \ninquiry.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Has there been time reserved for the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Further parliamentary inquiry: Is there an order for \nrecognition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Further parliamentary inquiry: Does anybody else have time \nreserved to them?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I believe I do for an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois and the Senator from \nCalifornia each have 13 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, may I just appeal to whatever \nreasoned and reasonable people there may be around here, and that is \nthat the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee has something to \nsay on this matter which relates to what I said. There is a sequential \npower in that which I think deserves consideration.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, in order for the Senator from Missouri \nto speak, would the Senator from Maine or one of the sponsors have to \nyield time to him?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Ms. COLLINS. How much time does the Senator from Maine have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank the ranking member of the \ncommittee.\n  When this committee was formed a long time ago--30 years ago--we \nlacked congressional oversight. Since 9/11, we found that congressional \noversight had not been as good as it should have been, and one of my \nfirst acts when I was appointed vice chairman was I suggested to the \nchairman that passing the authorization bill was the top priority. He \nagreed. We have to be able to pass authorization bills if we are to \nhave an impact on the intelligence community.\n  There are already a number of Rockefeller-Bond amendments on this 9/\n11 bill. There will be more.\n  There are some who say there is nothing an executive branch agency \nvalues more than a lack of congressional oversight. But I believe \ncongressional oversight can help them do their job better.\n  Is this bill perfect? No. But it is largely the same bill as last \nyear, and we have changed provisions that were objectionable. On the \ngood side, it would ensure that the exemption of Freedom of Information \nAct requirements carries over to operational files. There is a specific \nprovision creating, within the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence, a National Space Intelligence Center.\n  In reviewing all these, we worked very closely together to deal with \nproblems in the bill. I believe we have taken care of most of the \nproblems people raised. What I am afraid of is that people are \nobjecting to the bill without knowing what is in the bill, without \nknowing the changes we have made, the accommodations that have been \nmade by the chairman and by the vice chairman to make this bill \nacceptable.\n  Some have said that the administration has concerns. If the \nadministration has concerns, obviously they could exercise those \nconcerns in a veto. But if they have concerns, I am not sure they know \nthe changes and the provisions we have added to this bill.\n  I invite my colleagues who have problems with the bill to talk with \nme or with the chairman about the bill so we can move it. We have \nworked long and hard to help improve the operations of the intelligence \ncommunity. Our bill is the one way we have of providing that guidance \nand sharing with the intelligence community the issues that the \nbipartisan members of this committee believe are important.\n  I invite anybody, all people or any person who has a hold on this \nbill, to come forward and find out what is in the bill. Don't judge it \nby what you think it may contain.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/06/senate-section/article/S2678-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2678-S2690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          IMPROVING AMERICA'S SECURITY ACT OF 2007--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I believe I have 13 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 335\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, yesterday I spoke on an amendment we \noffered. It is cosponsored by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, as \nwell as Senators Lautenberg, Hutchison, Boxer, Schumer, Clinton, Obama, \nMenendez, Kerry, Coburn, and Casey. Essentially, what this amendment \ndoes is provide that more funds will go to States and localities based \non risk, threat, and vulnerability.\n  As you know, Madam President, the 9/11 Commission in their 25th \nrecommendation said, ``Homeland security assistance should be based \nstrictly on an assessment of risk and\n\n[[Page S2679]]\n\nvulnerabilities.'' ``And Federal homeland security assistance should \nnot remain a program for general revenue sharing.''\n  In current law, 40 percent of the money goes to a guaranteed minimum \nallocation--in other words, revenue sharing--and 60 percent is \nallocated based only on risk and effectiveness. The Lieberman-Collins \nbill--and I thank them--changes that. Twenty-four percent of the money \ngoes to satisfy this minimum revenue-sharing requirement, and 76 \npercent is allocated on risk and effectiveness. That is a major step \nforward. There is no question about that. However, Senator Cornyn and I \nand our cosponsors believe that in this day and age, we have to give \nmore money to risk, vulnerability, and threat. Therefore, the formula \nwe present in this amendment will give 87.5 percent of the dollars \nbased on risk and effectiveness, regardless of where that risk and \neffectiveness is, and 13 percent will go to satisfy guaranteed minimum \nallocation.\n\n  The second point I wish to make is that 35 States would benefit under \nthis amendment: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, \nDelaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, \nKentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, \nNebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, \nOhio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, \nWashington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n  I believe this is the right way to allocate homeland security \ndollars.\n  Do you have the risk? Is there a threat? The President, in his State \nof the Union Message, mentioned how a threat and a terrorist plot \nagainst the tallest building on the west coast was eradicated. That \ntallest building on the west coast is shown in this picture. It happens \nto be the Library Tower building in Los Angeles--now under a new name, \nbut nonetheless ``Library Tower'' is its historic name. This is the \nlargest tower on the west coast. There was reportedly a second strike \nby al-Qaida devoted to the west coast. So it seems to me that if there \nis this kind of a threat, the money should go where the threat is.\n  States such as New York, California, and Texas have vast \ninfrastructures. Terrorists go where the hit is going to be greatest, \nwhere the infrastructure is--big ports, big petroleum reserves, big \nbuildings, big congregations of people--and where they can do the most \npsychological damage.\n  So we feel very strongly that this money should have an even stronger \nformula that puts money where the risk and threat actually are.\n  I do wish to correct one thing. Someone on the floor, and I don't \nknow who, but somebody said Washington, DC, would receive less money \nunder this amendment. We do not alter the risk-based distribution of \nthe Urban Area Security Initiative Funds--which are called, in the \nvernacular of Washington, UASIF--and that comprises the lion's share of \nhomeland security preparedness received in our Capital. Washington \nreceived nearly $50 million in UASIF funds last year alone. So we do \nnot believe Washington would be negatively affected.\n  I know Senator Lautenberg wishes to come to the Chamber to speak. May \nI inquire how many minutes of the 13 I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time \nand yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, would that it were that easy, as my \nfriend from California has said, I would be eager to vote for her \namendment, but she is assuming that rather than following what the law \nnow says, the head of the Department of Homeland Security will use \ndiscretion always to benefit everybody's State--something we saw does \nnot always work, as the people suffered after Katrina.\n  Under the amendment of the Senator from California, States that will \nsubstantially gain are California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, \nLouisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, \nOhio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington. The States, however, that \nlose or break even by lowering the all-State minimum for homeland \nsecurity formula grants are these. I hope Senators are listening \nbecause they are going to be called upon to vote. These are the States \nwhich lose or break even. They don't receive an additional amount. The \nStates that lose or break even by lowering the all-State minimum are \nAlabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, \nDistrict of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, \nMaine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New \nHampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma.\n  Madam President, I haven't used my 13 minutes yet, have I? I still \nhave a lot more States to name.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I may need it.\n  Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, \nVermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n  In case anybody missed that, these are the States which will lose if \nmy colleagues do not adopt the Leahy-Thomas, et al amendment. These \nStates will lose if my colleagues adopt the amendment of the Senator \nfrom California: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, \nConnecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, \nIndiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, \nMississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New \nMexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, \nSouth Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, \nWisconsin, and Wyoming. The Senators from those States, of course, feel \nfree to vote any way they want, but should anybody be checking back \nhome, they should know what their vote means.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will support the Leahy-Thomas amendment, No. \n333, to restore the minimum allocation for States in the State Homeland \nSecurity Grant Program from .45 percent, which is proposed by the \nunderlying bill, and bring it back to current law. We are not asking \nfor an increase but bring it back to current law, which is .75 percent. \nIf you don't, the proposed changes in the formula result in the loss of \nmillions in homeland security funding for the fire, police and rescue \ndepartments in small- and medium-sized States. It will also deal a \ncrippling blow to dozens of States' efforts to fulfill federally \nmandated multiyear plans to build and to sustain their terrorism \npreparedness.\n  What I am saying is, the Federal Government has said: Here, small \nStates, cities, communities. Here is what we are saying you have to do. \nInitially, they said: We will give you some money to help. But now we \nare going to say: You still have to do it, but tax your people to do \nit. We don't have the money. We are going to send it to the Iraqi fire \ndepartments and to the Iraqi police departments. We are going to send \nit to the Iraqi homeland security. We can't spend it on your State.\n  As with current law, the State minimum under our amendment would \ncontinue to apply--and this is important--only to 40 percent of the \noverall funding under this program. The majority of the funds would \ncontinue to be allocated based on risk assessment criteria, which are \nthe funds of several separate discretionary programs the Congress has \nestablished for solely urban and high-risk areas. A lot of these \nsmaller States have voted for these extra amounts for these urban and \nhigh-risk areas. I think it is a good idea. The majority of the funds \nare not allocated to these smaller States or to areas based on risk \nassessment requirements. The underlying bill now before the Senate \nwould reduce the all-State minimum. The House bill reduces it even \nfurther.\n  We know, however, that this is a matter that is going to face the \nconference anyway, and because of these formula differences, there is \nno guarantee that the minimum will not even further be slashed during \nconference. Small- and medium-sized States face enormous cuts. With \nappropriations for formula grants already being cut by 60 percent since \n2003--$2.3 billion in 2003 to $900 million in fiscal year 2007--further \nreductions to first-responder funding would hamper even more these \nStates' efforts. The cuts would be even deeper should the President's \nbudget request for next year be approved,\n\n[[Page S2680]]\n\nsince he has requested only $250 million for these two important first \nresponder grant programs.\n  I am almost tempted to tell some of these small States and towns to \nchange their names to Baghdad or northern Iraq or something similar to \nthat and they will get all the money they want but not if they want to \ndefend their own people here in the United States. I have heard the \nargument from urban States, arguing that Federal money to fight \nterrorism is wasted in smaller States. They seem to forget that the \nattacks on 9/11 added to the responsibilities and the risks of all the \nState and local first responders nationwide. The Federal Government has \ncalled on all of them, and the portion that is allocated to all \nStates--again, only a portion of these funds--is part of the Federal \nGovernment's fulfillment of that directive.\n  I hope my colleagues will support my amendment to restore the .75-\npercent minimum base and ensure continued support and resources for our \npolice, fire, and ambulance services in every State. Homeland security \nis a new responsibility entrusted to our first responders, and this \nprogram, along with this assurance of basic help--not the special help \nthat goes to the large States but the special help that goes where we \nsee special needs--but this basic help will make a big difference.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Very quickly. Vote against my amendment, and here are the \nStates that lose: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, \nConnecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, \nIowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, \nMontana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North \nDakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, \nTennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and \nWyoming. If you want to vote for my friend from California, the States \nthat do gain are: California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, \nMassachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, \nPennsylvania, Texas, and Washington.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I believe I have 6 minutes, and I \nwould like to use 2 of them.\n  I very much disagree with the figures of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont. We wrote to the Congressional Research Service and asked \nthem to compute the grant numbers. They gave us back a document, dated \nFebruary 27, that relates to the two programs funded in this bill. One \nof them is the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the other is \nthe Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program, and these are the \nnumbers that CRS presents. Actually, Vermont, according to CRS, \nbenefits $72,250, according to the Congressional Research Service, as \ndo 35 States. I didn't make up these numbers.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nmemorandum from the Congressional Research Service, which is a straight \nmathematical computation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2007.\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Senator Dianne Feinstein, Attention: Ahmad Thomas.\n     From: Steven Maguire, Analyst in Public Finance, Government \n         and Finance Division.\n     Subject: DHS Grants to States and Insular Areas Under H.R. 1, \n         S. 4, and S. 608.\n       This memorandum responds to your request for a comparison \n     of three legislative proposals: H.R. 1, S. 4 as approved by \n     the Senate Homeland Security Committee, and S. 608. In \n     particular, you asked CRS to estimate how much each state \n     would receive through two programs under each proposal: (1) \n     the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) and (2) the \n     Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program (LETPP). All \n     three proposals would lower the minimum grant award that \n     states could receive under current law. S. 608, unlike H.R. l \n     and S. 4, only sets a minimum for funds authorized for SHSGP. \n     You asked CRS, for comparative purposes, to include LETPP \n     funds in the minimum when calculating the state-by-state \n     allocations.\n       Note that a third related DHS grant program, the Urban \n     Areas Security Initiative (UASI), is not considered in this \n     memorandum. The total grant amount to each state would change \n     if UASI grant awards were included. However, the information \n     needed to estimate UASI grant awards to each state under the \n     three legislative proposals is not publicly available.\n       A question that immediately arises is how proposed changes \n     to the minimum grant awards would affect the aggregate SHSGP \n     and LETPP grant amounts awarded to each state, the District \n     of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the insular areas. Answering \n     that question precisely, however, is problematic because DHS \n     does not disclose the risk and effectiveness scores it \n     assigns to grant applications. Accordingly, we relied on \n     three basic assumptions to generate what we consider \n     responsible ``rough justice'' estimates of grant amounts \n     under the aforementioned approaches:\n       Assumption 1. DHS Risk and effectiveness scores for each \n     applicant under the three proposals will equal those for \n     FY2006. This assumption is valid only to the extent that the \n     determinants of risk and effectiveness that pertain to each \n     applicant and the DHS scoring system do not significantly \n     vary from one year to the next.\n       Assumption 2. A proxy for each grant recipient's risk and \n     effectiveness score in FY2006 can be found in the ratio of \n     (a) the amount of the recipient's FY2006 total grant that was \n     based on risk and effectiveness to (b) the sum of risk and \n     effectiveness amounts for all recipients. In other words, if \n     one assumes that if a recipient received 5 percent of the \n     total funds available for allocation on the basis of risk and \n     effectiveness in FY2006, then that recipient will receive 5 \n     percent of the total funds available for allocation on the \n     basis of risk and effectiveness under S. 608, H.R. 1, and S. \n     4.\n       Assumption 3. The total authorization for S. 608 and H.R. 1 \n     will match the amount authorized in S. 4, to wit: \n     $913,180,500.\n\n\n                                 Caveat\n\n       The estimates presented in the following discussion are \n     intended for illustrative purposes only. Actual grant \n     allocations will almost certainly differ from the estimates \n     presented here. In addition, estimates for S. 608, which do \n     not include funds for LETPP in the minimum, are based on the \n     assumption that LETPP funds are included.\n\n\n                       Calculating the Estimates\n\n       Estimating grants for each eligible recipient involves the \n     following steps, the results of which are shown in Table 1:\n       1. Establish the proxies for risk and effectiveness.\n       2. Allocate the total available $913,180,500 in proportion \n     to the proxies.\n       3. When a recipient's risk and effectiveness allocation is \n     less than the statutory minimum, allocate an additional \n     amount to reach the minimum.\n       4. Because this results in a total greater than \n     $913,180,500, proportionally reduce the grants of all \n     recipients in excess of the minimum to prevent exceeding the \n     authorization.\n       5. Display the resulting adjusted estimated allocations. .\n       Establishing Proxies for Risk and Effectiveness Scores. In \n     FY2006, Congress appropriated a total of $912 million for the \n     SHSGP and LETPP programs--40 percent ($365 million) was \n     allocated to satisfy the minimum grant award requirements for \n     eligible recipients and the remaining 60 percent ($547 \n     million) was allocated based on risk and effectiveness. \n     Examination of column (b) in Table 1 shows, for example, that \n     California received 15.18 percent of the $547 million; New \n     York, 8.52 percent; Texas, 8.05 percent; and Florida, 6.82 \n     percent. These percentages and the corresponding \n     percentage for each grant recipient serve as a proxy for \n     each jurisdiction's risk-and-effectiveness score for the \n     CRS estimated allocations under S. 608, H.R. 1, and S. 4.\n       Estimating Risk and Effectiveness. H.R. 1 and S. 4 would \n     allocate total SHSGP and LETPP amounts by risk and assessment \n     subject to statutory minimums--lower than under existing law. \n     In order to estimate the risk and effectiveness allocations \n     for each eligible jurisdiction, we multiply the proxy \n     percentage discussed above by the total authorization of \n     $913,180,500. For comparative purposes, as you instructed, \n     CRS used the same methodology for S. 608.\n       Meeting the Minimums. As noted earlier, existing law sets \n     two minimum amounts based on the total appropriation: 0.75 \n     percent per state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, \n     0.25 percent for other U.S. insular areas. S. 608 would \n     ensure a minimum of 0.25 percent per state, the District of \n     Columbia, and Puerto Rico and 0.08 percent for other insular \n     areas. In contrast, S. 4 would ensure a minimum of 0.45 \n     percent per state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. \n     The other U.S. insular areas would be guaranteed the same \n     0.08 percent. Under H.R. 1, however, there would be three \n     minimum amounts based on the total appropriation: 0.45 \n     percent for international border states (18 states); 0.25 \n     percent for states without an international border (32 \n     states), the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico; and 0.08 \n     percent for the other U.S. insular areas. With an \n     authorization of $913,180,500, these minimums would be \n     $4,109,312 and $2,282,951 for the two categories of states, \n     respectively, and $730,544 for insular areas.\n       The last column of Table 1, column (f), compares S. 608 to \n     S. 4. A positive amount in column (f) indicates that the \n     state would receive more under S. 608 than under S. 4.\n\n[[Page S2681]]\n\n       For a complete explanation of the methodology used to \n     redistribute funds so that all jurisdictions receive the \n     required minimum, and the total authorization is not \n     exceeded, see CRS report RL33859, Fiscal Year 2007 Homeland \n     Security Grant Program, H.R. 1 and S. 4: Description and \n     Analysis, by Shawn Reese and Steven Maguire.\n       If you have any questions about this memorandum, please \n     call me on extension 7-7841 or send an e-mail to \n     smaguire@crs.1oc.gov.\n\n   TABLE 1.--COMPARISON OF S. 608, H.R. 1, AND S. 4 ASSUMING A $913,180,500 AUTHORIZATION FOR SHSGP AND LETPP\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          Estimated post-adjustment allocations\n                                          FY2006 share ------------------------------------------\n              Jurisdiction                of risk and                                  S. 4 as     S. 608* less\n                                         effectiveness     S. 608*       H.R. 1     amended Feb.

As I say, I understand there is a basic conflict here \nbetween small States and big States. There is a basic conflict between \nthose who think the money should be spread around and those who believe \nthis money should be used based on risk, vulnerability, and threat. I \nam in the latter. If the big threat is in Vermont, I am all for the \nmoney going to Vermont. I have no problem with that.\n  I look at the intelligence and I see the threats as they come in and \nI think the agencies that make the decisions should send the money \nbased on their analysis of the intelligence and the threats.\n  I do wish to at least give my source, which is the Congressional \nResearch Service, for these numbers which show 35 States as \nbeneficiaries.\n  I know Senator Lautenberg should be here momentarily. I reserve the \nremainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Who yields time?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nfrom the National Criminal Justice Association, in support of the \nformulas in the underlying bill, be printed in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n                                                 National Criminal\n\n\n                                          Justice Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 2007.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lieberman and Collins: On behalf of the \n     National Criminal Justice Association (NCJA), I write to \n     express our support for a number of important provisions in \n     the Improving America's Security by Implementing Unfinished \n     Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, or S. 4. \n     NCJA members administer justice assistance grant funding in \n     the states and tribal nations, and state and local criminal \n     justice practitioners from all parts of the criminal and \n     juvenile justice systems. In addition, NCJA provides direct \n     technical assistance\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\n     and training to state and local homeland security grant \n     administrators for all U.S. states and territories.\n       First, thank you for maintaining the Law Enforcement \n     Terrorism Prevention Program (LETPP) in your bill. The LETPP \n     provides needed support to public safety agencies across the \n     country for terrorism prevention, training and information \n     sharing. As a direct result of the LETPP funding over the \n     past several years, state and local law enforcement agencies \n     have become stronger partners with other homeland security \n     disciplines in the effort to prevent, not just respond to, a \n     terror attack. In addition, the LETPP provides invaluable \n     financial assistance to our state and local law enforcement \n     partners as they address the country's homeland security \n     priorities outlined in the National Preparedness Goal. One of \n     the most successful initiatives undertaken by state and local \n     first responders has been the all-source, Intelligence Fusion \n     Centers, funded primarily through the LETPP program. Clearly \n     the LETPP has been a tremendous mechanism by which state and \n     local public safety programs have been built to address the \n     new requirements for all-hazards and terrorism prevention and \n     response.\n       Second, we commend the Committee's creation of an Office \n     for the Prevention of Terrorism. As described in the bill, \n     this new office would be a useful point of coordination and \n     support for law enforcement within the Department of Homeland \n     Security. Coordination and information sharing among the \n     federal, state and local law enforcement and public safety \n     agencies is critically important. This new office would serve \n     as a point of liaison and as an advocate for prevention and \n     law enforcement activities, thereby increasing coordination, \n     focusing funding and, ultimately, increasing the safety of \n     our citizens.\n       Third, we ask for your continued support for a minimum \n     guarantee for State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) \n     funds. The primary goals of any national homeland security \n     strategy should be to: increase preparedness in our largest \n     urban areas; protect our targets of international \n     significance; and, to increase overall national preparedness. \n     An attack or disruption of our power or water or food supply \n     could occur anywhere. Core foundations of our economy could \n     be crippled from outside one of our major urban areas. States \n     are working hard to protect assets of national importance \n     within their borders and the safety of all our citizens. Only \n     by continuing a fair, balanced and substantial state minimum \n     guarantee can we be assured that all states reach a threshold \n     of preparedness under a national preparedness plan.\n       We thank you for your work on this important piece of \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Cabell Cropper,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to make sure my colleagues \nrecognize that under the amendment offered by my distinguished \ncolleague and friend from California, that States would have absolutely \nno guarantee at all of minimum funding under the Law Enforcement \nTerrorist and Prevention Program. This is a very important program. It \nhas provided needed support to public safety agencies across the \ncountry for terrorism prevention, training, and information sharing. As \nthe direct result of the LETPP funding over the past several years, \nState and local law enforcement agencies have become strong partners \nwith homeland security.\n  I wish to point out one of the most important uses of funds under \nthis program has been to establish with State and local first \nresponders all-source intelligence fusion centers that have been funded \nprimarily through the LETPP program. Clearly, it has been a very \nsuccessful program, and one of my concerns about the amendment offered \nby my friend from California is she eliminates the minimum under this \nprogram. That means that potentially a State could receive no funding \nat all under this program.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The time will be charged equally to all controlling time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I will proceed and yield myself time.\n  The first two amendments, one offered by the Senator from California \nand the second offered by the Senator from Illinois, are an attempt to \nget more funding for the large States at the expense of the smaller \nStates, and there is a myth around about the fact that the larger \nStates are not being adequately funded. The fact is that under the \nfiscal year 2006 homeland security grant funding, five States--\nCalifornia, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois--received 42 percent \nof the antiterrorism funds, while 20 States received less than 12 \npercent cumulatively.\n  California received in fiscal year 2006 as much money as the 22 \nStates at the bottom in funding.\n  I wish to thank my staff members for their humility in holding up \nthat chart.\n  What I am saying is, somebody said the money is being spread across \nthe country like peanut butter. No way. There is a lot of peanut butter \nand jelly going to the larger States. They deserve it, but they would, \nby these two amendments, the Feinstein and Obama amendments, would take \neven more money, as the Senator from Vermont quite movingly \ndemonstrated in his rollcall of the losing States. Why do the smaller \nStates deserve something? Because that is the nature of the enemy. \nEverybody is vulnerable to this terrorist enemy to some degree. We are \nnot making this up.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, since we yielded 6 or 7 \nminutes to the Intelligence chairman and vice chairman, to add 4 \nminutes to the time I was allocated under the initial proposal. It may \nbe that we will still be able to vote at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Reserving the right to object. The Senator from \nCalifornia, I believe, still has time remaining.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes, indeed. This will not interfere with the time she \nhas reserved for the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. All right. The Senator from California is giving her \ntime to me, so I wanted to be sure that time remains.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes, indeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Here is the point. We know the terrorists on 9/11 \nstruck New York, Washington, and Washington was probably intended \nagain--the plane went down in Pennsylvania. But what was the single \nmost devastating terrorist attack in the United States before 9/11? It \nwas the bomb at the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, but \nOklahoma City would not benefit from these amendments from the Senators \nfrom California and Illinois.\n  Let's go around the world. In 2001, a plot was uncovered by \nintelligence agencies to attack an American school in Singapore. In \n2002, in Bali, Indonesia, terrorists targeted a discotheque. In 2003, \nterrorists struck a residential compound in Riyahd. In 2004, terrorists \ntargeted a school in Beslan. In October 2004, computer disks were \ndiscovered in Iraq at a known insurgent's home containing detailed \nfloor layouts and evacuation routes for plans in various States in the \nUnited States of America.\n  This is the nature of the enemy. This is an inhumane but thinking \nenemy. They will strike where they determine we are most vulnerable. \nThat is why we think, as a matter of elemental fairness but also sound \nand strong homeland security, that most of the money ought to go to the \nlarge States with the most visible, potential terrorist targets, but \nthat some minimal amount ought to go to all States.\n  Senator Leahy would do that beyond what the bill does. Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Obama would reduce the amount most of the States \nwould get under this proposal from what the committee bill recommends. \nThat is why I strongly oppose the first two amendments that will come \nbefore us at around 5:30.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I come to the floor to support the \nFeinstein-Cornyn amendment and tell you I must say I do not get it. We \nare talking now about the security of our country. We are talking about \nwhether we put the fences up around the most susceptible targets or \nwhether we put fences, protective fences, around places in the country \nwhere there is no threat.\n  To every place there is a threat. No matter where you go, you can see \na place that can be a threat. But where the disease is, that is what \nthe hospital is there for. Take those who have the potential for the \ndisease. If you use an analogy, you don't start putting the antidote in \nplaces where the likelihood of catching this disease is not very \nstrong.\n  We are looking at this amendment and this bill. Thirty-four States, \nbesides New Jersey, will have resources\n\n[[Page S2683]]\n\ntaken away. In my State, the FBI has determined the 2-mile stretch \nbetween the airport, Newark-Liberty International Airport and Port \nNewark, is America's most at-risk area for a terrorist attack. We know \nthat in a moment of an orange alert the Prudential Building in Newark \nhas been a specific target of terrorists. In fact, in the summer of \n2004 only three specific areas were identified as potential targets \nunder the orange alert: northern New Jersey, New York, and Washington, \nDC. Yet I have listened to my colleagues, and it disturbs me that they \ntrivialize this purchase of some trucks in New Jersey. If those trucks \nwere used to take debris out of an exploded or damaged area, they would \nbe pretty valuable trucks. If there were snow on the ground when an \nattack took place, it would be absolutely essential that we have those \ntrucks.\n  We were struck and 700 people from New Jersey died, as did 2,400 \nothers from other places around the area. We know where the heat is \nwhen it gets hot. We ought not be dealing out pork. This is not a \nrestaurant. We are not talking about pork. We are not talking about \nputting money out there in case there is an attack here or there. We \nknow where the attacks take place. They take place in places with high \ndensity populations such as London or Spain. We know New Jersey is at \nrisk. New York is at risk. We know other major cities are at risk. They \nhave been identified, and homeland security funds to fight terrorism \nshould go to those places.\n  Recommendation 25 of the 9/11 Commission report said homeland \nsecurity grants should be distributed based solely on risk. We are \nhaving a debate here, saying no, the fact that there are risks should \nnot count because everybody is at risk. Everybody is at risk but not at \nthe same degree.\n  I hope our colleagues will respond in a way that is recommended by \nthe 9/11 Commission, supported by Secretary Chertoff of the Department \nof Homeland Security, and logic. Logic is on this side.\n  I encourage my colleagues to embrace a risk-based approach and \nsupport the Feinstein-Cornyn-Lautenberg amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is left to the proponents of \nthe various amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 2 minutes \nremaining, the senior Senator from Vermont has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining, and the junior Senator from Illinois has 13 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thought we were voting at 5:30. That time has slipped or \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, using part of my remaining time, again I \nwould tell my friends, my dear friend, the senior Senator from New \nJersey and others, we have set aside nearly 60 percent of these funds \nfor special purposes, high-threat areas, areas that we determine need \nthat money. We are talking about the all-State minimum going to what is \nremaining.\n  Again, I hope someone is listening to this debate. You can vote for \nthese next two amendments and a few States will gain from them, but if \nyou vote for these next two amendments, here are the States that will \nlose or at best break even: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, \nColorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, \nIndiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, \nMississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New \nMexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma--Mr. President, I haven't used my 13 \nminutes yet, have I, because I still have a lot of States to name \nhere----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I may need it--Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South \nDakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, \nand Wyoming.\n  Without sounding like a poor rendition of Johnny Cash's song ``I Have \nBeen Everywhere, Man''--one of my favorites, I might say; he actually \nmentions Brattleboro, VT. If you vote for my amendment, which will be \nthe third one, here are the States that do not lose or break even. \nThese are the States that will be protected under current funding: \nAlabama, Alaska--these are States I hope will support the amendment of \nthe Senator from Vermont, because it is to their State's benefit: \nAlabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of \nColumbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, \nMaryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New \nHampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, \nRhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, \nVirginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming--I realize the District of \nColumbia can't vote, but if they could, they would vote with us.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining to the Senator from Vermont \nor is any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 363\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nsend an amendment to the desk, so it becomes pending. I already cleared \nit with both the ranking member and the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 363 to amendment No. 275.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a Law Enforcement Assistance Force in the \n  Department of Homeland Security to facilitate the contributions of \n        retired law enforcement officers during major disasters)\n\n       On page 389, after line 13, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 15__.

Stafford Disaster Relief \n     and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122).\n       (h) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this section.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 335\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, we have a few moments before the vote \nwill go off. I gather Senator Obama is going to yield back the time \nremaining to him. I say to my friends, the committee bill reported out \non a bipartisan vote, 16 to 0, with one abstention, has a balanced \nformula in it that overall would increase homeland security funding to \nall States. We recognize with respect, and I think a sense of reality, \nthat all of the States and all of the people of the United States are \nvulnerable in the war against terrorism, and there ought to be some \nminimum amount for our first responders at each State level.\n  The two amendments we are going to vote on, therefore, I oppose, \nbecause they would alter the formula in the bill. Under the Feinstein \namendment, 34 States lose homeland security funding as compared to the \nformula in the bill. I repeat, we understand there are, based on \nsubjective risk assessments, visible targets that appear particularly \nin larger States that one might say were probably more likely to be \ntargets of terrorists. We acknowledge that. Our formulas give most of \nthe money to these areas.\n  I repeat a number that struck me. In this fiscal year, 42 percent of \nthe homeland security grant funding goes to 5 States: California, \nTexas, New York, Florida, and Illinois. It should go to these states. \nBut I do not think, insofar as the first two amendments that are \nsponsored by colleagues from California and Illinois, they should want \nmore of the money, and take it from 34 States--in the case of the first \namendment by Senator Feinstein from California; that they should take \nfrom the other States which have needs as well.\n  This is a balanced formula in the underlying bill that gives the \noverwhelming amount of money out to the States based on risk, but says \neach State deserves some minimum because of the nature of the threat we \nface.\n  The first amendment will be the one offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia. I urge my colleagues to oppose that amendment.\n  May I ask the Chair, has all time been used up except for the time of \nthe Senator from Illinois?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I understand through the staff of the Senator from \nIllinois that he is prepared to yield back his time.\n  Mr. President, I think, consistent with the spirit, if not the exact \nletter, of the unanimous consent we agreed to, there should be a minute \ngiven to the Senator from California in support of the amendment, and \nperhaps a minute to my ranking member in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the point of this amendment is to \nproduce a bill that, as nearly as possible, mirrors the recommendations \nof the 9/11 Commission. Those recommendations were clear and distinct. \nMoney should go to communities based on risk, threat, and \nvulnerability. This should not be a revenue-sharing program. Yes, the \nbig States have more infrastructure, more highrises, more tunnels, more \nsubways--the kinds of things that are attractive to terrorists. If that \nis in fact the case, as judged not by us but by the experts, then that \nmoney should be able to go where there is risk, threat, and \nvulnerability.\n  That is all this amendment does. We did not pull our figures out of \nthe clear blue that concluded that 35 States are benefitted. These are \nthe products of the Congressional Research Service analysis. We sent \nthem the facts, and what they say is, assuming a $913 million \nauthorization for the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Law \nEnforcement Terrorist Program, this would be the result.\n  You cannot say whether someone is going to get a grant, but these are \ntheir nearest computations of who would benefit on that list. Yes, some \nStates do lose; there is no question.\n  Please vote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this amendment is virtually identical to \na proposal we voted on last July during the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill. In fact, we have repeatedly voted on this formula \nissue. We need to bring all States up to a certain baseline level of \npreparedness. That does not mean we do not figure in the risk; we do. \nIndeed, under our bill 95 percent of the State Homeland Security Grant \nProgram funds and 100 percent of the Urban Area Security Initiative \nfunding will be allocated based on risk.\n  The Senator's analysis does not look at the impact she would have on \nall four of the programs included in our bill, yet her amendment does \naffect all four, and that is the reason our analysis is different.\n  We cannot assume a precise calculation of risk. A Federal building in \nOklahoma City was not an obvious target for a terrorist bombing, and \nyet we know the tragic attack that occurred in that city.\n  Rural flight schools were not obvious training grounds for \nterrorists, and yet we know that terrorists trained in Norman, OK.\n  Portland, ME, was not an obvious departure point for the terrorist \npilots as they began their journey of death and destruction on \nSeptember 11, and that is exactly what occurred.\n  My point is that terrorists can and do shelter, train, recruit, plan, \nprepare, and attack in unlikely places. That is one reason our bill \nputs so much emphasis on prevention, an emphasis that would be lost in \nthe Senator's amendment.\n  I urge opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Feinstein amendment No. 335.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I move to table the Feinstein amendment \nNo. 335 and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, there will now be 2 minutes \nof debate equally divided on Obama amendment No. 338.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, this amendment aims at moving us closer to \na risk-based allocation of resources. It takes us a step closer to the \n9/11 Commission report. I want to let everyone know that 34 States \nactually potentially do better under this amendment. Six States are \nheld harmless, and there are some States that would get less money. But \nkeep in mind the whole goal of this particular program is to ensure \nthat money is allocated on the basis of risk. It would still be .25 \npercent of the money allocated to every State. It would still be a \nminimum, and there would still be money through other programs that \nwould ensure that money is allocated to States for all-hazard purposes.\n  So I strongly urge all in this Chamber to take a look at this bill \nand look at the chart that we passed out. There have been arguments \nfrom my good friend, the Senator from Connecticut, as well as the \nSenator from Maine, suggesting that somehow States get less money. That \nis only the baseline; it does not include the money that would be \nallocated on the basis of risk.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this motion to table.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment by the \nSenator from Illinois, and in that sense to support the very balanced \nformula in our underlying bill which gives most of the money in \nhomeland security grant funding based on risk but acknowledges that \nevery State faces the threat of terrorism and therefore deserves some \nminimum amount of funding. This amendment essentially raises the same \npoints that the amendment offered by the Senator from California did, \nwhich my colleagues were just good enough to table. The amendment of \nthe Senator from Illinois would leave 32 of our States with less \nguaranteed funding than the underlying bill, S. 4.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the committee bill and oppose this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next two votes be 10-\nminute votes as opposed to 15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

I hope we \ncan have a good, full day of trying to complete this bill, and I also \nhope we can work something out where we may not have to have a cloture \nvote on Friday. If we do, we have to finish this bill this week. We \ncould have some votes late into Friday. Everyone should be put on \nnotice now that it may be necessary to have some Friday votes.\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, first I have a modification of my amendment \nNo. 357 I would like to send to the desk. That amendment has already \nbeen offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At page 174, strike line 1 and all that follows through \n     page 175, line 18, and insert the following:\n       ``(1) Data-mining.--The term ``data-mining'' means a query \n     or search or other analysis of one or more electronic \n     databases, where--\n       (A) a department or agency of the Federal Government is \n     conducting the query or search or other analysis to find a \n     pattern indicating terrorist or other criminal activity on \n     the part of any individual or individuals;\n       (B) the search does not use personal identifiers of a \n     specific individual or does not utilize inputs that appear on \n     their face to identify or be associated with a specified \n     individual to acquire information, to retrieve information \n     from the database or databases; and\n       (C) at least one of the databases was obtained from or \n     remains under the control of a non-Federal entity, or the \n     information was acquired initially by another department or \n     agency of the Federal Government for purposes other than \n     intelligence or law enforcement.\n       (2) Database.--The term ``database'' does not include \n     telephone directories, news reporting, information publicly \n     available via the Internet or available by any other means to \n     any member of the public, any databases maintained, operated, \n     or controlled by a State, local, or tribal government (such \n     as a State motor vehicle database), or databases of judicial \n     and administrative opinions.\n       (c) Reports on Data Mining Activities by Federal \n     Agencies.--\n       (1) Requirement for report.--The head of each department or \n     agency of the Federal Government that is engaged in any \n     activity to use or develop data mining shall submit a report \n     to Congress on all such activities of the department or \n     agency under the jurisdiction of that official.

Mr. President, at this point I wish to briefly address \nanother amendment, amendment No. 317, which is already pending. This is \nan amendment which would prohibit rewarding families of suicide bombers \nfor such attacks and stiffen penalties for other terrorist crimes. This \nis one we can hopefully adopt on a bipartisan basis. It would create \nthe new offense of aiding the family or associates of a terrorist with \nthe intent to encourage terrorist acts. It is targeted at those \nindividuals who give money to the families of suicide bombers after \nsuch bombings. The amendment would make it a Federal offense to do so \nif the act can be connected to the United States and if the defendant \nacted with the intent to facilitate, reward, or encourage international \nacts of terrorism.\n  Let me offer an example of why this amendment is necessary. In August \nof 2001, a Palestinian suicide bomber attacked a Sbarro pizza parlor in \nJerusalem. Among those killed was an American citizen, Shoshana \nGreenbaum, who was a schoolteacher and who was pregnant at the time. \nShortly after this bombing took place, the family of the suicide bomber \nwas told to go to the Arab Bank. The bomber's family began receiving \nmonthly payments through an account at that bank and later received a \nlump payment of $6,000.\n  According to press accounts, this is not the only time Arab Bank has \nfunneled money to the families of suicide bombers. One news account \ndescribes a branch of the bank in the Palestinian territories whose \nwalls are covered with posters eulogizing suicide bombers.\n  According to other news accounts, these suicide bombers in the \nPalestinian territories are recruited with the promises that their \nfamilies will be taken care of financially after the attack. Saudi \ncharities, the Palestinian Authority, and even Saddam Hussein have \nrewarded suicide bombers' families for their acts. According to one \naccount, Saddam Hussein paid $35 million to terrorists' families during \nhis time. Obviously, his actions are no longer of concern, but we \nshould all be deeply concerned about other wealthy individuals and \nfinancial institutions that continue to pay out these rewards. It is \nundoubtedly the case that in some instances, these payments make the \ndifference in whether an individual will commit a suicide bombing.\n  My amendment will make it a Federal crime, with extraterritorial \njurisdiction in cases that can be linked to U.S. interests, to pay the \nfamilies of suicide bombers and other terrorists with the intent to \nfacilitate terrorist acts. My amendment also makes other improvements \nto the antiterrorism laws, primarily by increasing the maximum \npenalties for various aspects of the material support offenses, which \nalready exist in law.\n  I hope, as I said, my colleagues will view this as an amendment which \nwe can adopt on a bipartisan basis. It is an important amendment to \nensure that another avenue of terrorism can be shut off. I ask for my \ncolleagues' affirmative consideration of this amendment No. 317, and I \nthank the Senator from Oklahoma for his courtesies extended to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me also address my thanks to our \ncolleague from Oklahoma. Before I discuss the Banking Committee's \ncontribution to this important bill, I would like to take a moment to \nprovide some thoughts on the overall bill--especially the initiatives \npertaining to our Nation's homeland security. Over 5 years after the \ntragic events of 9/11 and almost 20 months since the tragic events of \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita, we continue to hear from Governors, county \nexecutives, mayors, first responders, health professionals, and \nemergency preparedness officials that our country as a whole remains \nunprepared for another manmade or natural disaster. We have heard the \nargument, which I support, that Congress needs to do more to support \nregional and local efforts to protect Americans.\n  Overall, I believe this bill takes a critical step forward in \nprotecting Americans at home from manmade and natural disasters. It \ncodifies several recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission--seminal \nrecommendations that, nearly 3 years after being\n\n[[Page S2687]]\n\nissued, have still not been implemented by this White House or the \nCongress.\n  I support the measures in this bill designed to allocate critical \nresources based on concrete risk and effectiveness analysis. I also \nsupport the measure in this bill that establishes a minimum base of \nfunding for all States. We all know how important initiatives like the \nState Homeland Security Grant Program and the Law Enforcement Terrorism \nPrevention Program are to our States and localities. While I believe \nthose areas with higher degrees of risk from manmade and natural \ndisasters should receive adequate resources proportionate to that risk, \nI also believe that all areas of our country should receive a base \namount of funding that guarantees the protection of all Americans.\n  I am going to jump to the section of the legislation over which the \nSenate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee has specific \njurisdiction. The Presiding Officer is a distinguished member of the \ncommittee. He will recall just a few weeks ago we marked up the transit \nsecurity bill which is now a part of this legislation.\n  I thank Senator Richard Shelby, my ranking member on the committee, \nformer chairman of the committee, for his cooperation, and I thank all \nmembers of the committee. We marked up this piece of the bill now \nbefore the Senate, unanimously. It is very much a reflection of what \nthe committee did previously in the 109th Congress to deal with \ntransportation security, and we thought it was an important matter to \nraise at the outset.\n  My compliments to the chairman of the committee for the underlying \nlegislation, who is responsible for the homeland security issues, and \nhis colleague from Maine, for the tremendous work they have done on \nthis bill, and for others who have been involved in it.\n  I would be remiss if I also didn't commend the distinguished chairman \nof the Commerce Committee, Senator Inouye, and his ranking member, \nSenator Stevens, for their work, as well as Senator Reid, the majority \nleader, for bringing this all together in one package.\n  It is also important we recognize how important transit security is. \nThe Presiding Officer and others will recall we had a hearing on this \nsubject matter and heard from some very interesting witnesses. It is \nnot all that common that we invite witnesses who are not U.S. citizens \nto come and participate in congressional hearings. But given the \ntragedies in Madrid and London, we thought it might be worthwhile to \nhear from those who manage the transit operations in those two cities \nto come and share with us information about those two experiences. I \nthink their testimony was very helpful in galvanizing the importance of \nthis issue and the attention of the committee and, we hope, our \ncolleagues as well.\n  We learned in those hearings, of course, that transit attacks have \nunfortunately been the major source of some of the terrorist activities \nover the last number of years. It is no secret that worldwide \nterrorists have favored public transit as a target. Transit has been \nthe single most frequent target of terrorism.\n  In the decade leading up to 2000, 42 percent of terrorist attacks \nworldwide targeted rail systems or buses, according to a study done by \nthe Brookings Institution. In 2005 they attacked, as I mentioned, \nLondon's rail and bus system killing 52 riders and injuring almost 700 \nmore in what has been called London's bloodiest peacetime attack. In \n2004 they attacked Madrid's metro system killing 192 people and leaving \n1,500 people injured.\n  The Banking Committee heard testimony from the leaders of these two \ntransit systems, as I mentioned. Transit is frequently targeted because \nit is tremendously important to any nation's economy. Securing our \ntransit systems and our transportation networks generally is a \ndifficult challenge under any circumstances. Every act to increase \nsecurity generally potentially limits the specific security needs of a \ntransit agency. The bill includes grants for security equipment, \nevacuation drills, and, most importantly--what we heard from the \nwitnesses, particularly from Madrid and London--worker training. \nIndeed, the bill requires worker training for all systems that receive \nsecurity grants. The importance of worker training can be scarcely \noverstated. Transit workers are the first line of defense against an \nattack and the first to respond to an event of an attack.\n  Mr. O'Toole, the director of London's transit system said:\n\n       You have to invest in your staff and rely on them. You have \n     to invest in technology, but don't rely on it.\n\n  Finally, the bill authorizes funds for the research of new and \nexisting security technologies and fully authorizes the funding of the \nInformation Sharing Analysis Center, a valuable tool that provides \ntransit agencies timely information on active threats against their \nsystems.\n  Over the years we have invested heavily in aviation security. In \nfact, we have invested about $7.50 per aviation passenger per trip. \nAbout 1.8 million people travel using the aviation system daily in this \ncountry. 14 million people use mass transit systems every workday. We \nhave invested about $380 million in the security of mass transit \nsystems. That is about one penny per passenger per trip.\n\n  I am not suggesting, nor do we require, that there be an equilibrium \nbetween the security systems of both aviation and mass transit systems. \nBut our bill does provide an authorization of $3.5 billion to increase \nexactly the kind of operations I have described briefly, including the \ntraining issues which are critically important.\n  We believe with this additional authorization, and we hope an \nappropriate appropriation from the responsible committees, that we will \nbe able to provide some additional security for this critically \nimportant system of our economy.\n  Again, I am grateful to the members of the committee, as well as my \ncolleagues here, for their indication of support of this effort. It is \ngoing to be very important to all of us across this country. This is \nnot limited, obviously, to the east coast or west coast. In fact, now \nsome of the most urbanized States in the country are Western States \nwith mass transit systems. It is going to be very important we provide \nthe kind of support that this provision of the bill does.\n  Again, my thanks to Senator Shelby, to all members of the committee \nwho played a very constructive role in crafting this legislation, as \nthey did in the 109th Congress and, again, to my colleague from \nConnecticut and my colleague from Maine for their fine work on this \nissue, making this a part of this bill. I urge the adoption of this \nsection when the full bill is considered.\n  Again, my thanks to my colleague from Oklahoma for providing some \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Kyl amendment is the pending amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 345\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that pending amendment be set \naside in consideration of an amendment that has already been called up, \nmy amendment, No. 345.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. This is a pretty straightforward amendment.\n  I also ask unanimous consent Senator McCain be added as a cosponsor \nof this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. One of the first things we found out after 9/11 was a lot \nof our emergency workers could not talk to each other. That was one of \nthe most glaring, obvious defects in our response to emergencies--that \nemergency personnel had difficulty, from one group to another, talking \nto one another. As a matter of fact, it limited their ability to save \nlives.\n  From the beginning of the 9/11 Commission and from the start, in \n2002, that has been addressed in multiple ways. The purpose of this \namendment is to describe what is obviously something that is not good \nfor us as a nation.\n  We presently have occurring with the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 an \nelectromagnetic spectrum which was sold off and $1 billion reserved \nunder a program called the Public Safety Interoperability Public \nService Grant Program. That $1 billion was carved off and that is where \nwe are going to spend it. I don't disagree with that at all.\n\n[[Page S2688]]\n\n  What this bill has is another $3.4 billion for interoperable grants \naddressing the same problem in a different way than what the other \ngrant program was. One of our problems as a nation is we have too many \nprograms that are doing the same thing. They duplicate one another. One \nis better and the other is not. Yet we continue sending money down both \nholes, not making adjustments as to which gives us the best value for \nour money.\n  What has happened with this money from the Commerce Department, \nthrough a memorandum of understanding, is the administration of this \ngrant program has been transferred to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity with a little fiat that the Department of Commerce kept $12 \nmillion for themselves.\n  This memorandum of understanding was dated just a few weeks ago, \nFebruary 16, and what it did is it gave the administration near \ncomplete administrative control of this grant program, the one from \nCommerce, the one from 2005, to the Department of Homeland Security. \nThis grant program has yet, to date, to receive any applications for \nany grants to be administered under the program. This is 2005; 2006 we \ndid this. Now we are into March of 2007, and we have not received the \nfirst application.\n  S. 4, being considered on the Senate floor now, as I said, creates \nyet another interoperable grant program, the Emergency Communications \nand Interoperability Grant Program. This program is also going to be \nadministered by the Department of Homeland Security. The purpose of \nthis grant program is to make grants to States for \npurchasing interoperable equipment and training personnel, testing on \nhow and when to use it--similar to the PSIC grant which was mainly for \nequipment. This program authorizes $3.3 billion to be authorized in \ngrants over the first 5 years of the program and indefinite amounts, \n``such sums as are necessary,'' after that.\n\n  A question comes to mind: How much money would it take for every \nfirst responder in this country to have interoperable communications? \nWe don't address that in this bill. We just keep sending the money for \nit, after we send the first $3.3 billion and then whatever it takes \nafter that, rather than looking and reassessing what our need is.\n  If S. 4 passes in its current form, Congress will have authorized the \ncreation of two nearly identical interoperability grant programs. \nAgain, interoperability is this concept that first responders can talk \nto one another: if there is a fire going on in Tulsa, and there is a \nneed that Oklahoma City firefighters will be there, that they can talk \nto them; that if there is something going on in Arkansas and Oklahoma \nfirst responders need to be there, there is the ability for them to \ntalk to one another over their communications gear.\n  One of these grant programs is housed at Commerce but run by DHS. The \nother is going to be housed at DHS. The differences between these two \nprograms in their details are minimal. Both provide for funding of \nequipment, both provide for funding for training, and both will exist \nside by side until 2010, when PSIC expires.\n  The purpose of this amendment would be to combine the two duplicative \ngrant programs for interoperability. It does it by repealing the PSIC \nGrant Program at Commerce and it redirects the funding set aside for \nthe PSIC Grant Program at Commerce to funding the Emergency \nCommunications and Interoperability Grant Program at DHS. This will not \ndecrease the amount of money. We are going to still spend $4.3 billion. \nBut we are going to do it through one grant program rather than two.\n  There are not going to be two sets of signals out there for the \nStates that want to go after this money or the communities that need to \ngo after this money. There is going to be one.\n  There are a couple of technical changes with this that are required, \nwhich is repealing the Call Home Act of 2006, which sets a deadline of \nSeptember 30, 2007. We haven't had the first grant application right \nnow, so that gives us less than 6 months to get grants in and advised \nand granted on the PSIC Grant Program.\n  Finally, I think a very important part of this amendment requires \nthat DHS study and report to Congress on the feasibility of engaging \nthe private sector in developing a national interoperable emergency \ncommunications network. Neither of these grant programs address the \nnational focus that would be needed. One of the problems in Katrina was \nall the people who went down there, the 9/11 responders and emergency \nresponders, couldn't communicate with the emergency responders in \nLouisiana.\n  What this says is, aren't there some brains out there in the private \nsector who could tell us what we need to do and then we could have our \ngrant programs actually go to buy the equipment, the training, so the \nprogram is already figured out so we don't have duplication so the \npeople in Oklahoma can talk to the people in Kansas and Nebraska and in \nNew York--all across the country. There is no national security reason \nwhy we need two interoperable communication grant programs for the \nStates.\n  The second point: The administration--this is another area of this \nbill that they strongly oppose, setting up two identical or very \nsimilar grant programs.\n  No. 3, the Department of Commerce has essentially contracted this \ngrant program out to DHS. It rightfully should be.\n  No. 4, the 9/11 economic report explicitly stated that Congress \nshould not use grant programs as porkbarrel. If we have two grant \nprograms running side by side and one isn't talking to another and a \nState has gotten one and they don't know the State is applying for the \nsame thing at the other, how much stewardship have we practiced with \nthe American taxpayers' money? We have not.\n  One of the prime recommendations of the 9/11 Commission was to \nreorganize the grant programs to eliminate confusion. That is exactly \nwhat this amendment does. It reorganizes the grant programs into one \ngrant program, one place where you go to get it, one source of \nplanning, one source of administration for it.\n  I will not go into the reasons why we have two programs, but needless \nto say it is because Members of Congress are not talking to each other. \nWe have two interoperability grant programs that are not interoperable \nbecause we have a Congress that is not interoperable in communications \nwith one another in terms of committee to committee or Member to \nMember.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has been cleared as the lead \nFederal agency for interoperability emergency communications. That is \nwhere these grants ought to be. That is who we are going to hold \naccountable. By not having them both in the same department, then we \nare not going to be able to hold them accountable when we do oversight.\n  The other thing is the average American cannot afford to purchase two \nof anything. Many times with these two programs, we are going to see \nthe same thing paid for twice because the right hand is not going to \nknow what the left hand is doing. There is no good policy reason for \nthe Federal Government to have these two programs.\n  The other thing I think is fairly easy to recognize is if you have \ntwo grant programs, it is hard for the American public to realize how \nmuch money we are spending on the grant programs because you have got \nto find one and then the other. The total, which is going to be $4.3 \nbillion, is not recognized now.\n  The final reason is our first responder organizations write grants. \nThey are already required, in terms of all of the things we have done \nin terms of emergency preparedness, to provide multiple proposals \nannually right now to get Federal funding. Why would we not want them \nto have one application for interoperability? It is a waste of their \ntime and the State's time.\n  The arguments you are going to hear tomorrow--we are going to debate \nthis amendment again tomorrow afternoon with my colleagues from Hawaii \nand Alaska. They are going to say the PSIC Grant Program is only \nauthorized until 2010, so after that there would not be a problem \nanymore for two grant programs. That is not a good reason to have two \ngrant programs.\n  The public safety interoperability program requires the department to \ncoordinate its efforts with the Secretary of Homeland Security. Yes, \nthey did. They signed a memorandum of understanding that says they are \ngoing to run it all.\n\n[[Page S2689]]\n\n  Finally, the Commerce Department has the authority and expertise over \nemergency communication grant programs. Although the PSIC Program was \nplaced in Commerce, all of the operational authority for that grant \nprogram was essentially transferred to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  The Department of Homeland Security essentially treats the PSIC as \npart of its own budget, showing that Commerce has no real role in \nadministering this program.\n  Another argument would be the programs are not identical but focus on \ndifferent aspects of communications interoperability; it would hurt the \nemergency response community to get rid of either one of the programs.\n  Well, the one that is in this bill does it all. The one that is in \nthe Commerce bill that we have already allocated $1 billion for is \nmainly about equipment, it is not as much about training.\n  We ought to know, if we are going to spend $4.3 billion that \nemergency responders anywhere ought to be able to talk to one another. \nWe do not know that with this money. There is no string on this money \nthat says that is the end goal. That is why a study coming out of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security that says go look at the outside and \nask the private sector to tell us how do we take this spectrum that has \nbeen set aside, two different sections of spectrum for this, and how do \nwe create a plan so that throughout the whole country, no matter what \nthe need is, one group of emergency responders can talk to another?\n  That is what we ought to be getting for our $4.3 billion. That is not \nin either one of those programs. So what we are going to do is we are \ngoing to spend $4.3 billion on these grant programs, with no assurances \nthat we are going to accomplish the very thing we seek to accomplish.\n  I believe there could not be a more wasteful attempt at our spending \nwhen we do not know what we are going to do for an endpoint on the \nspending.\n  A few comments about the overall bill. There has to come a point in \ntime in this country where we recognize that we do not have enough \nmoney to do everything we need to do to protect us. That is true today. \nWhere we ought to be putting our money is where we think the highest \nrisks are. I agree with the Presiding Officer. Areas such as New Jersey \nare at much greater risk and ought to get much greater funding. They \nhave a greater risk and a greater need.\n  Does that mean I am pleased if that means soft targets in Oklahoma \nare going to be exposed? No, but there has to be a dispensing of the \nmoney based on what the most likely risks are. So when we finish all of \nthis, we will have gotten what we wanted.\n  Earlier today, I offered an amendment to sunset this bill in 5 years. \nWe will look at it again and see what have we accomplished. What is \nleft to accomplish? Where is the greatest area of risk? What do we \nstill need to do? We have not done that in this bill. That is how we \nare going to make good policy--making sure that the dollars we spend to \nprotect America are spent on the areas that will get us the most in \nthis bill that we are debating today. We refuse to do that. It \nauthorizes this bill to continue forever.\n  There is no sunset to it. There is no stop to say that we need to \nrelook at this. There is nothing for the Congress to come back and look \nat as we did in the PATRIOT Act, where we required that we had to come \nback and look at it. We sunsetted it. And even though we passed the \nPATRIOT Act last year, we took sections of it that we said we know we \nare going to want to look at again, so we sunsetted it.\n  If we are going to be good stewards with the American taxpayer's \nmoney, we ought to sunset this bill. We ought to sunset these two \ninteroperability programs so that we know whether we have accomplished \nwhat we desire and know what the problems are so that we can predict \nthem. By not sunsetting, by not combining the programs, by not \nefficiently spending and wisely planning the spending of the American \ntaxpayer dollars is getting us on down the road where we do not want to \nbe, which is more and more of what we are spending today being paid for \nmore and more by our grandchildren and children of tomorrow.\n  I thank you for the time. I look forward to debating this bill \ntomorrow with Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye. My hope is that \nSenator McCain, who is a member of the Commerce Committee, will be here \nto aid in this. There is no reason for us to have two programs making \nStates apply for two different grant programs that essentially do the \nsame thing.\n  We would not do that ourselves in our homes. We would not set up two \nparallel requirements to accomplish the same goal. We should not be \ndoing it in this bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the grant \nfunding formula in the underlying bill, S .4, as well as Senator Reid's \namendment in the nature of a substitute. I also wish to underscore the \ncomments made previously by the chairman and ranking member of the \nHomeland Security Committee on which I serve. As Senators Lieberman and \nCollins have articulated so well, I do not question the need for \nheavily populated States such as New Jersey and Texas to receive \nappropriate sums of homeland security grant funding to address their \nhomeland security needs, nor do I question the need to protect chemical \nplants or to protect nuclear power plants. All of this is beyond \nquestion.\n  The point of this debate is protecting America against many risks, \nboth natural and manmade. The State of Hawaii is subject to many \nnatural disasters including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, volcanoes, \ntsunamis, wildfires, droughts, and tropical storms. In addition, Hawaii \nis unique in that it is 2500 miles from the U.S. mainland. If disaster \nstrikes Hawaii, natural or otherwise, it does not have neighboring \nStates to rely on for assistance. It therefore must have numerous \nsafety and security systems in place and be relatively self-reliant. \nHawaii is also the gateway to the Pacific and, as such, provides \nsupport to American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands \nthrough the U.S. Pacific Command, PACOM, in the event of a disaster. \nHawaii also provided assistance and support to Thailand in the \naftermath of the December 26, 2004, tsunami.\n  It is critical to remember that, although the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, FEMA, was folded into the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, DHS, its mandate as the principal Federal agency charged with \naddressing preparation, mitigation, and response to all disasters, both \nnatural and manmade, remains.\n  On January 18, 2007, DHS Secretary Chertoff announced his plan to \nreorganize DHS. That plan calls for FEMA to assume control of the \nGrants and Training program, including the State Homeland Security \nGrant Program, SHSGP, and other grant programs--grant programs that \nfund not only activities to prepare for, mitigate, and respond to \nterrorist attacks but also activities to prepare for, mitigate, and \nrespond to natural disasters. Securing our homeland does not only mean \nprotecting it from terrorists but also from the effects of mother \nnature, a force capable of directing a Katrina-sized hurricane to our \nsoil.\n  In his recently released book, ``The Edge of Disaster,'' Dr. Stephen \nFlynn, a senior fellow with the National Security Studies Program at \nthe Council on Foreign Relations, argues that 90 percent of Americans \nreside in an area that will experience a moderate to major natural \ndisaster at any given time. This is not just about urban areas; this is \nabout nearly every American being faced with a significant natural \ndisaster with a far higher likelihood than any terrorist attack. As Dr. \nFlynn observes, we need ``an all-hazards approach'' in ``constructing \nsafer communities and reducing the overall fragility of the nation.''\n  Hurricane Katrina illustrated that the United States has limited \nsurge capacity at the State and local levels to respond to a large-\nscale natural or manmade event. Aging infrastructure, including faulty \npower grids, shortages in medical personnel and supplies make the \nUnited States vulnerable and exacerbate the impact of any attack or \nnatural disaster. If we have a weak infrastructure, faulty and eroding \nlevees, hopelessly outdated communications systems, then we are \nvulnerable and no amount of radiation portal monitors, RPMs, will \nprotect us from the catastrophic impact of a terrorist attack or \nnatural disaster.\n  I strongly support the homeland security grant formula contained in S \n.4\n\n[[Page S2690]]\n\nand Senator Reid's amendment in the nature of a substitute. I oppose \nany efforts to lower guaranteed funding levels for all States.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge that today, \nMarch 6th, 2007, we celebrate the 17th annual National Sportsmanship \nDay. Created by the Institute for International Sport at the University \nof Rhode Island in 1991, this initiative seeks to promote and develop \nthe highest ideals of sportsmanship and fair play among not only \nAmerica's youth but also the international community. Over its 17 \nyears, more than 13,500 schools and 80 million individuals across all \n50 States and many countries around the world have participated in \nNational Sportsmanship Day activities. On this day, in elementary \nschools, middle schools, high schools, and colleges, students, \nteachers, coaches, and parents will discuss issues regarding \nsportsmanship and fair play.\n  This year, National Sportsmanship Day will focus on the themes \n``Don't Punch Back, Play Harder'' and ``Defeat Gamesmanship.'' These \nthemes will prompt participants to explore the practical values of \n``competitive self-restraint'' and playing within the intended spirit \nof the rules. It is important for both our society and our culture that \nwe instill these values in our youth. Additionally, the celebration \nwill include the 14th annual USA Today National Sportsmanship Day Essay \nContest.\n  I am pleased to say that Rhode Island is home to the Institute for \nInternational Sport and National Sportsmanship Day. For 17 years, the \ninstitute and this initiative have enhanced the nature and health of \ncompetition among our Nation's youth. The efforts of Senator Claiborne \nPell and his able staff member Barry Sklar, Senator John Chafee, \nfounder Dan Doyle, and many others have contributed to the success of \nthis endeavor. I know that this year's National Sportsmanship Day \ncelebration will continue to promote fair play and in so doing ensure a \nsound foundation of sportsmanship for today and for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/06/senate-section/article/S2690-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  VANDALISM OF AHAVAS TORAH SYNAGOGUE\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, it is with great sorrow that I bring to the \nattention of the Senate the recent vandalism and desecration of Eugene, \nOR's only conservative synagogue, Ahavas Torah Synagogue, on February \n22, 2007. The targets of this vile act were two sacred Torah scrolls \nand accompanying prayer books. Police officers responding to neighbors' \ncalls found the building ransacked and a locked wooden chest containing \nthe Torah scrolls pried open; the scrolls themselves were torn and \ndamaged.\n  This event comes as a shock to the dozen families who make up \nEugene's small Orthodox community, but unfortunately is not an isolated \nevent. In 2002, Temple Beth Israel Synagogue was vandalized during a \nShabbat service; in 2001 the congregation received hundreds of hate-\nfilled letters; and in 1994 the synagogue was fired upon with armor-\npiercing rifle rounds.\n  I am compelled to speak out against this deplorable act of vandalism \nat the Ahavas Torah Synagogue, which proves that hate crimes still pose \na serious threat to our Nation's security and values. All forms of \nhatred and intolerance should be combated with every available tool and \nAmerica's leaders need to send a clear message that acts of violence \ntargeted at individuals of any group will not be tolerated. For this \nreason, I have been a cosponsor and strong supporter of hate crimes \nprevention legislation.\n  The Talmud teaches us that he ``who can protest an injustice, but \ndoes not, is an accomplice to the act.'' Even though the existence of \nhatred is foretold in the Torah, acts of anti-Semitism and hate must be \nstopped before anyone can truly worship safely and freely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/06/senate-section/article/S2690-4", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HONORING RITA A.

She will retire after this year's 45th anniversary \nprogram, which is currently being held March 3 to 10, 2007, in \nWashington, DC.\n  During her tenure Ms. Almon has overseen the education and safety of \nthousands of high school student delegates who come annually to the \nNation's Capital for this unique educational program about government, \nleadership and public service. She has worked closely with Senators and \ntheir staffs as well as with senior officials from each branch of \nGovernment to secure an opportunity for these young men and women to \nsee their Government up close and to meet the individuals who make it \nwork.\n  The mission of the U.S. Senate Youth Program, as set out in S. Res. \n324 in 1962, states that ``the continued vitality of our Republic \ndepends, in part, on the intelligent understanding of our political \nprocesses and the functions of our National Government by the citizens \nof the United States; and the durability of a constitutional democracy \nis dependent upon alert, talented, vigorous competition for political \nleadership.''\n  Rita A. Almon has achieved the mission of the U.S. Senate Youth \nProgram by adhering to the highest standards of ethics and integrity, \nsetting a shining example for the young men and women who participate. \nI join my colleagues in commending her and wish her well in her future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/06/senate-section/article/S2690-5", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2690-S2691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MARVIN VAN HAAFTEN\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one of the joys of my job as a \nSenator is working closely with talented, dedicated Iowans from all \nwalks of life. One of the exceptional people is Marvin Van Haaften, \ndirector of the Iowa Governor's Office of Drug Control Policy. With his \nretirement in January, he will conclude an extraordinary career in \npublic service spanning over three decades.\n  Marvin Van Haaften has lived in Marion County most of his life, but \nhis law enforcement experience and expertise has been felt throughout \nthe State of Iowa. Before being named by Governor Tom Vilsack to be \nIowa's drug policy coordinator in December 2002, he served as Marion \nCounty sheriff for 18 years. He is a graduate of the FBI National \nAcademy, certified as a peace officer by the Iowa Law Enforcement \nAcademy, served in the National Guard, and was a licensed medical \nexaminer investigator.\n  One key to his success is that he speaks with the authority of a \nseasoned veteran of decades on the front line fighting crime and \nimproving public safety. Marvin was named Sheriff of the Year in 1991 \nby the Iowa State Sheriffs' and Deputies' Association and served as its \npresident in 1996. With more than 32 years of law enforcement \nexperience, he has taught extensively in the field of rural law \nenforcement, particularly death investigation and domestic violence \ncrimes. He has provided local and national leadership on the role of \nlaw enforcement in strategic victim safety and offender apprehension, \nand served on the board of directors of the National Center for Rural \nLaw Enforcement. Marvin also served on many local and State committees \nsuch as the Iowa Criminal and Juvenile Justice Planning Advisory \nCouncil, the board of the Mid-Iowa Narcotics Enforcement Task Force, \nthe board of the 18-county South Central Iowa Clandestine Laboratory \nTask Force, and was third vice president on\n\n[[Page S2691]]\n\nthe board of directors of the Iowa Association of Counties.\n  As a law enforcement officer, Marvin has seen firsthand the ravages \nthat domestic violence inflicts on innocent women and children. For \nthat reason, he has been a committed advocate for combating domestic \nabuse. During the nineties he served on the President's National \nAdvisory Council on Domestic Violence, chaired by the Attorney General \nand Secretary of Health and Human Services, setting policy and \ndeveloping domestic abuse and sexual assault training for the Nation. \nHe was also a member of Iowa's Domestic Violence Death Review Team, the \nLieutenant Governor's STOP Violence Against Women Coordinating Council, \nand the National Sheriffs Association's Domestic Violence Committee.\n  The commitment that Marvin brought to domestic violence, he also \nbrought to his role as Iowa's drug policy coordinator and director of \nthe Office of Drug Control Policy. As a law enforcement officer, he saw \nthe destruction that drug abuse wreaks on families--the broken homes \nand ruined lives. He worked very hard at both the State and national \nlevel to ensure that the voices and needs of local law enforcement were \nheard. He will leave very big shoes to fill. I personally am very \ngrateful for the excellence, professionalism, and long hours that he \nbrought to this job.\n  Marvin also realizes the importance of a healthy, supportive family \nin a person's life: Marvin has been married to his wife Joyce for 42 \nyears and has 5 grown children and 11 grandchildren. I am sure they \nwill enjoy his retirement, but my staff and I will miss his counsel and \nhis can-do attitude. I have turned to him again and again over the \nyears, and he has never let me down. It has meant so much to be able to \nrely on someone of his caliber for authoritative answers and prompt \nanswers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/06/senate-section/article/S2691-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF JOHN F. BASS\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, today, I honor John Bass, a \nmuch loved member of the St. Louis community, who died last month at \nthe age of 80. John Bass was soft-spoken and low-key but he was also a \nfighter. As a young man, he served his country in the U.S. Navy. When \nhe returned from service, he found himself living in a racially \ndivided, socially and economically troubled city. Determined to bring \nchange to his community, John literally fought his way through a \ncollege education. As a champion boxer, he won a boxing scholarship to \nLincoln University. But John's true fight for St. Louis came long after \nhe hung up his gloves.\n  As an educator in Beaumont High School, John was a calming presence \nin a school bitterly divided by racial tension. There, at Beaumont, and \nprobably for the first time in his life, John was sent to the \nprincipal's office the hard way. After he began his new job as \nprincipal of Beaumont High, he provided the calm, wise leadership that \nwas necessary to soothe wounds that years of inequality inflicted on \nour Nation's educational system.\n  John was already a distinguished member of the St. Louis community \nwhen he rolled up his sleeves and delved into politics to bring \npositive change to the city of St. Louis by shaping its policies. He \ndid not come from a family of politicians, and he did not inherit a \npolitical power base. He came to politics as a thoughtful, practical, \nand hard-working man who wanted to make his community a better place to \nlive. With these attributes, John Bass won the trust and respect of St. \nLouis.\n  John served as an alderman, State senator, and cabinet official, but \nis best known for becoming the first African American to win the office \nof comptroller in St. Louis history. When he ran for that office in \n1973, the mayor told him that the prevailing racial tensions in St. \nLouis would prevent his election. Undeterred, John ignored that \nprediction, won his seat, crashed his way into the city's most \nimportant financial post, and left his mark on the city of St. Louis. \nRegarded highly by his contemporaries as well as older and younger \npoliticians, John helped pilot the city of St. Louis through some of \nits most turbulent years.\n  With John's passing, we have lost a prolific public servant, a \ntrusted friend, and a quiet but powerful leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/06/senate-section/article/S2691-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO AHMET ERTEGUN\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I wish to honor a celebrated \nAmerican pioneer, a legendary entrepreneur, a devotee, an integral \ncultivator of uniquely American music, and a great benefactor both to \nmy home State of Ohio and my hometown of Cleveland, the late music \nexecutive Ahmet Ertegun.\n  The son of a Turkish Ambassador to the United States, Ertegun arrived \nin this county in 1935 as a young boy destined for diplomatic service. \nYet at an early age he developed a profound love for music, especially \njazz and blues, that blossomed into a lifelong, remarkable career.\n  At the age of 24, he cofounded the independent Atlantic Records \nlabel, mounting a historic and formidable challenge to contemporary \nindustry giants by his keen ability to scout and develop talent. In \nother words, he knew a winner when he met one. John Coltrane, Ray \nCharles, and the Rolling Stones are among those in his repertoire.\n  An exemplary immigrant, Ahmet was well known for his ``culturally \ntriangular'' relationships: He was a Turkish Muslim; many of his fellow \nexecutives were Jewish, and many of the artists they produced were \nAfrican-American Christians.\n  David Geffen, the acclaimed entertainment mogul whom Ertegun \nintroduced to the record business, noted that fewer people have had a \ngreater impact on the music industry and that no one loved music more \nthan he did.\n  Ahmet's deep appreciation and respect for musical roots and history \nprompted him to establish a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n  The Hall of Fame Foundation was created in 1983, and soon after, its \nboard of trustees began searching for a suitable home for the museum. \nAt that time, about the midpoint of my decade as mayor of Cleveland, a \nregional renaissance was in full bloom, and Cleveland was making a \ncomeback. The city had a clear vision of our new destiny and knew where \nwe were headed.\n  The great people of my city had a dream: to land that Hall of Fame at \nhome, in the heart of rock 'n' roll, right where it belonged.\n  Moved by the undaunted initiative of Greater Cleveland civic and \nbusiness leaders, I joined their determined effort, boarded on a plane \nto New York, and pitched the idea to Ahmet and his board of trustees.\n  Our team's stunning case suddenly made Cleveland a top contender. The \nnews of our heavy impression galvanized the city and evoked a flood of \npublic spirit and support that greeted Ahmet and his board upon their \nsubsequent visit to scout the town.\n  Well, Ahmet never lost his ability to recognize a winner, and when he \nstepped off the plane in Cleveland, he met one. I had the honor of \npresenting him with a key to our city and leading him on a local tour, \nshowcasing what we had to offer.\n  A few months later, Ahmet and his board reached a decision, and in \ntheir good judgment, they selected Cleveland, where the term ``rock 'n' \nroll'' had been coined. We in Cleveland were both proud and humbled.\n  I am pleased to report, for more than a decade, the Rock and Roll \nHall of Fame in Cleveland has been a popular global destination and a \nsuccess for my hometown, for the State of Ohio, and for America.\n  I am fortunate that for a time, my duties in public services \ndovetailed with Ahmet's vision for the future of the Rock and Roll Hall \nof Fame.\n  He has been recognized many times throughout his life. In 1987, he \nwas inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2000, our own U.S. \nLibrary of Congress honored him as a living legend. And today, just a \nfew weeks after his death, I recognize him for his indelible \ncontribution to the fabric of our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/06/senate-section/article/S2691-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2691-S2692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:40 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 122.

S2696-S2722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. BURR (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 765. A bill to establish a grant program to improve high school \ngraduation rates and prepare students for college and work; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to talk about education, something \nmany in this body take very seriously. I rise today to address the \nNation's dropout crisis. Each day that our schools are open, \napproximately 7,000 students drop out of high school. That is 1.2 \nmillion students annually who do not complete their high school \neducation. Almost a third of American students who enter high school in \nthe ninth grade drop out of school and never receive their high school \ndiploma.\n  I know our students, our schools, our communities can do better. To \nensure that these young people have a better future and that America \nmaintains its competitiveness in a global economy, I suggest to all my \ncolleagues that we must do better.\n  According to a Manhattan Institute study, the high school graduation \nrate for the class of 2003 nationwide was only 70 percent. Thirty \npercent of our students in this country do not cross the goal line of \ngraduation. Even more alarming, however, is that high school graduation \nrates for subgroups of students in 2003 were for White students, 78 \npercent; African Americans, 55 percent; Hispanics, 53 percent.\n  Graduating from high school is a 50-50 proposition in 930 of our high \nschools in our country. Fifty percent of the students in 930 schools do \nnot get their high school diplomas. In 2,000 high schools, it is a 60-\n40 proposition. Sixty percent are going to get their diploma, 40 \npercent will not get their diploma.\n  Just last week, my home State of North Carolina released its most \ncurrent data on our State's dropout crisis. Our statistics, likewise, \npoint to an urgent need to pay attention to our public high schools and \nthese students.\n  North Carolina's statewide graduation rate was 68 percent. Yet for \nBlack students, that rate falls to 60 percent; for low-income students, \n55 percent; and for Hispanic students, 52 percent. Nearly 80 percent of \nthe Nation's high schools that produce the highest number of dropouts \nare in 15 States, and I am embarrassed at the fact that North Carolina \nis one of them.\n  To retain our competitive edge in the world economy, America's youths \nmust be prepared for the jobs of today and the jobs of the future, jobs \nwhich increasingly require a postsecondary education. Unfortunately, in \n2003, 3.5 million Americans ages 16 to 25 did not have a high school \ndiploma and were not enrolled in school.\n  Individuals without a high school diploma experience higher rates of \nunemployment, incarceration, and are more likely to live in poverty and \nreceive public assistance than individuals with at least a high school \ndiploma.\n  We know the statistics, but they are worth repeating. Mr. President, \n4 out of every 10 people ages 16 to 24 without a high school diploma \nreceive some type of government assistance. A high school dropout is \neight times more likely to be incarcerated than a person with a high \nschool diploma.\n  I am fortunate to represent a State with a rich history in its \ncommitment to higher education. The State of North Carolina is the home \nof the Nation's first State university, the University of North \nCarolina at Chapel Hill, which welcomed students for the first time to \nits campus on January 15, 1795. All total, North Carolina has 127 \ndegree-granting institutions of higher education--75 public and 52 \nprivate. However, North Carolina and the rest of the country cannot \nrest on their laurels with their higher education systems. We should be \nand are proud of our high college-going rate in North Carolina. Yet \nwhile 64 percent of recent North Carolina high school graduates go on \nto college, that number is far too low.\n  There is no silver bullet that will fix our educational system, \nincluding high school reform which many have talked about. I hope more \nand better research will give us a better direction and maybe better \nanswers, but until then, there are a number of things that we can and \nwe should be doing to improve what is a problem that must be addressed.\n  In particular, we know the three Rs to making our public high schools \nwork better for today's students are rigor, relevance, and \nrelationships. Today, Senator Jeff Bingaman from New Mexico and I are \nintroducing bipartisan legislation, the Graduate for a Better Future \nAct. This is to help turn the tide of our Nation's dropout crisis.\n  Senator Bingaman has been a stalwart leader in the Senate on issues \nrelating to dropout prevention. I am proud to join him in an effort to \nlower high school dropout rates and to raise high school graduation and \ncollege-going rates.\n  This legislation will create a competitive grant program targeted at \nschool districts and high schools with the lowest graduation rates, \nfocused on those three Rs of high school reform: rigor, relevance, and \nrelationships.\n  Funds under this act would be used for models of excellence for \nacademically challenging high schools to prepare all students for \ncollege and for work; to offer academic catchup programs for those \nstudents who enter high school and do not meet proficient levels in \nmathematics, reading, language arts, or science that enable such \nstudents to meet proficient levels and remain on track to graduate from \nhigh school with a regular high school degree; to implement early \nwarning systems to quickly identify students at risk of dropping out, \nespecially systems that track student absenteeism, one of the greatest \npredictors that a student may drop out of high school; to implement \ncomprehensive college guidance programs that ensure all students and \ntheir parents are regularly notified of high school graduation \nrequirements, college requirements for entry, and provide guidance and \nassistance to students in applying for postsecondary education and in \napplying for Federal financial assistance and other State, local, and \nprivate financial aid and scholarships; to implement a program that \noffers all students opportunities for work-based and experiential \nlearning experiences, such as job shadowing, internships, and community \nservice so that students make the connection between what they are \nlearning in school and how that applies to the workplace that we want \nthem to be in; and to implement a student advisement program\n\n[[Page S2697]]\n\nin which all students are assigned to and have regular meetings with an \nacademic teacher adviser.\n  A recent survey of high school dropouts by Civic Enterprises presents \na picture of the American high school dropout that is surprising to \nmany. I know it surprised me. Eighty-eight percent of those students \nwho dropped out of high school had passing grades when they dropped \nout. Let me say that again. Eighty-eight percent of the students who \ndropped out of high school had passing grades which would have enabled \nthem to complete their high school diploma. But they dropped out. \nFifty-eight percent dropped out with 2 or fewer years to complete high \nschool; 66 percent said they would have worked harder if expectations \nhad been higher; 81 percent recognized that a high school diploma was \nabsolutely vital to their success in life; and 74 percent said they \nwould have stayed in school if they had it to do all over again.\n\n  Mr. President, this is the point where we get a redo. We get an \nopportunity to make sure students get an opportunity in the next \ngeneration so they don't make the same mistakes the last ones did.\n  Over the past 25 years, the difference in earnings between workers \nwith lower and higher levels of education has grown. As my home State \nof North Carolina has experienced, gone are the days when an individual \nwith only a high school diploma or GED can find a high-paying job in \nindustries such as manufacturing, textiles, or furniture.\n  The global economy has changed the marketplace, and the competition \nis no longer the person who sits next to us. It is the person who \ngraduates from the school we will never hear about or have an \nopportunity to visit.\n  We know more education pays off. Over his or her lifetime, an \nindividual without a high school diploma will earn approximately $1.1 \nmillion less than an individual with a bachelor's degree, $1.5 million \nless than an individual with a master's degree, and $2.4 million less \nthan an individual with a doctoral degree.\n  What is the message to our children and our grandchildren? Is it that \nthe future is more competitive than the past, that to be competitive in \nthe job market means we have to raise our educational skills, and as \nparents and grandparents, we have to make it happen? The answer is yes.\n  The Senate can no longer sit by and accept rates of 30 percent of our \nstudents who don't cross the goal line of high school and accept that \nwithout a fight. We can do better, and we should do better.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and with my cosponsor, \nSenator Bingaman, to face our Nation's dropout crisis head on. This is \na first start. This is the ability to educate parents and students \nabout not only how we engage them in the proficiencies they need to be \ncompetitive but, more importantly, how we teach them that our \nexpectations are greater than what they felt in the past.\n  It is time that the Senate lead by example to begin to pass \nlegislation that has a real impact on the high school graduation rates \nin this country; that we can look back and say it was this legislation \nthat started the process, and it was quickly followed up with \nadditional legislation that helps our youth compete, regardless of \nwhere that job is and regardless of who their competition is.\n  As this legislation comes before the committee and comes to this \nfloor, I urge my colleagues to pay particular attention to the impact \nit has on our children and our grandchildren but, more importantly, on \nour competitiveness in the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 765\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Graduate \n     for a Better Future Act''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents to this Act \n     is as follows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Findings.\nSec. 3. Purposes.\nSec. 4. Definitions.\nSec. 5. Program authorized.\nSec. 6. Reporting and accountability.\nSec. 7. Evaluation and report.\nSec. 8. Authorization of appropriations.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The high school graduation rate for the class of 2003 \n     was only 70 percent nationwide. Thus, almost \\1/3\\ of \n     American students who enter high school in 9th grade drop out \n     of school and never receive a high school diploma.\n       (2) Large disparities exist in the high school graduation \n     rates among various subgroups of students. Although the high \n     school graduation rate for white students was 78 percent in \n     2003, the rate for African American students was only 55 \n     percent, and the rate for Hispanic students was only 53 \n     percent.\n       (3) For students in approximately 2,000 high schools across \n     the United States, the chance of graduating from high school \n     is less than 60 percent.\n       (4) In 2003, 3,500,000 Americans ages 16 to 25 did not have \n     a high school diploma and were not enrolled in school.\n       (5) To retain its competitive edge in the world economy, it \n     is essential that America's youth be prepared for the jobs of \n     today and for the jobs of the future. Such jobs increasingly \n     require a post-secondary education.\n       (6) Individuals without a high school diploma experience \n     higher rates of unemployment, incarceration, living in \n     poverty, and receiving public assistance than individuals \n     with at least a high school diploma.\n       (7) Over his or her lifetime, an individual without a high \n     school diploma will earn approximately $1,100,000 less than \n     an individual with a bachelor's degree, $1,500,000 less than \n     an individual with a master's degree, and $2,400,000 less \n     than an individual with a doctoral degree.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to create models of excellence for academically \n     rigorous high schools, including early college high schools, \n     in order to prepare all students for college and work;\n       (2) to raise high school graduation rates and college-going \n     rates;\n       (3) to reduce college remediation rates;\n       (4) to create a seamless curriculum between high school and \n     college;\n       (5) to improve teaching and curricula to make high school \n     more rigorous and relevant;\n       (6) to improve instruction and access to supports for \n     struggling high school students;\n       (7) to improve communication between parents, students, and \n     schools; and\n       (8) to create, implement, and utilize early warning systems \n     to help identify students at risk of dropping out of high \n     school, especially systems that monitor student absenteeism.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprovide more effective remedies of victims of discrimination in the \npayment of wages on the basis of sex, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Paycheck \nFairness Act in recognition of Women's History Month. I'd like to thank \nmy colleagues Senators Kennedy, Harkin, Boxer, Cantwell, Dodd, \nFeingold, Klobuchar, Leahy, Menendez, Mikulski, Murray, Reed, Reid and \nSchumer for joining me in reintroducing this legislation to prevent, \nregulate and reduce pay discrimination for women across the country. I \nalso want to acknowledge Congresswoman DeLauro for being the champion \nof this legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  As America celebrates Women's History Month, it's important that we \nnot only take pride in how far women have come in our lifetime, but \nalso recognize the work we must continue to achieve true pay equity in \nthis country. Over the past four decades, we have made tremendous \nstrides in closing the wage gap between women and men. But research \nstill shows us that pay discrimination continues to result in women \nearning less than men for performing the same job.\n  Today, women working full time, year-round, still make only 77 cents \nfor every dollar that a man makes--meaning that for every $100 she \nearns, a typical woman has $23 less to spend on groceries, housing, \nchild care, or other expenses. Women of color fare even worse: African-\nAmerican women earn only 67 cents, and Latinas only 56 cents, for every \n$1.00 earned by white men.\n  Just two weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal published an article \nentitled ``Women Post Job Gains, Data Show.'' The article showcased \nproof of progress over the past decade. From the year 2000 through \n2005, women posted a net increase of 1.7 million jobs paying above the \nmedian salary, while men gained a net increase of just over 220,000 of \nsuch positions, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The issue \nof the wage gap, however, continues to affect women workers. In 2005, \nthe median weekly pay for women\n\n[[Page S2700]]\n\nwas $486, or 73 percent of that for men--$663.\n  While we often associate the pay wage with low-paying jobs, this \ninequity is not exclusive to the lower class. The New York Times \nrecently reported that Wimbledon has finally agreed to pay its women \ntennis champions the same amount of prize money as their male \ncounterparts. Last year's men's champion received $1.170 million, while \nthe tournament's women's winner got $1.117 million.\n  That is why I am pleased to be introducing the Paycheck Fairness \nAct--a bill that will build on the promise of the Equal Pay Act and \nhelp close the pay gap.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act has three main components.\n  First, it prevents pay discrimination before it starts. By helping \nwomen strengthen their negotiation skills and providing outreach and \ntechnical assistance to employers to ensure they fairly evaluate and \npay their employees, the Paycheck Fairness Act gives employers the \ntools they need to level the playing field between men and women.\n  Second, the Paycheck Fairness Act creates strong penalties to punish \nthose who do violate the act. By strengthening the penalties for \nemployers who violate the Equal Pay Act, this bill sends a strong \nmessage--Equal Pay is a matter to be taken seriously.\n  And finally, the Paycheck Fairness Act ensures that the Federal \nGovernment, which should be a model employer when it comes to enforcing \nFederal employment laws, uses every tool in its toolbox to ensure that \nwomen are paid the same amount as men for doing the same jobs.\n  There is no question that we have come a long way since the Equal Pay \nAct became law 44 years ago. But we still have a lot of work to do.\n  According to the National Committee on Pay Equity, working women \nstand to lose $250,000 over the course of their career because of \nunequal pay practices--a difference in pay that cannot be fully \nexplained by experience, education, or other qualifications. And the \npay gap follows women into retirement: unmarried women in the workforce \ntoday will receive, on average, about $8,000 per year less in \nretirement income than their male counterparts. As a result, millions \nof American families lose out because equal pay is still not a reality.\n  It is my hope that many more of my colleagues will join me in \nrecognizing this is more than a women's issue--it is a family issue. It \nis in all of our interests to allow women to support their families and \nto live with the dignity and respect accorded to fully engaged members \nof the workforce.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the most profound economic shifts \nof the past century has been the entry of women into the workforce in \ntremendous numbers. In 1900, women made up only 18.4 percent of the \nworking population. Today, more than 46 percent of the workers who \nclaim a paycheck each week are women.\n  Unfortunately, while America's women are working harder than ever, \nthey are not being fairly compensated for their contributions to our \neconomy.\n  Discrimination against women continues to be prevalent in the \nworkplace. Women earn about 77 cents for each dollar earned by men, and \nthe gap is even greater for women of color. In 2004, African-American \nwomen earned only 67 percent of the earnings of White men, and Hispanic \nwomen earned only 56 percent.\n  Unfortunately, the problem is not getting better. The current wage \ngap of 23 cents is the same gap that existed in 2002. Since 1963, when \nthe Equal Pay Act was passed, the wage gap has narrowed by less than \nhalf of a penny a year.\n  While many argue that this persistent pay gap is a consequence of \nwomen's choosing to take time out of the workforce, the evidence shows \nthat other factors, including discrimination, are a significant cause. \nIn 2004, the Census Bureau concluded that the substantial gap in \nearnings between men and women could not completely be explained by \ndifferences in education, tenure in the workforce, or occupation. \nSimilarly, a recent General Accounting Office report concluded that the \ndifference in men and women's working patterns does not explain the \nentire disparity in their wages. Discrimination plays a significant \nrole as well.\n  It is appalling and unacceptable that such discrimination still \nexists in America, and we need to combat it with Federal legislation. \nThe issue is simple fairness, and Congress needs to act.\n  I am proud to join with Senator Clinton and Senator Harkin in \nintroducing the Paycheck Fairness Act today. This important legislation \nwill give America's working women the tools they need to fight for fair \npay. It will make sure our fair pay laws apply to everyone, and it will \nstrengthen the penalties for employers that are not playing by the \nrules.\n  These important reforms are long overdue. I urge my colleagues to \nstand up for working women and end wage discrimination by passing the \nPaycheck Fairness Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Biden, Mr. Smith, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 767.

A bill to increase fuel economy standards for automobiles and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, 33 years ago, this Nation faced a crisis \nthat touched every American. In 1973, in the shadow of a war against \nIsrael, the Arab nations of OPEC decided to embargo shipments of crude \noil to the West.\n  The economic effects were devastating. For American drivers, the \nprice at the gas pump rose from a national average of 38.5 cents per \ngallon in May 1973 to 55.1 cents per gallon in June 1974. The stock \nmarket fell, and countries across the world faced terrible cycles of \ninflation and recession that lasted well into the 1980s.\n  Lawmakers in Washington reacted by calling for a nationwide daylight \nsavings time and a national speed limit. They established a new \nDepartment of Energy that eventually created a strategic petroleum \nreserve. Perhaps most important, Congress enacted the Corporate Average \nFuel Economy standards, or CAFE, the first-ever requirements for \nautomakers to improve gas mileage on the vehicles we drive.\n  At the time, auto executives protested, saying there was no way to \nincrease fuel economy without making cars smaller. One company \npredicted that Americans would all be driving sub-compacts as a result \nof CAFE. But CAFE did work, and under the direction of Congress, the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHSTA, nearly doubled \nthe average gas mileage of cars from 14 miles per gallon in 1976 to \n27.5 mpg for cars in 1985. Today, CAFE standards save us about 3 \nmillion barrels of oil per day, making it the most successful energy-\nsaving measure ever adopted.\n  Now 30 years later, Americans again are feeling the pain at the pump. \nThe price of oil has reached up to $78 a barrel, and Americans have \npaid more than $3.00 a gallon for gas. America's 20-million-barrel-a-\nday habit costs our economy $800 million a day, or $300 billion \nannually. Because we import 60 percent of our oil, much of it from the \nMiddle East, our dependence on oil is also a national security issue as \nwell. Al-Qaida knows that oil is America's Achilles heel. Osama bin \nLaden has urged his supporters to ``Focus your operations on oil, \nespecially in Iraq and the gulf area, since this will cause them to die \noff.''\n  At a time when the energy and security stakes couldn't be higher, \nCAFE standards have been stagnant. In fact, because of a long-standing \ndeadlock in Washington, CAFE standards that initially increased so \nquickly have remained stagnant for the last 20 years.\n  Since 1985, efforts to raise the CAFE standard have been stymied by \nopponents who have argued that Congress does not possess the expertise \nto set specific benchmarks and that an inflexible congressional mandate \nwould result in the production of less safe cars and a loss of American \njobs. This has been a bureaucratic logjam that\n\n[[Page S2701]]\n\nhas ignored technological innovations in the auto industry and crippled \nour ability to increase fuel efficiency.\n\n  To attempt to break this two-decade-Iong deadlock and start the U.S. \non the path towards energy independence, I have joined with Senators \nLugar, Biden, Smith, Bingaman, Coleman, and Specter to introduce the \nFuel Economy Reform Act of 2007. This bill would set a new course by \nestablishing regular, continual, and incremental progress in miles per \ngallon, targeting 4 percent annually, but preserving NHTSA expertise \nand flexibility on how to meet those targets.\n  Over the past 20 years, NHTSA's efforts to improve fuel economy have \nbeen encumbered with loopholes and resistance. With this bill, CAFE \nstandards would increase by 4 percent every year unless NHTSA can \njustify a deviation in that rate by proving that the increase is \ntechnologically unachievable, does not materially reduce the safety of \nautomobiles manufactured or sold in the U.S., or can prove it is not \ncost-effective when comparing with the economic and geopolitical value \nof a gallon of gasoline saved. We specifically define the grounds upon \nwhich NHTSA can determine cost-effectiveness. By flipping the \npresumption that has served as a barrier to action, we replace the \nstatus quo of continued stagnation with steady, measured progress.\n  Under this system, if the 4 percent annualized improvement occurs \nover ten years, this bill would save 1.3 million barrels of oil per \nday--or 20 billion gallons of gasoline per year. If gasoline is just \n$2.50 per gallon, consumers will save $50 billion at the pump in 2018. \nBy 2018, we would be cutting global warming pollution by 220 million \nmetric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent gases.\n  The Fuel Economy Reform Act also would provide fairness and \nflexibility to domestic automakers by establishing different standards \nfor different types of cars. Currently, manufacturers have to meet \nbroad standards over their whole fleet of cars. This disadvantages \ncompanies like Ford and General Motors that produce full lines of small \nand large cars and trucks rather than manufacturers that only sell \nsmall cars.\n  In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop advanced-\ntechnology vehicles, this legislation provides tax incentives to retool \nparts and assembly plants. This will strengthen the U.S. auto industry \nby allowing it to compete with foreign hybrid and other fuel efficient \nvehicles. It is our expectation that NHTSA will use its enhanced \nauthority to bring greater market-based flexibility into CAFE \ncompliance by allowing the banking and trading of credits among certain \nvehicle types and between manufacturers.\n  Finally, the bill also would expand the tax incentives that encourage \nconsumers to buy advanced technology vehicles. The bill would lift the \ncurrent 60,000-per-manufacturer cap on buyer tax credits to allow more \nAmericans to buy ultra-efficient vehicles like hybrids.\n  By ending a 20-year stalemate on CAFE, the Fuel Economy Reform Act \nwill recapture the innovation that Congress and the auto industry \nlaunched in response to the OPEC crisis. In the process, we will \nsafeguard our national security, protect our economy, reduce consumer \npain at the pump, and protect our climate, environment, and public \nhealth. I urge my colleagues to join our bipartisan coalition and \nsupport the Fuel Economy Reform Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of these two bills be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bills were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 767\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fuel Economy Reform Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) United States dependence on oil imports imposes \n     tremendous burdens on the economy, foreign policy, and \n     military of the United States.\n       (2) According to the Energy Information Administration, 60 \n     percent of the crude oil and petroleum products consumed in \n     the United States between April 2005 and March 2006 \n     (12,400,000 barrels per day) were imported. At a cost of $75 \n     per barrel of oil, people in the United States remit more \n     than $600,000 per minute to other countries for petroleum.\n       (3) A significant percentage of these petroleum imports \n     originate in countries controlled by regimes that are \n     unstable or openly hostile to the interests of the United \n     States. Dependence on production from these countries \n     contributes to the volatility of domestic and global markets \n     and the ``risk premium'' paid by consumers in the United \n     States.\n       (4) The Energy Information Administration projects that the \n     total petroleum demand in the United States will increase by \n     23 percent between 2006 and 2026, while domestic crude \n     production is expected to decrease by 11 percent, resulting \n     in an anticipated 28 percent increase in petroleum imports. \n     Absent significant action, the United States will become more \n     vulnerable to oil price increases, more dependent upon \n     foreign oil, and less able to pursue national interests.\n       (5) Two-thirds of all domestic oil use occurs in the \n     transportation sector, which is 97 percent reliant upon \n     petroleum-based fuels. Passenger vehicles, including light \n     trucks under 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, represent \n     over 60 percent of the oil used in the transportation sector.\n       (6) Corporate average fuel economy of all cars and trucks \n     improved by 70 percent between 1975 and 1987. Between 1987 \n     and 2006, fuel economy improvements have stagnated and the \n     fuel economy of the United States is lower than many \n     developed countries and some developing countries.\n       (7) Significant improvements in engine technology occurred \n     between 1986 and 2006. These advances have been used to make \n     vehicles larger and more powerful, and have not focused \n     solely on increasing fuel economy.\n       (8) According to a 2002 fuel economy report by the National \n     Academies of Science, fuel economy can be increased without \n     negatively impacting the safety of cars and trucks in the \n     United States. Some new technologies can increase both safety \n     and fuel economy (such as high strength materials, unibody \n     design, lower bumpers). Design changes related to fuel \n     economy also present opportunities to reduce the \n     incompatibility of tall, stiff, heavy vehicles with the \n     majority of vehicles on the road.\n       (9) Significant change must occur to strengthen the \n     economic competitiveness of the domestic auto industry. \n     According to a recent study by the University of Michigan, a \n     sustained gasoline price of $2.86 per gallon would lead \n     Detroit's Big 3 automakers' profits to shrink by \n     $7,000,000,000 as they absorb 75 percent of the lost vehicle \n     sales. This would put nearly 300,000 people in the United \n     States out of work.\n       (10) Opportunities exist to strengthen the domestic vehicle \n     industry while improving fuel economy. A 2004 study performed \n     by the University of Michigan concludes that providing \n     $1,500,000,000 in tax incentives over a 10-year period to \n     encourage domestic manufacturers and parts facilities to \n     produce clean cars will lead to a gain of nearly 60,000 \n     domestic jobs and pay for itself through the resulting \n     increase in domestic tax receipts.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fuel Economy Reform Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) United States dependence on oil imports imposes \n     tremendous burdens on the economy, foreign policy, and \n     military of the United States.\n       (2) According to the Energy Information Administration, 60 \n     percent of the crude oil and petroleum products consumed in \n     the United States between April 2005 and March 2006 \n     (12,400,000 barrels per day) were imported. At a cost of $75 \n     per barrel of oil, people in the United States remit more \n     than $600,000 per minute to other countries for petroleum.\n       (3) A significant percentage of these petroleum imports \n     originate in countries controlled by regimes that are \n     unstable or openly hostile to the interests of the United \n     States. Dependence on production from these countries \n     contributes to the volatility of domestic and global markets \n     and the ``risk premium'' paid by consumers in the United \n     States.\n       (4) The Energy Information Administration projects that the \n     total petroleum demand in the United States will increase by \n     23 percent between 2006 and 2026, while domestic crude \n     production is expected to decrease by 11 percent, resulting \n     in an anticipated 28 percent increase in petroleum imports. \n     Absent significant action, the United States will become more \n     vulnerable to oil price increases, more dependent upon \n     foreign oil, and less able to pursue national interests.\n       (5) Two-thirds of all domestic oil use occurs in the \n     transportation sector, which is 97 percent reliant upon \n     petroleum-based fuels. Passenger vehicles, including light \n     trucks under 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, represent \n     over 60 percent of the oil used in the transportation sector.\n       (6) Corporate average fuel economy of all cars and trucks \n     improved by 70 percent between 1975 and 1987. Between 1987 \n     and 2006, fuel economy improvements have stagnated and the \n     fuel economy of the United States is lower than many \n     developed countries and some developing countries.\n       (7) Significant improvements in engine technology occurred \n     between 1986 and 2006. These advances have been used to make \n     vehicles larger and more powerful, and have not focused \n     solely on increasing fuel economy.\n       (8) According to a 2002 fuel economy report by the National \n     Academies of Science, fuel economy can be increased without \n     negatively impacting the safety of cars and trucks in the \n     United States. Some new technologies can increase both safety \n     and fuel economy (such as high strength materials, unibody \n     design, lower bumpers). Design changes related to fuel \n     economy also present opportunities to reduce the \n     incompatibility of tall, stiff, heavy vehicles with the \n     majority of vehicles on the road.\n       (9) Significant change must occur to strengthen the \n     economic competitiveness of the domestic auto industry. \n     According to a recent study by the University of Michigan, a \n     sustained gasoline price of $2.86 per gallon would lead \n     Detroit's Big 3 automakers' profits to shrink by \n     $7,000,000,000 as they absorb 75 percent of the lost vehicle \n     sales. This would put nearly 300,000 people in the United \n     States out of work.\n       (10) Opportunities exist to strengthen the domestic vehicle \n     industry while improving fuel economy. A 2004 study performed \n     by the University of Michigan concludes that providing \n     $1,500,000,000 in tax incentives over a 10-year period to \n     encourage domestic manufacturers and parts facilities to \n     produce clean cars will lead to a gain of nearly 60,000 \n     domestic jobs and pay for itself through the resulting \n     increase in domestic tax receipts.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to ensure that participants in the Troops to Teachers program may \nteach at a range of eligible schools; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Troops to \nTeachers Improvement Act of 2007, which will help more of our veterans \nand service members find second careers in our classrooms. This bill \nwill expand the accessibility of this program, so that more military \npersonnel will be able to enroll, receive $5,000 toward their teaching \ncertification, and teach in a school near their home. I am proud to be \njoined by Senator Chambliss, Senator Collins, and Senator Allard in \nintroducing this legislation. On the House side, Congressman Petri and \nCongresswoman Matsui have introduced a companion to this bill.\n  Since it was created in 1994, the Troops to Teachers program has \nhelped place over 10,000 new teachers in classrooms around the country. \nThe program provides guidance, teacher certification assistance, and \nbonuses for military personnel who give at least three years of service \nin the classroom.\n  When Congress established the Troops to Teachers program, it created \ntwo levels of bonuses for military personnel and veterans who \nparticipate. An individual was eligible for a $5,000 stipend so long as \nhe or she taught in any school in a district that received Title I \nfunding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. This meant \nthat an individual could teach three years in any of a vast majority of \nschools in the country and still be eligible for the $5,000 bonus.\n  Congress allowed a person to receive an additional $5,000 if he or \nshe taught three years in a school that served a high percentage of \ndisadvantaged students. The total bonus of $10,000 was meant to draw \nthese talented new teachers into schools that needed them most.\n  For over a decade, this bonus structure was highly successful. In \nColorado alone, the program has provided around 80 new hires a year to \nschools where new teachers are desperately needed.\n  But in 2005, the Department of Education limited the number of \nschools that were eligible to participate and therefore made it more \ndifficult for individuals to receive the baseline $5,000 bonus. The \nDepartment of Education was able to do this because when the Troops to \nTeachers program was reauthorized under the No Child Left Behind Act, \nthere was a mistake in the reauthorization language that created \nconfusion about which schools an individual may teach in order to be \neligible for the $5,000 bonus. As I pointed out a moment ago, when \nCongress created the Troops to Teachers program, it said that an \nindividual could receive the bonus if he or she taught in a ``high-\nneed'' school, that is, in any school in a district that received Title \n1 funding. In Colorado, that meant that around 98 percent of school \ndistricts qualified. But, because Troops to Teachers was mistakenly \nplaced in a section of NCLB with a different definition of ``high \nneed,'' an individual can now only receive the $5,000 bonus if he or \nshe teaches in a school that has more than 10,000 students or has more \nthan 20 percent of its students from families below the poverty line.\n  As a result of this change, enrollments in the Troops to Teachers \nprogram have dwindled over the past two years. Western and rural \nStates, in particular, have been negatively impacted. In Colorado, new \nhires out of Troops to Teachers have dropped from 79 for the 2003-2004 \nschool year to 43 for the 2006-2007 school year.\n  This drop-off in new hires from Troops to Teachers is problematic for \nseveral reasons. First, we should be finding ways of attracting new \nteachers to our classrooms, not devising bureaucratic barriers that \nkeep them out. Experts predict that we will need approximately 2 \nmillion new teachers in the next decade, and we need teachers who will \ngive more than a year or two of service. Today, half of newcomers to \nthe teaching profession last less than five years. The good news is \nthat Troops to Teachers has an 83 percent retention rate for its \nteachers. A full 223 of the 343 original participants are still \nteaching today, more than a decade after the program's creation.\n  Troops to Teachers also helps fill a need for diversity in the \nclassroom--83 percent of program participants are male, compared to 18 \npercent of teachers nationally, and 37 percent are ethnic minorities, \ncompared to 15 percent of teachers nationally.\n  The second problem with the new eligibility criteria is that it \ndisproportionately hurts rural veterans and rural school districts. \nIt's hard to find a school district in western Colorado or on the \neastern plains that has 10,000 students. Are we expecting a Troops to \nTeacher participant living in Yuma County, population 9,789 to drive to \nDenver to teach in an eligible school there so they can receive the \n$5,000 stipend?\n  The third problem with the new criteria is that it hurts retiring \nservice members who want to pursue a second career in education. This \ncountry has a long history of providing educational benefits to our men \nand women in uniform through the 1944 GI Bill and successive \nlegislation. Troops to Teachers furthers this great cause by helping \nour men and women in uniform extend their education and earn a teaching \ncertificate. With over 1.3 million veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, \nmany of whom are currently transitioning back to civilian life, we have \nan opportunity to bring the best and the brightest who are now serving \nin the military straight into the classrooms, where they can continue \nto extend their service to their country.\n  The bill I'm introducing today provides a simple fix to the problems \nthat arose for the Troops to Teachers program under the No Child Left \nBehind Act. The bill simply says that if there is no school within 50 \nmiles of the home of a Troops to Teachers participant, the individual \nmay teach in any school in a district that receives Title 1 funding and \nreceive the initial $5,000 bonus. This bill will allow thousands of \nretiring service members in rural communities to take advantage of the \nTroops to Teachers incentives and transition to a second career in the \nclassroom. I also want to point out that this bill still prioritizes \nschools that fit the current definition of ``high need''--that is, \nschools with over 10,000 students or with 20 percent of its students \nfrom families below the poverty line--but it also provides an outlet if \nthere are no schools in the area that fit those criteria. This bill \ndoes not affect the additional bonus that Troops to Teachers \nparticipants have always\n\n[[Page S2707]]\n\nbeen able to receive if they teach in a school with a high percentage \nof disadvantaged students.\n  I am hopeful that when we reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act, \nwe take another look at Troops to Teachers to help make it more \naccessible to veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, National Guard \nmembers, and reservists. Troops to Teachers is a good program that \nshould be strengthened and supported when it is reauthorized. Yet, we \nshouldn't wait until then to fix this needless problem that is \nhampering the program's effectiveness today. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this problem, today, by supporting the quick, straightforward \nsolution that this bill provides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 769\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to improve \nthe nutrition and health of schoolchildren by updating the definition \nof ``food of minimal nutritional value'' to conform to current \nnutrition science and to protect the Federal investment in the national \nschool lunch and breakfast programs; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, our Nation faces a public health crisis of \nthe first order. Poor diet and physical inactivity are contributing to \ngrowing rates of chronic disease in the U.S. These problems do not just \naffect adults, but increasingly affect the health of our children as \nwell. Research suggests that one-third of American children born today \nwill develop type II diabetes at some point. For some minority \nchildren, the numbers are even more shocking, as high as 50 percent. At \nthe same time, since 1963, rates of obesity have quadrupled among \nchildren ages 6 to 11 and tripled among children ages 12 to 19. Even \nour youngest children are not immune. Since 1971, among children ages 2 \nto 5, obesity rates have tripled.\n  There are many reasons for this public health crisis, and \naccordingly, addressing the crisis will require multiple solutions as \nwell. One place where we can start is with our schools, which have been \ninundated with foods and drinks having little or no positive \nnutritional value. A recent study from the Government Accountability \noffice found that 99 percent of high schools, 97 percent of middle \nschools, and 83 percent of elementary schools sell foods from vending \nmachines, school stores, or a-la-carte lines in the cafeteria. And it \nis not fresh fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are \nbeing sold. No, the vast majority of the foods being sold in our \nschools outside of Federal meal programs are foods that contribute \nnothing to the health and development of our children and are actually \ndetrimental to them.\n  Not only does the overconsumption of these foods take a toll on the \nhealth of our children, but they also have a negative impact of the \ninvestment of taxpayer dollars in the health of our kids. Every year \nthe Federal Government spends nearly $10 billion to reimburse schools \nfor the provision of meals through the National School Lunch Program \nand School Breakfast Program. In order to receive reimbursement, these \nmeals must meet nutrition standards based upon the Dietary Guidelines \nfor All Americans, the official dietary advice of the U.S. government. \nHowever, sales of food elsewhere in our schools do not fall under these \nguidelines. Therefore, as children consume more and more of the foods \ntypically sold through school vending machines and snack bars, it \nundermines the nearly $10 billion in federal reimbursements that we \nspend on nutritionally balanced school meals.\n  Finally, the heavy selling of candy, soft drinks and other junk food \nin our schools undermines the guidance, and even the instruction and \nauthority of parents who want to help their children consume sound and \nbalanced diets. The American public agrees. A Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation poll from several years ago found that 90 percent of parents \nwould like to see schools remove the typical junk food from vending \nmachines and replace it with healthier alternatives. My bill seeks to \nrestore the role and authority of parents by ensuring that schools \nprovide the healthy, balanced nutrition that contributes to health and \ndevelopment.\n  What really hurts children and undermines parents is the junk food \nfree-for-all that currently exists in so many of our schools. How does \nit help kids if the school sells them a 20-ounce soda and a candy bar \nfor lunch when their parents have sent them to school with the \nexpectation that they will have balanced meals from the school lunch \nprogram?\n\n  Today, along with my colleague Senator Murkowski of Alaska, I will \nintroduce bipartisan legislation to address this problem--and to do \nwhat is right for the health of our kids. This bill has broad support \nin both the education and the public health communities and is \nsupported by the National PTA, the National Education Association, the \nAmerican Federation of Teachers, the American Medical Association, the \nCenter for Science in the Public Interest, the School Nutrition \nAssociation, the Food Research and Action Center, the American Heart \nAssociation, the American Dietetic Association, the American Diabetes \nAssociation, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, among others.\n  The Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act of 2007 \ndoes two very simple but important things:\n  First, it requires the Secretary of Agriculture to initiate a \nrulemaking process to update nutritional standards for foods sold in \nschools. Currently, USDA relies upon a very narrow nutritional standard \nthat is nearly 30 years old. Since that definition was formulated, \nchildren's diets and dietary risk have changed dramatically. In that \ntime, we have also learned a great deal about the relationship between \npoor diet and chronic disease. It is time for public policy to catch up \nwith the science.\n  Second, the bill requires the Secretary of Agriculture to apply the \nupdated definition everywhere on school grounds and throughout the \nschool day. Currently, the Secretary can only issue rules limiting a \nvery narrow class of foods, and then only stop their sales in the \nactual school cafeteria during the meal period. As a result, a child \nonly needs to walk into the hall outside the cafeteria to buy a lunch \nconsisting of soda, a bag of chips and a candy bar. This is a loophole \nthat is big enough to drive a soft drink delivery truck through--\nliterally. It is time to close it.\n  The bill is supported in the Senate by a bipartisan group of \nSenators. Joining me in introducing the bill are Senator Murkowski of \nAlaska, Senator Durbin of Illinois, Senator Voinovich of Ohio, Senator \nMenendez of New Jersey, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, Senator \nSchumer of New York, Senator Cantwell of Washington, and Senator Carper \nof Delaware. The diverse group of supporters of this bill cuts across \nideological lines and shows that when the health of our children is at \nstake, we can put aside our differences in the interest of our \nchildren.\n  This bill, by itself, will not solve the problem of poor diet and \nrising rates of chronic disease among our children and adults. But it \nis a start. Scientists predict that--because of obesity and preventable \nchronic diseases--the current\n\n[[Page S2708]]\n\ngeneration of children could very well be the first in American history \nto live shorter lives than their parents. If this isn't a wake up call, \nI don't know what is.\n  Our children are at risk. The time to act is now. And that's why I am \npleased to introduce the Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch \nProtection Act of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Vitter, \n        and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 772. A bill to amend the Federal antitrust laws to provide \nexpanded coverage and to eliminate exemptions from such laws that are \ncontrary to the public interest with respect to railroads; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Antitrust \nSubcommittee, I believe it is my role to investigate and help end--\nmonopolistic practices that exploit American consumers. In that spirit, \nI rise today to introduce along with my colleagues, Senators Coleman, \nFeingold, Vitter and Rockefeller, the Railroad Antitrust Enforcement \nAct of 2007. This legislation will eliminate obsolete antitrust \nexemptions that protect freight railroads from competition.\n  Consolidation in the railroad industry, allowed under the exemptions \nmy legislation would repeal, has resulted in only four Class I \nrailroads providing over 90 percent of the nation's freight rail \ntransportation. The lack of competition was recently documented in a \nGovernment Accountability Office October 2006 report. That report found \nthat, ``concerns about competition and captivity, in the rail industry, \nremain as traffic is concentrated in fewer railroads.'' The report also \nstated that the Surface Transportation Board, the entity charged with \nensuring that the industry remains competitive, has failed to do so. In \nAugust 2006, the Attorneys General of 17 states and the District sent a \nletter to Congress citing problems due to a lack of competition and \nasked that the antitrust exemptions be removed.\n  The ill-effects of this consolidation are exemplified in the case of \n``captive shippers''--industries served by only one railroad. Over the \npast several years, these captive shippers faced spiking rail rates. \nThey are the victims of the monopolistic practices and price gouging by \nthe single railroad that serves them, price increases which they are \nforced to pass along into the price of their products, and ultimately, \nto consumers. And in many cases, the ordinary protections of antitrust \nlaw are unavailable to these captive shippers--instead, the railroads \nare protected by a series of exemptions from the normal rules of \nantitrust law to which all other industries must abide.\n  These exemptions have put the American consumer at risk, and in \nWisconsin, victims of a lack of railroad competition abound. A \ncoalition has formed, consisting of about 40 affected organizations--\nBadger CURE. From Dairyland Power Cooperative in La Crosse to Wolf \nRiver Lumber in New London, companies in my State are feeling the \ncrunch of years of railroad consolidation. To help offset a 93 percent \nincrease in shipping rates in 2006, Dairyland Power Cooperative had to \nraise electricity rates by 20 percent. The reliability, efficiency, and \naffordability of freight rail have all declined, and Wisconsin \nconsumers feel the pinch.\n  And similar stories exist across the country. That is why I'm joining \nwith my colleagues to introduce the Railroad Antitrust Enforcement Act \nof 2007. This legislation will force railroads to play by the rules of \nfree competition like all other businesses.\n  The current antitrust exemptions protect a wide range of railroad \nindustry conduct from scrutiny by governmental antirust enforcers. \nRailroad mergers and acquisitions are exempt from antitrust law and are \nreviewed solely by the Surface Transportation Board. Railroads that \nengage in collective ratemaking are also exempt from antitrust law. \nRailroads subject to the regulation of the Surface Transportation Board \nare also exempt from private antitrust lawsuits seeking the termination \nof anti-competitive practices via injunctive relief. Our bill will \neliminate these exemptions.\n  No good reason exists for them. While railroad legislation in recent \ndecades--including most notably the Staggers Rail Act of 1980--\nderegulated much railroad rate setting from the oversight of the \nSurface Transportation Board, these obsolete antitrust exemptions \nremained in place, insulating a consolidating industry from obeying the \nrules of fair competition.\n  Our bill will bring railroad mergers and acquisitions under the \npurview of the Clayton Act, allowing the Federal Government, State \nattorneys general and private parties to file suit to enjoin anti-\ncompetitive mergers and acquisitions. It will restore the review of \nthese mergers to the agencies where they belong--the Justice \nDepartment's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission. It \nwill eliminate the exemption that prevents FTC's scrutiny of railroad \ncommon carriers. It will eliminate the antitrust exemption for railroad \ncollective ratemaking. It will allow State attorneys general and other \nprivate parties to sue railroads for treble damages and injunctive \nrelief for violations of the antitrust laws, including collusion that \nleads to excessive and unreasonable rates.\n  In sum, by clearing out this thicket of outmoded antitrust \nexemptions, railroads will be subject to the same laws as the rest of \nthe economy. Government antitrust enforcers will finally have the tools \nto prevent anti-competitive transactions and practices by railroads. \nLikewise, private parties will be able to utilize the antitrust laws to \ndeter anti-competitive conduct and to seek redress for their injuries.\n  It is time to put an end to the abusive practices of the Nation's \nfreight railroads. On the Antitrust Subcommittee, we have seen that in \nindustry after industry, vigorous application of our Nation's antitrust \nlaws is the best way to eliminate barriers to competition, to end \nmonopolistic behavior, to keep prices low and quality of service high. \nThe railroad industry is no different. All those who rely on railroads \nto ship their products--whether it is an electric utility for its coal, \na farmer to ship grain, or a factory to acquire its raw materials or \nship out its finished product--deserve the full application of the \nantitrust laws to end the anti-competitive abuses all too prevalent in \nthis industry today. I urge my colleagues to support the Railroad \nAntitrust Enforcement Act of 2007.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 772\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud today to join with my \ncolleagues, Senator Kohl, Senator Coleman, Senator Feingold, and \nSenator Vitter, to introduce the Railroad Antitrust Enforcement Act of \n2007. If enacted, this bill would close an incomprehensible legal \nloophole that has allowed our Nation's freight railroads the unfettered \nability to act in anti-competitive ways for too many years. Since \nbefore I came to the United States Senate I have been quite stunned at \nthe ability of railroad companies, by virtue of an exemption from our \nantitrust laws, to ignore the legitimate complaints of their customers, \nto sidestep the appropriate concerns of elected officials and leaders \nin the private sector alike, and to consolidate operations and power to \nthe detriment of the consumer.\n  The Railroad Antitrust Enforcement Act would benefit businesses, \nemployees, and consumers by providing meaningful government oversight \nwhere none exists currently. It will give our Nation's shippers--long \ncaptive to monopoly abuses courts were powerless to check, the Surface \nTransportation Board was unwilling to acknowledge--remedies that will \nmake for a more open and competitive freight rail marketplace.\n  In my home State of West Virginia and in towns all across the \ncountry, companies and consumers are negatively impacted by lack of \ncompetitive rail transportation options--a phenomenon often referred as \na shipper being ``captive'' to one railroad. Because the antitrust \nexemptions in place allowed railroads to ignore the rules by which \nvirtually all other American corporations are required to operate, \nrailroads have refused to negotiate in good faith with their customers \nover the costs of shipping important rail-dependent commodities such as \ncoal, bulk chemicals, and grains and other agricultural products. \nManufacturers have been left at the mercy of the railroads and are \nforced to pay exorbitant transportation rates to ship their goods. Many \nmanufacturers struggle to be competitive with competitors here and \nabroad because they simply do not have real transportation choices. The \nbottom line, which should come as no surprise to my colleagues, is that \nif industrial inputs and the fuel used to produce half of our \nelectricity are artificially high in price, consumers are left paying \nhigher prices for just about everything they buy. This continues to \nhave an overwhelmingly negative affect on West Virginia's economy, as \nindustries served by only one carrier face pressures to cut production \nin the state, or to leave it altogether.\n  How has this been allowed to come to pass? It will probably come as a \nshock to members of the Senate, but the railroad industry is exempt \nfrom the Nation's antitrust laws related to mergers, acquisitions, and \npooling arrangements approved by the Surface Transportation Board \n(STB). They are also exempt from antitrust laws that would otherwise \ninfluence ratemaking. Under the current exemptions, private parties \ncannot file antitrust suits against railroad companies to halt what in \nwould be for every other industry illegal practices. Under current law, \nrailroads are allowed to continue a wide range of anti-competitive \npractices that severely inhibit the ability of our Nation's businesses \nfrom shipping their goods at reasonable rates. What this Nation has \nexperienced in the more than 25 years since the Staggers Act partially \nderegulated the freight rail market are not efforts by railroads to \nmodernize their systems, improve efficiency, and upgrade service. \nRather, rail carriers have manipulated the system to charge their so-\ncalled ``captive'' customers as much as they chose to charge, not what \nthe market would normally bear.\n  Specifically, the Railroad Antitrust Enforcement Act will alter \nexemptions in current law to allow for the following: Permit the \nJustice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to review \nmergers under the Clayton and Sherman Acts, and allow them to bring \nlegal action to block anti-anticompetitive railroad mergers. Remove \nantitrust exemptions that have allowed railroads to merge, acquire new \nproperties, set rates collectively, and otherwise coordinate policies \nacross the entire freight rail market. Allow State Attorneys-General \nand other private parties to sue for treble damages for violations of \nantitrust laws, including for collusive activity leading to excessive \nand unreasonable\n\n[[Page S2710]]\n\nrates. Allow State Attorneys General and private parties to sue for \ncourt orders to halt anticompetitive conduct. Expand the jurisdiction \nof the FTC to allow it to enforce antitrust law in the railroad \nindustry.\n  By granting consumers and shippers long-denied access to the \nprotections of our antitrust laws with regard to the freight rail \nindustry, the Railroad Antitrust Enforcement Act may make strides \ntoward creating the competitive freight rail marketplace envisioned by \nCongress when it passed the Staggers Act in 1980. I hope so. However, \nbecause I believe rail customers and retail consumers need greater \nprotection still, along with some of my cosponsors today and others, \nlater this month I will be introducing additional, broader rail policy \nlegislation to declare the rights shippers were meant to have, and the \nresponsibilities railroads were meant to have, when Congress passed the \nStaggers Act.\n  For the system to work, there must be a meaningful way to seek \nredress of grievances and punish wrongdoing. The Railroad Antitrust \nEnforcement Act will go a long way toward correcting some of the \nglaring problems those of us who pay attention to the rail marketplace \nhave known about for a long time. It will not fix all the problems in \nthe system, but perhaps its provisions will encourage railroads to \nnegotiate with their customers in good faith. The lack of fairness in \nthe current system is devastating to businesses in my state of West \nVirginia, and to companies and consumers in every part of the country.\n  I again express my support for the Railroad Antitrust Enforcement Act \nof 2007, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. This is a problem \nthat affects rural America and urban America, the Grain Belt and the \nCoalfields, and all points on the compass. Indeed, no American consumer \nis unaffected by this problem, and all American consumers should take \nheart: If we enact this bill, help will be on the way.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. Snowe, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Sununu):\n  S. 773. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nFederal civilian and military retirees to pay health insurance premiums \non a pretax basis and to allow a deduction for TRICARE supplemental \npremiums; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprovide some relief for our Nation's retired Federal employees from the \nsevere increases in Federal Employee Health Benefit program (FEHBP) \npremiums. This measure extends premium conversion to Federal and \nmilitary retirees, allowing them to pay their health insurance premiums \nwith pre-tax dollars.\n  Access to affordable health care is a critical issue for everyone. \nWhile Federal employees enjoy the ability to choose among a wide \nvariety of health plans to best suit their needs, substantial increases \nin FEHBP premiums threaten to make health insurance coverage cost \nprohibitive for many Federal employees, their dependents, and Federal \nretirees.\n  In response to these cost increases, a Presidential directive issued \nin 2000 extended premium conversion to current Federal employees who \nparticipate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Premium \nconversion allows individuals to pay their health insurance premiums \nwith pre-tax dollars. It is a benefit already available to many private \nsector employees and State and local government employees. While \npremium conversion does not directly affect the amount of the FEHBP \npremium, it helps to offset some of the cost by reducing an \nindividual's Federal tax liability. Regrettably, our retired civil \nservants, who pay the same premiums as Federal employees, do not have \nthis same opportunity.\n  Extending this benefit to Federal retirees requires a change in the \ntax law, specifically Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code. This \nlegislation makes the necessary change in the tax code.\n  Under the legislation, the benefit is concurrently afforded to our \nNation's military retirees to assist them with increasing health care \ncosts.\n  A number of organizations representing Federal and military retirees, \nincluding the National Association of Retired Federal Employees and the \nMilitary Coalition, have come out strongly in support of this bill.\n  My support for this legislation spans four Congresses. In the 109th \nCongress, my premium conversion bill received considerable bipartisan \nsupport with 64 cosponsors. It is my sincere hope that this legislation \nwill be passed by Congress this session. I encourage my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this critical legislation and to show their \nsupport for our Nation's dedicated Federal civilian and military \nretirees. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 773\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a National Commission on the \nInfrastructure of the United States; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I join my good friend, Sen. George \nVoinovich, in introducing a bill to study the current state and future \nneeds of our national infrastructure, including rail, airports, \nwastewater\n\n[[Page S2713]]\n\ntreatment facilities, waterways and levees.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that $1.6 trillion \nis needed over a five-year period to bring the Nation's infrastructure \nto a good condition. Clearly, we need to look at our needs and find a \nbetter way to maintain the infrastructure we have, while meeting new \ndemand--all in a way that is fiscally sustainable.\n  Last Congress, during the debate about the surface transportation \nreauthorization, we discussed the problems facing our roadways. Poor \nroad conditions cost U.S. motorists $54 billion per year in repairs and \noperating costs and 3.5 billion hours a year in traffic. Over 27 \npercent of the Nation's bridges are structurally deficient or \nfunctionally obsolete. While transit use increased faster than any \nother mode of transportation--up 21 percent--between 1993 and 2002, the \nFederal Transit Administration estimates $14.8 billion is needed \nannually to maintain conditions.\n  In Delaware, while population growth grew a robust 23 percent from \n1990 to 2003, vehicle travel on our highways increased 38 percent. And \ndriving on roads in need of repair cost Delaware motorists $160 million \na year in extra vehicle repairs and operating costs. To take a look at \nwhat must be done to maintain our highways and transit as well as \naddress future needs, and ways to pay for all of that, Congress created \na commission to study these issues in SAFETEA-LU and report back to \nCongress with recommendations.\n  But there are more types of infrastructure in need of attention than \njust highways and transit. Air travel has reportedly surpassed pre-\nSeptember 11, 2001, levels and is projected to grow 4.3 percent \nannually through 2015. Aging wastewater management systems discharge \nbillions of gallons of untreated sewage into U.S. surface waters each \nyear. And the EPA estimates that $390 billion over the next 20 years \nwill be needed to replace existing systems and build new ones to meet \nincreasing demands.\n  Further, limited rail capacity has created significant chokepoints \nand delays, as freight rail tonnage is expected to increase at least 50 \npercent by 2020 and intercity passenger rail ridership has increased to \napproximately 25 million a year. To accommodate both freight and \npassenger rail demand, $12-13 billion a year in investments will be \nneeded.\n  After Hurricane Katrina led to the failure of floodwalls in New \nOrleans, Congress asked the Corps of Engineers to inspect other flood \ncontrol structures to identify other repair needs. The Corps found that \n146 levees in 28 States, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia are \nin danger of failing.\n  In Delaware, vehicle travel on our highways has increased 38 percent \nfrom 1990 to 2003, costing Delaware motorists $160 million a year in \nextra vehicle repairs and operating costs--$273 per motorist. Delaware \nalso has $304 million in drinking water infrastructure needs over the \nnext 20 years and $288 million in wastewater infrastructure needs.\n  Understanding the problem and plotting a plan of attack are essential \nfor attracting and maintaining business and investment in our economy \nand communities. The legislation we are proposing today would give the \nNational Commission on the Infrastructure of the United States until \nFebruary 15, 2009, to complete a study of the Nation's infrastructure, \nin consultation with the appropriate Federal, State and local agencies \nas well as private sector stakeholders. The Commission would study the \nage and condition of public infrastructure, the capacity to sustain \ncurrent and anticipated economic development, the methods used to \nfinance public infrastructure, and the return to the economy from \npublic works investment.\n  Many times, when we debate infrastructure needs, people simply call \nfor additional funds. Unfortunately, the taxpayer is losing confidence \nin the way we invest their tax dollars. Failures, like the floodwalls \nin New Orleans, harm confidence in the government's ability to protect \ncommunities from natural disasters. The fact that we've made no changes \nto the Corps' flood control program in the wake of that catastrophic \nfailure has further damaged government credibility.\n  Increasing traffic in spite of the investment of billions of dollars \nevery year in highways and bridges reduces confidence in government's \nability to address traffic congestion. Failure to invest in rail while \nboth freight usage and passenger ridership is at all time highs makes \nthe taxpayer doubt that government is spending their tax dollars \naccording to the needs of the people.\n  Part of the solution is, likely, greater funding. But the American \npeople need to be confident in the products we provide before they are \ngoing to sign a check for more funding. That is why the Commission will \nstudy innovative financing, such as tax-credit bonds and private \ninvestment. But also, the Commission will study the impact of State and \nlocal governments' land use and economic development decisions on \nFederal infrastructure costs, and provide Congress with some insight as \nto how the various levels of government can better coordinate to gain \ngreater efficiencies from our infrastructure investment.\n  Stronger coordination, greater investment and creativity are the keys \nto maintaining our infrastructure and investing in future needs--as \nwell as a healthy and robust economy. I look forward to guidance from \nthis Commission as to how Congress can better do just that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 777. A bill to repeal the imposition of withholding on certain \npayments made to vendors by government entities; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Withholding \nTax Relief Act of 2007, which would repeal Section 511 of the Tax \nIncrease Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005.\n  Last year, Congress answered Americans' calls for tax relief when it \npassed the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005. The \nlower taxes on capital gains and dividends--and the higher alternative \nminimum tax exemption amounts--contained in the legislation assisted \nsmall businesses, encouraged the kind of investment that creates jobs \nand makes our economy grow, and ensured fairer tax treatment for \nmiddle-income families who would otherwise be left picking up the bill \nfor a tax intended for the wealthy.\n  Alongside these essential tax relief provisions, however, conferees \nquietly inserted Section 511, a last-minute $7 billion tax penalty on \ngovernment contractors, into the bill. Thus, the bill, whose aim was \n``tax increase prevention,'' actually raised taxes. On the same day the \nPresident signed the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act \ninto law, I introduced the Withholding Tax Relief Act of 2006 and made \ngood on my promise to work to repeal Section 511. Today, I am renewing \nthat promise.\n  Section 511--the largest revenue-raiser by far in the Tax Increase \nPrevention and Reconciliation Act--imposes a sweeping new 3 percent tax \nwithholding on all government payments for products and services made \nby the Federal Government, State governments, and local governments \nwith expenditures of $100 million or more. It affects payments for \ngoods and services under government contracts and payments to any \nperson for a service or product provided to a government entity--for \nexample, Medicare and certain grants--beginning in 2011.\n  Section 511 will not close the tax gap--or the difference between \nwhat American taxpayers owe and what they actually pay--as proponents \nof the provision argue. Section 511 is estimated to ``increase'' \nrevenue by $7 billion from 2011 to 2015, but raises $6 billion of that \namount due solely to accelerated tax receipts and not an actual revenue \nincrease from tax compliance. It generates only $215 million in 2012 \nand increases slightly in each of the three years thereafter hardly the \n$290 billion annual tax gap the IRS estimates. Further, Section 511 is \nbased on revenues from government payments with no relationship to a \ncompany's taxable income or tax liability. Section 511 hurts honest \ntaxpaying businesses without providing any additional enforcement \nmechanisms for tax delinquents.\n  Section 511's costs to businesses are substantial. Although \nproponents of Section 511 call the 3 percent withholding rate ``low'' \nand ``conservative,'' in most cases, businesses make substantially less \nthan 3 percent profit on their contracts and sometimes, turn no profit \nat all. Section 511 will effectively withhold entire paychecks--\ninterest free--thereby impeding the cash\n\n[[Page S2714]]\n\nflow of small businesses, eliminating funds that can be used for \nreinvestment in the business, and forcing companies to pass on the \nadded costs to customers or finance the additional amount.\n  Section 511 will also impose significant administrative costs on the \nFederal, State, and local governments--costs so high, in fact, that the \nCongressional Budget Office (CBO) said the provision constitutes an \nunfunded mandate on the state and local governments. The projected \ncosts of Section 511, says CBO, will far exceed the allowable $50 \nmillion annual threshold.\n  More than the costs to government, though, Section 511 stands to \nnegatively impact nearly every sector of the economy--from health care \nand technology to building and transportation--and there is already \ntalk of expanding the provision's reach and accelerating its effective \ndate. What there wasn't talk of, though--at the inception of Section \n511--was the provision itself. Congress never debated the merits of an \nexpanded withholding requirement--as a revenue-raiser or as a way to \nnarrow the tax gap--in a committee or on either chamber's floor. If it \nhad, Congress would have realized that it does neither of these things \nwell. Section 511 is the start of years of bad tax policy. We can do \nbetter than this, and I urge my colleagues to join me in working to \nrepeal this unfair tax penalty.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 777\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Withholding Tax Relief Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF IMPOSITION OF WITHHOLDING ON CERTAIN \n                   PAYMENTS MADE TO VENDORS BY GOVERNMENT \n                   ENTITIES.\n\n       The amendment made by section 511 of the Tax Increase \n     Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 is repealed and the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be applied as if such \n     amendment had never been enacted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Burr, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n        Sanders):\n  S. 778. A bill to amend title IV of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 in order to authorize the Secretary of Education \nto award competitive grants to eligible entities to recruit, select, \ntrain, and support Expanded Learning and After-School Fellows that will \nstrengthen expanded learning initiatives, 21st century community \nlearning center programs, and after-school programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Teaching \nFellows for Expanded Learning and After-School Act to tap the idealism, \nenergy, and talent of 2-year and 4-year college graduates to serve as \nteaching fellows in our Nation's highest need schools.\n  The Act will establish a new cadre of talented leaders to establish, \nexpand or improve expanded learning initiatives, 21st century community \nlearning center programs and after-school programs. These programs will \nbuild essential academic and youth development skills for all students \nin targeted grade levels in expanded-day programs. They will also \nassist teachers during the school day in linking the school curriculum \nmore closely with after school programming.\n  As we know most Olympic athletes train harder when a gold medal is in \nsight. Employees work overtime when a business launches a breakthrough \nproduct. Communities rally to provide material relief and comfort when \nnatural disasters strike. When success matters most, increased effort \nis essential for achieving a worthy goal, and that fundamental \nprinciple can work in education too.\n  The time has come for the Nation to go the extra mile to meet our \neducation goals and ensure that all children develop the skills they \nneed to participate fully in our economy and in the civic life of their \ncommunities. If students are to learn more--the core premise of the No \nChild Left Behind Act--they must have more time to meet these \nexpectations.\n  Teaching Fellows recruited under this bill will receive intensive \ntraining by experienced high-quality after-school programs and will \nserve for two years. The Act will also enable Teaching Fellows to \npursue a bachelor's or graduate degree in education, in order to give \ncommunities a pipeline of leaders ready for future involvement in \neducation and youth development.\n  For the most part, reform efforts to date have equated education \nreform with school reform. As a result our attention has been focused \non the 1,000 hours a year children are in school, while largely \noverlooking the 4,000 hours a year when children are awake and out of \nschool.\n  Teachers must, of course, remain at the heart of our strategy to \nimprove education. But they need help. We need to expand learning time, \ninvolve caring adults in the lives of children, and make learning more \nrelevant and engaging, especially for students who are struggling.\n  The school calendar today is largely a relic of the agrarian age. It \nfails to respond to the realities that students must develop new skills \nfor modem needs, and that in most families, parents are working during \nmany of the after-school hours. Fourteen million children come back to \nempty homes after school. Voters across party lines, demographic \ngroups, and geographic areas have said for 5 consecutive years that \nthey overwhelmingly support after-school programs for all. Police \nchiefs, sheriffs and prosecutors overwhelmingly agree that investing in \nafter-school programs is more effective in reducing youth violence and \ncrime than hiring more police officers or stiff penalties. Diverting \nless than one percent of at-risk youth from a life of crime would save \nsociety several times the cost of the after-school programs. It is time \nfor a new learning day to dawn in our country. Our communities and our \ncitizens need to waken to clear call for involvement and investment in \nthis aspect of public education.\n  The Teaching Fellows for Expanded Learning and After-School Act draws \non the impressive experience of after-school programs and schools that \nhave developed, and tested these ideas and shown they can work. The Act \nis inspired by the Teaching Fellowship Program created by Citizen \nSchools, a national network of after-school programs with a track \nrecord of significant impact on academic achievement. A rigorous, long-\nterm evaluation has shown that such students outperform their peers on \nsix out of seven measures of school success.\n  The Act also draws on the superb work of LA's BEST and After-School \nAll-Stars, as well as the experience and innovations of other schools \nand programs across the country.\n  Under the Act, the Department of Education will make grants to \npartnerships between local education agencies and strong community \norganizations, institutions of higher education, and community learning \ncenters. These partnerships will recruit and place Teaching Fellows to \nwork full-time in high-need schools that serve low-income students. \nGrants from the Department of Education will be at least $15,000 per \nFellow annually, so that recipients can recruit, select, train, and \nsupport the Fellows. Fellows will also be able to earn a national \nservice education award for each term of service. Partnerships will be \nrequired to obtain non-federal matching funds to leverage the federal \ngovernment's investment and to involve the private sector in expanding \nthese educational opportunities.\n  Expanded learning time and after-school programs are the new frontier \nof education reform in America. Teaching Fellows recruited under the \nAct will complement the outstanding efforts of classroom teachers and \ninfuse new energy, talent, and idealism in the after-school sector. \nThey will also be an essential resource for the nation's parents, \nencouraging students to understand their potential and helping them to \nsee the true promise of the American Dream.\n  This bill is supported by thirty-seven groups representing education \nand after-school communities. I ask unanimous consent that their \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2715]]\n\n\n\n\n                             National Collaboration for Youth,\n\n                                                February 16, 2007.\n     Hon.

We appreciate your \n     attention to, and support for, the need for quality \n     afterschool programs and for attracting young professionals \n     to the field.\n       By creating a cadre of talented young people to serve as \n     Fellows in expanded-day and afterschool programs, the T-FELAS \n     Act will help ensure that such programs are infused with \n     well-educated front-line staff who can support students in \n     activities that will enhance their development and success in \n     school. The Fellowships and opportunities to pursue \n     additional education should help attract graduates interested \n     in afterschool work, but who might not be able to enter the \n     field without such supports.\n       Research shows that more highly-educated and well-trained \n     staff who understand how children develop are the key to high \n     quality afterschool programs. As the leading voice of the \n     afterschool profession, representing over 9,000 afterschool \n     practitioners, administrators, and policymakers, we at the \n     National AfterSchool Association applaud this creative \n     approach to bringing talented new workers into the field. We \n     look forward to working with you both on this initiative and \n     on approaches to address the larger issues of overall \n     compensation and training levels in the field that make long-\n     term retention of staff difficult for afterschool programs.\n       Thank you again for your leadership in ensuring that well-\n     trained and supportive adults are available to enhance the \n     lives of our young people.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                    Judith N.

Edward M.

This legislation addresses a critical need in \n     communities across our country and offers an exciting \n     opportunity to expand national service.\n       The T-FELAS Act will recruit outstanding college graduates \n     to become Teaching Fellows and to serve in schools and after-\n     school programs that serve low-income students. Through their \n     service, Teaching Fellows will take their first steps along a \n     pathway of service and educational leadership. These dynamic, \n     aspiring educators will earn Segal AmeriCorps Education \n     Awards which will support them as they go on to careers as \n     classroom teachers and after-school leaders. Their experience \n     in linking in-school and after-school learning will play a \n     critical role in advancing academic achievement and expanding \n     educational opportunity.\n       Voices for National Service is a coalition of national \n     service organizations and state commissions from across the \n     country that provide direct services to communities in need, \n     matching the talents of committed citizens with service \n     opportunities in schools, community centers, senior homes, \n     health clinics, and national parks and recreation areas. \n     Collectively, we reach thousands of Americans in need every \n     day. We are excited to support this important initiative and \n     look forward to contributing to its success. The T-FELAS Act \n     will strengthen public education, create a powerful pipeline \n     of future educational leaders, and move students in schools \n     across the country toward the American Dream of college and \n     career opportunity.\n       Sincerely,\n         Karen Baker, Executive Director, California Volunteers; \n           Michael Brown, CEO, City Year, Nelda Brown, Executive \n           Director, National Service-Learning Partnership; Kyle \n           Caldwell, President & CEO, ConnectMichigan Alliance; \n           AnnMaura Connolly, Senior Vice President, City Year; \n           Calvin George, National Director, National Association \n           of Community Health Centers; Jacqueline Johnson, \n           Executive Director, Connecticut Commission for \n           Volunteer Services; Marsha Meeks Kelly, Executive \n           Director, Mississippi Commission for Volunteer Service; \n           Marguerite Kondracke, President & CEO, America's \n           Promise; Michelle Nunn, CEO, Hands On Network; Sally \n           Prouty, President, The Corps Network, Eric Schwarz, \n           President, Citizen Schools; Dorothy Stoneman, \n           President, YouthBuild USA; Marty Weinstein, \n           Chairperson, California AmeriCorps Alliance.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Illinois Center for Violence\n\n\n                                                   Prevention,\n\n                                                February 15, 2007.\n     Hon. Edward M.

We have long supported strategies to \n     enhance the quality of out-of-schoo1 time services, since \n     high quality programs are able to provide extended learning \n     opportunities and positive youth development experiences for \n     our youth. ICVP coordinates the Illinois After-school \n     Partnership, co-chaired by our state's Department of Human \n     Services and our State Board of Education. The Partnership is \n     working on policy and program enhancements to increase the \n     quality and availability of out-of-school-time opportunities. \n     The Partnership has been examining the professional \n     development needs of the current and future workforce for \n     this field, and is participating in a state-wide effort to \n     increase career pathways for youth workers.\n       The T-FELAS Act will be a valuable and needed tool that \n     will help develop the next generation of youth workers, \n     versed in essential youth development skills, and who view \n     public service and youth work as a career. We applaud the \n     inclusion of youth development language, especially the \n     training in youth development for the Fellows, and \n     acknowledgment of the education youth workers receive through \n     both two- and four-year institutions of higher education that \n     provide accredited coursework in youth development.\n       Thank you for your public service and leadership on this \n     issue. Please do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of \n     any assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Debbie Bretag,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Afterschool Alliance,\n\n                                                February 16, 2007.\n     Hon.

This legislation will \n     expand the federal government's interest in and support for \n     afterschool programs that keep kids safe, improve academic \n     achievement, and\n\n[[Page S2716]]\n\n     support working families by investing in quality initiatives. \n     On behalf of the advocates, afterschool providers, \n     researchers and parents that make up the Alliance network, \n     thank you for your longstanding support for our goal of \n     Afterschool for All.\n       Just as having a highly qualified teacher in the classroom \n     leads to student success, having well trained, skilled \n     leadership in afterschool programs ensures that the programs \n     provided contribute to children's academic and social \n     development and give young people the opportunities that will \n     assure their college and workplace readiness in the future. \n     The T-FELAS program will provide partnerships that offer \n     afterschool programs, including the 21st Century Community \n     Learning Centers, the chance to expand the quality and \n     capacity of services offered in targeted communities. It will \n     give individuals the financial support they need to pursue \n     careers in the afterschool field and to put their training \n     and talents to use serving children and families that need \n     their help most.\n       The Alliance endorses this legislation and looks forward to \n     working with you in the future to translate our common vision \n     of high quality afterschool and expanded learning \n     opportunities for all into reality.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Jodi Grant,\n\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  First Focus,\n\n                                                February 16, 2007.\n     Hon.

Richard Burr,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy and Senator Burr: First Focus is \n     pleased to endorse the Teaching Fellows for Expanded Learning \n     and After-School Act of 2007 (T-FELAS).\n       Quality after-school programs are critical for the nation's \n     young people. After-school programs keep children safe and \n     productive while their parents are at work; however, less \n     than half of parents of 6- to 17-year-olds say there are \n     enough affordable afterschool programs according to a recent \n     study conducted for America's Promise--The Alliance for \n     Youth.\n       T-FELAS will help to not only expand after-school \n     opportunities for young people, but it will also help to \n     ensure that new and existing after-school opportunities are \n     of high quality. We appreciate the emphasis placed on \n     positive youth development in your legislation, as well as \n     your inclusion of an independent evaluation and the \n     dissemination of best practices through the Federal Youth \n     Development Council. These measures will strengthen outcomes \n     for children and help to ensure that after-school programs \n     throughout the country benefit from the lessons learned by \n     the Expanded Learning and After-School Fellows.\n       First Focus is a new bipartisan advocacy organization that \n     seeks to make children and their families the first focus of \n     federal budget and policy decisions. T-FELAS is an important \n     way to do so. We are pleased to support your efforts and look \n     forward to working with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bruce Lesley,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Next Generation Youth Work\n\n\n                                                    Coalition,\n\n                                                February 16, 2007.\n     Hon.

Both of these are much \n     needed improvements that will help ensure that children and \n     youth have the supports they need to succeed.\n       The Next Generation Youth Work Coalition is a group of \n     individuals and organizations dedicated to developing a \n     strong, diverse after-school and youth development workforce \n     that is stable, prepared, supported and committed to the \n     well-being and empowerment of children and youth, and \n     particularly at-risk youth. We know the need for expanded \n     learning and positive youth development experiences in the \n     hours after school. We know the importance of developing the \n     next generation of youth workers, skilled in youth \n     development practices and viewing public service and youth \n     work as a career. Our research shows that those who chose to \n     work come from varied backgrounds but share a common belief--\n     that they can make a difference.\n       We applaud the inclusion of youth development language, \n     especially the training in youth development for the Fellows, \n     and acknowledgment of the education youth workers receive \n     through both two- and four-year institutions of higher \n     education that provide accredited coursework in youth \n     development. Furthermore, as part of the evaluation of T-\n     FELAS programs, implementing the interagency reach of the \n     Federal Youth Development Council as a place to disseminate \n     best practices will continue to move the field forward.\n       We look forward to supporting your office and the staff of \n     the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee as this \n     bill progresses towards enactment.

By offering fellowships to recent college \n     graduates who work in after-school and summer programs \n     serving Title I students, the bill would dramatically enhance \n     the quality and amount of learning opportunities available \n     for disadvantaged students. The program would result in a 25-\n     30% increase in the time students spend engaged in learning \n     and improve a wide range of developmental outcomes for youth.\n       In addition, the legislation would create a talented new \n     group of educators who specialize in motivating young people \n     to learn outside the traditional classroom. The fellows who \n     participate in the program will provide critical linkages \n     between the school day and after-school programs and become \n     dynamic future leaders in the field of education and youth \n     development.\n       Thank you so much for supporting this legislation and \n     please feel free to contact me directly at (410) 516-6221 if \n     we can provide any assistance to this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Ron Fairchild,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n     Center for Summer Learning.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 15, 2007.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing in support of the \n     Teaching Fellows for Expanded Learning and After School Act \n     of 2007. The T-FELAS Act addresses a critical need for \n     schools, communities, and working families.\n       It will dramatically strengthen after-school and expanded \n     learning time programs and make them full partners in \n     restoring the promise of educational opportunity for all \n     children.\n       Teachers in our schools are doing their best, but America's \n     traditional 6-hour school day is obsolete. Our students need \n     more learning time, more caring adults involved in their \n     learning, and more relevant, hands-on learning activities \n     that inspire and motivate them.\n       At Citizen Schools, we have seen firsthand the impact that \n     Teaching Fellows can make. Citizen Schools operates a \n     national network of after-school programs that advance \n     student achievement and mobilize adult volunteers to teach \n     hands-on apprenticeship courses. Our programs blend real-\n     world learning projects with rigorous academic and leadership \n     development activities, preparing students in the middle \n     grades for success in high school, college, the workforce, \n     and civic life. Citizen Schools currently serves 3,000 \n     students and engages 2,400 volunteers in California, \n     Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina and Texas. In \n     Massachusetts our programs operate in Boston, Lowell, Malden, \n     New Bedford, Worcester, and Springfield.\n       Citizen Schools works intensively with low-income students, \n     most of whom are struggling academically. A rigorous \n     independent evaluation has reported that Citizen Schools' \n     students significantly out-performed a matched comparison \n     group on key metrics of school success and advancement, \n     including grades and standardized test scores.\n       The Teaching Fellowship program that Citizen Schools has \n     piloted attracts dynamic, aspiring educators and community \n     builders to careers in education. In the morning our Fellows \n     support classroom teachers and in the afternoon they serve as \n     front-line teachers and team leaders at our after-school \n     programs. Teaching Fellows also have the opportunity to earn \n     a Master's Degree in Education, preparing them for careers as \n     teachers and educational leaders.\n\n[[Page S2717]]\n\n     Teaching Fellows have been the crucial factor in delivering \n     powerful results for our students.\n       The T-FELAS Act will advance the achievement of our \n     neediest students and open new horizons of opportunity to \n     them. Thank you so much for your leadership in introducing \n     the T-FELAS Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Eric Schwarz,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Save the Children,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2007.\n     Hon.

We know the \n     difference these activities make in their lives. Students in \n     our programs are not only safe during the critical hours from \n     3 to 6 p.m.; they are also doing better in school. Evaluation \n     results from the past three school years found that our \n     literacy program is improving the reading levels of regular \n     participants. Fifty-four percent of the children \n     participating made gains in reading proficiency greater than \n     would be expected if they were just attending school.\n       We also know first-hand the difficulties of recruiting and \n     retaining trained, dynamic staff. The T-FELAS Act will assist \n     the caring individuals working with high-need children in \n     rural communities improve their qualifications by enabling \n     them to pursue an undergraduate or graduate level degree in \n     education, expanding their opportunities to in public \n     education and youth development programs.\n       We look forward to working with you and the staff of the \n     Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee as this bill \n     progresses towards enactment. Please do not hesitate to \n     contact us if we can be of any assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Mark K.

As a \n     provider of high quality after school enrichment I would love \n     to see more awareness of the opportunity for extended \n     learning time and the strides that organizations such as ours \n     have made in the field.

Richard Burr,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy and Senator Burr: The National \n     Institute on Out-of-School Time is writing to express its \n     support of the Teaching Fellow for Expanded Learning and \n     After-School (T-FELAS) Act.\n       T-FELAS will help ease the difficulty of recruiting and \n     paying new educators and leaders for high need schools and \n     afterschool programs. NIOST is actively involved in \n     developing increased educational opportunities for people who \n     choose afterschool as their profession and is excited about \n     how T-FELAS will also increase the viability of afterschool \n     as a professional career. Talented front-line educators are \n     needed to serve in expanded learning and after-school \n     environments to help students meet the ever-increasing \n     challenges of the real world.\n       T-FELAS will encourage and enable qualified people \n     interested in teaching and afterschool to spend time learning \n     in the field while completing their own education. The \n     funding of dynamic Teaching Fellows to administer and improve \n     expanded-day programs and to also assist teachers during the \n     school day is a great plan. Research indicates that \n     relationships between school and afterschool staff can \n     contribute to positive academic and developmental outcomes \n     for youth. The Teaching Fellows have the potential of playing \n     an important role in supporting those relationships.\n       The National Institute on Out-of-School Time looks forward \n     to watching this bill as it progresses towards enactment. \n     Please do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of any \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Ellen Gannett,\n\n                               Director, The National Institute on\n     Out-of-School Time.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Search Institute,\n                                                February 14, 2007.\n     Senator Edward Kennedy,\n     317 Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy: I am writing to express my strong \n     support for the Teaching Fellows for Expanded Learning and \n     After-School Act. This bill, fondly known as T-FELAS, is an \n     exciting proposal that will recruit, train and place Fellows \n     in expanded learning and after-school environments.\n       I am particularly gratified to see that the bill ensures \n     that each Fellow will be provided with training on the power \n     of positive relationships and the value of developmental \n     assets. This is so important! Research has consistently shown \n     that increased developmental assets promote academic success, \n     divert youth from risky behavior and give young people the \n     strengths they need to make positive choices in life.\n       I assure you that providing the Fellows with training in \n     positive youth development and the 40 Developmental Assets \n     will have a dramatic and profound impact on their ability to \n     serve the youth under their care. When Fellows develop \n     sustained, strength-based relationships with children and \n     adolescents, these after-school and summer hours will produce \n     all the positive outcomes we hope to see from our students.\n       Again, thank you for your service and your efforts to \n     ensure that all youth have an opportunity to thrive!\n           Best regards,\n                                              Peter Benson, Ph.D.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Policy Studies Associates, Inc.,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 15, 2007.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, HELP Committee, Hart Senate Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing in support of your bill \n     to amend ESEA Title II to create the Expanded Learning and \n     After-School Fellows program.\n       I direct evaluations of large-scale after-school programs \n     in many locations, including Boston, New York City, statewide \n     in New Jersey, and rural America (as sponsored by Save the \n     Children). Our studies have consistently shown the value to \n     youth of staffing these programs with well-educated \n     individuals who have four-year college degrees. Such \n     individuals bring an understanding of the learning process \n     plus an enriched store of background knowledge. Because they \n     have completed a college education, they understand its value \n     and can communicate high standards and the value of hard work \n     to the youth with whom they work.\n       In one example, from a 2004 multi-year evaluation of \n     programs in New York City sponsored by The After-School \n     Corporation (TASC), I wrote: In sites where at least 25 \n     percent of project staff had a four-year college degree, \n     participants had more positive changes in test scores than in \n     TASC sites with a lower proportion of staff members with such \n     degrees (effect size of 0.14 in math and 0.13 in reading). \n     Staff with college degrees may be better able to see and to \n     exploit the varied learning opportunities embedded within \n     themes and topics adopted by after-school projects.\n       You or your staff should call on me at any time if I can be \n     helpful with regard to this bill. I can be reached at (202) \n     939-5323 and at ereisner@policystudies.com.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Elizabeth R.

Edward M. Kennedy,\n     317 Russell Senate Office Building\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The Forum for Youth Investment is \n     writing to express its support of the Teaching Fellows for \n     Expanded Learning and After-School (T-FELAS) Act.\n       T-FELAS will establish a new service teacher corps and \n     expand learning and enrichment opportunities targeted towards \n     the hours after the school day ends. Both of these are much \n     needed improvements that will help ensure that children and \n     youth have the supports they need to succeed.\n       The Forum for Youth Investment is committed to ensuring all \n     young people are Ready by 21TM--ready for college, \n     work and life. We know the need for expanded learning and \n     positive youth development experiences in the hours after \n     school. We know the importance of developing the next \n     generation of youth workers, skilled in youth development \n     practices and viewing public service and youth work as a \n     career. Our research shows that those who chose to work come \n     from varied backgrounds but share a common belief--that they \n     can make a difference.\n       We applaud the inclusion of youth development language, \n     especially the training in youth development for the Fellows, \n     and acknowledgment of the education youth workers receive \n     through both two- and four-year institutions of higher \n     education that provide accredited coursework in youth \n     development. Furthermore, as part of the evaluation of T-\n     FELAS programs, implementing the interagency reach of the \n     Federal Youth Development Council as a place to disseminate \n     best practices will continue to move the field forward.\n       We look forward to supporting your office and the staff of \n     the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee as this \n     bill progresses towards enactment.

A bill to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community \nSelf-Determination Act of 2000; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a one year only \nreauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\nDetermination Act.\n  For the last six years, this Act has provided critical funding to our \nrural schools and counties and has built collaboration on the ground \nthrough the accomplishments of the Resource Advisory Committees.\n  Unfortunately Congress has not been able to reauthorize P.L. 106-393 \nand I do not feel the schools and counties should become victims while \nwe in Congress negotiate a path forward.\n  Thus, I am introducing this bill today and will work to include it in \nany legislation that is being considered by the Senate.\n  The Act has been an enormous success in achieving and even surpassing \nthe goals of Congress. This Act has restored programs for students in \nrural schools and prevented the closure of numerous isolated rural \nschools. It has been a primary funding mechanism to provide rural \nschool students with educational opportunities comparable to suburban \nand urban students. Over 4,400 rural schools receive funds because of \nthis Act.\n  Next, the Act has allowed rural county road districts and county road \ndepartments to address the severe maintenance backlog. Snow removal has \nbeen restored for citizens, tourists, and school buses. Bridges have \nbeen upgraded and replaced and culverts that are hazardous to fish \npassage have been upgraded and replaced.\n  In addition, over 70 Resource Advisory Committees, or RACs have been \nformed. These RAC's cover our largest 150 forest counties. Nationally \nthese 15-person diverse RAC stakeholder committees have studied and \napproved over 2,500 projects on Federal forestlands and adjacent public \nand private lands. These projects have addressed a wide variety of \nimprovements drastically needed on our National Forests. Projects have \nincluded fuels reduction, habitat improvement, watershed restoration, \nroad maintenance and rehabilitation, reforestation, campground and \ntrail improvement, and noxious weed eradication.\n  The accomplishments of this Act over the last few years are positive \nand substantial. This law should be extended so it can continue to \nbenefit the forest counties, their schools, and continue to contribute \nto improving the health of our National Forests.\n  If we do not work to reauthorize this Act, all of the progress of the \nlast six years will be lost. Schools in timber dependant communities \nwill lose a substantial part of their funding. These school districts \nwill have to start making tough budget decisions such as keeping or \ncanceling after school programs, sports programs, music programs, and \ntrying to determine what is the basic educational needs of our \nchildren. Next, counties will have to reprioritize road maintenance so \nthat only the essential services of the county are met because that is \nall they will be able to afford.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 783. A bill to adjust the boundary of the Barataria Preserve Unit \nof the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve in the State \nof Louisiana, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to re-\nintroduce--with some changes--a bill that I first introduced on April \n6, 2004, in the 108th Congress and which I reintroduced in the 109th \nCongress. This bill will transfer 3,083 acres of Federal land to the \nBarataria Preserve Unit of the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park, \nand authorize the Park to purchase up to 821 acres of neighboring \nprivate lands from willing sellers. The lands in question contain \nimportant freshwater wetlands, and would allow the park boundary to \nconform to existing waterways and levee corridors.\n  As of today, the Senate has twice passed--once in the 108th Congress \nand once in the 109th Congress--a form of this bill by unanimous \nconsent. I trust that few will find anything too objectionable about \nthese provisions in the 110th Congress either. After all, it simply \nplaces lands that are already under Federal control under the \nmanagement authority of the National Park Service, which already \nmanages neighboring lands and helps protect their environmental, \ncultural and historic integrity.\n  The first major tract in question is the Bayou aux Carpes wetlands, \nwhich were acquired by the Justice Department in 1996 as a result of \nthe settlement of a lawsuit. Although the National Park Service has \nconstructive possession of the deeds, it lacks legal management \nauthority. The area has exemplary natural resource values and has been \ndesignated by the Environmental Protection Agency as a wetland of \nsignificant value. Most importantly, because of the hydrologic \nconnection between the two areas, the environmental health of the Jean \nLafitte Park's Barataria Preserve is dependent on the continued health \nof the Bayou aux Carpes.\n  The second major tract is the Bayou Segnette wetlands, which are \npresently managed by the Army Corps of Engineers. The inclusion of this \narea in the Barataria Unit will allow for better control over water \nentering the park from outside sources.\n  My bill also authorizes the acquisition, from willing sellers, of \napproximately 821 acres of privately owned lands which are adjacent to \nthe park. Approximately half of this area is designated as \njurisdictional wetlands, with limited access and no potential for \ndevelopment. All of this land has been included within the boundary at \nthe request of the owners. This provision was also included in the \nearlier versions of this bill that were passed in the 108th and 109th \nCongresses.\n  Lastly, allow me to explain what is new about this bill: this bill \nalso authorizes the Jean Lafitte National Historic Park and Preserve to \nacquire the Fleming-Berthoud Plantation--previously known as the Mavis \nGrove Plantation. This plantation is one of the southernmost early \nsugar plantations and surrounds a prehistoric Indian mound and historic \ncemetery on the edge of the bayou, which is one of the most scenic and \nmost photographed cemeteries around New Orleans. Recently, it was \nhighlighted in the recent Cabildo exhibition and book on historic \ncemeteries of New Orleans.\n  The original plantation contained more than 10,000 acres and was a \nlarge sugar plantation. After floods destroyed area sugar plantations \nin the 19th century, this was turned into one of the larger cypress \ntree lumbering plantations. The Berthoud family bought it in the late \n19th century and the Fleming family bought it in the early 20th \ncentury.\n  The 1,000-year-old prehistoric Indian mound and historic above-ground \ntombstone cemetery are relatively well preserved and have been twice \ndeclared eligible for the National Register of Historic Places by state \nofficials; though no action has yet been taken on that designation.\n  Currently, many of the historic plantation structures are unrestored, \nvacant and in poor condition. But the main plantation house remains in \ngood condition. I have been told that it was photographed for the cover \nof National Geographic Magazine in the 1930s and has been the setting \nfor close to 10 Hollywood movies.\n  The other buildings include a 75-foot, 175-year-old brick sugar \nrefining chimney, in relatively good condition; an overseer's Creole \nstyle cottage from the mid 1800s cited by historians as a fine early \nexample of island architecture; a 19th Century annex building connected \nto the original plantation house, now in poor condition; a 1920s house \nbuilt on the original sugar refinery foundations; an early blacksmith \nshop and several other barns and buildings, most in poor condition.\n  My bill will authorize the National Park Service to acquire this land \nfrom the family, who I am told support the transaction and the \nrestoration of the land and buildings. I am also told that historic \npreservation organizations may step forward to provide private funding \nin support of the National Park Service's acquisition of the land.\n\n[[Page S2719]]\n\n  In all, I think that this bill marks an important day for Louisiana. \nWe are authorizing the management and preservation of several \necological, cultural and historic gems. I hope that my colleagues will \nfully support this endeavor as they have in the past.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 783\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 4 of the United States Code to limit \nthe extent to which States may tax the compensation earned by \nnonresident telecommuters; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today, together with my colleague \nSenator Lieberman, to introduce the Telecommuter Tax Fairness Act of \n2007.\n  The Telecommuter Tax Fairness Act of 2007 will end an outdated legal \ndoctrine that unfairly penalizes thousands of workers in Connecticut \nand across the country whose only offense is that they sometimes work \nfrom home.\n  Technology continues to transform the way business is conducted in \nAmerica and all over the world. Telecommunications advances such as \ncell phones, email, the Internet, and mobile networking have not only \nmade Americans more productive, they have also given people greater \nflexibility in where they can work without compromising productivity. \nAs a result, more Americans now have the freedom to work from home or \nother alternative offices when their physical presence is not required \nat their primary place of work.\n  This option to telecommute offers tremendous benefits for businesses, \nfamilies, and communities. It helps employers lower costs and raise \nworker productivity, and individuals better manage the demands of work \nand family. It also reduces congestion on our roads and rails, and in \nso doing, lowers pollution.\n  Despite the many benefits of telecommuting, some states continue to \nmaintain and enforce outdated laws that unfairly penalize people who \nchoose to work from home. New York, in particular, has been among the \nmost aggressive.\n  Under its so-called ``convenience of the employer'' rule, New York \nrequires out-of-State residents who work for an employer in New York to \npay New York taxes on income earned outside the State, even if the \nState in which the employee is physically present also applies tax to \nthe same income. New York only allows exceptions for cases of \n``necessity,'' as opposed to ``convenience,'' and the State has \ndetermined that telecommuting falls into the latter, taxable category. \nWhile there are several States that have ``convenience of the \nemployer'' rules, no other State applies it with the same rigor as New \nYork.\n  Under this rule, if a Connecticut resident who normally works in New \nYork--as thousands of Connecticut residents do--chooses to work from \nhome some days, New York forces her to pay taxes for income earned on \nthose days not only to Connecticut, the state in which she is \nphysically present, but also to New York. This rule unfairly subjects \nthe many workers who telecommute from their homes or other sites \noutside of New York to a double tax on the part of their income earned \nfrom home.\n  According to Connecticut's attorney general, thousands of Connecticut \nresidents alone are affected by this unfair double taxation. However, \nit isn't only Connecticut residents who are at risk.\n  Thomas Huckaby is a Tennessee-based computer programmer that \ntelecommuted for a firm in Queens, New York. In 1994 and 1995, Mr. \nHuckaby spent 75 percent of his time working in Tennessee and the \nremaining 25 percent working in the Queens office and attempted to \napportion his income accordingly. New York, however, sought to tax 100 \npercent of his income and was successful due to its ``convenience of \nemployer'' rule. On March 29, 2005, the New York Court of Appeals \nupheld New York's rule in a 4 to 3 decision. The Supreme Court declined \nto hear his appeal.\n  A similar story involves Arthur Gray, a New Hampshire resident who \nworked for the New York office of Cowen & Co. as an investment \ncounselor from 1976 through 1996 and paid New York state income taxes \nduring that time. In 1997, Arthur Gray, per his employer's request, \nopened and managed an office from his home in New Hampshire. Several \ntimes during the year, Mr. Gray worked in New York, but most of his \ndays were spent in New Hampshire. When paying his taxes during this \ntime, he paid New York state income taxes for the days he was in New \nYork, but not for the days he worked in New Hampshire. New York, \nhowever, sought to tax 100 percent of his income and was successful due \nto its ``convenience of the employer'' rule.\n  These are only two examples of the far-reaching consequences of this \n``convenience of employer'' rule. There are thousands of individuals \nacross the country who are adversely impacted by this rule. Most, \nhowever, lack the time, money, or energy to take their case to court.\n  This potential for double taxation is not only unfair, it also \ndiscourages people from telecommuting when we should be doing the \nopposite.\n  Legislation is needed to protect these honest workers who deserve \nfair and equitable treatment under the law. The Telecommuter Tax \nFairness Act of 2005 accomplishes this by specifically preventing a \nState from engaging in the current fiction of deeming a nonresident to \nbe in the taxing state when the nonresident is actually working in \nanother state. In doing so, it will eliminate the possibility that \ncitizens will be double-taxed when telecommuting.\n  Establishing a ``physical presence'' test--as this legislation does--\nis the most logical basis for determining tax status. If a worker is in \na State, and taking advantage of that State's infrastructure, the \nworker should pay taxes in that State.\n  Some suggest that the double-taxation quandary can easily be fixed by\n\n[[Page S2721]]\n\nhaving other States provide a tax credit to those telecommuters. \nHowever, why should Connecticut, or any other State, be required to \nallow a credit on income actually earned in the State? If a worker is \nworking in Connecticut, he or she is benefiting from a range of \nservices paid for and maintained by Connecticut, including roads, \nwater, police, fire protection, and communications services. It's only \nfair that Connecticut ask that worker to help support the services that \nhe or she uses.\n  This is not just an issue that deals with a small group of citizens \nfrom one small state.\n  Rather, this is an issue that affects workers all over the country. \nIt will only grow more pressing as people and businesses continue to \nseek to take advantage of new technologies that influence the way we \nlive and work.\n  I hope our colleagues will favorably consider this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 785\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to \nfoster efficient markets and increase competition and transparency \namong packers that purchased livestock from producers; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator Feingold and I have in the past \nsponsored the Transparency for Independent Livestock Producers Act, or \nwhat we have generally referred to as the ``Transparency Act.'' Today \nwe are once again working together in a bipartisan fashion to \nreintroduce this important legislation.\n  My sponsorship of the packer ban this Congress is based on the belief \nthat independent producers should have the opportunity to receive a \nfair price for their livestock. Over the years we have seen widespread \nconsolidation and concentration in the packing industry. Add on the \ntrend toward vertical integration among packers and there is no \nquestion why independent producers are losing the opportunity to market \ntheir own livestock during profitable cycles in the live meat markets.\n  The past CEO of a major packer in 1994 explained that the reason \npackers own livestock is that when the price is high the packers use \ntheir own livestock for the lines and when the price is low the packers \nbuy livestock. This means that independent producers are most likely \nbeing limited from participating in the most profitable ranges of the \nlive market. This is not good for the survival of the independent \nproducer.\n  This bipartisan legislation would guarantee that independent \nproducers have a share in the marketplace while assisting the Mandatory \nPrice Reporting system. The proposal would require that 25 percent of a \npacker's daily kill comes from the spot market.\n  By requiring a 25 percent spot market purchase daily, the mandatory \nprice reporting system, which has been criticized due to reporting and \naccuracy problems, would have consistent, reliable numbers being \npurchased from the spot market, improving the accuracy and transparency \nof daily prices. In addition, independent livestock producers would be \nguaranteed a competitive position due to the packers need to fill the \ndaily 25 percent spot/cash market requirement.\n  The packers required to comply would be the same packers required to \nreport under the Mandatory Price Reporting system. Those are packs that \nkill either 125,000 head of cattle, 100,000 head of hogs, or 75,000 \nlambs annually, over a 5 year average.\n  Packers are arguing that this will hurt their ability to offer \ncontracts to producers, but the fact of the matter is that the majority \nof livestock contracts pay out on a calculation incorporating Mandatory \nPrice Reporting data. If the Mandatory Price Reporting data is not \naccurate, or open to possible manipulation because of low numbers on \nthe spot market, contracts are not beneficial tools for producers to \nmanage their risk. This legislative proposal will hopefully give \nconfidence to independent livestock producers by improving the accuracy \nand viability of the Mandatory Price reporting system and secure fair \nprices for contracts based on that data.\n  It's just common sense, when there aren't a lot of cattle and pigs \nbeing purchased on the cash market, it's easier for the Mandatory Price \nreporting data to be inaccurate or manipulated. The majority of \nlivestock production contracts are based on that data, so if that \ninformation is wrong, the contract producers suffer.\n  This legislation will guarantee independent livestock producers \nmarket access and a fair price. It will accomplish these goals by \nmaking it more\n\n[[Page S2722]]\n\ndifficult for the Mandatory Price Reporting System to be manipulated \nbecause of low numbers being reported by the packs. The Transparency \nAct is crucial legislation to guarantee livestock producers receive a \nfair shake at the farm gate and I am looking forward to working on this \nlegislation in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 786\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 96\n\n       Whereas Harriett Woods, a native of Cleveland, Ohio, \n     launched a 50-year political career with a neighborhood \n     crusade against rattling potholes;\n       Whereas Harriett Woods, who died of leukemia at the age of \n     79 on February 8, 2007, had many firsts, including being the \n     first female editor for her college newspaper at the \n     University of Michigan, the first woman on the Missouri \n     Transportation Commission, and the first woman to win \n     statewide office in the State of Missouri as Lieutenant \n     Governor;\n       Whereas, from 1991 to 1995, Harriett Woods served as \n     president of the National Women's Political Caucus, a \n     bipartisan grassroots organization whose mission is to \n     increase women's participation in the political process at \n     all levels of government; and\n       Whereas Harriett Woods was integral to the electoral \n     successes of what became known as the Year of the Woman, when \n     in 1992, female candidates won 19 seats in the House of \n     Representatives and 3 seats in the Senate: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that Harriett \n     Woods will be remembered as a pioneer in women's politics, \n     whose actions and leadership inspired hundreds of women \n     nationwide to participate in the political process and to \n     break gender barriers at every level of government.\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, today I am proud to submit as my first \npiece of legislation as a United States Senator, a resolution to honor \nthe memory of a great woman and a great leader--Harriett Woods.\n  It is also a privilege to submit this resolution with Senators Bond, \nMikulski, Clinton, Cantwell, Murray, Stabenow, Lincoln, Boxer, \nFeinstein, Klobuchar, Bingaman, Levin, Obama, Harkin, and Dodd. \n  Harriett, who died last month at the age of 79 from leukemia, had \nmany firsts in her rich life: she was the first female editor of her \ncollege newspaper at the University of Michigan. She was the first \nwoman on the Missouri Transportation Commission and she was the first \nwoman to win statewide office in the State of Missouri when she was \nelected Lieutenant Governor.\n  But Harriett's career in public service only tells part of the story. \nHarriett was a born leader and she used it to inspire hundreds of women \nacross the country to get involved at all levels of government. For 5 \nyears, she served as president of the National Women's Political \nCaucus, a bipartisan grassroots organization whose mission is to \nincrease women's participation in the political process.\n  Her struggle to win a U.S. Senate seat in 1982 against Senator John \nDanforth was the inspiration to the founders of Emily's List, which is \ndedicated to recruiting and funding viable women candidates. Many \nthought that Harriett could have won that race, which she lost by a \nscant 27,247 votes, had she not run out of money.\n  Harriett was also integral to what became known as the Year of the \nWoman, when in 1992, female candidates won nineteen seats in the United \nStates House of Representatives and three seats in the United States \nSenate.\n  Harriett realized 25 years ago, before most women even considered the \nnotion, that there was only one way women were going to take their seat \nat the table of political power in our great Nation: by daring to fail, \nby embracing breathtaking risk, and by standing up to the bouncer at \nthe door of the back room filled with the good old boys who ran for \noffice. When that bouncer told Harriett that she could not come in, she \nsaid, just watch me.\n  And when that same bouncer tried to kick her out of the room, she \nsaid just try it. And after she was comfortable in that room, she \ndidn't sit down. She went out and found other women and led them to \nthat room by pure unadulterated leadership.\n  Harriett wrote a wonderful book about her life as a national \npolitical leader. She closed the book with the following:\n\n       Somewhere, at this very moment, in some neighborhood in \n     America, a woman very like my younger self is confronting a \n     problem that affects her life, and family. Perhaps it's the \n     need for a playground for her children; maybe it's a threat \n     to clean water from rural animal waste. She has spoken up, \n     but no one is willing to take action. She's never been a \n     public person, and famous woman senators seem a world away. \n     Still, she cares deeply about finding a solution. After \n     agonizing thought, she makes a crucial decision.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM OF IRAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad refuses to \n     abandon the uranium enrichment program of the Government of \n     Iran, and continues to work towards advancing that program.\n       (2) The United Nations Security Council unanimously passed \n     Security Council Resolution 1737 on December 23, 2006, which \n     imposed sanctions on trade and expertise related to the \n     nuclear infrastructure of Iran and the transfer to Iran of \n     International Atomic Energy Agency technical aid.\n       (3) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737 (2006) \n     states that if Iran refuses to comply with the Resolution \n     within 60 days, the Security Council ``shall adopt further \n     appropriate measures under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the \n     Charter of the United Nations to persuade Iran to comply with \n     this resolution and the requirements of the IAEA, and \n     underlines that further decisions will be required should \n     such additional measures be necessary''.\n       (4) According to a report issued by the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency on February 21, 2007, Iran failed to \n     comply with United Nations Resolution 1737 within 60 days.\n       (5) The refusal of the Government of Iran to comply with \n     International Atomic Energy Agency orders to prove the \n     peaceful intent of its nuclear program and with United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1737 (2006) indicates \n     that the efforts of the Government of Iran toward uranium \n     enrichment are not for peaceful means.\n       (6) The Government of Iran has contributed to instability \n     in the Middle East and has shown itself unwilling to use its \n     influence to support peaceful transformation in the region, \n     including through the following actions:\n       (A) The Government of Iran has demonstrated its ability to \n     strike United States military forces and allies in the Middle \n     East with missiles.\n       (B) Weapons produced in Iran have moved into Iraq and other \n     countries in the region in support of violent religious \n     extremism, a practice which the Government of Iran is either \n     incapable or unwilling to stop.\n       (C) President Ahmadinejad continues to assert that Israel \n     will be ``wiped off the map'' and consistently denies the \n     existence of the holocaust, as evidenced through hosting an \n     ``International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the \n     Holocaust'' on December 11, 2006.\n       (7) John Michael McConnell, Director of National \n     Intelligence, indicated in a hearing of the Committee on \n     Armed Services of the Senate on February 27, 2007, that \n     economic sanctions on Iran uniformly applied by the \n     international community could have a major effect on the \n     economy of Iran.\n       (8) The placement and implementation of sanctions on \n     countries such as North Korea and Libya have made progress in \n     bringing about change.\n       (9) Despite the release of an internal European Union \n     document dated February 7, 2007, which indicated that \n     European Union officials believe that preventing Iran from \n     developing a nuclear weapon is not likely, on February 12, \n     2007 the European Union agreed, in compliance with United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1737 (2006), to impose \n     limited sanctions on Iran in order to prevent the sale of \n     materials and technology that could be used in Iran's nuclear \n     program.\n       (10) Full economic sanctions on the part of the entire \n     international community have not been applied to Iran.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the nuclear program of the Government of Iran continues \n     to be of grave concern and should be considered a serious \n     threat to the United States and its military forces and \n     personnel in the Middle East, and to United States allies and \n     interests in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia;\n       (2) as a result of the failure of Iran to comply with \n     United Nations Security Resolution 1737 (2006), the United \n     Nations Security Council should implement additional \n     sanctions in order to persuade Iran to comply with \n     requirements imposed by the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency;\n       (3) full economic sanctions, uniformly imposed by the \n     entire international community, including Russia and China, \n     offer the best opportunity to bring about significant change \n     in Iran to prevent the development of a nuclear weapon in \n     Iran; and\n       (4) the elimination of the threat of a nuclear Iran is in \n     the long term interest of the people of Iran, the region, and \n     the world.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 361.
