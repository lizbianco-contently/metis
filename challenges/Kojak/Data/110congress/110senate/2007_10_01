Freedom of speech is one of the country's most cherished \nvalues. Nothing sets us farther apart from the countries and regimes we \noppose than our belief that everyone's opinion matters--everyone's--and \nthat everyone has a right to express it. That is why when we hear \nthings on the radio and other places that are offensive, by and large \nwe tolerate them. But last week Rush Limbaugh went way over the line. \nWhile I respect his right to say anything he likes, his unpatriotic \ncomments cannot be ignored. During his show last Wednesday, Limbaugh \nwas engaged in one of his typical rants. This one was unremarkable and \nindistinguishable from his usual dribble which has been steadily losing \nlisteners for years, until he crossed that line by calling our men and \nwomen in uniform who oppose the war in Iraq ``phony soldiers.'' This \ncomment was so beyond the pale of decency we can't leave it alone. Yet \nhe followed it up with denials and an attack on Congressman Jack \nMurtha, who was a 37-year active member of the Marine Corps, a combat \nveteran.\n  We have been debating the Iraq war in the Senate and throughout the \ncountry, not for months but for years. There are good, patriotic \nAmericans who favor the war and good, patriotic Americans who oppose \nPresident\n\n[[Page S12344]]\n\nBush's first getting us into war and the way he has handled the war. \nNeither party holds a patent on patriotism. I know all of my Republican \ncolleagues would agree with this, or at least I hope so. Yet Rush \nLimbaugh took it upon himself to attack the courage and character of \nthose fighting and dying for him and for all of us. Rush Limbaugh got \nhimself a deferment from serving when he was a young man. He never \nserved in uniform. He never saw a person in the extreme difficulty of \nmaintaining peace in a foreign country engaged in civil war. He never \nsaw a person in combat. Yet he thinks his opinion on the war is worth \nmore than those who have been on the front lines. What is worse, \nLimbaugh's show is broadcast on Armed Forces Radio which means that \nthousands of troops overseas and veterans here at home were forced to \nhear this attack on their patriotism. Rush Limbaugh owes the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces an apology.\n  This past Friday, many Democrats joined me in drafting a letter to \nthe chief executive officer of Clear Channel, Mark Mays, that we will \nsend out this week. Here is what we wrote:\n\n       Dear Mr. Mays, At the time we sign this letter, 3,801 \n     American soldiers have been killed in Iraq, and another \n     27,936 have been wounded. 160,000 others awoke this morning \n     on foreign sand, far from home, to face the danger and \n     uncertainty of another day at war. Although Americans of \n     goodwill debate the merits of this war, we can all agree that \n     those who serve with such great courage deserve our deepest \n     respect and gratitude. That is why Rush Limbaugh's recent \n     characterization of troops who oppose the war as ``phony \n     soldiers'' is such an outrage. Our troops are fighting and \n     dying to bring to others the freedoms that many take for \n     granted. It is unconscionable that Mr. Limbaugh would \n     criticize them for exercising the fundamentally American \n     right to free speech. Mr. Limbaugh has made outrageous \n     remarks before, but this affront to our soldiers is beyond \n     the pale. The military, like any community within the United \n     States, includes members both for and against the war. Senior \n     generals, such as General John Batiste and Paul Eaton, have \n     come out against the war while others have publicly supported \n     it. A December 2006 poll conducted by the Military Times \n     found just 35 percent of service members approved of \n     President Bush's handling of the war in Iraq, compared to 42 \n     percent who disapproved. From this figure alone, it is clear \n     that Mr. Limbaugh's insult is directed at thousands of \n     American service members. Active and retired members of our \n     armed forces have a unique perspective on the war and offer a \n     valuable contribution to our national debate. In August, \n     seven soldiers wrote an op-ed expressing their concern with \n     the current strategy in Iraq. Tragically, since then, two of \n     those seven soldiers have made the ultimate sacrifice in \n     Iraq. Thousands of active troops and veterans were subjected \n     to Mr. Limbaugh's unpatriotic and indefensible comments on \n     your broadcast. We trust you will agree that not a single one \n     of our sons, daughters, neighbors and friends serving \n     overseas is a ``phony soldier.'' We call on you to publicly \n     repudiate these comments that call into question their \n     service and sacrifice and to ask Mr. Limbaugh to apologize \n     for his comments.\n\n  Just as patriotism is the exclusive realm of neither party, taking a \nstand against those who spew hate and impugn the integrity of our \ntroops is a job that belongs to both parties. I can't help but wonder \nhow my Republican colleagues would have reacted if the tables were \nturned--if a well-known Democratic radio personality had used the same \ninsulting line of attack against troops who support the war. The letter \nI read will be available on the Senate floor all day. During the votes, \nafter the votes, colleagues on both sides of the aisle will have every \nchance to add their names to it. I encourage all to do so. If we take \nthe Republican side at their word that last week's vote on another \ncontroversial statement related to the war was truly about patriotism, \nnot politics, then I have no doubt they will stand with us against \nLimbaugh's comments with equal fervor.\n  I am confident we will see Republicans join with us in overwhelming \nnumbers. ``Confident'' is the wrong word. ``Hopeful'' is the right \nword. I am hopeful we will see Republicans join with us in overwhelming \nnumbers. Anything less would be a double standard that has no place in \nthe Senate.\n  I ask my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to join together \nagainst this irresponsible, hateful, and unpatriotic attack by calling \nupon Rush Limbaugh to give our troops the apology they deserve. I hope \nall will sign this letter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12344-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as cochairman of the Senate Caucus on \nInternational Narcotics Control, I have had a distinct interest in the \nNational Youth Antidrug Media Campaign and how we can improve its \nquality and improve its effectiveness. In 1998, the White House Office \nof National Drug Control Policy, with overwhelming bipartisan support \nfrom Congress, launched a historic initiative to encourage kids to stay \ndrug free. That effort in 1998 built upon the success of former First \nLady Nancy Reagan's ``just say no'' campaign. The National Youth \nAntidrug Media Campaign targets youths age 9 to 18. The campaign also \ntargets parents and other adults who might have influence over the \nchoices young people make about drugs.\n  Research has clearly shown that if we can keep children free from \ndrugs until the age of 20, chances are very slim that they will ever \ntry or become addicted to drugs. Maintaining a coherent antidrug \nmessage begins early in adolescence and continues throughout the \ngrowing years. This is essential for educating and enabling our young \npeople to reject illegal drugs. Through realistic portrayals, the media \ncampaign is designed to show kids the harmful effects of drugs and the \nbenefits of a drug-free lifestyle.\n  I wish to call my colleagues' attention to the poster behind me. This \nis one of those famous antidrug advertisements that maybe they remember \nfrom a long time ago. They might recall this famous advertisement known \nfor its unforgettable slogan: ``This is your brain; this is your brain \non drugs.'' Created by the Partnership for a Drug Free America in 1987, \nit is widely recognized as one of the known influential ads of all \ntime. While most of us have probably never seen an actual brain on \ndrugs, this commercial helped to shape the view of an entire generation \nregarding the dangers of drugs.\n\n  The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign is without a doubt the \nsingle most visible symbol of the Federal Government's commitment to \nyouth drug prevention. These advertisements are an important source of \ninformation for kids and parents about the risks and dangers associated \nwith illegal drugs. Sadly, though, we have come a long way from the \ncost and success of those early ads, such as the one you see on the \neasel.\n  In the 10 years prior to the creation of the media campaign in 1998, \nthe Partnership for a Drug-free America was able to secure grants from \nvarious businesses, foundations, and agencies to create over 1,000 ads. \nIncluded in that number is the famous ``this is your brain on drugs'' \nad which ran in 90 percent of America's households every day.\n  Between 1987 and 1998, national and local media outlets donated over \n$2.3 billion worth of free advertising space. If you adjust that number \nfor today's pricetag, that would be nearly $3 billion worth of donated \nmedia time. Unfortunately, as drug use began to decline, then, as you \nmight expect, so did the generous donations of free air time. By 1998, \nCongress decided--since it was not going to be free--to fund a paid \nmedia campaign employing the partnership's antidrug messages.\n  Since that time, the Federal Government has spent well over $1.5 \nbillion to create, to research, to produce, and to distribute ads to \nprevent teen drug use. Yet I fear we are continuing to spend precious \nantidrug dollars to fund increasingly mediocre ads that fail to \neffectively reach our Nation's youth. In other words, they are nothing \nlike the brain being fried ad I told you about.\n\n[[Page S12345]]\n\n  A case in point are the spots running on TV today. The image you can \nsee in this new ad I have before us in the Chamber is entitled ``Walk \nYourself'' from the ``Above the Influence'' campaign. For those who \nmight not be familiar with this ad, I will give a quick synopsis of \nwhat this ad says.\n  The commercial--which looks as though it could have been drawn by a \n5-year-old--begins with a man smoking a marijuana cigarette while his \ndog looks on. When the man notices that his dog wants to go for a walk, \nhe tells his dog to walk himself, presumably because he is too busy \ngetting high. The dog responds, telling him he is disappointed in his \nmaster. The ad ends with the dog leaving and raising an ``Above the \nInfluence'' flag.\n  Now, maybe I am missing the point, but I fail to see how an ad such \nas this realistically portrays the dangers or harmful effects of doing \ndrugs.\n  We have a moral obligation in this country to ensure our young people \nhave a chance to grow up without being accosted with drug pushers at \nevery turn. We need, as a country, to create a strong moral context to \nhelp our young people know how to make the right choices. They need to \nknow how to say no. They need to know that saying no is OK. And they \nneed to know that saying no to drugs is the right thing to do. It is \nnot just the safe thing, it is not just the healthier thing, it happens \nto be the right thing.\n  While funding for the media campaign has been relatively modest in \nterms of our overall Federal drug control budget, it, for many, is the \nmost visible aspect of our Nation's war on drugs. With only so much \nmoney to go around, we must ensure we are getting the most bang for our \nbuck. Although I support and encourage any agency that works to reduce \nor prevent drug abuse, as Members of Congress it is important we be \ngood stewards of the taxpayers' dollars.\n  So I refer you to the Weiden-Kennedy chart--and I am not referring to \nSenator Wyden or Senator Kennedy. This is a different Weiden and a \ndifferent Kennedy. We have had numerous studies over the years as to \nhow the effectiveness of the present media campaign is very minimal, if \nnot nonexistent.\n  In last year's Weiden-Kennedy test results of teenagers, the flags \nads I referred to in the previous chart, as these ads are called--they \nare called ``flags ads''--were rated on their believability, \npersuasiveness, and honesty. When you add up the averages of the flags \nads with the rest of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America ads, the \nflags ads perform well under the ratings of the previous ads. I think \nthe most important categories an antidrug ad must deliver on would be \nthe ones you see listed on this chart. That is why I am concerned the \nmedia campaign is failing to reach and deliver an important message to \nour teens.\n  Now, I would like to refer back to the funding because these are \ntaxpayers' dollars, and we ought to see how they are being spent.\n  So I am not alone in this assessment about the believability or the \neffectiveness of these ads. There is a wide variety of studies beyond \njust the one I referred to showing a lack of effectiveness. Even the \nGovernment Accountability Office recommended that Congress reduce \nfunding for the campaign until it can be proven to be an effective \nprevention tool.\n  Congress has slashed funding considerably. As you can see from this \nchart, the funding for the media campaign is only half of what it was \n10 years ago. For fiscal year 2008, the House has slashed another $6 \nmillion off the campaign's budget to bring it to $93 million, though \nour Senate version keeps the funding level. If this is not a wake-up \ncall to the Office of Drug Control Policy, I do not know what is. If \nCongress is to support the White House's request for a 30-percent \nbudget increase, then the drug czar must take several steps to improve \nthe quality and the effectiveness of the campaign.\n  The first thing that must be done is to improve the quality of the \nads. This does not require a budget increase to do so. The ads need to \nbe simple, they need to be direct, and, obviously, they need to show \nthe consequences of drug use. Exaggerations like a girl flattened on a \ncouch or ``smushed'' from pot use, along with poorly drawn cartoons \nwhere dogs speak and space aliens freely roam show unrealistic \nscenarios and damage the credibility of the campaign, as you saw in the \nprevious chart.\n  The early antidrug public service announcements--I am talking about \ngoing back to that period of time 1987 through 1998--were simple, they \nwere short, they were memorable. I believe the success of those early \nads can be replicated by using a similar formula.\n  Secondly, the campaign could be more effective if its message was \nmore diversified. Although the media campaign has begun an awareness \ncampaign on meth, it took an act of Congress to force the campaign to \nspend 10 percent of its budget to do so. Most of the ads produced by \nthe campaign so far have all been about marijuana. Although I believe \nit is important that we discourage marijuana use, there are new and \nalarming drug abuse patterns that are starting to emerge among teens.\n\n  Recent studies and articles are showing an alarming rate of teenagers \nwho are abusing prescription drugs to get high. These drugs are easily \naccessible because kids can easily find and purchase them online or \ngrab them from their parents' medicine cabinet. Many parents are not \neven aware of the trend or how they should go about discarding leftover \nmedication. The media campaign could be a very useful tool to educate \nyoung people as well as parents on these new and emerging threats.\n  Finally, the campaign, along with Congress, should work to encourage \nmedia outlets to donate more air time for antidrug messages. Currently, \nthe campaign spends most of its budget in purchasing air time. Although \nmedia outlets match the amount the campaign spends, it in no way \ncompares to what was donated 20 years ago. I believe it is imperative \nwe show these outlets the need for more donated time in light of the \ntrends I have previously illustrated. With more donated time, it will \nenable the campaign to focus on producing more ads on emerging drugs \nwithout Congress having to balloon its budget in the process.\n  Some maybe think I have been against antidrug media campaigns because \nI have been overseeing some of that for a long period of time. But I am \nnot against media campaigns. I am against wasting taxpayers' dollars on \nineffective programs that show no effort at improvement. I believe the \ncampaign can be remade into an effective tool to aid in our prevention \nefforts against teen drug abuse. But much has to change in order for \nthat to happen.\n  So I intend to send a letter to Director Walters, our drug czar, to \nfind out why the campaign is not having a positive impact on preventing \nteen drug use. What do they intend to do to change this trend? I am \ngoing to ask him. I look forward to hearing their response promptly and \nto begin the process of reforming and reenergizing the National Youth \nAntidrug Media Campaign.\n  Mr. President, let me ask my colleague from Iowa, who has been \nwaiting to speak, I do not know whether we have the first half hour or \nwhether we are going back and forth, but if the Senator does not need \nthe floor right now, I have other remarks I want to make.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time is equally divided, but \nthe order says it is 10 minutes to each speaker. So if the junior \nSenator from Iowa wishes to speak, he is free to do so.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

On Saturday, on television I saw \nthat the President called our agreement--our bipartisan agreement, I \nwant to emphasize--he called it irresponsible.\n  Specifically, in his radio address, the President said we ``put \nforward an irresponsible plan that would dramatically expand this \nprogram beyond its original intent.''\n  Well, I am here to respond to that accusation by President Bush. To \ncall\n\n[[Page S12346]]\n\nwhat we agreed to as irresponsible is an insult to an agreement we \nreached and is an insult to 67 Members of the Senate and 265 Members of \nthe House who voted in favor of it.\n  Calling our bipartisan proposal irresponsible ignores reality. The \nreality is that the current program--the program of the last 10 years, \nsunsetting yesterday--is out of control. The present program is \nfailing. That is--to emphasize--the reason for passing the bipartisan \nbill that we passed. Because the present program is not working the way \nit was intended, and with this legislation we corrected a lot of \nproblems to turn that around.\n  So the President is about to veto a bill that fixes the problems and \nimproves the program for the future without having put a credible \nalternative on the table. We have not heard from the President as to \nwhat he would do about the SCHIP program except he wanted to save it \nand expand it.\n  The current program does not have adequate funding just to keep \nrunning with no changes. Under current law, the current program is \nauthorized to spend $25 billion over the next 5 years. That is the \nbaseline amount. But the Congressional Budget Office says the $25 \nbillion baseline amount will not fully fund the program. So the \nPresident says he wants to keep the program going. You cannot do it the \nway it is funded right now.\n  Now, what does the Congressional Budget Office say? It says that \nwithout more funding, 840,000 kids would lose coverage. Without \nchanges, as many as 22 States will not have any funding to run the \nprogram next year, and Iowa is one of those States--my home State. \nSenator Harkin is on the floor; he would agree with that, I am sure.\n  Anyway, the President never said he wanted this program to lose kids, \nbut the Congressional Budget Office says, doing what we are doing now, \n840,000 kids would lose coverage. So keeping the current level of \nfunding is not responsible, but if the President vetoes that bill, that \nis what we are doing. Of course, to the President, ignoring that fact \nis ignoring reality.\n  Let's look at what the President proposed. The President proposed a \n$5 billion increase in funding in his budget, but that is also \ninsufficient funding. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the \nPresident's proposal would cause 840,000 children to lose coverage. \nThat is right. The President's proposed $5 billion of new funding, \nwithout doing anything to get more kids covered, I think is hardly the \nresponsible thing to do.\n  The proposal put forward by Senator Lott and Senator Kyl that we \nvoted on 2 months ago--now maybe 3 months ago; I guess it was in July \nwe voted on it--was an alternative to the bipartisan product we \neventually passed. The proposal by Senators Lott and Kyl devoted twice \nas much funding as what the President did. To me, that is recognition \nenough that the President's thinking on the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram is off track. The Lott-Kyl proposal was the alternative \nchildren's health insurance proposal offered during floor debate in \nJuly. My good friends put some serious thought into what they \ndeveloped. They proposed about $10 billion in new Children's Health \nInsurance Program funding. That proposal covered 900,000 additional \nuninsured children, according to the Congressional Budget Office, but \nthe Lott-Kyl proposal only received 35 votes--barely a third of the \nSenate.\n  There are good ideas in the Lott-Kyl proposal. They took a serious \nlook at what populations should be covered by the SCHIP program, and it \ndoesn't result in kids losing coverage as the President's proposals do, \nas the President's budget does, and that for sure is going to happen \nwith a veto. But with all due respect to my friends, 35 votes is hardly \na ringing success.\n  So how much funding is really needed to keep the program afloat? \nWell, the Congressional Budget Office says $24 billion of additional \nfunding is needed to provide States with funding so that States can \noperate their programs as intended. That means $24 billion is needed to \nmake sure there are no funding shortfalls, and $24 billion is needed \njust to fill the hole in the baseline and cover the kids whom States \nwould like to cover if they had sufficient funding. The compromise \nagreement provides that level of funding and then goes an additional \nstep by offering States incentives to cover more low-income kids, \nmeaning kids and families under 200 percent of poverty. Now, that is \nthe goal of reauthorization--to cover more low-income kids.\n  The bill we passed last week makes other important improvements to \nthe program. Those improvements include better dental benefits, \nimproves mental health coverage, with an outreach program to get the \nword out to kids for the kids to enroll. A bipartisan compromise is a \nresponsible approach to funding the program and returning it to its \noriginal intent--covering lower income kids--and not covering more \nadults in 3 of our 50 States than our kids are being covered in those \nStates.\n  Now let me shift gears and talk about the alternative to authorizing \nthe program. The alternative to a reauthorization of SCHIP is a simple \nextension of current law, and calling for a simple extension of the \ncurrent program without addressing the many problems it has--and I just \nsuggested one: 3 States out of 50 cover more adults in the children's \nprogram than they cover children. Now, if you want to talk about the \nword ``responsible'' and whether Congress is responsible in this bill, \nI would say anybody who wants to leave the program the way it is--and \nthat is what is going to happen with a veto--that is an irresponsible \nposition to take, to keep a program going that is covering adults in a \nchildren's program. We want to cover kids, low-income kids. So the \nSCHIP program today, which is the way it has been for the last 10 \nyears, is far off track.\n  The President has it backward when he says our bipartisan proposal \n``expands the program beyond its original intent.'' With no changes, it \nis the current SCHIP program that has strayed far from the original \nintent. I wish to remind my colleagues of 1997, passing the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. There is no ``A'' in SCHIP. It was \nnever meant to cover adults, but adults are being covered. We want to \nget back to the original intent of this program being for kids.\n  First of all, the current program covers kids at incomes far above \nwhat was considered low income in 1997. It covers parents, and in some \nStates it even covers adults who have no kids. Under the bipartisan \nagreement passed last week, this program will return to its roots: \ncovering kids, covering low-income kids. Even though the administration \napproved of States covering childless adults--now, I want to emphasize \nthat: This administration approved the States covering childless \nadults. Under our bill, childless adults will be phased completely out \nof the program. This is a responsible thing for Congress to do. This is \none of the reasons the President should sign the bill, because the \npresent policies are irresponsible.\n  Even though the administration approved of States covering parents, \nunder our bill States will no longer be able to get enhanced Federal \nfunding for covering parents. Even though the administration approved \nof States covering childless adults, under our bill States will only be \nable to cover higher income kids if they demonstrate they have covered \ntheir lowest income kids first.\n  The agreement passed last week creates new financial incentives to \ndiscourage States from spending a penny to cover anyone other than low-\nincome children. All the financial incentives in the agreement are \nentirely focused on low-income children and, let me emphasize, families \nof under 200 percent of poverty.\n  The administration has done nothing to turn around this irresponsible \nprogram which is now on the books. In fact, they have made it worse. \nYet they have the audacity to call our bill irresponsible. Those who \nsay our bill is irresponsible clearly haven't read the bill. This \nbipartisan compromise provides coverage for more than 3 million low-\nincome children who don't have coverage today.\n  If this bill is vetoed and if at the end of the day all we do is \nsimply extend the program that has now been on the books for 10 years, \nwhat will we have accomplished? Will adults be gone from the program? \nNo. Will States have a disincentive to cover parents? No. Will States \nbe encouraged to cover low-income kids before higher income kids? No. \nWill the funding formula be fixed\n\n[[Page S12347]]\n\nso that States are not constantly challenged by funding shortfalls? No. \nFinally, will we have done anything to cover kids out there who are not \ncovered today? The answer is no. No, no, no, no. Is that responsible? \nNo. It is continuing current law. Let me emphasize, it is a \ncontinuation of the current law that is the irresponsible thing to do. \nThe program is broken as evidenced in just one way: the 3 out of 50 \nStates covering more adults than kids, in some instances covering \nadults who don't have any kids.\n\n  The program has strayed. It needs fixing. In fact, the bipartisan \nagreement follows the path laid down by the President himself. I have \nsaid this repeatedly. The President made a promise at the Republican \nConvention in New York:\n\n       We will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of \n     poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the \n     government's health insurance programs.\n\n  President Bush said that. An extension of current law will not do \nthat. He may not want to hear this quote again and again, but until he \nhonors the commitment he made in that speech by making a proposal to \ncover more low-income kids, I intend to keep repeating it.\n  The President can keep his commitment by signing the bill we passed \nlast week. But if he is going to veto it, he owes those of us who tried \nto keep his commitment with our bill a sense of what serious policies \nCongress can adopt to cover more kids.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak just \nvery briefly about a loss Louisiana has suffered--and, in many ways, \nthe Nation--of a great political leader, a great political figure, and \na friend to many.\n  Earlier this morning, Sheriff Harry Lee of Jefferson Parish passed \naway after a battle with leukemia. As my colleagues know, I come from a \nplace of rich political heritage, colorful characters, and of amazing \nand fantastic stories at times about our political figures. Among the \nmost colorful, though, was Sheriff Harry Lee, who stood out and stood \ntall for so many years. He served the people of Jefferson Parish since \n1979 as their sheriff, but he started life in Louisiana in a much more \nhumble way.\n  Harry was born in the back room of a Chinese laundry in downtown New \nOrleans to immigrant parents, Bing and Yip Lee, who instilled in him a \nstrong and very determined spirit that would serve him well and serve \nall of us well for the rest of his life.\n  After a promising educational start at Francis T. Nicholls, where he \nserved as both senior class president and student body president, Harry \nwent on to college at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. He \njoined the ROTC Program there and was recognized early on as an \noutstanding cadet. He didn't stop there, though. His next step was to \nserve the country in the Air Force during the height of the Cold War. \nHe served in the famous Strategic Command. His Air Force career led him \nto make a great decision in life, and that was to marry Lai Beet Woo, \nhis wife of 40 years.\n  When Harry returned to Louisiana, he took over the family restaurant \nand convinced his father to allow him to attend law school. He excelled \nand became the first Federal magistrate for the Eastern District of \nLouisiana. He soon then, through many political contacts and his great \nspirit and gregarious nature and classwork, became parish attorney for \nJefferson Parish.\n  Then, in 1975 and shortly thereafter, he was elected sheriff, a post \nhe held for more than two decades, and he became a household name in \nLouisiana. This story has probably been tracked by others, but for \nHarry Lee, who comes from a Chinese-American background, at the time he \nwas elected sheriff I think he was the highest ranking Chinese official \nand the only Chinese-American sheriff in the country. He was always \nextremely proud of that, proud of his heritage, always reminding us of \nthat singular accomplishment.\n  After being a larger-than-life force in the realm of criminal justice \nfor over 30 years, as I said this morning, he finally lost his own \nbattle with leukemia. He had fought and won many battles on the streets \nin Jefferson Parish, in the courtrooms, and also in the court of public \nopinion.\n  Harry Lee's success says something important about our country--the \nson of immigrants who goes on to not only serve his parish, his city, \nhis region, but went on to befriend Presidents, Republicans and \nDemocrats, being the go-to person when people of great political \ndistinction would come to our State. They always wanted to see and talk \nwith Harry Lee.\n  Like all of us in public life, his tenure was not without \ncontroversy, but he was fiercely loyal to his deputies. There are \nthousands of deputies, current and former, who are mourning his passing \ntoday.\n  Looking back on a life like this, you can only think that his father \nand mother, Bing Yip Lee, who have long passed away, must have looked \ndown and smiled on their son's accomplishments.\n  The loss of this singular figure in Louisiana politics is not only a \nloss to Jefferson Parish and to the State of Louisiana, but it is a \nloss to this great country that we all try our best to serve.\n  I want to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Lee family, to the \ndeputies, to the law enforcement officials of Jefferson Parish in our \nState who are mourning this loss today. I hope we will all take some \nsolace from the fact that they are being joined by so many mourners who \nrecognize and appreciate a life well lived.\n  In closing, a not-so-secret hobby of Harry's was singing. I cannot \nsay he would have ever made records, but he tried and he sang with \ngreat zest. At many jazz fests, he would be tempted to the stage by his \nfriend Willie Nelson. They would often sing together. His favorite song \nwas ``Welcome to My World.'' I would like to say to Harry today: Thank \nyou for welcoming us to your world, Sheriff Lee. You served us well, \nand you will be missed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for accepting my \namendment to support the families of those National Guard and Reserve \nindividuals serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. I thank Senator Levin and \nSenator McCain for their support and assistance in including it as part \nof the National Defense Authorization Act, on which we will be voting \non final passage later today.\n  This is a new era for our National Guard and Reserves. They are \nshouldering a huge share of the combat burden in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nplus a\n\n[[Page S12348]]\n\nstepped-up role here in homeland security. It speaks volumes that more \nthan four times as many Guard members have been killed in Iraq as \nduring the entire Vietnam war.\n  With many Guard and Reserve members on their third or even fourth \ndeployment, and with some deployments being stretched to at least 16 \nmonths, the stresses on their families are acute. Their children are at \ngreater risk for depression, behavioral disorders, and academic \nproblems. Long family separations often result in financial \ndifficulties and troubled marriages.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced the Coming Together for National \nGuard and Reserve Families Act, which is the heart of this amendment. \nThat amendment was accepted by the majority and the minority. The \namendment does a number of things: It strengthens the family assistance \nprogram to ensure there are adequate resources for Guard and Reserve \nfamilies throughout the deployment cycle. It provides special attention \nfor the children of deployed servicemembers, who often react to \nparental separation with acting-out behaviors, anxiety, and depression. \nFinally, the amendment ensures that Guard and Reserve families receive \nappropriately timed information about the psychological symptoms that \ncan appear long after coming home--such as anger, depression, alcohol \nabuse, or post-traumatic stress disorder--to help them take advantage \nof the services and support they may need.\n  Shortly after introducing the bill, I received a letter from the \nfiance of an Iowa Guard member deployed in Iraq. It was one of many \nletters I received. I cannot read them all. I thought this portion of \nit summed it up:\n\n       I received a letter from you today about the S. 902 bill \n     that would help National Guard families, and I just wanted to \n     say thank you. I cried when I first read this; for the first \n     time in 2 years I feel like someone heard me. I hope this \n     bill is passed and carried out. My fiance is in Iraq with the \n     133rd Infantry of the Iowa National Guard. He was due home in \n     March but now will be there until August. To say the least, I \n     was devastated when I heard that he was extended, and \n     honestly believe that it is such a terrible thing. Since he \n     has been extended, many of his friends in the unit have tried \n     to commit suicide and even more are deeply depressed. More \n     times than not, I hear him saying how he wishes he could just \n     have his life back. And I ask that you keep fighting for this \n     because our soldiers' lives are hanging in the balance. My \n     soldier and I will have to deal with the long-term \n     consequences of his being in a war zone for so long for the \n     rest of our lives, and we have to stop this before our \n     children and grandchildren have to deal with this as well. . \n     . . I am proud to live in the United States of America. \n     However, my fiance has done his part; he has protected this \n     country for 22 months and he has been away from my side for \n     that long. Let him come home, give us our lives back.\n\n  Mr. President, one happy result is that the brave men and women of \nthe 1st Battalion of the 133rd Infantry of the Iowa National Guard--the \nsame soldiers who inspired this amendment--returned home in July after \nserving as part of the longest continuous deployment of the Iraq war, \nspending nearly 2 years in active duty and 17 months in Iraq.\n  Senator Grassley and I passed a resolution earlier honoring the \nservice and sacrifices made by these brave soldiers and their families. \nBut there is more we can do. Of course, I am working with my colleagues \non this side of the aisle, and others, to begin the long, overdue \nprocess of redeploying our troops out of the civil war in Iraq. I hope \nwe can make real progress on this in the coming weeks.\n  Until we are able to accomplish that, we must do everything we can to \nmake sure the loved ones and family members of our deployed soldiers \nreceive the support they need and deserve.\n  These families, many of whom are just starting their lives together, \nare dealing with tremendous stress. They include many small children \nwho have grown up while their mothers or fathers were away.\n  Mr. President, this is a quiet crisis that we don't read about in the \nmorning newspaper, but it is a crisis nonetheless. This amendment \naddresses that crisis by strengthening family assistance programs and \ndoing outreach to parents and professionals who serve children--\nincluding mental health counselors and teachers--to alert them to the \nspecial needs of kids in military families, especially those with a \nparent in a war zone.\n  This amendment also ensures that families receive support after \nsoldiers come home. The amendment ensures that families receive mental \nhealth information for up to 6 months post deployment so they can have \naccess to the services and support they need.\n  Again, why is the amendment necessary? It became clear, after \nvisiting with families of these National Guard troops and reservists \nwho were overseas in Iraq that we have one set of family services and \nintervention and support for families of regular military personnel in \nthe Army, Marines, Navy, and Air Force, but don't have the same support \nservices for National Guard and Reserves. Many times in our small towns \nand communities you have one or two families who have a husband or a \nfather overseas in the National Guard for an extended time, but those \nfamilies don't get the same support and services as a family with a \nloved one in the regular Armed Forces, either throughout the deployment \nor when the soldier returns. Perhaps this made sense in the past. But \nthe line between the Reserves and National Guard and the regular forces \nhas become very blurred with the war in Iraq. So we see the National \nGuard carrying out what normally would have been done by the Active-\nDuty military. That is why this amendment, providing Guard and Reserve \nfamilies with this support, is so important.\n  On a final note, the benefits of this amendment will apply to all \nGuard and Reserve troops, as well as their families--and I might point \nout, even those who disagree with President Bush and Vice President \nCheney. They can disagree and this amendment will still apply to them. \nI feel obliged to say this because a prominent conservative leader, \nRush Limbaugh, of radio infamy, said men and women in uniform over in \nIraq who oppose the war are ``phony soldiers,'' and are presumably \nunworthy of the American people's support.\n  Earlier today, I was here and I heard Senator Reid, our majority \nleader, speak about this. This statement is outrageous and despicable. \nOur men and women in uniform in Iraq have made extraordinary \nsacrifices. 3,800 have been killed and nearly 28,000 have been wounded, \nmany with amputations and brain injuries they will live with for the \nrest of their lives. Our troops live in constant danger. Meanwhile, \ntheir families at home have had to cope with repeated separations and \nwith the constant dread of bad news from Iraq. The very thought of Rush \nLimbaugh sitting in his air-conditioned broadcast studio and ranting \nabout ``phony soldiers'' in Iraq who dare to speak their mind is just \nshameful. Perhaps in Mr. Limbaugh's case the correct word is \n``shameless.''\n  I realize he and some other extremists on the right hold the view \nthat you are either with us or you are against us; you are either a \ngood American or a bad American, depending upon whether you agree with \nthe conservative Republican line. But that is not the way most \nAmericans think. We respect disagreement. We value dissent. We don't \nresort to name-calling when our fellow Americans--especially those in \nuniform--express a differing point of view.\n  For the record, by labeling as ``phony soldiers'' those who disagree \nwith the war or the President's comments, that denigrates many \nthousands of our Armed Forces serving in Iraq. Listen to this. A \nDecember 2006 poll conducted by the Military Times found that fully 42 \npercent of servicemembers disapproved of President Bush's handling of \nthe war, while just 35 percent supported it.\n  In other words, our men and women in uniform are not much different \nfrom the rest of the American people, the majority of whom also \ndisagree with Mr. Bush's conduct of the war. Frankly, it increases my \nrespect for those soldiers' professionalism and sense of duty. They \ndisagree with their Commander in Chief, but they continue to perform \ntheir jobs with enormous courage, confidence, and commitment. That is \ncause for admiration and praise, not name-calling and denigration.\n  I must add, as a veteran, I find it offensive that Rush Limbaugh, who \nnever put on the uniform of this country, would attack the patriotism \nor dedication of any soldier fighting in Iraq. I have often said about \nsomeone like that, before they drape themselves in the flag of this \ncountry, they ought\n\n[[Page S12349]]\n\nto put on the uniform first to defend it. In Limbaugh's case, he would \nnot do that.\n  Well, I also find it disturbing that his offensive comments have not \nbeen condemned by our Republican colleagues, or by the Commander in \nChief, all of whom were so quick to condemn a similar personal attack \non General Petraeus several weeks ago.\n  The Boxer-Levin-Durbin Amendment to the Defense authorization bill \nsaid the Senate ``strongly condemns all attacks on the honor, \nintegrity, and patriotism of any individual who is serving in the Armed \nServices.'' I just point out that all but two Republican Senators voted \nagainst this amendment. Will any one of them stand up and be brave \nenough to take on Rush Limbaugh? Will anybody on that side of the aisle \ntake on Rush Limbaugh for this statement? We have not heard anything \nyet, but I hope they do.\n  The silence from President Bush and the Republican leadership is \nsimply deafening. Is this because they agree with Mr. Limbaugh, or they \ndon't want to risk angering such a prominent conservative by taking him \nto task.\n  Mr. President, in August, seven soldiers published an op-ed in the \nNew York Times criticizing the current strategy in Iraq. Tragically, \ntwo of those soldiers were subsequently killed in action, making the \nultimate sacrifice for their country.\n  I only can assume by Mr. Limbaugh's definition that they, too, were \nphony soldiers. What is most despicable, Rush Limbaugh says these \nprovocative things to make more money. So he castigates our soldiers. \nThis makes more news. It becomes the news, more people tune in, he \nmakes more money.\n  I don't know, maybe he was high on his drugs again. I don't know if \nhe was or not. If so, he ought to let us know. That shouldn't be an \nexcuse.\n  I wish to make it clear that I respect Mr. Limbaugh's right to say \nwhatever he wants, but we also have a right. We have a right not to \nlisten to him.\n  So I think the best thing to do for him is to tune him out, tune out \nRush Limbaugh and listen to more responsible talk show hosts in this \ncountry.\n  I think that it is time, again, for us to stand up for our troops, as \nwe have, I think, in the past, to give them every bit of support and \ngive their families support. That is what my amendment does.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute and thanks to Joe \nPapez, Technical Sergeant, U.S. Army retired. Joe is a veteran of World \nWar II. In fact, he is believed to be the oldest living Purple Heart \nrecipient in the United States, and he is one of the brave men who \nanswered the call of their country and who helped the ``greatest \ngeneration'' earn that title.\n  Joe was injured three times during his stint in the Army, where he \nserved in both Africa and Italy, in the campaigns of 1943 and 1944. He \nearned three Purple Hearts fighting in Casablanca, on the island of \nSicily, and in Italy. But it was his last wound by a German artillery \nshell during the fierce fighting at Anzio, Italy, that earned him a \nfree ticket back home.\n  The way Joe tells the story, after he was wounded in Anzio, he was \nput on a ship and sent home, but he doesn't remember the trip. He woke \nup in Virginia. After a while, he was shipped to Denver, where he \nrecovered in a hospital. Then he was shipped to Oregon and finally to \nSanta Barbara.\n  When he finally got back on his feet, he kept on serving his country \nby caring for German prisoners of war in Utah, where he remained until \nthe war was over.\n  Following the war, Joe returned to Red Lodge, MT. Disabled from his \nwar wounds, he was unable to get a job. He made a drawing for a \nhomestead in Powell, WY, but was told he was too sick to have it. \nHowever, with help from his brothers and a bank loan, he got into \nfarming and ranching.\n  On December 19, Joe Papez will turn 100 years old or, should I say, \n100 years young. He will turn 100 in the same town in which he has \nlived for nearly his entire life. Although he was born in Franklin, KS, \nthe State of Montana is proud to claim Joe as one of our own.\n  Joe's family moved to Red Lodge when he was a year old. Residents of \nRed Lodge know he is a fixture in the town's Memorial Day parade, he is \na regular in the Fourth of July parade, and even at his age, he marches \nin these parades to remember his brothers in arms with whom he served. \nAnd they will always remember him. Fittingly, the Billings chapter of \nthe Military Order of the Purple Heart is named for Joe Papez.\n  Joe is spry and healthy and said he would serve his country again if \nhe could. Joe Papez has served his country and his community, and he \nhas done it very well.\n  So today we give thanks to him and Dorreen, and we pray for more \nfolks just like Joe.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Mr. President, today marks the beginning of domestic \nviolence month, and it marks a time when we look at the progress we \nhave made in this area and what challenges remain.\n  As a former prosecutor, I am well aware of the tragedies we see every \nday in this country from domestic violence. But it is also a time in \nour State where we look back at the lives of Paul and Sheila Wellstone, \nwho devoted their time, their passion, and their energy to doing \nsomething about a problem that so often is overlooked or about which \npeople do not want to talk.\n  This is, in fact, a few weeks on the calendar before their tragic \ndeath in a plane crash. Today we are going to welcome their son, David \nWellstone, to the Capitol, and there will be a quilt displayed in the \nRussell rotunda, a quilt made by women and children from 13 different \ndomestic violence centers across this country.\n  At the event today, we are going to have in Paul and Sheila's honor--\nwe are not just going to look back on all they accomplished and stood \nfor, but we are also going to look ahead to the work we all must do to \ncarry their legacy forward, especially that commitment they had to \nending domestic violence.\n  It is hard to believe it has already been nearly 5 years since we \nlost Paul and Sheila. It feels both so long ago and yet not that long \nago. But we know their dreams and passions remain alive in each one of \nus, and that is why we are gathering tonight.\n  For me, I get my own special reminder of Paul Wellstone every day. \nHis family gave me the flags that hung in his office. I am also \nreminded every day by ordinary people in the Capitol when I say I am \nfrom Minnesota--the tram drivers in the basement or the police officers \nor the secretaries in Senate offices who, when you say you are a \nSenator from Minnesota, they remember Paul, and they remember how well \nhe treated people and the dignity with which he treated people every \nday.\n  Above all, I keep in mind, in front of my mind, the fundamental \nvalues for which he fought and struggled--being a voice to the \nvoiceless, bringing power to the powerless, bringing justice to those \nwho suffered injustice and above all, bringing hope to all of us that \nwe can change the world and make it a better place.\n  There is no better way to honor Sheila's groundbreaking work in \ndomestic violence than to mark the beginning of Domestic Violence \nAwareness Month with that quilt hanging in the Capitol.\n\n[[Page S12350]]\n\n  I had the honor and opportunity to work with Sheila on many occasions \nwhen I was Hennepin County attorney. She was instrumental in creating \nand funding the Hennepin County Domestic Abuse Service Center. Hennepin \nCounty has about 1.1 million people, and this center is a landmark \ncenter across the country. It is a single place where women and their \nchildren can come. There is a play area for the kids. There are \nprosecutors there. There are police there. It is one place where they \ncan get through the redtape and come to get help. The center is an \ninternational model for serving victims of domestic violence.\n  Sheila and I shared a particular concern for the fate of children who \ngrew up in homes with domestic violence. There are deeply disturbing \nstatistics on children who witness domestic abuse in their homes. These \nkids are six times more likely to commit suicide. They are 24 times \nmore likely to commit sexual assault. They are 60 times more likely to \nexhibit delinquent behavior and, most chilling of all, little boys who \nwitness domestic violence are 100 times more likely to become abusers \nthemselves.\n  In my job as a prosecutor, I learned very quickly that when there is \ndomestic violence, there is always a victim, the immediate victim, but \nit ripples through an entire family.\n  I remember a case we had in a suburban area where a man who had been \nabusing his wife killed her. There was a little girl, a little daughter \nwho was about 4 years old. When he disposed of his wife's body, he \nbrought the daughter with him in the back seat. A few days later, the \ngrandparents came in from Russia. The woman was a Russian immigrant. \nThey brought the deceased woman's twin sister, identical twin sister. \nThis little daughter had never seen her aunt before. She ran through \nthe airport when she saw her get off the plane and she said: Mommy, \nmommy, mommy. When you hear stories such as that story, you remember it \nis not about one victim, it is about an entire family.\n  Sheila knew those stories, and Sheila knew those statistics. But even \nmore, she knew the names and the faces of the real children who \nwitnessed and experienced abuse in the home. It made her all the more \ndetermined to do something about it because in America, of all places, \nkids should be free to grow up with safety, security, and peace of \nmind.\n  I remember the last time I saw Sheila. It was 2 weeks before that \nterrible plane crash. She and I had been asked to speak at a ceremony \ncelebrating the new citizenship of Russian immigrants. It wasn't a \ncampaign event. There were no cameras, even though it was about 3 weeks \nbefore one of the biggest elections in the country. It was just new \ncitizens and their families.\n  We both talked about the immigrant traditions in our own families. \nShe talked about her family growing up in Appalachia. I talked about my \nfamily on the Iron Range with the Slovenian roots. As the event was \nwinding down, in walked Paul. He wasn't supposed to be there. He was \nsupposed to be in Washington. It was 3 weeks before this major \nelection, and he was in this little room, with no reporters and no \ncameras, to greet these new citizens.\n  I always knew he was there for two reasons. One, he was there because \nhe loved his wife and he wanted to be there to surprise her and support \nher. But he was also there that night because he truly embraced that \nimmigrant tradition. He embraced the idea that a person could come to \nthis country, an incredible journey to freedom, with nothing, and they \ncould work hard, succeed and send their kids and their grandkids to \ncollege because that had been what had happened to him and that had \nbeen what happened to Sheila.\n  It was the same thing for Sheila and Paul with victims of domestic \nviolence, people who had sunk to the lowest in their life, who had no \nhome, who were out on the street, who were out hiding in a shelter. She \nworked tirelessly to ensure that victims and their families could begin \ntheir own journeys to freedom, that they could get a fresh start, with \nnew opportunities, in a new and secure environment.\n  We will always miss Paul and Sheila, but thanks to their son David, \nwho is going to be with us here this evening, and countless volunteers \nand friends from all over the country, they have carried on their \nlegacy and their work. They have carried on their legacy to change the \nworld and make it a better and safer place for everyone.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12350-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The amendments that are now \nscheduled for a vote are the substitute amendment and final passage.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I was under \nthe impression we had a vote agreed upon.\n  Mr. President, I understand there has been an agreement with the \nleadership that we will dispose of this amendment at the hour of 5:30. \nIn any event, is the time divided between now and 5:30?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time is not divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I desire to talk on the amendment that is \nsponsored by Senator Mikulski, myself, and a number of others, which is \nan amendment to the Defense authorization bill. I see the ranking \nmember of the committee. If he had other business he wanted to deal \nwith, obviously, I would withhold.\n  Mr. President, at the end of last week, on Thursday evening, there \nwas an excellent presentation on this issue before the Senate by \nSenator Mikulski. I addressed the Senate on Friday on this issue, and I \nam going to take a few minutes this afternoon.\n  This is an exceedingly important issue. It relates to the underlying \nconcept of our national security and our national defense. In this \nlegislation, we are authorizing some $675 billion, which is essentially \nthe backbone of our defense. What this amendment deals with is the \npersonnel who will be working on the tanks, the planes, and the \nmilitary hardware which needs to be conditioned and updated and \nimproved so it is available and accessible to those men and women who \nare involved in defending this country. These are the employees who \nwork primarily in the Defense Department.\n  There is a phenomenon that has arisen that works to discriminate \nagainst these excellent workers. They are not only excellent workers \nbut a third of them are veterans. A third of them are veterans. These \nare men and women who have worn the uniform of our country and have \ndecided that they want to continue in public service and so, therefore, \nhave brought their skills and their training they have achieved in the \nmilitary to give attention to the Defense Department. This is probably \nthe highest percentage of veterans in any undertaking or employment \nbase we have in this country, because these individuals, highly \npatriotic, highly motivated, highly skilled, want to continue their \nservice to the country.\n  Basically, what they are asking is for an opportunity to continue \nservice within the Defense Department, working on the various \nchallenges and contracts which come before the Defense Department. This \nchart shows that thousands of veterans could lose their\n\n[[Page S12351]]\n\njobs under the outsourcing rules. That is what this amendment is about. \nWe are going to get fairness in competition so these workers are \ntreated fairly and the taxpayer is treated fairly, and we get the \ndollar value for the taxes paid, and the workers will be treated \nfairly.\n  Under the current system, the rules that have been developed by the \nadministration undermine that sense of fairness for these workers--a \nthird of whom, as I said, are veterans. That is the issue. Thirty-four \npercent of the civilian defense employees are veterans. This amendment \nensures that these 226,620 dedicated Americans who have served our \ncountry will not lose their jobs because of unfair outsourcing. That is \nwhat we are talking about--unfair outsourcing.\n  Let me explain how this works. The chart probably demonstrates it as \nwell as it can be demonstrated. This is the Government here for some \nparticular Defense Department work. You can see from the green box that \nthe Government can provide a lower rate for the cost of providing the \nservice, and can also do it with higher skills than on the private bid. \nBut the fact that the Government employees have health insurance or \nretirement benefits adds an additional cost to their proposal, which \nputs them out of competition. So what we are finding now with these new \nrules and regulations is the bids and contracts are going to companies \nthat are dropping their health care and dropping their pension programs \nand dropping other security benefits so they can come up underneath the \nGovernment contract. Essentially, this is a race to the bottom.\n  In a country where we have 47 million Americans who are uninsured, \nand we are having a major national debate about covering children, why \nare we providing more financial incentives to companies to drop their \nhealth insurance? That is what we are doing. The ones who are losing \nout are, by and large, the ones who have served in the Armed Forces of \nour country.\n  This isn't only on Government bids; this could be a responsible \ncontractor and an irresponsible contractor. Maybe a responsible \ncontractor can do it more efficiently even than the Federal Government, \nbut look how it works. If you have a responsible contractor who is \ntrying to provide some benefits, limited benefits, or good benefits for \ntheir employees--and that is the combination we are talking about, \nhealth and retirement; those are the two, retirement and health--we are \nseeing those contractors who can provide the services more efficiently \nand better. Nonetheless, the bid will go to the irresponsible \ncontractor. So this works against responsible contractors and it works \nagainst veterans working in the Defense Department.\n  What we are saying with this amendment--and there are other \nprovisions in the amendment--but what we are saying is let the \ncompetition take place. Let the competition take place between the \nworkers in the Defense Department and the private sector, but let them \nhave an even playing ground. Let us exclude the health insurance and \nretirement benefits. Let us have the competition out there and the best \nperson win. The best bid wins the contracts.\n  Why would we want to continue to drive out these contracts? We can \nshow what has been happening over time to these workers. We saw in \n2004, because of these new regulations, where Federal employees lost on \n10 percent of these bids; in 2005, it went to 30 percent; and the best \nestimate now is it is going all the way up to 78 percent, and basically \nit is about this issue--not completely, but it is fundamentally about \nthis issue.\n  Now, in the amendment there are other provisions which I will mention \nvery briefly. Provisions of this amendment, which have been debated on \nthe floor and acted on in the Senate at other times, have also had \nstrong bipartisan support, and I will mention those very briefly.\n  At the present time, a private contractor can appeal an unfair \ndecision if there is a belief by the private contractor that there is \nunfairness in terms of the decision in the competition with the Federal \nworkers. They are entitled to get an appeal. On the other hand, if the \nFederal workers believe it is an unfair competition, they have no right \nto do so. They have no right to do so. This restores that right. This \nrepresents a very similar provision that was sponsored by Senator \nCollins in 2004, and Senators Chambliss, Warner, Thomas, and Voinovich \nhave also supported appeal rights in the past for Federal employees in \nprevious appropriations legislation. I am not speaking for them, but it \nis an indication that this is an issue that has been before the Senate \nat other times and there has been bipartisan support for it.\n  On this point here--can renew a contract without recompetition--if \nthey have a follow-on contract, they can renew that, if it is a private \ncontract. With the Federal workers, they do not have that right to do \nthat at the present time. So under the outsourcing provisions, these \nFederal workers are shortchanged.\n  The provision regarding the submission of the competitive bid that \nrequires the Federal workers to follow procedural and administrative \nprovisions actually increases the cost of their bids. Again, at the \nrequest of the employees, all they wish to do is have the same kind of \n``most competitive bid'' they can offer. They would like that one to be \non the table so we will get the best in terms of productivity and skill \nand also get the best in terms of savings for the taxpayers. But they \nare denied that right.\n  We provided, through the Appropriations Committee, those protections. \nThose provisions had been added through the Appropriations Committee. \nBut what has happened is, as the Appropriations Committee process goes \nalong, these provisions expire, and so we have to come back to them. We \nhave to win them again every time. Because if they are added on the \nappropriations, they do not continue to last and we have to refight \nthose issues.\n  Finally, there are what they call ``quota provisions,'' which have \nbeen put on by OMB and require a certain amount of quotas in terms of \nthe private contracting, which obviously provides some unfairness to \nthe workers and, secondly, to the public and the taxpayers.\n  These are basically the provisions we have in the legislation. The \nprimary one we have talked about today has been on this competition we \nhave had for the benefit cost. This is the overarching issue and \nquestion.\n  We are going to have a good national debate during the Presidential \nelections of 2008 about how we are going to address the problems of \ncost in this country on health care. We have gone from $1.3 trillion to \n$2.3 trillion in the last 5 years. We have added $1 trillion worth of \nspending in health care and have added 7 million more people who are \nuninsured and there would have been a great deal more if we didn't have \nthe CHIP program.\n\n  We cannot continue that as a nation. We are not going to be able to \ncontinue that. Our companies are not going to be able to; the costs in \nterms of local communities have gotten prohibitive. These involve real \npeople and real sacrifices--real important considerations. We are \ntalking about families. We are talking about, by and large, fairly \ntreating people who served in the military. They had health care when \nthey were serving in the military. They could have the health care when \nthey retired. But the real question is going to be, now, when they are \ncontinuing to be a part of the whole defense and security of this \ncountry, whether we are going to treat them with the kind of respect \nthey need, understanding they have families and they need this health \ncare coverage. They are glad to pay for it and bargain for it. They \nhave to look down the road in terms of their security and the security \nof their families, in terms of pensions in the future. They are glad to \npay for that. But why we should be able to effectively cut them loose \nat a time of intense competition, I don't know.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, who has been \ninvolved in the different phases. I mentioned half a dozen different \nphases on this issue. He has been involved and engaged in these \ndifferent aspects since he has been on that committee. I enjoy serving \nwith him on the Armed Services Committee. He has been an eloquent and \neffective voice and has given enormous support to this effort. I see \nhim on the floor and thank him for all of his help and assistance on \nthis issue.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n[[Page S12352]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Massachusetts for his eloquent, \npassionate statement and for his kind words. I appreciate it very much. \nIn a short while, I will be adding my own few words of support for this \namendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from \nMaryland, and others--including myself.\n  I am privileged to be managing the bill until the chairman, Senator \nLevin arrives. I thought insofar as there are Members here on both \nsides, we would go back and forth. I suggest Senator Sessions, who is \nhere now, go next. I will follow him.\n  I ask, through the Chair, of my friend from Alabama, how much time he \nwould like to speak?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Alabama go \nnext for 10 minutes and then I be recognized for 7 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                  The Retirement of General Peter Pace\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I had the honor today to be at the \nretirement ceremony, a few hours ago, for the 16th Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff of the armed services of the United States, GEN \nPeter Pace, and the installation of the 17th Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs, ADM Mike Mullen. The weather was beautiful, indeed, in your \nState of Virginia at Fort Myer, the brass shining in the Sun, the music \nwas stirring, and the uniforms of the services in their bright collars \ngave appropriate recognition to the passing of the torch from a \nChairman proven to a new Chairman challenged.\n  It is always thus, I suppose. It was a thrill to see the commander of \nthe Honor Guard one last time advance and say: ``General Pace, the \nHonor Guard of the United States is ready for your inspection.''\n  And General Pace did just that, it appeared with pleasure and \nsatisfaction. That he is admired within the military cannot be denied. \nI understand last week they planned a surprise for him in the Pentagon. \nHe was invited to come to a meeting for some business, it was \nsuggested, and the halls filled with over 1,200 people who appeared and \napplauded him for 20 minutes. It was a true expression of the \nadmiration and affection in which he is held throughout the military. \nSuch support is not a surprise for anyone who knows that wonderful man.\n  He made a number of remarks at his retirement or change of command. \nHe expressed his admiration for President Bush's willingness to listen \nto his advice the entire time of his tenure. He made clear President \nBush did listen, and he was a regular briefer of the President; and \nGeneral Pace's admiration for the President for standing by his \ncommitments when he sent military men and women in uniform into harm's \nway was quite personal and strong. In other words, General Pace is \nthere. General Pace has been part of this process. General Pace has \nseen this Congress and this President authorize soldiers and send \nsoldiers into harm's way. He felt a sense of appreciation for President \nBush, I would say, for his willingness to not give lightly and to be \ntotally supportive of those troops once they had been sent in harm's \nway.\n\n  He said the No. 1 question he is asked when he goes about with \nmilitary personnel: Does Congress still support us?\n  I remember not too many months ago, a gentleman right out there \ncaught me. His son was about to go to Iraq. He told me: Senator, make \nno mistake, those soldiers over there and in training to go over there \nare watching what you do like a hawk.\n  Secretary Gates, President Bush, Admiral Mullen were exceedingly \ncomplimentary of General Pace. They discussed his bravery as a young \nlieutenant at the battle of Hue in Vietnam. They lost quite a number of \nofficers. He was moved up as a second lieutenant to be in command of \nthe company they would have to have led. There was a bitter battle and \nhe lost a number of marines.\n  He said he felt a debt to those marines, that he had spent 40 years \nof his career in the military attempting to pay off.\n  Several people made reference to that. He called those marines he \nserved with, who lost their lives there, by names at that retirement \nceremony. He indicated he still did not believe he had paid that debt \nthat he owed those people who had given their full measure to our \nNation's defense. But other speakers said he had, and they were most \ncomplimentary of him.\n  Recently, at a hearing, he was encouraged--let me say it that way--to \nretreat from a statement he had made that reflected his personal moral \nand faith beliefs; but he admirably, I suggest, declined to pander or \nto retreat from what he honestly believed, and he restated his personal \nvalues. That is the kind of man you want leading us, I suggest.\n  Our Nation is in the debt, I think, of GEN Peter Pace. He has given \ntirelessly of himself to support the policies of our country and to \nmake those policies successful.\n  I say: Well done, good marine, well done.\n  Mr. President, on a different subject, I want to take a few minutes \nto note that on Friday, September 21, the Missile Defense Agency had a \nhighly successful missile defense intercept. A target vehicle was \nlaunched from Kodiak, AK. It went into space. The interceptor missile \nwas launched at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. It was, \nindeed, a realistic test of this capability. According to Rick Lehner, \nthe spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency, ``This was a very \noperationally realistic test.''\n  In those tests we want to determine whether our missile defense \ncapability will actually succeed in knocking down an intercontinental \nmissile. These two missiles were launched, the target vehicle on a \ntrack not unlike what we would see if, for example, the North Koreans \nlaunched an attack. We launched our defensive missile out of \nCalifornia. And they collided and destroyed one another over the \nPacific, like we planned, a bullet to bullet. There were no explosives \nin the ``kill'' vehicle. Just speed, guided by computers and \nsophisticated guidance systems, allowed those two to collide and to \ndestroy the incoming missile.\n  The American people have a number of questions and misconceptions \nabout missile defense. Some think we already have a complete missile \ndefense system that can knock down incoming missiles. That is not so. \nSome think we do not have any capability, that this is a bunch of money \nbeing spent on programs that are never going to work. That is \nabsolutely not so. We now have proven the technology. General Obering \nand his team at the Missile Defense Agency have continued to have \nsuccess after success. We know we have the capability to knock down an \nincoming missile that threatens the people of the United States, who \nknows--with a nuclear weapon or biological or chemical munition \ncontained within it.\n  This is an important matter for the United States that the President \ncan know. If he is negotiating with some extreme nation that threatens \nto attack us with a missile and tries to use that threat as leverage or \nbargaining power, he can say: We are not afraid of you. You send a \nmissile off and we will knock it down.\n  We are reaching that point in our capability. Intelligence tells us \nIran also continues to build its systems and produces greater \ncapability.\n  I would say, we need a site in Europe. I hope we continue to work \ntoward that. We need to maintain steady appropriations and \nauthorizations in this Senate to make sure our missile system that we \nhave committed so many years to, and so many dollars to, is now \ncompleted, since it has been proven to be a good investment from the \nbeginning.\n  I thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity and note I am \nexcited about this test's success. I do believe it is important for all \nof us in Congress to note that and make sure about our funding--which I \nthink this year is a bit tight. The President took some money down out \nof missile defense. The Congress has taken some more. But I believe we \nhave enough funding to keep this program on track.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Lieberman. I note there are few in the \nSenate who have studied the issue more or who have been engaged in it \nlonger than he. I know he and Senator Thad Cochran offered the \nresolution, not long after I came to the Senate, to\n\n[[Page S12353]]\n\ndeploy a national missile defense system ``as soon as technologically \nfeasible.'' That was the language, wasn't it, Senator Lieberman? \nIndeed, we are now deploying it. We are already deploying the system, \nand the American people took comfort last July 4, when the North \nKoreans launched missiles to demonstrate their power--they took comfort \nbecause of you and others, before I even came into the Senate--such as \nSenator Shelby, my colleague from Alabama--who were pioneers moving \nthat forward. We can now take comfort that we do have ability. It means \na lot for our people and for the safety of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend my \nstatement, which I will now offer for 10 minutes instead of 7; to be \nfollowed by the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, for 10 minutes; \nfollowed by the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders, for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I extend my time to respond to two \nthings my friend from Alabama, Senator Sessions--one of my two friends \nfrom Alabama, Senator Sessions, mentioned.\n  The first is the good news from the Missile Defense Program of the \nsuccessful test last Friday. We wish we did not have to spend money \nbuilding a missile defense, but the truth is that the number of powers, \nincluding a lot of hostile anti-American countries that have the \ncapacity to fire missiles at us and our allies, carrying both \nconventional weapons and potentially weapons of mass destruction, is \nincreasing and has increased.\n  The creation of this program has been controversial. The funding of \nit is controversial. But I believe, just as deeply as anyone can \nbelieve anything, that we will, particularly as we hear the success of \nthe testing, look back on the investments we have made in this program \nand be very thankful we did it because it will protect the security of \nthe United States from attack via a missile from the enemies that exist \nto our country and to our values.\n  I wish to just briefly echo what Senator Sessions said about General \nPace, who has just ended his time as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. I put an extensive statement in the Record last week without \nbeing on the floor. I just say now that this is a good man, a patriot \nwho has served his country with a tremendous sense of excellence, of \nbravery, of honor, taking on risks and burdens to himself for the \ndefense of America.\n  When he was appointed and confirmed as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, there were two pieces of history, two firsts. We are a \ncountry that loves firsts because when people do something for the \nfirst time, it talks about the increasing openness, the reality of what \nwe call the American dream. The one that was greatly commented on was \nPeter Pace was the first marine to become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff. That was a historic first. The other--perhaps less commented \non but a great story of America--Pete Pace was the first Italian \nAmerican to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--yet another \nextraordinary accomplishment and act of service to our country from its \nItalian-American community.\n  Pete Pace served during a difficult time. He served with honor and \nintegrity. He was intensely devoted to the men and women who serve all \nof us, and their families. He has maintained the fighting edge of our \nmilitary going through a very difficult time, oversaw two extraordinary \nvictories in Afghanistan and Iraq and then the post-Saddam war \nincreasingly against al-Qaida in Iran and Iraq--very difficult times. \nBut he leaves office now at a moment when, obviously thanks to the \nskill and bravery of the American military, there are some reasons for \nencouragement in Iraq, good reasons.\n  I thank General Pace, his wife, and his family for their service to \nAmerica. We wish them well in the years ahead.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3058\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the amendment offered by \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Mikulski and others, including myself, \nwhich will be voted on later today. This amendment would bring some \ncommonsense reforms to the process by which agencies decide whether to \noutsource Federal jobs to contractors.\n  Sometimes, obviously, it makes a lot of sense for agencies to turn to \ncontractors because they are able to perform certain functions more \nefficiently than the agencies could themselves. That is in everybody's \ninterest, including the taxpayers'. However, in many cases, experience \nhas shown Federal employees can perform the work just as efficiently or \nmore efficiently than the contractors and deserve the right to bid when \nwork is proposed to be outsourced. Additionally, agencies must ensure \nthat inherently governmental work--in other words, work which is \nintimately related to the public interest--is performed by Federal \nemployees and not by private contractors. That is why the Government \nwas created.\n  The process for deciding when to outsource jobs has to be a careful \none, it has to be fair to contractors, and it has to be fair to Federal \nemployees. Of course, it has to be fair, most of all, to America's \ntaxpayers.\n  The Kennedy amendment provides Federal employees the same right \ncontractors currently possess to appeal outsourcing decisions. In other \nwords, when a particular function is proposed for outsourcing, open to \nbidding by private contractors, there is a process--and a good one--\nthat has been created where Federal employees themselves may bid \nagainst those contractors for that outsourcing work. What the Kennedy \namendment says is Federal employees should have the same rights \ncontractors have to appeal outsourcing decisions. Why just have one of \nthe competitors for the outsourcing have the right to appeal and the \nother one does not? To me, that is simply a fundamental issue of \nfairness.\n  The amendment also contains a provision to ensure that contractors \ncompeting for Department of Defense work do not receive an unfair \nadvantage because they offer inferior health or retirement benefits to \nwhat we are offering to Federal employees. I do not think any Member of \nthis Chamber would want employees of the Department of Defense to be at \na disadvantage in competing for their jobs because they receive health \nand retirement benefits that we authorize and ordain from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  This amendment also addresses a concern I have had for quite a long \ntime; that is, it sometimes appears as if the Office of Management and \nBudget pushes agencies to meet arbitrary numerical targets for the \noutsourcing of jobs. Decisions on outsourcing should be made on a case-\nby-case basis where it makes sense for agencies to outsource the jobs \nas opposed to giving them a quota of outsourcing and say they have to \nhit that quota.\n  Arbitrary numerical targets, I am afraid, take agencies off the path \nof pursuing other means of cutting costs. They overtax agencies already \nstruggling to monitor work performed by contractors. I believe they \nsometimes, without cause, undermine the civil service, which we ought \nto be elevating as it is elevated in so many of the other \nindustrialized developed democracies. Those types of numerical targets \nwere prohibited by Congress in the fiscal year 2003 Omnibus \nappropriations bill, but the Office of Management and Budget seems to \nbe continuing to pressure agencies to conduct competitions between \nFederal employees and contractors on a certain number of jobs each \nyear. That is not right. The amendment before us makes clear that use \nof such quotas at the Department of Defense is impermissible.\n  These are all, in my opinion, sensible, modest reforms. They do not \nand they are not intended to prohibit the outsourcing of Federal jobs, \nwhich I support when it makes sense, but, rather, ensure that the \nprocess is objective, fair. It essentially puts both parties here on a \nlevel playing field.\n  The core provisions of this amendment have, in fact, received \nbipartisan support in the Senate over the last few years. I hope we can \ncontinue that support when the amendment comes to the vote today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S12354]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2905\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity to say \na few words about an amendment I have offered, No. 2905, that is \ncosponsored by Senators Sununu, Kerry, Harkin, and Brown. This \namendment addresses a problem that is huge, that is going to continue \nto grow in coming years, and is something the Congress must address. \nAll across our country, veterans of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan are \ngoing to come home with what we believe to be very high levels of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder as well as traumatic brain injury. These are \nthe signature injuries of the war in Iraq. I worry very much that we \nare not yet prepared to address this serious problem which not only \nimpacts the returning soldiers, it impacts their wives, their kids, and \ntheir communities.\n  The amendment I have offered would develop a pilot program for State-\nbased outreach to assist servicemembers and their families. The concern \nI have is that those who return home with TBI or PTSD are not going to \nget the care they need unless somebody makes contact with them and \nmakes them aware of services and help that might be available. We can \nhave all of the money we want allocated to addressing TBI or PTSD, but \nunless somebody goes out and brings those people into the system, that \nmoney is not going to do any good. I worry about that, especially for \nthose returning soldiers who are in the National Guard who are not part \nof the active duty, who do not have a military infrastructure in front \nof them. I worry about soldiers coming home to small towns in Vermont \nand all across this country who suddenly find that their world is very \ndifferent than the world they left, that they have nightmares, cold \nsweats, panic attacks when they go through a tunnel, and they don't \nknow how to address those very serious symptoms of post-traumatic \nstress disorder.\n  What this amendment does uniquely is create an outreach effort by \nwhich trained personnel from the National Guard or elsewhere are \nliterally going to knock on doors and chat with the individual \nreturning soldier and his or her family and get a sense of what is \ngoing on in the family, letting those veterans understand that what \nthey are experiencing is something being experienced by tens of \nthousands of other soldiers, and there is nothing to be ashamed of \nabout the kinds of problems that individual is having.\n  The essence of this program is its nature as an outreach effort, not \nto sit back but to aggressively go out, knock on doors, have dialog, \nand bring people into the system which might be able to help them.\n  This amendment is supported by the National Guard Association of the \nUnited States. They have pointed out that this amendment, with its \nunique emphasis on outreach, is a perfect compliment to the \nreintegration and readjustment policies laid out by the Yellow Ribbon \nProgram in the previously adopted Chambliss amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  This is a very strong amendment. I look forward to having support on \nboth sides of the aisle. If we are serious about addressing the \nproblems of PTSD and TBI, we have to be aggressive in outreach. That is \nwhat this amendment does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. KYL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12354-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12354-S12372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                  COST OF PRIVATE SECURITY CONTRACTORS\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, the recent incident in which \nBlackwater USA reportedly killed at least 11 Iraqis and wounded several \nothers has prompted a long overdue examination of the role that private \nsecurity contractors are playing in Iraq. An article in today's \nWashington Post titled ``U.S. Pays Steep Price for Private Security in \nIraq'' helps to highlight the exorbitant mark-up that private security \ncontractors are reportedly charging the U.S. Government.\n  Last week, the Senate accepted an amendment to the Defense Department \nauthorization bill that I offered that will require Federal departments \nto report information to Congress on the total number of contractors in \nIraq and Afghanistan, the companies awarded these contracts, and the \ncost of the contracts. The provisions of the amendment are drawn from \nthe Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security \nContracting Act, S. 674, that I introduced in February.\n  The American people have a right to know how their tax dollars are \nbeing spent in Iraq and the role that security contractors are playing \nin that conflict. We need to make sure that security contractors in \nIraq are subject to adequate and transparent oversight and that their \nactions do not have a negative impact on our efforts to bring the war \nin Iraq to a responsible end.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record the text of the article from the \nWashington Post.\n  The article follows.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 1, 2007]\n\n           U.S. Pays Steep Price for Private Security in Iraq\n\n                           (By Walter Pincus)\n\n       It costs the U.S. government a lot more to hire contract \n     employees as security guards in Iraq than to use American \n     troops.\n       It comes down to the simple business equation of every \n     transaction requiring a profit.\n       The contract that Blackwater Security Consulting signed in \n     March 2004 with Regency Hotel and Hospital of Kuwait for a \n     34-person security team offers a view into the private-\n     security business world. The contract was made public last \n     week by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee \n     majority staff as part of its report on Blackwater's actions \n     related to an incident in Fallujah on March 31, 2004, when \n     four members of the company's security team were killed in an \n     ambush.\n       Understanding the contract's details requires some \n     background: Regency was a subcontractor to another company, \n     ESS Support Services Worldwide, of Cyprus, that was providing \n     food and catering supplies to U.S. armed forces in Fallujah \n     and other cities in Iraq. And ESS was a subcontractor to KBR, \n     a subsidiary of Halliburton, which had the prime contract \n     with the Defense Department.\n       So, Blackwater was a subcontractor to Regency, which was a \n     subcontractor to ESS, which was a subcontractor to \n     Halliburton's KBR subsidiary, the prime contractor for the \n     Pentagon--and each company along the way was in business to \n     make a profit.\n       Under the contract, Regency was to pay Blackwater \n     $11,082,326 for one year, with a second year option, to put \n     together a 34-person team that would provide security \n     services for the ``movement of ESS's staff, management and \n     workforce throughout Kuwait and Iraq and across country \n     borders including the borders of Iraq, Kuwait, Turkey and \n     Jordan.''\n       Blackwater's personnel were to do more than just convoy \n     security. They were also to run command centers in Kuwait and \n     Iraq 24 hours a day, seven days a week, that were to control \n     all ESS security operations; prepare risk assessments; \n     develop security procedures; train ESS personnel in security; \n     and even vet other Iraqi security forces hired by Regency.\n       But their main role was to provide ``tactically sound and \n     fully mission capable protective security details, the \n     minimum team size [being] six operators with a minimum of two \n     vehicles to support ESS movements.''\n       Blackwater's pricing was to be on ``a per person support \n     basis, not including costs for housing, subsistence, vehicles \n     and large equipment items,'' according to the contract. The \n     team would be made up of two senior managers, 12 middle \n     managers and 20 operators.\n       Regency was to provide Blackwater personnel with housing \n     and necessities, including meals, as well as office space and \n     administrative support. In addition, Regency would provide \n     basic equipment, including vehicles and heavy weapons, while \n     Blackwater was responsible for purchasing individual weapons \n     and ammunition.\n       According to data provided to the House panel, the average \n     per-day pay to personnel Blackwater hired was $600. According \n     to the schedule of rates, supplies and services attached to \n     the contract, Blackwater charged Regency $1,075 a day for \n     senior managers, $945 a day for middle managers and $815 a \n     day for operators.\n       Acording to data provided to the House panel, Regency \n     charged ESS an average of $1,100 a day for the same people. \n     How the Blackwater and Regency security charges were passed \n     on by ESS to Halliburton's KBR cannot easily be determined \n     since the catering company was paid on a per-meal basis, with \n     security being a percentage of that charge.\n       Halliburton's KBR blended its security costs into the \n     blanket costs passed on to the Defense Department.\n       How much more these costs are compared with the pay of U.S. \n     troops is easier to determine.\n\n[[Page S12355]]\n\n       An unmarried sergeant given Iraq pay and relief from U.S. \n     taxes makes about $83 to $85 a day, given time in service. A \n     married sergeant with children makes about double that, $170 \n     a day.\n       Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in \n     Baghdad overseeing more than 160,000 U.S. troops, makes \n     roughly $180,000 a year, or about $493 a day. That comes out \n     to less than half the fee charged by Blackwater for its \n     senior manager of a 34-man security team.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, when it comes to running the Federal \nGovernment and its workforce, the Bush administration is driven too \nmuch by ideology and not enough by common sense. In its quest to \nscuttle a civil service system that has served us well during peace \ntime and war, the administration has embarked on an unprecedented \ncampaign to privatize what most would agree are ``inherently \ngovernmental'' functions.\n  The Office of Management and Budget, OMB, has spearheaded \nprivatization, claiming it can save taxpayers money. One example: \nrelinquishing tax collection to private contractors. In May 2007, OMB \nclaimed that contracting out Internal Revenue Service, IRS, debt \ncollection to private contractors resulted in saving $35 million in \nfiscal year 2006. OMB failed to mention that the contractor had missed \nseveral deadlines imposed under the contract, leaving IRS employees to \nperform the bulk of the work. Another concern about that particular \ncontract: our Government is turning over sensitive and private \nfinancial information entrusted to it by its citizens and placing that \ninformation in the hands of private debt collectors with grave \npotential for abuse.\n  An article from the February 3, 2007, New York Times neatly \nsummarizes the situation: ``Without a public debate or formal policy \ndecision, contractors have become a virtual fourth branch of \ngovernment. On the rise for decades, spending on federal contracts has \nsoared during the Bush Administration, to about $400 billion last year \nfrom $207 billion in 2000, fueled by the war in Iraq, domestic security \nand Hurricane Katrina, but also by a philosophy that encourages \noutsourcing almost everything government does.'' This unofficial branch \nof Government is not subject to the same checks and balances of \naccountability found in the civil service system.\n  The true cost of the executive branch's decision to privatize is the \ncountless number of dedicated and highly trained Federal workers who \nwill seek employment elsewhere rather than face the uncertainty of \nworking in an environment that is subject to the political whims of an \nadministration that pursues ideology over common sense and sound \nbusiness policies. Even worse, such a hostile atmosphere will deter \nhighly skilled candidates from ever considering public service, thereby \ndepriving the public sector of the best and brightest who would \notherwise seek careers in public service.\n  Left unchecked, this notion that the Federal Government is divisible \nand its functions can be auctioned off to the lowest bidder will \nultimately deprive us of an experienced Federal workforce and the \ninstitutional memory that are essential for the Government to function \neffectively, especially in a crisis. We don't need each new contractor \nto start from scratch reinventing the wheel when old problems arise.\n  At a minimum, Federal employees should be allowed to compete with \nprivate contractors on an equal footing, which is where the Kennedy-\nMikulski amendment comes in.\n  Currently, the contracting rules as spelled out in OMB Circular A-76 \nare overwhelmingly weighed in favor of contractors and against Federal \nemployees. This amendment will correct inequities in the public-private \ncompetitive process at the Department of Defense, DOD, to ensure that \nhardworking civilian defense employees are not unfairly deprived of \ntheir jobs. It will also provide basic protection from unfair \ncompetition for other Federal employees at other agencies.\n  The amendment excludes the costs of health and retirement benefits \nfrom bids in public-private competitions, so contractors are not \nrewarded for providing bad benefits or even no benefits at all. \nContractors currently have an incentive to shortchange their employees' \nbenefits to gain an unfair advantage in bidding for Government work. \nThe amendment would eliminate this incentive.\n  The amendment prohibits the use of ``privatization quotas.'' It is \nunlawful for OMB to set quotas for the amount of work that agencies \nshould outsource away from the Federal workforce, but there is \nsubstantial evidence that the administration has a de facto quota \nsystem. The amendment would protect agencies' independent \ndecisionmaking by requiring that any decision to conduct a public-\nprivate competition be wholly independent of OMB.\n  The amendment allows Federal employees the same appeal rights as \ncontractors. When Federal employees win a privatization review, \ncontractors can have the agency's decision reviewed by independent \nthird parties, by appealing to the Government Accountability Office, \nGAO, or the Court of Federal Claims. Federal employees currently have \nno such appeal rights.\n  The amendment requires DOD to issue long overdue guidance on \noutsourcing Federal jobs. These guidelines were due in January, but DOD \nhas failed to act. The amendment requires DOD to issue this guidance.\n  Finally, the amendment provides a fair opportunity to renew contracts \nwon by Federal employees. Currently, DOD requires managers to ``re-\ncompete'' contracts that are won by Federal employees at the end of \neach contract term, rather than extending the contract. But the same \nmanagers have discretion to extend contracts for jobs that are awarded \nto private contractors without reopening them to competition. The \namendment gives managers discretion to extend contracts awarded to \npublic employees.\n  We can and should have a discussion about the proper role of \nGovernment, and we should try to make the Government as efficient as \npossible. What we shouldn't do is carve it up and outsource its \nessential functions willy-nilly to politically favored contractors. \nThere is money at stake but much more too. The Kennedy-Mikulski \namendment is a proper way to proceed with regard to public-private \ncompetitions, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

REPORT ON FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A DOMESTIC \n                   MILITARY AVIATION NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than March 31, 2008, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report to determine the feasibility of \n     establishing a Border State Aviation Training Center (BSATC) \n     to support the current and future requirements of the \n     existing RC-26 training site for counterdrug activities, \n     located at the Fixed Wing Army National Guard Aviation \n     Training Site (FWAATS), including the domestic reconnaissance \n     and surveillance missions of the National Guard in support of \n     local State, and Federal law enforcement agencies, provided \n     that the activities to be conducted at the BSATC shall not \n     duplicate or displace any activity or program at the C-26 \n     training site or the FWAATS.\n       (b) Content.--The report required under subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (1) examine the current and past requirements of RC-26 \n     aircraft in support of local, State, and Federal law \n     enforcement and determine the number of additional aircraft \n     required to provide such support for each State that borders \n     Canada, Mexico, or the Gulf of Mexico;\n       (2) determine the number of military and civilian personnel \n     required to run a RC-26 domestic training center meeting the \n     requirements identified under paragraph (1); and\n       (3) determine the requirements and cost of locating such a \n     training center at a military installation for the purpose of \n     preempting and responding to security threats and responding \n     to crises; and\n       (4) include a comprehensive review of the number of \n     intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance platforms \n     needed for the National Guard to effectively provide domestic \n     operations and civil support (including homeland defense and \n     counterdrug) to local, State, and Federal law enforcement and \n     first responder entities.\n         (c) Consultation.--In preparing the report required under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense shall consult with \n     the Adjutant General of each State that borders Canada, \n     Mexico, or the Gulf of Mexico, the Adjutant General of the \n     State of West Virginia, and the National Guard Bureau.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2905\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I rise today in favor of the Sanders \namendment, No. 2905, to the Department of Defense authorization bill, \nwhich would establish a pilot program aimed at providing essential care \nand services to National Guard soldiers returning home from duty.\n  Back in the fall of 2004, the New Hampshire National Guard was one of \nthe first Guard units to recognize the unique difficulties encountered \nby guardsmen and women returning from combat operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. In response, the Guard led the way in addressing these \nconcerns by establishing its own reunion and reentry program, which \nemploys innovative solutions to cope with the difficult transition to \nlife at home.\n  Under the reentry program, soldiers and their families receive \nmultiple counseling sessions and an introduction to the array of \nservices available to them within the first 36 hours of returning home. \nThe program works to ensure that servicemembers and their families \nrecognize that they are not alone and that the Guard is committed to \nproviding the care and assistance they need after returning from \ndeployment.\n  This program has proven to be enormously successful, and has become a \nmodel for other States, due in part because it removes the burden of \nseeking and requesting care from the individual soldier. I am proud of \nthe leadership role New Hampshire's National Guard has taken in \ncombating this very serious problem.\n  I am pleased the Senate adopted the Sanders amendment to provide \nsupport that will allow other States to establish programs similar to \nNew Hampshire's.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this juncture, I think the Senator from \nMichigan and I might commend our staffs for doing a lot of diligent \nwork through a good part of the weekend to achieve this package of \namendments. I think this adds up to about 180 amendments we have done \nnow. So much of that work is done by our magnificent professional \nstaff, many of whom have been on the Armed Services Committee for \nnumbers of years.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, Senator Warner, for \nthat suggestion. This is a good moment to do that before we have a vote \nlater on the bill. Our staffs, as always, put in an amazing amount of \ntime--in the evenings, mornings, over weekends--in order for us to get \nthrough hundreds of amendments.\n  Actually, the Senator is right. I think there were 180 cleared \namendments and about 35 amendments that\n\n[[Page S12364]]\n\nhave been disposed of separately one way or another.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, over 180 amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So I do not know if we set a record because my good friend \nfrom Virginia probably is the record-holder--and probably more than \nonce. But, I say to the Senator, we are going to try to get to where \nyou have been. We are going to try harder.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, where have you been?\n  Mr. LEVIN. With you every time. But when you were chairman and you--\n  Mr. WARNER. We have both been chairman of this committee, Mr. \nPresident, three times.\n  Mr. LEVIN. One time each, I think, for 18 days.\n  But, in any event, I thank our staffs.\n  I thank my friend for raising this issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the indulgence of our \ndistinguished Presiding Officer and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I withhold the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I, too, join in thanking our chairman and \nranking member, Senator Levin and Senator Warner, for all of their \ncooperation during the consideration of a number of amendments we have \noffered these past days. It is typical of their service and their \nthoughtfulness. They are serious legislators. We are fortunate to have \nthem dealing with these issues of such importance and consequence for \nour national security. I am grateful to them both.\n  I wish to take a few moments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Massachusetts yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts has been on \nthis committee for more than two decades, and there is no one who works \nharder and more diligently. I wish there were more programs on which we \nhad a concurrence of philosophy and policy, but nevertheless I say to \nthe Senator, you are a very prodigious worker.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I could add one word on that subject, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts is not only about as diligent a Senator \nas one can imagine, but he has had great success on this particular \nbill. I do not know how he manages to keep all the balls in the air \nthat he does, including the CHIP program, immigration, and so many \nother issues. But he has had an extraordinary success on this \nparticular bill, and it is a real tribute to him--this bill--for many \nreasons.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, as was described earlier on the floor with the \nchairman of the committee, on last Friday, there are important \nprovisions dealing with refugees, particularly the select refugees who \nhave been the ones who have been so associated with the American effort \nin Iraq.\n  We have differences in this body on the overall policy in Iraq, but I \nthink all of us admire those extraordinary individuals who worked, in \nmany instances, as translators for the American servicemen and risked \ntheir lives. Many of them lost their lives in this effort. A number of \nothers who had worked with American forces now have their lives \nthreatened, for which there is a sense of urgency. The amendment was \naccepted by both Senator Levin and Senator Warner. We are hopeful it \nwill result in saving lives. Also, there are individuals who, by their \nreligious beliefs, were being persecuted as well.\n  So this was a small amendment, but it will make a big difference. I \nthank them for their help and assistance on that amendment and a number \nof other items on our hate crimes legislation, and others.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3058\n\n  Mr. President, one of the pending amendments is the amendment offered \nby Senator Mikulski and myself, and that is an amendment that affects \nworkers. In this case, we are talking about Defense Department workers. \nOf those 640,000 Defense Department workers, we are talking about a \nthird of those workers who have proudly served in the Armed Forces of \nour country. They have worn the uniform of our country, acquired \nvarious skills, and then have come back and now are serving in the \nDefense Department in a wide variety of areas--in information and \ninformation technologies, in supplies, in technology and safety \nequipment--a wide variety of areas. They are using their skills--which \nthey had--their patriotism, their dedication to service to this country \nand are doing so with great skill and determination.\n  It means a lot to those who are in the Armed Forces to know they have \na backup, first of all by their families, but secondly by skilled men \nand women who are going to make sure they have the best in technology, \nthe best in terms of equipment, and that they are going to be able to \ndo their job in the way they were trained. Those are the Defense \nDepartment employees.\n  Now, we have found in recent times as to those employees that their \nfutures have been put at risk. They have been put at risk because of a \nchange in the rules and regulations for what they call outsourcing, the \nbidding for various contracts. These workers are highly skilled, highly \nprofessional, and they are prepared to compete on a level playing field \nwith any group of workers--public or private sector--and do so, and do \nso well, do it skillfully, and also do it in a way that is going to \nsave the American taxpayer resources. But what is added to the bid in \nvarious contracts is the fact that these Federal employees have health \ninsurance and also have some retirement benefits.\n  In this country now we are facing a health care crisis. We hear \nDemocratic candidates for President talk about it, Republican \ncandidates talk about it, business leaders, leaders of the trade union \nmovement talk about it. We were spending $1.3 trillion 6 years ago; we \nare now spending $2.3 trillion. We have increased the spending by $1 \ntrillion, and 8 million Americans have lost their health insurance--8 \nmillion. It would be more than that if we didn't have the SCHIP \nprogram. That is another issue for another time, when it will be more \nthan that.\n  So we are in real danger of seeing middle-class families lose both \ntheir retirement in terms of their pensions, as well as their health \ninsurance. Now we have the regulations of the Department of Defense \nthat are accelerating that. Effectively, what they are saying is, if we \nhave good competition between the government bid and the private bid, \nthe fact that we have health insurance and retirement, it is going to \nmake the total cost somewhat higher and therefore the award will go to \nthe private bid. This is sending a powerful message to these private \ncontractors: Don't even think of providing any services, health care, \nfor the families of your workers. Don't think about retirement. Don't \nthink about anything because you can win contracts against those who \nare working in the Defense Department who are providing those benefits. \nThat is basically unfair.\n  This competition ought to be for the cost of providing the services. \nWho can do that more efficiently? We don't want to rush to the bottom--\na race to the bottom--and that is what we are having at this time, and \nthat is wrong. That is wrong, and it is unfair. If we continue that, we \nare going to find out we are going to have not tens of thousands, but \nwe are going to have hundreds of thousands of people who are going to \nsee that their insurance is lost.\n  This isn't just the employees. If we look at the private contractor, \none private contractor was going for a bid, another was bidding for it, \nand at the present time, if that were the circumstance today, the \nresponsible contractor who is looking out for their employees with \nhealth insurance for the families and with a retirement program, they \nwould be somewhat higher than the cost of providing service by the \nirresponsible contractor, and they would lose out. So it isn't only the \nworkers who are working in the Defense Department but also responsible \ncontractors who are providing services for their employees and who \nrespect their employees.\n  If we don't accept this amendment, we are going to see a continuing \nrush to the bottom where it is going to be virtually impossible to get \nthese independent contractors to provide any of the kinds of services \nto these families who are working in this country. That isn't what we \nought to have in terms of the Defense Department rules.\n\n[[Page S12365]]\n\n  Finally, as I pointed out earlier, but it is worth mentioning again, \nsome of the other provisions that basically work for the unfairness of \nthose who are working in the Defense Department. If there is an unfair \ndecision, the private contractors can appeal that, but the workers over \nhere cannot. That isn't fair. This amendment is about fairness, \ntreating people fairly.\n  Renew a contract without recompetition, they can do that. Private \ncontractors can do it, but if the Federal workers have that contract, \nthey can't do it. We find out for the most competitive bid, there are \nadministrative rules and regulations that prohibit Federal employees \nfrom getting the lowest competitive bid. They know how to do it, they \nwant to do it; nonetheless, they are denied the opportunity to do it.\n  Then we have these quotas that are set by OMB, which is not right. \nThey establish so many contractors and so much is virtually prohibited, \nbut it has grown into a practice at the present time.\n  So this amendment is very much about fairness. It is about how we are \ngoing to treat people who are part of the whole Defense establishment. \nAnd they are these workers, and they are indispensable. A great \npercentage of them have been a part of the military and have served \nwith great distinction for many years. They want to continue that sense \nof patriotism, continue that sense of service, continue that sense of \ngiving. The men and women who are in the Armed Forces know they can \nrely on the quality of the work that the individuals do because these \nindividuals are highly motivated, highly trained, have been in the \nservice, many of them have served for many years, come out of the \nservice, have skills, and say: What I would like to do for the rest of \nmy career is to be able to continue to give support to those who are on \nthe front lines, and they do it. They do it with great distinction, and \nthey do it with great expertise and with extraordinary patriotism.\n  All they are asking for is to have a fair system, to give them a fair \nshake. Give them some respect. Give them the respect they deserve, that \nthey should have. Give some respect for their families as well.\n  So I hope very much we will have good support for this amendment. As \nI mentioned earlier in those particular provisions that we put up about \ndisparities between the private contractors and the employees, we have \nhad strong bipartisan support for just about every one of those \nprovisions, but they have been put on appropriations in the past, and \ntherefore at the time the appropriation expires, these provisions \nexpire. Now we are back to try to revisit this once again. So there is \na strong and compelling reason for this amendment.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman and so many of our cosponsors, including \nSenator Mikulski who has spoken so well and who has been such a strong \nadvocate, and so many of our colleagues who have supported the \ndifferent provisions on both sides of the aisle. Hopefully, we will \nhave a strong vote in an hour from now for those workers.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise to support the Kennedy \namendment because, frankly, it makes fiscal sense. There has been in \nthis administration a rush to contract. They never saw any function of \ngovernment that somehow they didn't believe would be better off in the \nprivate sector. I am not opposed to privatization just for the sake of \nbeing opposed to privatization. I have no problem with contracting, if \nit is going to save taxpayers' money and we are still going to get \nquality work on behalf of taxpayers from those contractors working in \ngovernment. But if we have learned anything over the last 6 years, we \nhave learned that you don't always get a good deal when you contract.\n  I know we have spent a lot of time talking over the last few weeks \nabout the contracting that went on in Iraq, and I will not dwell on \nthat here, but it is exhibit A of how badly government sometimes does \nin the name of saving money when it enters into private contracts.\n  So what this amendment says is pretty simple, and it is kind of what \nauditors say over and over again until people want us to be quiet; that \nis, compete, compete, compete. Not only should these contracts be \ncompetitive among potential contractors, they must be competitive with \nthe government workers who are currently doing the work. There have \nbeen many examples of where, in the name of saving money, someone was \nhired to do the job, and it ended up costing us more than had the \ngovernment employees remained on the job. That is just the basics of \nthis amendment.\n  This is nothing new. This has been in a number of Defense \nappropriations bills, and it is in effect for the Department of \nDefense. The A-76 rule, which this is called, is now currently the law \nwithin the Department of Defense. This will extend it, codify it, make \nit uniform across the Federal Government. If you are going to contract \nout, then the employees have a right to participate in that \ncompetition. And if the employees of government can show they can do \nthe job, as they have been doing, and they can do it for less money \nthan the private contractor, then they should get the award in that \nparticular competition.\n  This is a way to not only make sure we are not getting rid of the \nexpertise we have in government, it is also a way to reinforce how \nimportant competition is. We have had competitions that have \nmasqueraded as real competitions in this administration a number of \ntimes. This will make sure we are getting the best value for that very \nprecious taxpayer dollar. They are going to have to demonstrate that \nthe contract is going to save money in order for the contract to be put \nout to a private entity as opposed to government employees.\n  I think it is a very solid amendment in terms of watching out for \ntaxpayer money. I know it is characterized that this is to protect \ngovernment employees. It is not. It is called protecting taxpayers' \nmoney. That is why I think this amendment is so important. That is why \nI hope my colleagues will join together to strike another blow on \nbehalf of fiscal accountability and making sure we treat taxpayers' \nmoney with respect and deference and making sure we are spending it \nvery wisely.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to rise in support of the pending \namendment by Senator Kennedy on public-private competition. Sometimes \nthis amendment is described as the Kennedy-Mikulski or the Mikulski-\nKennedy amendment. Both Senators deserve a great deal of credit for \ntheir support.\n  The Department of Defense has allowed its workforce of civilian \nemployees to atrophy to the point of a human capital crisis. Since \nfiscal year 2000, the number of contractor employees under DOD service \ncontracts has roughly doubled, while the number of DOD civilian \nemployees has remained virtually unchanged. As a result, the Department \nof Defense has found in area after area--acquisition management, \nfinancial management, even security and intelligence--it must now rely \nupon contractors to perform functions that were formerly performed by \nFederal employees.\n  These adverse trends have been exacerbated by an administration that \nhas consistently pushed to have more Federal work performed in the \nprivate sector. In 2001, the Office of Management and Budget \nestablished a goal of subjecting half of the work performed by Federal \nemployees to private sector competition within 4 years. While the \nadministration subsequently backed off of this Government-wide goal, \nOMB continues to establish agency-specific goals, and to grade agencies \non their performance in converting work to private sector performance.\n  The Kennedy-Mikulski amendment would end this artificial effort to \ndrive contracts to the private sector by codifying a commonsense set of \nrules that govern competition between Federal employees and private \ncontractors.\n  Some of these rules have already been enacted through appropriations \nacts in previous Congresses. The Kennedy-Mikulski amendment would make \nthese rules permanent law. Others have\n\n[[Page S12366]]\n\nalready been enacted for the DOD. The Kennedy-Mikulski amendment would \nmake these provisions Government-wide.\n  I wish to focus on one provision of the amendment which addresses a \nfundamental element of fairness in competition between the private and \npublic sectors. OMB circular A-76, which governs public-private \ncompetitions, establishes rules for what happens after one side or the \nother wins a competition. If the private sector wins a competition, the \nwork stays in the private sector forever. If the public sector wins, \nhowever, the work must be subject to a new competition within 5 years. \nAttachment B to OMB circular A-76 specifically states that if the \npublic sector competitor wins a competition, ``an agency shall complete \nanother . . . competition of the activity by the end of the last \nperformance period'' in the performance agreement.\n  This rule is fundamentally unfair. It also undermines the morale of \nFederal civilian employees by contributing to the view of civil \nservants as second-class citizens. At a time when the Department of \nDefense should be recruiting thousands of new civilian employees to \naddress a human capital crisis, the rule is clearly contrary to the \nDepartment's own interests.\n  The Kennedy-Mikulski amendment would address this problem by stating \nthat OMB may not require the Department of Defense to conduct a new \npublic-private competition within any specified period of time after \nthe public sector wins a competition. That is the right answer. DOD's \nhuman capital policies should be driven by the Department's human \ncapital needs--not by arbitrary policies established by the Office of \nManagement and Budget. So I hope our colleagues will support the \nKennedy-Mikulski amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week, the Senate adopted a historic \namendment offered by Senators Webb, McCaskill, and others, to establish \nan independent commission to review the many problems with fraud, \nwaste, and abuse that have arisen in Iraq relative to contracting and \nto give us recommendations on how we can avoid similar problems in the \nfuture. I wish to commend the Senators that were involved in this \neffort for the leadership they showed in drafting this amendment and \ngetting it adopted by the Senate.\n  The Department of Defense faces huge problems in its acquisition \nsystem today. Over the last few years, we have seen an alarming lack of \nacquisition planning across the Department; the excessive use of \ncontracts that make open-ended commitments of DOD funds; and a \npervasive failure to perform contract oversight and management \nfunctions necessary to protect taxpayers' interest. These problems have \nbeen particularly acute in Iraq and Afghanistan, but they are in no way \nlimited to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The contracting commission established pursuant to the Webb-McCaskill \namendment should help us identify the sources of these problems and \nprovide us with constructive recommendations to avoid similar problems \nin the future.\n  In addition to the commission language adopted last week, there are \nsignificant acquisition reform measures already in this bill, as it \ncame to the floor, that will make improvements in the DOD acquisition \nsystem and to wartime contracting. Taken together, these provisions \nwill make the bill that is now before the Senate, by far, the most \nsignificant acquisition reform measure to be considered by Congress \nsince the enactment of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act and the \nFederal Acquisition Reform Act more than 10 years ago.\n  For example, section 821 of the bill would require increased \ncompetition in large ``umbrella contracts'' awarded by the Department \nof Defense. The Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing in April \non the Department of Defense management of the $20 billion so-called \nLOGCAP contract, under which a company called KBR--until recently, a \nsubsidiary of Halliburton--has provided services to U.S. troops in the \nfield.\n  Here are some of the things we learned in our hearing:\n  The company was given work that appears to have far exceeded the \nscope of the contract; all of this added work was provided to the \ncontractor without competition; the contractor resisted providing us \nwith information that we needed to monitor and control costs; there \nwere almost $2 billion of overcharges on the contract; and the \ncontractor received highly favorable settlements on these overcharges.\n  When asked why the Army had waited 5 years to split the massive \nLOGCAP contract among multiple contractors, allowing for greater \ncompetition of the work to be performed under the contract, the \nAssistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Technology, and \nLogistics gave the following answer: ``I don't have a good answer for \nyou.''\n  The provision in our bill would avoid the kind of abuses we get in \nsole-source contracts by ensuring that future contracts of this type \nprovide for the competition of task and delivery orders unless there is \na compelling reason not to do so. If our language stays intact, we \nshould never again see the kind of abuses which existed with the \nHalliburton-KBR umbrella contracts.\n  Similarly, section 871 of the bill would require tighter regulation \nand control over private security contractors operating in areas of \ncombat operations. Over the last 4 years, there has been a number of \nreports of abuses by private security contractors operating in Iraq. \nThere have been allegations, even films, of contractors shooting \nrecklessly at civilians as they drive down the streets of Baghdad and \nother Iraqi cities. Some of these contractors work for the Department \nof Defense, but many others work for other Federal agencies or for \ncontractors of other Federal agencies.\n  Most recently, the Iraqi Government has complained about an incident \nin which employees of Blackwater allegedly opened fire on innocent \nIraqis in downtown Baghdad. According to published reports, Blackwater \nemployees shot into a crush of cars, killing at least 11 Iraqis and \nwounding 12. Blackwater officials insist their guards were ambushed, \nbut witnesses described this shooting as unprovoked, and Iraq's \nInterior Ministry has concluded that Blackwater was at fault.\n  Last week, the Washington Post reported that senior military \nofficials are deeply concerned about this shootout and other similar \nincidents which could undermine our efforts to combat terrorists and \ninsurgents in Iraq. This is what the Washington Post article reported:\n\n       ``The military is very sensitive to its relationship that \n     they've built with the Iraqis being altered or even severely \n     degraded by actions such as this event''. . . .\n       ``This is a nightmare,'' said a senior U.S. military \n     official. ``We had guys who saw the aftermath, and it was \n     very bad. This is going to hurt us badly. It may be worse \n     than Abu Ghraib, and it comes at a time when we're trying to \n     have an impact for the long term''. . . .\n       In interviews involving a dozen U.S. military and \n     government officials, many expressed . . . concern over the \n     shootings. . . .\n       ``This is a big mess that I don't think anyone has their \n     hands around yet,'' said another U.S. military official. \n     ``It's not necessarily a bad thing these guys are being held \n     accountable. Iraqis hate them, the troops don't particularly \n     care for them, and they tend to have a know-it-all attitude, \n     which means they rarely listen to anyone--even the folks that \n     patrol the ground on a daily basis.''\n       ``Their tendency is shoot first and ask questions later,'' \n     said an Army lieutenant colonel serving in Iraq. Referring to \n     the September 16 shootings, the officer added, ``None of us \n     believe they were engaged, but we are all carrying their \n     black eyes.''\n       ``Many of my peers think Blackwater is oftentimes out of \n     control,'' said a senior U.S. commander serving in Iraq. \n     ``They often act like cowboys over here . . . not seeming to \n     play by the same rules everybody else tries to play by.''\n\n  The provision in our bill would address this problem by ensuring that \nthe Department of Defense and its combatant commanders are in a \nposition to regulate the conduct of all armed contractors in the battle \nspace, regardless of whether they are employed under contracts of the \nDepartment of Defense or other Federal agencies. Under the provision in \nour bill, private security contractors employed by any Federal agency \nor any contractor or subcontractor for a Federal agency would be\n\n[[Page S12367]]\n\nrequired for the first time to comply with DOD rules on the use of \nforce and with orders, directions, and instructions issued by combatant \ncommanders relating to force protection, security, health, safety, or \nrelations and interaction with local nationals.\n  Other provisions in our bill would provide added protection for \ncontractor employees who blow the whistle on fraud, waste, and abuse. \nThey would require the DOD to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the \nbillions of dollars it spends every year to purchase contract services. \nOur bill will tighten rules for the acquisition of major weapons \nsystems; ensure that we get fair prices when we purchase spare parts \nfor those weapons systems; enhance competition requirements for \nproducts purchased from Federal prison industries; and address abuses \nof undefinitized contract actions.\n  The root cause of these and all the other problems that we read and \nhear so much about, or at least most of the other problems, in the \ndefense acquisition system is our failure to maintain an acquisition \nworkforce with the resources and skills that are needed to manage the \nDepartment's acquisition system.\n  Earlier this year, the Acquisition Advisory Panel, chartered pursuant \nto the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2004, \nreported that ``curtailed investments in human capital have produced an \nacquisition workforce that often lacks the training and resources to \nfunction effectively.'' And they went on:\n\n       The Federal Government does not have the capacity in its \n     current acquisition workforce necessary to meet the demands \n     that have been placed on it.\n\n  The failure of Department of Defense and other Federal agencies to \nadequately fund the acquisition workforce, the panel concluded, is `` \n`penny-wise and pound-foolish,' as it seriously undermines the pursuit \nof the good value for the expenditure of public resources.''\n  Senior DOD officials have recognized the deficiencies in the defense \nacquisition workforce, but they have been unable to obtain significant \nfunds that are needed to remedy the problem. Section 844 of our bill \nwill address this issue by establishing an acquisition workforce \ndevelopment fund to enable the Department of Defense to increase the \nsize and quality of its acquisition workforce. In the first year, we \nwill provide roughly $500 million for this purpose. It is a large sum \nof money, but it is a small investment to ensure the proper expenditure \nof more than $200 billion of taxpayers' money every year.\n  We look forward to working with the House conferees after we pass our \nbill, hopefully this evening, to make these important provisions on \nacquisition reform and the acquisition workforce the law of the land.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I want to speak on final \npassage of the bill. We are going to have that vote shortly. What is \nthe parliamentary procedure we are in?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently considering the \nKennedy amendment to the bill.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, if I may be recognized, I \nwill use these remarks to tell the Senate that it has been a pleasure \nto work with the chairman of the full committee, Senator Levin, who has \nconsistently given this Senator free rein as the chairman of the \nStrategic Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee.\n  What it looked like last winter was that all the thorny issues of \nnuclear weapons and the follow-on nuclear weapons and the question of \nnational missile defense, the strategic posture of the United States, \nwould get us all wound up around the axle. But it didn't turn out that \nway, and I want to give credit to my colleague, Senator Sessions, the \nranking member of our subcommittee, for working with me and the members \nof the committee in resolving these issues. What we worked out in \nsubcommittee, basically, is what is in the bill.\n  Although the administration would like to go ahead and start building \nnational missile defense sites in Eastern Europe, the fact is, they \nhaven't even worked it out with the countries involved in Eastern \nEurope. So what we did was we put a fence around any funding other than \nthe acquisition and the preparation of the land for such a site.\n  At the end of the day, there is going to have to be continued \nresearch and development should the need arise for locating those \nmissiles in Eastern Europe because they are not the same version that \nis in the silos in Alaska. That is a three-stage version; this is a \ntwo-stage version. And it is not the same missile or rocket; therefore, \nit has to go through all of its subsequent testing.\n  Now, General Obering just had a successful test a couple of days ago, \nand for that we want to congratulate him, but if the threat is the \nShahab missile from Iran shooting into Europe or into the United States \nwith a nuclear weapon on top of the rocket, if that is the reason to \nhave national missile defense in Eastern Europe, well, we just simply \ndon't know that Iran is going to have that capability. And as we \ncontinue to look at this on down the road, that is going to be an \nevaluation as to whether at the end of the day we are going to need \nthat national missile defense in Eastern Europe. But since we don't \nknow all those answers, we have provided in this bill that if they \nconcluded the agreement with those Eastern European countries, they can \ngo about the process of acquiring the land, the site, and the \npreparation of the site.\n  We also noted in our committee that they have not had tremendous \nsuccess with the airborne laser, and of the approximately $.5 billion \nthat they wanted to continue that program, we cut that program by $200 \nbillion and used that money elsewhere, in kinetic energy intercepts on \nthe boost phase of an intercontinental ballistic missile.\n  So those are just some of the things in here, and I want to thank all \nthe parties who worked with us to get a bipartisan resolution, which is \nthe way a Defense bill ought to be managed and ought to be passed, and \nwe have that this year, and I am very grateful.\n  Now, there is another part in here that Senator Levin and the ranking \nmember of the full committee approved, and I want to thank him for \nthat. That is the question of widows and orphans. Current law is that a \nservicemember pays for survivors benefits. They pay once they retire, \nand they pay for that benefit. It is like an insurance policy. On the \nother hand, there is another body of law in the Veterans' \nAdministration where there are survivors benefits for widows and \norphans. When the servicemember passes away, those two eligibilities, \nunder current law, cancel out each other, and that is not the way we \nought to be treating widows and orphans.\n  It was no less than President Lincoln who said, in his second \ninaugural address, that the mark of a country is how it treats the \nvictims of war, the widows and orphans. And taking care of the widows \nand orphans, in fact, is a cost of defense. It is a cost of doing \nbusiness in defense. Just like you buy tanks and airplanes and guns and \nmateriel, and so forth, taking care of not only the veterans is a cost \nof war, but taking care of their survivors is a cost of war too. This \nNation has long canceled out those two eligibilities, and it is time \nfor us to change this.\n  Because we were down at the end of our discussion of this bill last \nweek, I did not ask for a rollcall vote, as I had last year. Of course, \nthe rollcall was something like 95 to 3 in favor of the widows and \norphans, and we would have gotten some kind of a vote like that again. \nI was trying to accommodate my chairman and the ranking member in the \ncrush of business, and they were kind enough to put it into the \nmanagers' package. So this will become a conference item, where it is \nalways a question about money. A few years ago it was estimated that it \nwould cost an additional $9 billion over 10 years. That is now down to \nsomewhere in the range of about $7 billion or $8 billion over 10 years. \nSo when we get into the conference committee, this Senator is going to \ntry to find how\n\n[[Page S12368]]\n\nwe can get conferees to accept this provision.\n  So I come to the floor of the Senate to congratulate Senator Levin \nand Senator Warner, acting in the stead of Senator McCain as the \nranking member. What a pleasure it has been to deal with these \ngentlemen for the last 7 years as a member of this committee.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first, let me commend the Senator from \nFlorida. As chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee, with his ranking \nmember, the members of that subcommittee have worked through some of \nthe most difficult and thorny issues we faced on this bill this year, \nand he identified a few of them. He very modestly gives credit to \nothers, but, truly, Senator Nelson deserves most of the credit for \nworking out those very difficult issues on a bipartisan basis.\n  As a passionate defender of what we should do as a country for the \nsurvivors of those men and women we lose in war, I can only assure him \nwe are going to do everything we can possibly do in conference because \nI assume that had that been brought to a rollcall vote, it would have \nbeen unanimous or nearly unanimous on the floor of the Senate. We \nappreciated his willingness to have that go as part of the managers' \npackage, but for the purpose of that conference, I can assure my dear \nfriend from Florida that there is an assumption on our part that would \nhave been a unanimous or near unanimous vote by the Senate and so, \nobviously, it is the right thing to do.\n  I also have a longer statement later--because 5:30 has arrived--about \nour work as a committee, the subcommittee chairs, the ranking members, \nand the staff. I will save that statement for after our vote on final \npassage, which will come immediately after the vote on the Kennedy-\nMikulski amendment, but I wanted to add that quick comment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks of our colleague and Senator Sessions, the ranking member. I \ncan remember the days on the authorization bill when we would spend a \nweek or more on the one issue, missile defense. I think both sides have \npretty well reconciled that the present posture of the program is about \nwhere it should be.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator for that. The hour of 5:30 has \narrived. I ask unanimous consent that the Kennedy-Mikulski amendment, \nNo. 3109 be withdrawn and that there be 2 minutes of debate at this \ntime prior to a vote in relation to the Kennedy-Mikulski amendment, No. \n3058; that no amendment be in order to the amendment; that no further \namendments be in order; that the debate time be equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to amendment No. 3058; \nthat upon disposition of that amendment, the substitute amendment, as \namended, be agreed to and that the Senate then vote on the passage of \nH.R. 1585; that all other provisions of the previous order relating to \nH.R. 1585 remain in effect and that on Tuesday, October 2, following a \nperiod of morning business, the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nCalendar No. 353, H.R. 3222, the Defense Department Appropriations Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Amendment No. 3109 is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3058\n\n  There are now 2 minutes of debate on the Kennedy amendment.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I seek recognition in these 2 minutes \nseeking support on this amendment, joined by my colleagues, Kennedy and \nAkaka, who spoke Friday about why this amendment is important. It is \nimportant that this amendment be on this bill because we all remember \nthe Walter Reed scandal. Remember the Walter Reed scandal, mold in the \nhotel and all that? I spoke on this floor more than a year and a half \nago, with Paul Sarbanes, for an amendment that tried to deal with the \ncontracting out at Walter Reed. I lost that amendment on the floor by \ntwo votes.\n  We went from 300 employees to 50 employees, and we only saved money \nafter they had 6 different attempts to make sure they had contracting \nout. Let me tell you, if you want no more Walter Reeds, you want the \nKennedy-Mikulski-Akaka amendment. This amendment saves taxpayers money. \nIt says that any attempt at contracting out must save $10 million or 10 \npercent, so we meet the taxpayer mandate. It eliminates privatization \nquotas. If you are against quotas and OMB bounty hunters, this \namendment is for you. If you want to make sure our contractors have \nhealthy retirement benefits as part of the contract, this amendment is \nfor you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the Kennedy-Mikulski amendment is \nintended to cause the A-76 process to become so cumbersome and \nexpensive it would effectively eliminate the ability of the Federal \nGovernment to conduct any future A-76 competitions. What it \nspecifically does is it mandates private contractors match Government \nhealth and retirement benefits.\n  DOD alone has saved taxpayers over $5 billion as a result of \ncompetitions completed between fiscal year 2001 and fiscal year 2006. \nDOD expects these savings to grow to over $9 billion after the \ncompletion of all planned competitions initiated in fiscal year 2007 \nare completed.\n  Right now the Government bidders win over 80 percent of the \ncompetitions. This can hardly be characterized as an unfair process, as \nsupporters of this amendment portray it. It is designed to save \ntaxpayer dollars. It has--$5 billion over the past 5 years.\n  This amendment makes it so cumbersome, by mandating the private \ncontractors match Government health and retirement benefits, that the \nA-76 process will be completely undermined.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, is a request for a quorum call in order \nat this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in order. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 358 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n\n[[Page S12369]]\n\n\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Biden\n     Clinton\n     Dodd\n     McCain\n     Obama\n  The amendment (No. 3058) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for \ntheir robust debate about this important piece of legislation.\n  I would also like to highlight a provision included in this bill \nbased on the Stop Arming Iran Act, which I introduced in January of \nthis year. The provision seeks to end the Iranian Government's \nacquisition of sensitive military equipment by blocking the Pentagon's \nsale of F-14 fighter jet parts.\n  It is the sensitive job of the Department of Defense to demilitarize \nand auction off surplus military equipment. However, recent \ninvestigations and reports have uncovered a frightening trend regarding \nthe sale of F-14 Tomcat aircraft parts. U.S. customs agents have \ndiscovered F-14 parts being illegally shipped to Iran by brokers who \nbought F-14 surplus equipment from Department of Defense auctions.\n  Other than the United States, Iran is the only nation to fly the F-\n14. The United States allowed Iran to buy 79 F-14s before its \nrevolution in 1979. Fortunately, most of Iran's F-14s are currently \ngrounded for lack of parts. As the F-14 is retired from active service \nin the United States, a slew of parts are about to be processed by the \nPentagon.\n  We know that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons capability. We know \nthat the Department of State has identified Iran as the most active \nstate sponsor of terrorism. We know that the sale of spare parts for F-\n14s could make it more difficult to confront the nuclear weapons \ncapability of Iran. And yet F-14 parts are still being sold by the DOD.\n  Iran's F-14s, especially with the parts to get more of them airborne, \ngreatly strengthen its ground war potential, harming our national and \nglobal security. Our country should be doing everything possible to \ndeny the brutal regime in Tehran access to spare parts for their F-14 \nfleet.\n  The Department of Defense will tell you that it is already taking \naction to control the sale of F-14 parts. They now say that every F-14 \npart is frozen and cannot be sold. However, they will not commit to \nkeeping this freeze in place and admit that the Pentagon can choose to \nrescind or make exceptions to this policy at any time. I have \nidentified three large-scale changes to the Pentagon's policy on F-14 \nparts in just the last year. And history has shown us that these rules \nare not enough.\n  The Department has been caught still selling F-14 parts, even when \nits rules forbid it. It has sold F-14 parts to companies that have \nturned out to be fronts for the Iranians. More recently, the DOD sold \nsensitive technology, including classified F-14 parts, to undercover \nGAO investigators.\n  This provision will make it crystal clear to the Department of \nDefense that it may not sell any F-14 parts to anyone for any reason. \nThere should be no chance for the parts to make their way to the \nIranians.\n  I am very encouraged that both the Senate and House Armed Services \nCommittees have included the Stop Arming Iran provision in both \nversions of the Defense authorization bill. I commend my colleagues for \nallowing this important legislation into today's bill.\n  The provision fixes a very specific but very important problem: the \nsale of F-14 components to a state sponsor of terrorism. We cannot--and \nwith the passage of this bill, we will not--allow that to happen.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wish to explain my vote against \nending debate on the Defense authorization bill. I voted this way for \ntwo simple reasons--first, this bill does not do anything to end the \nwar, and second, it does not provide adequate support for the families \nof our returning wounded warriors.\n  A few weeks ago, I filed an amendment based on a key recommendation \nof the Dole-Shalala Wounded Warriors Commission--to expand the Family \nand Medical Leave Act to allow the families of wounded military \npersonnel to take up to 6 months of unpaid leave to care for their \nloved ones. Now, because the Senate voted to shut off debate, this \ncritically important amendment will not be considered. Such an \nexpansion of the FMLA is of the utmost importance to our wounded \nwarriors, and I will ask at the end of my statement to have a letter \nfrom Senator Bob Dole to Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain, \ndetailing the tremendous importance of this provision, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  On September 11, 2007, I announced that I would not support \nlegislation dealing with Iraq unless it included a firm and enforceable \ndeadline for withdrawing U.S. combat forces from Iraq--one linked to an \nexplicit cut off of funds after a date certain. Sadly, Republican \nstalling tactics made it impossible for such a provision to receive an \nup-or-down vote under regular Senate procedures. Therefore, I could \nnot, in good conscience, call for an end to debate on a bill that has \nnot addressed that issue or the hardships our soldiers and their \nfamilies face both at home and abroad, and the very security of our \nNation.\n  That said, I commend Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain for \ntheir hard work in making sure this legislation does include many \nbeneficial and important provisions, such as a 3.5-percent pay raise \nfor our men and women in uniform and additional funding to purchase \nMine Resistant Armor Protected vehicles. These are important steps in \nmaking sure our Armed Forces are appropriately compensated and equipped \nto defend our Nation. But as long as another year passes without an \neffective plan to end the war and support our military families, I am \nafraid that this Congress's work will be incomplete.\n  Madam President, I ask to have the letter to which I referred printed \nin the Record.\n  The letter follows.\n\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain, I would like \n     to thank you, once again, for your continued efforts to \n     improve the treatment of our returning combat troops, \n     exemplified by your shepherding of the Wounded Warrior \n     Assistance Act of 2007 through the Senate in July. This \n     important measure provided a good first step; but as you \n     know, much more remains to be done and I appreciate your \n     willingness to consider the recommendations made by the \n     President's Commission on Care for America's Returning \n     Wounded Warriors.\n       As you know, I, along with former Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services Donna Shalala, recently released the findings \n     of the Commission. One specific finding of this report is \n     currently pending as an amendment to the National Defense \n     Authorization Act currently being debated on the Senate \n     floor. Notably, the Dodd-Clinton-Dole-Graham amendment (S. \n     Amdt #2647) increases Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) job \n     protection benefits to the families of our injured soldiers \n     from the current 12 weeks to 6 months. These families are \n     facing significant challenges to help their loved ones heal, \n     and the last thing they need to worry about is losing their \n     jobs in the process.\n       There are two very critical points to be made with respect \n     to this recommendation by the Commission. First, the use of \n     already existing FMLA authority is vital to minimizing the \n     delay in implementation of this needed benefit. The FMLA has \n     existed for 14 years and has a proven track record of \n     success. It is understood by those using the benefits, those \n     charged with its oversight, and the employers working within \n     its framework. Second, the length of the benefit has been \n     carefully crafted to best balance the impact on employers on \n     one side and the average time it takes for most injured \n     personnel to regain self-sufficiency. While other pending \n     amendments have either sought to depart from the existing \n     FMLA structure by using other legislative vehicles not \n     intended to extend to families of service members such as the \n     Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act \n     (USERRA), or extended job protection benefits beyond six \n     months, neither are supported by the Commission's findings \n     and may actually hinder the efforts to implement the \n     Commission's work.\n\n[[Page S12370]]\n\n       The Administration will have a different approach, but it \n     will be some time before the Administration's comprehensive \n     proposal will be acted on.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important \n     legislation. I know that you share my belief that it is \n     essential that we supply all necessary and prudent tools to \n     our military families to deal with the hardships of helping \n     their wounded warriors regain self-sufficiency following a \n     severe injury. The Dodd-Clinton-Dole-Graham amendment passes \n     this test. If I may be of any further assistance, please feel \n     free to contact me.\n           God Bless America,\n                                                 Bob Dole.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I will vote against H.R. 1585, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act. I support many of the provisions in \nthis bill, which authorizes the activities of the Department of \nDefense, including important research, development and procurement \nfunding to improve our Armed Forces and the operations and maintenance \nfunding necessary to ensure the smooth running of the military services \nover the coming year. I support these activities, which not only \nbenefit those servicemembers currently serving overseas in Afghanistan \nand Iraq, but also help build a strong and effective military for the \nfuture. I applaud the fine work of Senator Levin and the Committee on \nArmed Services for their efforts in putting together a bill that is, in \nmost ways, a good piece of legislation.\n  However, H.R. 1585 also includes title XV, which provides \nauthorization for the funding of continued operations in Iraq for the \ncoming year. In my view, this provision constitutes a ``poison pill.''\n  I have stated before that the Congress should not continue to write \nblank checks for the prosecution of this apparently endless war in \nIraq. That is what title XV does. In effect, it provides a \ncongressional authorization to fund the continuation of President \nBush's policy in Iraq for another year, without any strings attached. I \noffered an amendment to clarify that nothing in the bill constitutes a \nspecific authorization for U.S. troops to remain in Iraq, but the \ncommittee was unable to clear the amendment. Other amendments offered \nto the bill that would have placed limits on the number of troops or \notherwise limited the mission of U.S. forces in Iraq were defeated \nduring the floor debate on H.R. 1585. This is regrettable.\n  Continuing to prosecute this war at the current rate is straining our \nmilitary to the breaking point. Many units and individuals are enduring \ntheir third and fourth rotation to Iraq, and because no limits have \nbeen placed on the mission or force levels, there is no end in sight. \nMore and more military analysts are warning that the U.S. Armed Forces \nare at risk for becoming a `hollow force,' as happened after the \nVietnam conflict. That is irresponsible, and it puts our Nation at \nrisk.\n  There are no provisions in this bill to require the U.S. President or \nthe Iraqi government to meet any benchmarks or withdraw any troops, or \neven to put limits on sending still more troops to Iraq, if any could \nbe found. It is time for Congress to start reining in this runaway \nhorse, before our military is completely exhausted and our nation made \nvulnerable.\n  I support our troops. I do not want them to lack for anything needed \nto do their job or to keep them safe. But I cannot and will not agree \nto leave them in Iraq forever, with no limits placed on their mission, \nno provision to ensure that they at least get as much time at home as \nthey do on the battlefield, with no benchmarks or goals set for the \nIraqi Government that might trigger a return of our troops, and no \nassurances by our commander in Iraq that this war is making the United \nStates any safer. That is a bitter poison pill I cannot swallow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the substitute \namendment, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2011), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted against the fiscal year 2008 \ndefense authorization bill because it does nothing to bring to a close \nthe open-ended military mission in Iraq, which has overburdened our \nmilitary, weakened our national security, and cost the lives of \nthousands of American soldiers.\n  There were provisions in the bill which I strongly supported, \nincluding language I proposed that will make it easier for family \nmembers and other trusted adults to take leave to care for children and \ndependents when their loved ones are deployed. I am also pleased that \nthe Senate approved two amendments I cosponsored. One was an amendment \nby Senator Webb creating a Commission on Wartime Contracting to examine \nwaste, fraud and abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan, including the misuse of \nforce by private security contractors. The other was an amendment by \nSenator Sanders to ensure that money allocated for research on gulf war \nillnesses is spent wisely.\n  But on balance, I could not vote for a bill that defies the will of \nso many Wisconsinites and so many Americans by allowing the President \nto continue one of the greatest and most tragic foreign policy blunders \nin the history of our Nation.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I was pleased today to vote, along with my \nSenate colleagues, for the passage of H.R.1585, the Defense \nAuthorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2008. I thank the managers of this \nbill, Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain, for working so \ndiligently and in such a collegial manner toward passage of a bill that \naddressed so many complicated and potentially divisive issues. It is to \ntheir credit that we have been able to move this bill along which is so \nvital to the support of our brave men and women in our armed services.\n  This bill was passed out of committee with a number of provisions to \nimprove\n\n[[Page S12371]]\n\nthe lives of our military members and the effectiveness and readiness \nof our armed services which I, as a senior member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness, \nworked to ensure were a part of the bill language. They include \nimportant acquisition reforms such as a series of provisions that would \nhelp the DOD manage its oversight of contract services and the creation \nof a Chief Management Officer for the Department of Defense. I also was \nable to work with my colleagues to incorporate language that \nestablishes a Director of Corrosion and Control Policy and Oversight in \naddition to other provisions that further my efforts to establish \neffective corrosion control in all branches of our services. H.R. 1585 \nalso contained my legislation to establish a National Language Council \nto develop and implement a long-term and comprehensive language \nstrategy.\n  In addition to the provisions that I initiated and supported in the \nunderlying language, I was able to successfully introduce and cosponsor \na number of amendments during the Senate's consideration of the Defense \nAuthorization Act. As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I \nwas particularly pleased to see that language from the Dignified \nTreatment of Wounded Warrior Act which addresses shortfalls in the \nquality of health care provided to our servicemembers was included as \nan amendment to this bill. Similarly, I was pleased that my amendment \nrelated to the Wounded Warrior Act was passed by the Senate. This \nlegislation will enhance the quality of care that members of our Armed \nForces receive once they transition to veteran status, improve the \ncapability of the Department of Veterans Affairs to care for veterans \nwith traumatic brain injuries, and improve access to VA mental health \nand dental care. In addition, my amendment addresses the issue of \nhomelessness among newly discharged servicemembers and recognizes the \nimportance of the National Guard and Reserve in the VA's outreach \nprograms.\n  This bill also includes an amendment I offered to end the disparate \ntreatment of employees who accepted discontinuation of service \nretirement following a reduction in force. My amendment ensures that \nthese Federal employees would be able to return to work at DOD and \ncontinue to earn toward retirement. It is vital that this Nation have a \nviable plan to produce individuals who are capable of effective \ncommunication in today's global environment. I also applaud the \ninclusion of the fair competition amendment, introduced by Senator \nKennedy which I cosponsored, which will minimize the harmful effects of \nthe current A-76 process for outsourcing Federal jobs to private \ncontractors by removing several unfair advantages that contractors \ncurrently have in the contract competition process.\n  I was disappointed, however, that the Webb amendment which I was \nproud to cosponsor was not agreed to by the Senate. The Webb amendment \nwould have lessened the burden placed on our soldiers and their \nfamilies by setting a minimum time between deployments in order to \nensure that members of our Armed Forces have as much time at home with \ntheir loved ones as they fight overseas for this Nation.\n  I was also disappointed that the Levin-Reed amendment which would \nhave set a clear and definitive deadline for the withdrawal of forces \nfrom Iraq was not passed. One of the key elements of stabilizing the \nongoing chaos in Iraq is for the Iraqi Government to begin to take more \nresponsibility for ensuring their own nation's security and assume \nprimary combat role in protecting and defending their nation. This will \nnot occur without the development and implementation of a coherent exit \nstrategy. The Levin-Reed amendment offered just such a plan.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Armed Services and chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Readiness and Management, I will continue to work with \nmy Senate colleagues to change the course of this war by insisting that \nthe administration provide to this Congress and the people of our \nnation with a comprehensive exit strategy.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1327\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 172, S. 1327, a \nbill to create temporary district court judgeships, that the bill be \nread a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 535\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 211, S. 535, the Emmett Till \nUnsolved Civil Rights Act; that the substitute amendment be agreed to; \nthe bill, as amended, be read a third time, passed; the title amendment \nbe agreed to; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the bill we have just adopted is the 46th \nconsecutive annual Defense authorization bill that has come out of our \ncommittee and been brought to the Senate for debate and passage. It has \nbeen no secret that this is one of the largest and most complex and \nimportant pieces of legislation that comes before the Senate every \nyear. Every year since 1961, it has been a challenge to get it passed. \nThankfully, because of its vital importance to our Nation, we have \nalways found a way to do so. This year was particularly difficult, as \nwe continue to debate the war in Iraq. Today is the 19th and final day \nof debate on this bill. Only two other annual Defense authorization \nbills have required longer to pass. In 1969, the Senate debated the \nbill for 37 days. In 1970, it was debated for 28 days. History shows \nthat in time of war, the Senate acts as it should and takes the \nnecessary time to carefully consider this bill and its impact on our \nNation.\n\n  We had over 400 amendments that were filed to this bill. We were able \nto work with all Senators and pass several large packages of managers' \namendments while we were wrestling with Iraq-related amendments. All \ntold, we acted on a total of 214 amendments during the bill's \nconsideration.\n  Whenever we reach the point of final passage of legislation, we take \na moment to thank Members and staff. To some this may seem to be a \nroutine matter. It is not. All of us who make up the Senate should \nhonor its customs and traditions. They are really the foundation of \nthis Senate.\n  With that as my motivation, I want to take a moment to express my \nthanks to those who worked so hard and cooperated so well to bring us \nto final passage of this bill.\n  First, my thanks go to Senator McCain who is serving as our ranking \nmember for the first time this year. Senator McCain's leadership and \ndetermination helped forge this bill through the committee and on to \nfinal passage.\n  Next, I thank and acknowledge our former chairman, Senator Warner. \nSenator Warner has made innumerable contributions to this bill. This \nbill would not be here but for the work of Senator Warner. Working \nwithin arm's reach of Senator Warner each year for the past 28 years \nhas been truly one of the highlights of my Senate career.\n  He is a good friend of mine. More importantly, he is a good friend to \nnational defense and to the people who depend upon it and who work for \nit in this country.\n  To our majority leader, Senator Reid, and his floor staff, a special \nword of thanks for giving us the time and the tools to get this bill \nthrough the Senate.\n  To all of our committee members who, again, worked on a bipartisan \nbasis, we appreciate their work. We do not often take the time to \nexpress it. I am afraid this will kind of have to be that moment. \nPeople do not realize our committee has one quarter of the Senate as \nits members. We work together in the committee. Our differences on the \nbill did not divide us. We reported the bill by a unanimous vote.\n  To Charlie Armstrong in the Office of Senate Legislative Counsel, he \ndid his work skillfully. He proved over 400 times, with those 400 \namendments, that he knows how to draft amendments.\n  To our committee staff members, they truly earned the thanks and \nrecognition of the entire Senate for their\n\n[[Page S12372]]\n\ntime and their efforts on this legislation.\n  I want to mention two of the members of our staff who lead our staff \nand one woman who has served on our committee staff for the past 19 \nyears.\n  To Rick DeBobes, our committee staff director, he serves us so \nbrilliantly and well and so unselfishly 24/7. He is within earshot, so \nI will not embarrass him and have him blush other than to say he is so \ntotally indispensable not just to me but to the Senate and all of the \nstaff that work so well with him. Our gratitude.\n  To Senator McCain's new Republican staff director, Mike Kostiw, his \nleadership is so effective that it is quite difficult to believe this \nis Mike's first year.\n  To Cindy Pearson, our assistant chief clerk and security manager, a \nspecial word of thanks and encouragement. Cindy has been serving the \ncommittee for the last 19 years. She is the consummate professional in \nevery aspect of her work. She is away from us right now as she \nundergoes treatment for breast cancer. We want her to know she is ever \npresent in our thoughts and in our prayers. We all look forward to \nwelcoming Cindy Pearson back to the committee family soon.\n  So Rick's and Mike's and all the other committee staff members' long \nand hard work and personal sacrifices, day in and day out, to get this \nbill enacted again this year paid off. They are the backbone of the \nSenate. They and other people who work for us in this Senate make it \npossible to turn our ideas into policies and into legislation.\n  I thank them all. I know I thank them for their expertise and their \ndedication on behalf of all the members of the committee. They brought \nus again through to the point of conference with the House. We are \nhopeful to bring back promptly a conference report. But in the \nmeantime, thanks to them, their professionalism, and their hard work. \nWe are where we are at.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of the entire \nArmed Services Committee staff be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Armed Services Committee Staff\n\n       Richard D.

Again, I cannot say too often what it means to \nhave as a partner John Warner of Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I very much value the friendship and the \nworking relationship we have had together. It would be interesting if \nsomebody wanted to try to look at records. I suppose since this is our \n29th bill we have worked on, that might be a bit of a record. But I \nthink also both of us have been chairman three times. That might be a \nbit of a record too.\n  But I say to the Senator from Michigan, I give you a most sincere and \nwarm congratulations for your achieving this bill. This is the 19th day \nthe bill was on the floor, and our good friend, the ranking member, was \non the floor many of those days. He has called in each day to our \ndistinguished chief of staff, Mike Kostiw, and has talked with me and \nother members of the staff. So he is very much hands on.\n  But I think we probably got through with a little less contention \nthis time than in years past. I think that reflects a lot of credit on \nthe distinguished chairman and the distinguished ranking member and the \nwonderful staff and very active membership by each and every one of \nthe, as you say, 25 members of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  We work well together as a team. People are very proud to be on this \ncommittee. They believe they are serving a most noble cause; that is, \nthe men and women of the Armed Forces, and their families, who tonight \nare on two battlefronts and, indeed, in many other places of personal \ndanger throughout the world, for the sole purpose of guarding freedom \nand, most importantly, the freedom we have here at home.\n  So I thank the chairman. I thank all who made it possible, and say, \nalso, how well our two staffs worked together in a bipartisan way to \nachieve, as you say, a consensus on almost 200 of those amendments. So \nI think we have done our job, I say to the Senator. It is at a critical \ntime in the course of our country. Again, I wish the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces and their families only the best.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate insists \non its amendment and requests a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my chairman has overlooked a minor item.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in this Chamber about a \nstory unfolding right now in Costa Rica.\n  This country of 4 million people is having a national referendum on \nOctober 7--next week--on the Central American Free Trade Agreement, the \ntrade deal this Congress passed by a narrow margin a couple of years \nago.\n  CAFTA stipulates that the last signatory country must approve the \ndeal no later than 2 years after the first signatory country implements \nthe agreement.\n  So over the past 2 years, the United States, El Salvador, Honduras, \nGuatemala, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic enacted the NAFTA \nexpansion.\n  The Costa Rican people have resisted it.\n  My colleagues have seen news reports this weekend about a massive \nrally of fair traders--people who want trade but under different \nrules--against CAFTA in Costa Rica. Some 150,000 citizens in a country \nof 4 million people spoke out expressing their opposition to the \nagreement--150,000 people--and most thought that a conservative \nestimate.\n  The pro-CAFTA government gave up efforts to pass CAFTA in the \nlegislature after continued protest against it, including a 2-day \ngeneral strike last October.\n  Their is strong opposition to a NAFTA-style agreement. In fact, the \nissue of whether to approve CAFTA has stirred up such political \nupheaval that the Government chose to go to a public\n\n[[Page S12373]]\n\nreferendum instead of going to the legislature. Legislators not unlike \nour peers in Congress did not want to face voters in their home \ndistrict if they voted for the pact.\n  The agreement must be implemented as domestic law--meaning Costa Rica \nhas to enact new laws in order for the trade agreement to take effect. \nThat bothers hundreds of thousands of Costa Ricans because they have in \nplace today strong laws on health, on the environment, on education, on \nprivatization, on generic drugs, on all the kinds of issues that have \nhelped to build the middle class in Costa Rica.\n  Costa Rica is a progressive country. More than a third of its land is \nprotected in national parks. More than 90 percent of its electricity \ncomes from renewals. Costa Rica's high literacy rates are well known, \nand it has a strong health care system. Its life expectancy is not too \ndifferent than our own in this country.\n  Costa Rica's citizens have also seen what NAFTA--the North American \nFree Trade Agreement--did to Mexico's middle class, and what especially \nit has done to Mexican farmers, small peasant family farmers.\n  These factors have created strong resistance to entering into an \nagreement that can handcuff policymakers from setting progrowth, \nprodevelopment policies in their own country.\n  As this Chamber knows, NAFTA/CAFTA-style deals are about a whole lot \nmore than just tariffs and quotas. These agreements are top-down pacts \nthat lock in new rules on investment, on food safety, on services, and \non procurement.\n  This month, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \nissued a report warning developing countries to be wary of bilateral \nand regional free-trade deals as they are currently written. They \nwarned them against signing these agreements.\n  The U.N. report cited NAFTA as an example of a trade agreement that \nmay have short-term benefits but does long-term harm. You hear a lot of \ntalk from the Bush administration that free trade is necessary to \naddress poverty. You hear that the ``people,'' as they say, of these \nmostly poor countries want trade deals like NAFTA.\n  But what we are seeing in Costa Rica right now is what we are seeing \naround the globe when it comes to trade deals that purely and simply \ngive too much power to multinational corporations. What we are seeing \nis a loud and clear demand for change.\n  We see it in the WTO negotiations, which continue to falter as \ndeveloping countries resist WTO expansion. We see it in Ohio--in Lorain \nand Mansfield, in Youngstown and Lima, in Dayton and Chillicothe--where \nhard-working men and women who have made America the strongest Nation \nin the world are betrayed by Washington's trade policy.\n  Presidents from both parties have entered into trade agreements, \nagreements such as NAFTA, promising they would create millions of new \njobs and enrich communities. Instead, too many of these agreements, too \noften, have cost millions of jobs and devastated communities.\n  Two years ago, when I served in the House, we created a bipartisan \ncoalition against the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Religious \norganizations, labor unions, environmentalists, small businesses, human \nrights advocates, and small manufacturing companies were part of this \nbipartisan opposition.\n  The opposition that was evident in Washington and, more importantly, \nin congressional districts around the country caused the Bush \nadministration to make deals and promises and--in the words of one \nsympathetic lawmaker to the Bush administration--helped us so that we \n``twist[ed] arms until they break into a thousand pieces.''\n  The Bush administration got what it wanted when it pushed NAFTA \nthrough. But we won the debate. Today in Costa Rica, we are seeing \nsimilar scare tactics taken by the pro-CAFTA administration.\n\n  A memo was leaked to the Costa Rican press, and it has caused an \nuproar for good reason. In this memo, the Costa Rican Vice President \nand a Member of Congress outlined a plan to President Arias that uses \nfear, threats to local officials, and attacks on CAFTA opposition as \ntactics to win the referendum.\n  The Second Vice President, one of the memo's authors, had to resign \nfrom his government office while officials investigate whether any laws \nhad been broken.\n  The memo states clearly:\n\n       The mayor that does not win his canton--\n\n  Which is their political jurisdiction--\n\n       The mayor that does not win his canton (precinct) will not \n     get a penny from the government in the next three years.\n\n  It is pretty simple. The memo says the government then needs to \n``stimulate fear'' among Costa Ricans. It even lists the kinds of fear \nthat are effective: Stimulate fear. Create fear of the loss of jobs if \nCAFTA is not approved. Stimulate a fear of violence and civil strife. \nStimulate a fear of Chavez and Castro if Costa Rica does not approve \nCAFTA.\n  Specifically, there has been an informational campaign in Costa Rica \nthat if this agreement fails, then the United States will punish Costa \nRica by revoking the existing trade benefits that Costa Rica has under \nthe Caribbean Basin Initiative. That is simply patently false.\n  Costa Rica will continue to benefit from CBI because it is the law. \nIt is a permanent program. Its existence depends on the U.S. Congress, \nnot an edict from the Bush administration.\n  These tactics should sound familiar to my colleagues who recall the \nCAFTA debate. These tactics make it very clear that what is at stake--\nin Costa Rica this week and when this Chamber takes up issues of trade \nand globalization--is that there are very different competing \nideologies. There is the NAFTA ideology and there is the fair trade \nideology.\n  In truth, I believe the defeat of this referendum may actually do \nmore to improve Costa Rican-U.S. relations because it is clear that \nthere is a fair trade movement on the rise in this Chamber, in the \nHouse of Representatives, and surely across the land. Look at elections \nlast year in the Presiding Officer's State of Rhode Island, in Ohio, in \nPennsylvania, in Missouri, and in Minnesota and Virginia and Montana, \nbecause it is clear there is a fair trade movement on the rise in this \ncountry and in Costa Rica.\n  We have reason to hope. If the referendum is defeated, we can create \na new trade agreement that benefits workers and communities, small \nbusinesses, religious folks, people who care about an economy that \nworks for more of us, that helps us to create a solid, strong middle \nclass, not just supporting the multinational corporations.\n  We have a choice. The people of Costa Rica have a choice there this \nweek. We can continue with the fair trade model or we can reject the \nNAFTA and CAFTA models and work together on a new trade deal, a fair \ntrade deal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12373-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12373-S12374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the past week the world watched the \npeople of Burma rise up against the oppressive regime that rules that \ncountry.\n  Then, the tyrannical junta that has held power for some 40 years, the \nState Peace and Development Council, brought out its soldiers and it \nbrought out its guns. They arrested, brutalized, and killed many who \nbravely stood up to the misrule of this junta.\n  So while last week the streets were filled with brave monks adorned \nin saffron robes demonstrating for freedom, today those same streets \nare occupied by uniformed thugs and lined with barbed-wire barricades. \nFor now the people of Burma have largely fallen silent. But the silence \nin Burma is a deafening one that we can still hear. Even if the \nfreedom-loving people of Burma had been temporarily quieted, the rest \nof us can still lend our voices to their cause.\n  Earlier today, Senator Kerry and I introduced a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution condemning the SPDC for its brutality in snuffing out these \ncries for\n\n[[Page S12374]]\n\nfreedom. We have already been joined by scores of our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, and I know we will be joined by many more. The \nHouse of Representatives is slated to pass a similar measure later this \nweek. In this way, the entire Congress of the United States will be \nable to speak, when the Burmese citizen, the Buddhist monk, the \ndemocracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi herself are forced to be silent.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me and join Senator Kerry on this \nresolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12374-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12374-S12375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MAYER MITCHELL\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mayer \nMitchell, a great American and human being who passed away on \nWednesday, September 26, 2007. A highly successful businessman and \nremarkable philanthropist, Mayer Mitchell was a personal friend, and \nalong with the entire city of Mobile, I mourn his passing.\n  Mayer was born in New Orleans in 1933 and grew up in Mobile, AL. He \nearned his bachelor of science degree in economics at the University of \nPennsylvania's Wharton School of Finance in 1953. He then served as an \nArmy first lieutenant in Korea, earning a commendation ribbon with \nmedal pendant for meritorious service.\n  Returning home to Mobile with his wife Arlene in 1958, Mayer founded, \nwith his brother Abe, the Mitchell Company, a commercial and \nresidential real estate development firm. He went on to serve as its \nchairman and chief executive officer for the next three decades, \nselling his interest in the Mitchell Company in 1986.\n  The company's final total under the oversight of the Mitchell \nbrothers was remarkable, with 25,000 single family homes, 20,000 \napartments and 175 shopping centers built throughout the Southeast.\n  In fact, the current Mitchell Company that descended from a \npartnership of Mayer and his brother remains the largest private firm \nin Mobile and is among the top 40 in Alabama. Mayer's business success \nearned him an induction into the Alabama Business Hall of Fame in 2006.\n  Mayer Mitchell leaves a legacy of tremendous philanthropy, touching \nthe lives of many residents of south Alabama. Mayer was a tireless \nproponent of education and health care, serving more than 32 years on \nthe University of South Alabama's Board of Trustees, including a term \nas chairman.\n  He was awarded the University of South Alabama's National Alumni \nAssociation Distinguished Service Award in 2005 and an honorary \ndoctorate of humane letters in 2007.\n  The Mitchell family's philanthropy reached all aspects of the campus \nat the University of South Alabama, from business and medicine to \nathletics. Mayer will forever be remembered as a legendary figure in \nthe growth of the University. The Mitchell Cancer Institute, the \nMitchell College of Business and the Mitchell Center sports and \nperformance complex, proudly bear the family name.\n  To date, the Mitchell family holds the distinction of having \ncontributed more than any other single family to a public university in \nAlabama State history.\n  The Mitchell Cancer Institute alone is a powerful legacy, providing \nstate-of-the-art cancer care to people throughout the gulf coast \nregion. Mayer always explained his deep commitment to cancer treatment \nthrough a personal connection. At the age of 36, he was diagnosed with \nHodgkin's disease and was given 6 months to live. After 2 years of \ntreatments, Mayer made an extraordinary recovery.\n  This victory not only shaped his life, but shaped the future of the \nMobile region as well. He never forgot that he had to leave Mobile for \nhis own cancer treatment in Rochester, NY, and he vowed to make certain \nMobile had its own cancer center in the future.\n  This experience shaped his generosity and will to persevere in the \nform of improved quality of health care for every resident in south \nAlabama.\n  Although Mayer Mitchell and his family were critical to the \ntremendous growth of the University of South Alabama, this was not the \nonly object of Mayer's patronage.\n  A strong friend to Israel, he served a term as president of the \nAmerican Israeli Public Affairs Committee and served on the board of \nthe Washington Institute for Near East Policy and the Jewish Seminary \nof America, which awarded him an honorary doctorate.\n  Mayer supported several other schools and numerous social and \nreligious organizations. His philanthropic service included work with \nAlabama Power Company, Wright School, Bishop State Community College, \nLeukemia Society of America, USA Foundation, AmSouth Bank, Altus Bank, \nMobile Area United Way, Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, Mobile Jewish \nWelfare Fund, Mobile Federation of Jewish Charities, Mobile County Real \nEstate Association, Archives of American Art, Anti-Defamation League \nand the Banc Corporation.\n  His honors include: Jewish Welfare Fund Man of the Year, Outstanding \nYoung Men of America, Prichard Honorary Citizen of the Year, Mobile \nCounty Realtor of the Year, and numerous high honors from the Boy's \nClub of Mobile, Bishop State Community College, University of \nRochester, New Orleans Chapter of Hadassah, Alabama Institute for the \nDeaf and Blind, Mobile Kiwanis Club and the American Hellenic \nEducational Progressive Association.\n  Mayer is loved and will be missed by his wife of 54 years, Arlene; \nhis son Richard; his three daughters, Melinda Wertheim, Joy Grodnick \nand Lisa Bukstein; and eight grandchildren.\n  He was an inspiration to many and will be remembered for his \ndedication and many contributions to Mobile and the University of South \nAlabama.\n  I ask the entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the \nlife of Mayer Mitchell.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask the indulgence of the Senator \nfrom Vermont. I know Senator Sessions wishes to add a few words of \ntribute to Mr. Mitchell, and then Senator Sanders will have his 10 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Shelby for \nrecalling the remarkable facts of the life of Mayer Bubba Mitchell, one \nof Mobile's great citizens, a national leader, as well as a local \nleader, someone who has friends throughout the country and the world. \nIt is remarkable, the extent of his reach and impact. He had a clear \nvision. He wanted his life to be a life that made the world a better \nplace. He worked at that. He had a strong will to do that. Senator \nShelby and I were talking about that this morning. It was remarkable. \nHe had an ability to get things accomplished. To me, one of his most \nremarkable characteristics was the fact that he could have many \ndifferent activities going on, but he always seemed to complete each \none of them and get it done successfully.\n  At a final AIPAC banquet he attended, realizing it would be his \nlast--it was recalled at his funeral service Friday--he asked these \nquestions about himself but really applying to others. I think it would \napply to all of us in the Senate. Knowing that he would not be back, he \nasked: Have I done enough? Have I done my best? Have I made a \ndifference? All of us ought to ask those questions more and would \nprobably be better performers when we do.\n  His wonderful partner Arlene is such a fabulous person, so well \nliked, a former Mobilian of the year. She is so gracious. His son \nRichard spoke so movingly at his memorial service. His son-in-law Jimmy \nGrodnick likewise, married to his wonderful daughter Joy, made remarks. \nHis grandchildren read from the Talmud such wonderful passages that \nreflected his values. His brother Abe, who has been a partner in \nbusiness and in so many of these activities, told me afterwards it \nwasn't over. He still had things he wanted to do and he would continue \nto work at them. I know that is exactly what Mayer would have liked.\n  The business school I visited at the University of South Alabama is \nso well endowed by the Mitchell family. The athletics center, the \nMitchell Center, is where his memorial service was held, the sports \ncomplex. And perhaps in the long term, the greatest financial \ninvestment he and his family made is in the Mitchell Cancer Center that \nwill be a place for research as well as treatment of those who have \nsuffered with\n\n[[Page S12375]]\n\ncancer, because he felt so blessed, having been allowed to survive what \nmany said at the time was a fatal disease.\n  So many people came from all over the country to that service, it was \nreally remarkable, including the Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch \nMcConnell, who himself came down and was an honorary pallbearer. He was \non a first-name basis with Presidents. Indeed, I am aware that \nPresident Bush called him twice in recent months. Foreign leaders, \nSenators, and Congressmen were on a first-name basis with him. His life \nis a testament to what can happen when a person focuses his life on \nmaking a positive difference in the world and living a good life. He \naccomplished those things. Probably outside of a public official, he \nwas on a first-name basis with more Senators than maybe any other \nperson in our country. There may be some others, but not many would \nknow as many and be as well respected as he was over the years.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to make these remarks. Not only did he \nserve on the board, chairman of the board of the University of South \nAlabama for 32 years, he gave hours and hours of his time and attention \nand ideas and ability to making that the great university it is. So he \nnot only gave money, he gave of his time and of himself to make it the \ngreat university it is. Gordon Moulton, the president, certainly \nreflected that in his remarks.\n  I thank the Chair and Senator Shelby for his excellent remarks and \nyield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, Mayer was a wonderful man who a lot of \nus got to know because of his leadership role in the American Israel \nPublic Affairs Committee. This was a wonderful gentleman, the \nexemplification of the American dream. He worked extremely hard, made a \ngreat success of himself for his family, for his community, for his \ncountry. He loved America. He was devoted to Israel and devoted to the \nstrength of the United States-Israel relationship. He was a great \nAmerican patriot. I don't want to take the time to describe it now, but \nI am personally grateful for him for the ways in which he stuck with me \nat tough times in my own career. He didn't just stick with me, but he \nsort of worked at it to make sure everything came out all right. He was \na good friend, a good man. God bless his soul.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12375-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     STAFF SERGEANT ZACHARY TOMCZAK\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to SSG Zachary \nTomczak and his heroic service to our country. As a member of the \nArmy's 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division \nbased in North Carolina, Staff Sergeant Tomczak was serving in support \nof Operation Iraqi Freedom. On September 25, 2007, he was killed in \naction in Baghdad.\n  A Huron native, Zachary joined the Army in June 2002 and took great \npride in serving his country. His graduation from Ranger School at Fort \nBenning, GA, in May is described by his father as ``one of the proudest \nmoments for him and for me.'' His captain remembers him as ``a leader, \nmentor, warrior, Ranger, hero.'' Zachary was on his fourth tour of duty \nin Iraq and had earned the Purple Heart and Bronze Star Medal, among \nother awards.\n  A hard worker, Zachary enjoyed hands-on projects and worked for a \nconstruction company during high school. He also enjoyed spending time \nfour-wheeling, pheasant hunting, and deer hunting. Friends and family \nwill remember Zachary's love for life and easygoing personality.\n  Sergeant Tomczak gave his all for his soldiers and his country. Our \nNation owes him a debt of gratitude, and the best way to honor his life \nis to emulate his commitment to our country. Mr. President, I join with \nall South Dakotans in expressing my deepest sympathy to the family of \nStaff Sergeant Tomczak. He will be missed, but his service to our \nNation will never be forgotten.\n\n\n                Private First Class Christopher Pfeifer\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof United States Army PFC Christopher Pfeifer of Nebraska. Private \nFirst Class Pfeifer died on September 25 from injuries he sustained \nnear Kamu, Afghanistan, when insurgents attacked his unit on August 17. \nHe was 21 years old.\n  Private First Class Pfeifer grew up in the small town of Spalding, \nNE, where he played eight-man football at Spalding Academy, as well as \nthe drums in the band. He was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 91st \nCavalry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team based in \nSchweinfurt, Germany. All the flags in Spalding, a town of about 600 \npeople, are at half-mast in honor of Private First Class Pfeifer.\n  Private First Class Pfeifer is remembered as a devoted husband, son, \nand brother. Sadly, he was denied the chance to become a proud father; \nhis wife Karen gave birth to a baby girl the day after his death.\n  All of Nebraska is proud of Private First Class Pfeifer's service to \nour country, as well as the thousands of other brave Americans serving \nin Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  In addition to his wife and newborn daughter, he is survived by his \nparents, Mike and Dar, his brother Aaron, and his sister Nicki.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring PFC \nChristopher Pfeifer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12375-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12375-S12376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HEALTH INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about health \ninsurance. Congress is well aware of the ever increasing number of the \nuninsured. Not to mention the fact that health costs continue to rise \nat an alarming rate. Make no mistake, the numbers are sobering.\n  But I am not here to dwell on the past and present. I stand here \ntoday to talk about the future. I stand here to discuss ways to expand \naccess to health insurance and to change the inequities in the tax \ntreatment of health insurance.\n  During the debate on SCHIP, I engaged in a colloquy with Senators \nBurr, Coburn, Martinez, Corker, and Bennett. During that exchange, I \nexplained that, currently, a taxpayer who receives health insurance \nthrough his or her employer is not taxed on the cost of the health \ncoverage. I also explained that individuals who do not receive health \ncoverage through their employer generally do not receive a tax benefit. \nSimilarly, a tax benefit is not afforded to people who are not employed \nand purchase health insurance on the individual market.\n  I noted that Republicans and Democrats alike agree that Congress \nshould ``level the playing field'' and expand access to health \ninsurance. The question is how. Senators Burr, Coburn, Martinez, \nCorker, and Dole have introduced a proposal that would eliminate the \nexclusion for employer-provided health coverage. It would provide a \nflat tax credit to all Americans who purchase ``qualifying health \ninsurance.'' I commend the Senators for their leadership, and I intend \nto work with them on ways to expand access to health insurance.\n  Senators Wyden and Bennett have also introduced a proposal that would \nexpand access to health insurance. Senators Gregg, Bill Nelson, and \nAlexander have cosponsored the proposal. Most recently, Senators \nStabenow, Landrieu, and Coleman cosponsored the legislation. This \nbipartisan legislation is a ``patient-driven'' approach to reforming \nour health care system. I want to stress, a ``patient-driven'' approach \nto reforming health care.\n  A ``patient-driven'' approach means the patient can shop for their \nown health care in a competitive marketplace, which will allow them to \nchoose the type of health insurance that meets their needs. Many in the \nDemocratic Party, including several of the Democratic Presidential \ncandidates, want a government-run single-payer health care system that \nis not ``patient-centered.'' This is a nonstarter and is bad policy. \nRecent polling shows that the American public thinks so. That is, the \nmajority of Americans do not want a government-run system.\n  I want to reform the health care system through the Tax Code. I want \nto cap or eliminate the exclusion for employer-provided health coverage \nand offer Americans a choice between a tax credit and a deduction for \nhealth insurance. I want to condition these tax subsidies on States \nundertaking certain insurance reforms. I want to give the States the \nflexibility to decide what\n\n[[Page S12376]]\n\ntypes of reforms are best for their constituencies.\n  This ``patient-driven'' approach--with insurance reforms and changes \nin the tax treatment of health insurance--should make health insurance \nmore affordable. And it should significantly reduce the number of the \nuninsured.\n  During my tenure in the Senate, I have sought to build bridges \nbetween Republicans and Democrats. I believe that there are times where \nRepublicans and Democrats need to come together to produce results.\n  An example of my efforts to work in a bipartisan manner is the \nbipartisan SCHIP legislation that was overwhelmingly passed by this \nbody. In the spirit of bipartisanship, I join Senator Wyden in \ncosponsoring the Healthy Americans Act. The Healthy Americans Act is a \n``patient-driven'' approach to reforming our health care system.\n  While I support this ``patient-driven'' approach, I have serious \nconcerns about a number of the provisions of the Healthy Americans Act. \nFor example, like many of the Democratic Presidential candidates, the \nact would require all individuals to buy health insurance. I support \naccessibility to private insurance and differ with my colleagues on \nthis point. Also, Senator Wyden's approach is more regulatory than I \nwould prefer.\n  In addition, I am not endorsing the repeal of the noninterference \nclause in Medicare Part D. That is not going to be on the table. So my \ncosponsorship is not an endorsement of these elements. Instead, I am \ncosponsoring the Healthy Americans Act to add my voice to the call for \nsignificant changes in our health care system.\n  What we have here is Republicans and Democrats coming together to \nsolve a problem. This is what bipartisanship is all about. We are all \non the same page when it comes to the big picture; that is, reforming \nour health care system and expanding access to health insurance.\n  We have serious problems, and we need serious people to solve them. \nSo let's put politics aside, roll up our sleeves and work in a \nbipartisan way to reform our health care system.\n  Make no mistake, my cosponsorship of the Healthy Americans Act is \nonly one step in the process. I intend to work with Senators Burr, \nCoburn, Martinez, Corker, and Dole on their health care reform \nproposal. I intend to work with Chairman Baucus and members of the \nSenate Finance Committee on small business health reforms, along with \nmore comprehensive health care reform proposals like the Healthy \nAmericans Act. Let's get serious.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12376-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish today to pay tribute to the \ncontributions of Hispanic Americans as we commemorate Hispanic Heritage \nMonth. This occasion welcomes the opportunity to celebrate the \nachievements made by Hispanic Americans to enrich the culture and day-\nto-day life of the United States.\n  Today, there is no denying the strength and impact of Hispanic \nAmericans, who are now more than 40 million strong. In my home State of \nNew Mexico, 44 percent of the total population is made up of people of \nHispanic descent, which according to the Census Bureau, is the largest \nproportion of any State in the Union. What has truly been remarkable to \nme over the years is the extent to which the Hispanic community has \nthrived in every facet of civic life.\n  For instance, I am proud to call attention to the remarkable \nachievement of PFC Jose F. Valdez, one of 48 Hispanic American Medal of \nHonor recipients. Born and raised in Governador, NM, Jose served during \nWorld War II near Rosenkrantz, France. He heroically saved the lives of \nhis fellow comrades by engaging in a firefight which allowed the \nsoldiers to escape after an enemy counterattack. Similar tales of \nbravery are prevalent in the history of Hispanic Americans, who have \nserved with distinction in every U.S. military campaign including our \ncurrent engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  In the areas of science, medicine, sport, art, business, and public \nservice, the various achievements of the Hispanic community are \nimmeasurable. This year, Hispanic Business magazine celebrated its 25th \nanniversary by profiling 500 of the largest Hispanic-owned companies in \nthe United States, a nearly tenfold increase from the magazine's \ninitial listing in 1982. These companies boast total revenues of $36.6 \nbillion, which is a sizable contribution to the American economy.\n  Twenty-five of these top-ranked companies join me in calling New \nMexico their home. At the top of this list is Manuel Lujan Agencies \nfrom Albuquerque, NM, which has also been awarded ``Most Admired \nCompany'' by New Mexico's top 100 private companies. Also included in \nthis list is Centinel Bank of Taos in Taos, NM, which is one of the \nvery few minority-owned financial institutions in the United States. I \nam pleased that Manuel Lujan Agencies and Centinel Bank of Taos are \njoined by such firms as Roses Southwest Papers, Applied Tech \nAssociates, Networx and Sparkle Maintenance Inc. The fact, is Hispanics \nin New Mexico today lead a growing number of firms that help set the \npace for a growing economy in my State, and many of them are firms \ninvolving high technology, construction, and service industries.\n  While there is no doubt that Hispanics have fought to protect our \nfreedoms and made advancements in the corporate world, they are also \nleaving their imprint on the world of entertainment through sports and \nthe arts. Of the athletes currently playing in the National Football \nLeague, 24 players are of Hispanic descent. These players are \nrepresented on 16 teams across the country, and during a recent \nfootball matchup, Grammy winners Gloria Estefan and the musical group \nOzomatli performed the national anthem at the halftime show in honor of \nthis month's celebration. In my home State, music legends like Al \nHurricane and the popular Tobias Rene add to the rich cultural \ncontributions being made to our society.\n  I encourage Americans to take this moment to remember all of the \nareas of our society that have been influenced by the Hispanic \ncommunity. I would also like you to recall the sacrifices Hispanics \nhave made to preserve the liberties and freedom that make America a \nbeacon of hope to millions around the world. These men and women have \nstood up as proud Americans and volunteered to protect their families \nand communities during the global war on terror. Our Nation is stronger \nbecause of these men and women. They deserve the gratitude of the \nNation for their sacrifices.\n  The tradition of Hispanic Heritage Month dates back almost 40 years. \nIn 1968, Congress started by designating a week to celebrate Hispanic \nheritage. By the early 1980s, we decided to extend the designation to \ncover a month starting on September 15. The extra time has been a \nnecessary and appropriate change to allow us to recognize the long \nrecord of contributions Hispanic Americans have made to our communities \nand to our Nation. I call on the American people to join with all \nchildren, families, organizations, communities, churches, cities, and \nStates across the Nation to observe the month with appropriate \nceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12376-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12376-S12377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING JIM NICHOLSON\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it is my distinct pleasure to recognize my \nfriend and fellow Coloradan Jim Nicholson. Although it is with sadness \nthat his resignation takes effect this week, I would like to take this \ntime to commend him for his service as the Secretary of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs.\n  Jim is a veteran's veteran. As a West Point graduate, Army Ranger, \nhighly decorated Vietnam war veteran, and 4 years of service as the \nambassador to the Holy See, Jim was well prepared and highly qualified \nfor the duties as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Jim was nominated \nby President Bush to serve as Secretary in December of 2004 and was \nsubsequently confirmed unanimously by the Senate. The confidence \nbestowed upon Jim Nicholson by the President and all of those who \ngather here speaks to his unassailable ability to assist our veterans. \nSworn into office on February 1, 2004, Jim readily assumed his role as \nthe primary advocate for veterans.\n  Jim accepted control of the VA at an extremely difficult time and has \nproven himself to be the right man for the\n\n[[Page S12377]]\n\njob. He was asked to serve his country in a new capacity and brought \nwith him a great sense of honor and duty. In this time of war, Jim has \nworked tirelessly to ensure that the VA meet the current needs of those \nveterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Although there is great \nurgency in caring for our recently wounded service men and women, Jim \nhas also understood the crucial need to continue to provide the utmost \ncare for our veterans and warriors of past generations. Under his \nleadership, the VA has earned higher marks for medical services than \nthe private health care industry for customer satisfaction, according \nto the American Customer Satisfaction Index, for the seventh \nconsecutive year. He has helped to give all our veterans the care they \ndeserve, as they have sacrificed so much for all of us.\n  I have personally worked with Jim for years. I would especially like \nto thank him for the instrumental role he played in reinvigorating the \nconstruction of a new VA hospital in Aurora on the Fitzsimons campus. \nWithout his support, this project would not have progressed to the \npoint it is at today. This hospital will prove to be a great asset for \nour veterans in Colorado, and Secretary Nicholson should be commended \nfor his efforts.\n  As we celebrate the service of Secretary Nicholson, I had also like \nto take this opportunity to thank his family, notably his wife Suzanne, \nwhose endless support is undoubtedly valued and is greatly appreciated. \nJim Nicholson has served this country with honor and valor in many \ncapacities. I will certainly miss Secretary Nicholson, and wish him and \nhis family the best of luck in the future. I thank him for his \nexceptional service on behalf of all our veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12377-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S. ARMY SPACE AND MISSILE DEFENSE COMMAND\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrecognize the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Army \nSpace and Missile Defense Command, an organization that is \nheadquartered in Huntsville, AL.\n  On this day, October 3, 1957, the Army activated the Redstone Anti-\nMissile Missile Systems Office. With a staff of 5 military and 19 \ncivilians, this organization set the foundation of the Army's space and \nmissile defense programs. From these beginnings, they have become an \ninternational organization of more than 2,000 military and civilians \ndevoted to providing around-the-clock space and missile defense \nresearch and development and operational capabilities. I wish to \nexpress my congratulations to the Army community in northern Alabama \nfor their splendid record of achievement in space and missile defense \nand to ask my colleagues to join me in saluting them for their \ncontributions to the security of our Nation and her warfighters.\n  This organization and the U.S. Army have led the Nation in space and \nmissile defense from the 1957 authorization to proceed with the Nike \nZeus system to the deployed hit-to-kill national and theater missile \ndefense systems today. Along the way, the Army's missile defense team \nhas achieved a number of significant milestones: the first successful \nintercept of an intercontinental ballistic missile, ICBM, in 1962; the \nfirst deployed ballistic missile defense system in the United States in \n1975: the first non-nuc1ear intercept of an ICBM in 1984; the first \nkinetic energy intercept of a tactical missile in 1987; and the first \ndirected energy intercepts of rockets in flight in 1996. Their \nbattletested products are currently deployed around the world defending \nour Nation, our service members, and our allies.\n  In 1957, missile defense brought a new facet to the Army's \nexploration of space in the 1950s. As missions changed, it remained \nconstant. In the 1970s, the Army returned to space exploration with a \nprecedent setting tactical exploration program. From the 1970s through \nOperation Desert Storm, the first space war, space has become an \nintegral element of the warfighter's life. Since then, this \norganization has become the focal point for Army Space. They provide \nresearch and development to expand the possibilities provided by space. \nThey have established a brigade of space soldiers dedicated to space \nsuperiority and the application of space technology. And today, space \nsoldiers and technologies continue to provide battlefield \ncommunications, satellite imagery and analysis, three-dimensional \nvisualization, guidance information, precise early warning of threat \nmissiles, and a host of other space-based capabilities tailored for the \nwarfighter.\n  Together with their Government and industry teammates, the future of \nspace and missile defense rests in the hands of the men and women who \nwork in this Army organization in Huntsville and Colorado Springs, as \nwell as other locations throughout the world.\n  Mr. President, I salute Huntsville, the surrounding area, and the \nhard-working men and women of this great region of our country. Most \nimportantly, I wish to extend a warm and hearty congratulations to the \nU.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command team for a job well done, \nand best wishes for its continued success during the next 50 years and \nbeyond. Secure the high ground.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12377-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12377-S12378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PUBLIC LANDS DAY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this past Saturday was National Public \nLands Day. On September 29, hundreds of thousands of citizens from \nacross the country volunteered to give their time to improve our public \nlands. These volunteers cleared obstructed trails, picked up litter, \nplanted trees, removed invasive species, and taught young Cub Scouts \nand Girl Scouts about camping. I commend all volunteers for their \ncommitment.\n  Now in its 14th year, National Public Lands Day has become the \nlargest grassroots volunteer effort on behalf of our public parks, \nrivers, lakes, forests, rangelands, and beaches. Last year, an \nestimated $11 million worth of labor intensive work was carried out, \nand this year it is expected that $12 million of improvements were \nadded to America's public lands.\n  On Wednesday, September 27, the front page of USA Today displayed a \npicture of Coeur d'Alene, ID, with a headline that read ``No end in \nsight for Idaho's growth.'' The article went on to provide a breakdown \nof how Idaho's economy has remained strong despite the current slump in \nthe housing market. It reads, ``[An] ingredient in Idaho's boom has \nbeen the ``amenities business''--hiking, hunting, fishing, skiing, \nwhitewater rafting--that attracts tourists and new residents, from \nbillionaires to young outdoor enthusiasts.''\n  Today Idaho is experiencing a new brand of tourists and a new brand \nof neighbors moving in down the street. These people are focused on the \nvigorous quest for a quality of life that includes the enjoyment of the \noutdoors. What ties the third generation Idahoan to a newcomer is an \nappreciation for the resources and the value that multiple uses \ncontribute to our livelihoods and communities.\n  The USA Today article also points out that ``[t]he federal government \nowns about two-thirds of the land in Idaho, mostly national forests. \nThe state has 21 million acres of roadless wilderness, about the size \nof South Carolina and more than any state except Alaska.'' Public lands \nhave much to offer and are very beneficial for Idaho.\n  There are a myriad of different resources that can be responsibly \nharvested or extracted from our public lands. From sustainably managed \nforests to livestock use to oil and geothermal potential, these lands \nhold the resources Americans rely on to achieve the standard of living \nthat we have today.\n  Using the resources on our own public lands, as opposed to relying on \nforeign resources, affords us the opportunity to fund schools, \nhighways, and national defense, all the while easing the financial \nburden on the taxpayers.\n  There are those, however, who would prefer to see land management \nagencies take more of a preservationist role, prohibiting access to our \nnational forests, parks, beaches, and rangelands and leaving nature to \nrun its course. This is not a value that many Idahoans hold, and \nneither do I.\n  We must actively manage our lands so that the recreational and \nresource benefit can be utilized by every American citizen. Under \ncertain circumstances, active management includes limited access in \nspecific areas;\n\n[[Page S12378]]\n\nhowever, we must be cautious not to be overly restrictive of public \naccess to public lands. The same holds true for natural resource \nmanagement.

He served his country in the U.S. Air Force from 1964 to \n1968, and is a veteran of the Vietnam War. He also served three terms \nas the mayor pro-tem of the City of Ingleside, Texas, and was elected \nbusiness manager of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \nLocal 278 in Corpus Christie in 1977. He held this post until 1983, \nwhen he was appointed to the International Office of IBEW as the \ndirector of their Committee on Political Education. In 1998, he became \ndirector of the Political/Legislative Department, a position he has \nheld to this day.\n  For nearly four decades, Rick has fought to improve the working and \nliving standards for our Nation's workers. As director at the \nInternational Office, Rick spearheaded the modern political program of \nthe union, and transformed the way that unions effect legislative \nchange. He worked to get more IBEW members elected to office than any \nother union, and he established a full-time grassroots mobilization \nprogram at IBEW to give even a louder voice to workers' needs.\n  Throughout his career, Rick has been a forceful advocate for the \napproximately 750,000 members who work in a wide variety of fields, \nincluding utilities, construction, telecommunications, broadcasting, \nmanufacturing, railroads and government. Rick has served as a powerful \nchampion for the labor movement, not only because he was a skillful \nadvocate on behalf of workers, but also because he encouraged workers \nto make their individual voices heard. Rick understood the importance \nof workers engaging in the political process to elect members who made \nworkers' rights a priority.\n  Rick Diegel is a dear friend and an invaluable ally in the fight to \nsupport America's workers. He has left an indelible mark on the country \nhe has served his entire life, and he has improved the lives of \nmillions of workers. I wish him a retirement full of health and \nhappiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12378-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING MICHAEL HOOFFSTETTER\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize a \nfellow New Mexican, Michael Hooffstetter, for his hard work and \nadvocacy on behalf of individuals living with Parkinson's disease.\n  Michael is in Washington this week receiving a very prestigious award \nfrom the Parkinson's Action Network, the Milly Kondracke Award. The \naward's namesake was a well-known Parkinson's advocate who worked \ntirelessly to increase awareness of this disease and support Federal \nfunding for research until her death in 2004. The award is presented \nannually to an advocate who demonstrates the incredible strength of \nspirit and commitment to advocacy that Milly demonstrated. I am very \npleased that this year's recipient is Michael Hooffstetter.\n  Each of the last several years, Michael and others from New Mexico \nhave come to Washington and met with me to discuss programs that help \nthose suffering with Parkinson's disease. As the New Mexico State \ncoordinator for the Parkinson's Action Network, Michael speaks candidly \nabout his disease, the treatments he has undergone, and the effect it \nhas had on him and his family. Michael's Air Force service has given \nhim a special interest in the Department of Defense Neurotoxin Exposure \nTreatment and Research Program. I have always appreciated his honesty \nand insight and admire him for his advocacy.\n  Michael Hooffstetter has helped many people by dedicating his time \nand efforts through the Parkinson's Action Network. I congratulate him \nfor this award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12378-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HABITAT FOR HUMANITY\n\n   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish today to congratulate \nthe New Mexico affiliates of Habitat for Humanity on the completion of \ntheir 500th house. This house was built for Frances Marquez and her \ndaughter, 11-year-old Amanda Marquez in San Pedro, NM, which is located \nright outside of Espanola. The Espanola and Los Alamos affiliate of \nHabitat for Humanity gathered 100 people from Espanola Valley to \nvolunteer on this project and bring a real sense of community to the \nMarquez family's new home.\n  This particular house was a very special project. It involved the \ncommunity not only through the volunteers who built the house, but also \nthrough the suggestions of Northern New Mexico College surveying \nstudents who helped draft the plans for the house. Drafting instructor \nJeff Toomey brought this project to his class in order to give them a \nreal-world lesson on drafting plans for a client. Thanks to their \ninput, this house was specially designed to meet the needs of the \nMarquez family.\n  Habitat for Humanity is responsible for the creation and \nrehabilitation of over 150,000 homes since its 1976 inception. In my \nhome State of New Mexico, there are 18 affiliates of Habitat for \nHumanity who have improved the lives of families and communities by \nstriving to provide safe and affordable housing. As a Senator, I am \nalways looking for ways to help New Mexico communities be the best that \nthey can be, and thanks to organizations like Habitat for Humanity, \nthis common goal can be accomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12378-4", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12378-S12379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO GRACE PALEY\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the recent \npassing of Grace Paley. Grace, who called Vermont her home, was a \nrenowned and award-winning short story writer, a political activist, a \nwife and mother.\n  Although she spent much of each year in Thetford, VT, and we \nconsidered her an adopted Vermonter, her fiction was set in the \napartments, streets and neighborhoods of New York City. Grace Paley was \nnot attracted to the bright lights or famous personalities or glitter \nof New York; however, she was attracted to the quotidian lives and the \ninterpersonal and ethical problems faced by people very like ourselves. \nAs Grace once said, ``I'm not writing a history of famous people, I am \ninterested in a history of everyday life.'' She wrote about them in her \ntwo most noted collections of stories, ``The Little Disturbances of \nMan'' and ``Enormous Changes at the Last Minute.'' And she wrote \nbeautifully, and with great sensitivity to both the spoken language and \nto human relationships. Her work gathered enormous critical acclaim. \nShe was one of the great short fiction writers of our age.\n  Her home in Thetford, VT, was not some weekend getaway, some means of \nunwinding from the hectic pace of life in the big city. For Grace, \nThetford--and the State of Vermont--was a place where she could carry \non her long-standing struggle for peace and for social justice. She was \nan active, a very active, presence in the local community. Whether it \nwas through her long-standing commitment to bringing peace to the world \nor her many local readings of her fiction, Grace Paley was a presence \nin our lives--and a beloved local figure. She never sought the \nspotlight, but she did not shy away from it when she felt her cause was \njust. She lived her convictions and served as a model for generations \nof women, of Vermonters, of activists.\n  In recognition of her contributions to Vermont, Grace Paley was \nawarded the title of ``Vermont State Poet'' in 2003, a position that \nhad been held previously by Robert Frost, among others. She was also \nawarded the title of ``New York State Writer'' by Mario Cuomo in\n\n[[Page S12379]]\n\n1986. It is a fitting testimony to the quality and importance of her \nliterary work that both States, which she called home, chose to honor \nher in this fashion.\n  Grace Paley will be sorely missed, but her work, her passion for \npeace and justice, and her love of her fellow Vermonters will not be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12379-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12379-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12379-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              ENROLLED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS SIGNED\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2007, the \nfollowing enrolled bills and joint resolutions, previously signed by \nthe Speaker of the House, were signed on September 28, 2007, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, by the President pro tempore [Mr. Byrd].\n\n       H.R. 976.

A bill to amend title V of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 to reduce class size through the use of highly \nqualified teachers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleague, \nSenator Murray, in introducing legislation--the Facilitating \nOutstanding Classrooms Using Size Reduction (FOCUS) Act of 2007--that \nwill provide $2 billion in funding to help, States and school districts \nhire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size, particularly in the \nearly grades.\n  When a teacher is responsible for a classroom of 25, 30, or more \nstudents, how can we expect each student to receive enough time and \nattention? One pillar of our education system should be small classes. \nThe body of research around class size has consistently shown that \nsmaller classes improve student performance, including reading and \nmathematics, in the early grades as well as in subsequent years when \nstudents are placed in larger classes. Research also shows that at the \nend of fifth grade, students who were in small classes in first through \nthird grades were about half a school year ahead of students from \nlarger classes in all core subjects--reading, language arts, math, and \nscience. Additionally, studies have found that students from small \nclasses earn better grades in high school, take more advanced courses, \nand are more likely to take college-entrance exams. They are also more \nlikely to graduate from high school than students in larger classes.\n  Small classes also enable teachers to teach better. Any teacher will \ntell you that small classes make a difference. Small classes allow \nteachers to spend more time on instruction, get to know their students \nbetter, spend less time on discipline problems, and better identify \nstudents who need individually tailored assistance. The difference \nbetween teaching large classes and teaching small classes is \nsubstantial, and the pedagogy required for each differs.\n  I have stood with Senator Murray on previous legislation to reduce \nclass size in our Nation's schools, and I am proud to stand with her \nagain today in support of a class size reduction bill. The bill we \noffer today strengthens our earlier efforts to reduce class size. \nFirst--the FOCUS Act would provide a dedicated funding stream for class \nsize reduction. The No Child Left Behind Act incorporated the Class \nSize Reduction Program into title II of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. The Murray-Biden FOCUS Act would create a separate \nfunding stream in title V for the class size reduction initiative--\nensuring that efforts to reduce class size would not have to compete\n\n[[Page S12382]]\n\nfor funding with a broad array of other teacher and administrator \nprofessional development and training funds.\n  Another provision that has been added are instructions that States \nand schools districts allocate their funding in a manner that creates a \ncontinuum of small classes for students as they progress from \nkindergarten to third grade and beyond. Research has shown that the \nbenefits of attending small classes are the greatest for students in \nkindergarten through third grade, with further benefits accruing to \nthose students for each additional year spent in small classes. The \nultimate goal is that a student in the kindergarten grade matriculates \nthrough first, second, and third grades--each with an average class \nsize of 18 students or less.\n  The bill also establishes a Web-based National Clearinghouse on Class \nSize that would provide research, best practices, and resources for \nsmall classroom instruction. This information needs to be broadly \navailable and easily accessible to the education community as well as \nthe public.\n  Additionally, the legislation requires an independent evaluation to \nbe conducted to determine the impact and effectiveness of the \ninitiative and the National Center for Education Statistics to report \non average class size data. It is imperative that we understand, \nobjectively, how these funds are spent, and what outcomes are achieved.\n  Mr. President, the ultimate success of our education system depends \non teachers. Ask any teacher if it matters whether they are teaching a \nclass of 18 students or 25 students and you will get the same answer \nevery time: absolutely. Smaller classes will provide teachers with the \nresources they need to create the opportunities for learning that our \nstudents deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Dodd, \n        Ms. Collins, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Domenici, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Martinez, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Smith, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n        Obama, Mr. Specter, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Brown, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Sununu, and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 2123. A bill to provide collective bargaining rights for public \nsafety officers employed by States or their political subdivisions; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Gregg \ntoday in reintroducing the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation \nAct, to guarantee that all firefighters, police officers, emergency \nmedical personnel, and other first responders across the country have \nfundamental collective bargaining rights. The issue is one of basic \nrespect for this valuable workforce, and I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this bipartisan bill.\n  The first responders of our State and local governments are on the \nfront lines of the effort to keep America safe. They perform difficult, \nexhausting work, day and night, to preserve and protect our \ncommunities. In this post-9/11 era, they have an indispensable role in \nhomeland security as well. It is vital to our national interest to \nensure that these essential public services are carried out as \neffectively as possible.\n  Strong partnerships between first responders and the cities and \nStates they serve are vital to public safety. Studies show that \ncooperation between public safety employers and employees improves the \nquality of services communities receive and reduces worker fatalities. \nThese strong, cooperative partnerships are built on bargaining \nrelationships. Every New York City firefighter, emergency medical \ntechnician, and police officer who responded to the disaster at the \nWorld Trade Center on 9/11 was a union member under a collective \nbargaining agreement, and those agreements strengthened their ability \nto respond in that time of crisis.\n  Unfortunately, many first responders across the country do not have \nbasic workplace protections. Twenty-nine States and the District of \nColumbia guarantee all public safety workers the right to bargain \ncollectively, but 21 States deny some or all of their public safety \nworkers this fundamental right.\n  Our Nation's first responders have earned the right to be treated \nwith respect. The Cooperation Act will ensure that they receive that \nrespect and will benefit from the same protections enjoyed by many \nother workers across the country. The bill gives public safety officers \nthe right to bargain over wages, hours, and working conditions, and \nensures that these rights are enforceable in State court. It also \nprovides an efficient and effective means to resolve disputes in labor-\nmanagement conflicts.\n  The Cooperation Act accomplishes these important goals in reasonable, \nmoderate ways. States that already have collective bargaining in place \nfor public safety workers are not affected by the bill. States that do \nnot currently provide these protections may establish their own \ncollective bargaining systems or ask the assistance of the Federal \nLabor Relations Authority in doing so. This approach respects existing \nState laws and gives each State full authority to decide how it will \ncomply with the basic standards.\n  America's public safety workers are prepared to put their lives on \nthe line for their community each and every day. They deserve a voice \nat the table in the life-and-death decisions about their work. It is \nessential for their safety, the safety of our communities, and the \nsafety of our entire Nation.

Res. 338\n\n       Whereas, through international travel, Americans can \n     individually play a major role towards improving foreign \n     relations by building bridges and making connections with \n     citizens of other countries;\n       Whereas interacting with the global community inspires \n     Americans to reflect on the diverse multi-cultural background \n     that has defined the United States as a great country of \n     cooperation and progress;\n       Whereas having a passport and traveling abroad creates \n     connections with the global community;\n       Whereas having a passport and traveling abroad promotes \n     understanding and goodwill throughout the world, opening the \n     doors to increased peace, tolerance, and acceptance;\n       Whereas having a passport and traveling abroad opens up a \n     wealth of educational opportunities and experiences for \n     Americans of all ages;\n       Whereas having a passport and traveling abroad enables \n     Americans to see first-hand the effect of the United States \n     on the world, including the tremendous amount of humanitarian \n     aid given by the United States through both public and \n     private sectors;\n       Whereas having a passport and traveling abroad reminds \n     Americans that they are members of a global family and gives \n     them opportunities to mend rifts around the world;\n       Whereas fewer than 23 percent of Americans have passports, \n     thereby limiting their ability to travel outside the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the more Americans travel outside the United \n     States, the more they will experience opportunities to \n     increase their understanding of the world and the place of \n     the United States in it;\n       Whereas the creation and support of a National Passport \n     Month signals to Americans the important role they can play \n     as ambassadors for the United States by serving as agents of \n     understanding, tolerance, and mutual respect; and\n       Whereas travel publishers along with travel editors from \n     the most prestigious media outlets in the United States, \n     student travel organizations, and book sellers have \n     designated September as ``National Passport Month'' to \n     educate the public about the importance of having a passport \n     and the positive impact international travel has on \n     individuals: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Passport \n     Month; and\n       (2) calls on the Federal Government, States, localities, \n     schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, \n     and the people of the United States to observe National \n     Passport Month with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12382-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12382-S12383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 339--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE \n                           SITUATION IN BURMA\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Biden, Mr. Lugar, Mrs. \nBoxer, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, Mr.\n\n[[Page S12383]]\n\nColeman, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Menendez, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nReid, Mr. Levin, Mr. Hagel, Mr. McCain, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Casey, Mrs. \nClinton, Mr. Obama, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \nSununu, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Whitehouse) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 339\n\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Burmese citizens, \n     including thousands of Buddhist monks and students, engaged \n     in peaceful demonstrations against the policies of the ruling \n     State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), demanding that \n     the State Peace and Development Council release all political \n     prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San \n     Suu Kyi, and urging that the government agree to a meaningful \n     tripartite dialogue with Suu Kyi, the National League for \n     Democracy (NLD), and the ethnic minorities towards national \n     reconciliation;\n       Whereas the State Peace and Development Council violently \n     dispersed the peaceful demonstrators, killing at least 10 \n     (and reportedly more than 200) unarmed protesters, including \n     a number of monks and a Japanese journalist, and arrested \n     hundreds of others, and continues to forcibly suppress \n     peaceful protests;\n       Whereas the National League for Democracy won a majority of \n     seats in the parliamentary elections of 1990, but the State \n     Peace and Development Council refused to uphold the results \n     or to negotiate a transition to civilian rule and \n     subsequently placed Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest;\n       Whereas Aung San Suu Kyi has spent most of the past 18 \n     years under house arrest or in jail, and is currently being \n     held in government custody, cut off from her followers and \n     the international community;\n       Whereas 59 world leaders, including 3 former presidents of \n     the United States, have called on the State Peace and \n     Development Council to release Aung San Suu Kyi and all other \n     political prisoners;\n       Whereas the State Peace and Development Council has \n     destroyed more than 3,000 villages, systematically and \n     violently repressed ethnic minorities, displaced \n     approximately 2,000,000 Burmese people, and arrested \n     approximately 1,300 individuals for expressing critical \n     opinions;\n       Whereas the United States Department of State's 2006 \n     Reports on Human Rights Practices found that Burma's junta \n     routinely restricts its citizens' freedoms of speech, press, \n     assembly, association, religion, movement, and traffics in \n     persons, discriminates against women and ethnic minorities, \n     forcibly recruits child soldiers and child labor, and commits \n     other serious violations of human rights, including \n     extrajudicial killings, custodial deaths, disappearances, \n     rape, torture, abuse of prisoners and detainees, and the \n     imprisonment of citizens arbitrarily for political motives;\n       Whereas the Government of Burma relies heavily on the \n     unconditional military and economic assistance provided by \n     the People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas on September 30, 2006, the United Nations Security \n     Council officially included Burma on its agenda for the first \n     time;\n       Whereas on January 13, 2007, China and Russia vetoed a \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution calling on Burma \n     to release all political prisoners, allow a more inclusive \n     political process and unhindered humanitarian access, and end \n     human rights abuses, and on September 26, 2007, China blocked \n     a United Nations Security Council Statement from condemning \n     the State Peace and Development Council crackdown against the \n     peaceful demonstrators;\n       Whereas the prevalence of tuberculosis in Burma, with \n     nearly 97,000 new cases detected annually, is among the \n     highest in the world, malaria is the leading cause of \n     mortality in Burma, with 70 percent of the population living \n     in areas at risk, at least 37,000 died of HIV/AIDS in Burma \n     in 2005, and over 600,000 are currently infected, and the \n     World Health Organization has ranked Burma's health sector as \n     190th out of 191 nations;\n       Whereas the failure of the State Peace and Development \n     Council to respect the human rights and meet the most basic \n     humanitarian needs of the Burmese people has not only caused \n     enormous suffering inside Burma, but also driven hundreds of \n     thousands of Burmese citizens to seek refuge in neighboring \n     countries, creating a threat to regional peace and stability; \n     and\n       Whereas the State Peace and Development Council continues \n     to restrict the access and freedom of movement of \n     international humanitarian organizations to deliver aid \n     throughout Burma: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to strongly condemn the use of violence against \n     peaceful protestors in Burma, and to call on the Government \n     of Burma to refrain from further violence, release the \n     demonstrators it has arrested, immediately cease attacks \n     against ethnic minorities, release Aung Sang Suu Kyi and all \n     other political prisoners, and begin a meaningful tripartite \n     political dialogue with Suu Kyi, the National League for \n     Democracy, and the ethnic minorities;\n       (2) to call on the People's Republic of China to remove \n     objections to efforts by the United Nations Security Council \n     to condemn the actions taken by the Government of Burma \n     against the peaceful demonstrators;\n       (3) to call on the People's Republic of China and all other \n     nations that have provided military assistance to the \n     Government of Burma to suspend such assistance until civilian \n     democratic rule is restored to Burma;\n       (4) that the Government of Burma should engage in a \n     peaceful dialogue with opposition leaders and ethnic \n     minorities to implement political, economic, and humanitarian \n     reforms that will improve the living conditions of the \n     Burmese people and lead to the restoration of civilian \n     democratic rule;\n       (5) to recognize and welcome the many constructive \n     statements issued by various nations, and particularly the \n     statement issued by the Association of Southeast Asian \n     Nations on September 27, 2007, which demanded an immediate \n     end to violence in Burma, the release of all political \n     prisoners, and a political solution to the crisis;\n       (6) that the United States and the United Nations should \n     strongly encourage China, India, and Russia to modify their \n     position on Burma and use their influence to convince the \n     Government of Burma to engage in dialogue with opposition \n     leaders and ethnic minorities towards national \n     reconciliation;\n       (7) to support the United Nations mission to Burma led by \n     Ibrahim Gambari, and to call on the Government of Burma to \n     allow the mission freedom of movement and access to top \n     government leaders in order to prevent additional violence \n     and to further peaceful dialogue towards national \n     reconciliation; and\n       (8) that the United States should work with the \n     international community to pressure the Government of Burma \n     to lift all restrictions on humanitarian aid delivery and \n     then allow international humanitarian aid organizations to \n     work to alleviate suffering and improve living conditions for \n     the most vulnerable populations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12383-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 340--RECOGNIZING THE EFFORTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF \n          OUTSTANDING HISPANIC SCIENTISTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Menendez, and \nMr. Salazar) submitted the following resolution;

This success has been founded in the \n     integration of these dependent processes.\n       (2) Air Force Air Logistics Centers have embraced best \n     practices, technology changes, and process improvements, and \n     have successfully managed increased workload while at the \n     same time reducing personnel.\n       (3) Air Force Air Logistics Centers continue to \n     successfully sustain an aging aircraft fleet that is \n     performing more flying hours, with less aircraft, than at any \n     point in the last thirty years.\n       (4) The purpose of the Global Logistics Support Center is \n     to apply an enterprise approach to supply chain management to \n     eliminate redundancies and improve efficiencies across the \n     Air Force in order to best provide capable aircraft to the \n     warfighter.\n       (5) The Air Force is working diligently to identify means \n     to create further efficiencies in the Air Force logistics \n     network.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the Air Force should work closely with Congress as the Air \n     Force continues to develop and implement the Global Logistics \n     Support Center concept.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3113.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Protocol of 2005 to the \nConvention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of \nMaritime Navigation (the ``2005 SUA Protocol'') and the Protocol of \n2005 to the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the \nSafety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf (the ``2005 \nFixed Platforms Protocol'') (together, ``the Protocols''), adopted by \nthe International Maritime Organization Diplomatic Conference in London \non October 14, 2005, and signed by the United States of America on \nFebruary 17, 2006.

They establish a legal basis for \ninternational cooperation in the investigation, prosecution, and \nextradition of those who commit or aid terrorist acts or trafficking in \nweapons of mass destruction aboard ships at sea or on fixed platforms.\n  The Protocols establish the first international treaty framework for \ncriminalizing certain terrorist acts, including using a ship or fixed \nplatform in a terrorist activity, transporting weapons of mass \ndestruction or their delivery systems and related materials, and \ntransporting terrorist fugitives. The Protocols require Parties to \ncriminalize these acts under their domestic laws, to cooperate to \nprevent and investigate suspected crimes under the Protocols, and to \nextradite or submit for prosecution persons accused of committing, \nattempting to commit, or aiding in the commission of such offenses. The \n2005 SUA Protocol also provides for a ship-boarding regime based on \nflag state consent that will provide an international legal basis for \ninterdiction at sea of weapons of mass destruction, their delivery \nsystems and related materials, and terrorist fugitives.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Protocols, subject to certain under-standings that are described in \nthe accompanying report of the Department of State.\n                                                      George W.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of this \nresolution that would designate the month of September as ``National \nPassport Month.''\n  Travel book publishers, along with travel editors from some of the \nmost prestigious media outlets in the United States and many student \ntravel organizations, have designated September as ``National Passport \nMonth'' as part of a campaign to educate the public about the \nimportance of having a passport.\n  This resolution supports the goals and ideals of ``National Passport \nMonth'' and calls on the Federal Government, States, schools, \nbusinesses and the people of the United States to observe the month of \nSeptember with programs and activities that will encourage Americans to \nget their passports and see the world.\n  Since 2000, the number of passport applications received by the U.S. \nState Department has increased by 66 percent. This year, the State \nDepartment is expected to issue a record 17 million passports, up from \nlast year's record of 12 million.\n  This surge in passport applications has led to longer processing \ntimes, averaging 6 to 8 weeks. As a result, there have been significant \nincreases in public requests for expedited processing.\n  The designation of September as ``National Passport Month'' will \nserve as an important reminder for the American people to plan ahead \nand begin their passport application process early.\n  Despite the significant increase in the number of passport \napplications being processed, fewer than 23 percent of Americans have \npassports.\n  This number is far too low. International travel provides a unique \nperspective of the world and is an invaluable opportunity to interact \nwith the global community and experience world cultures first hand.\n  I want to encourage the American people to get their passports and \nsee the world.\n  The designation of September as ``National Passport Month'' will not \nonly encourage the American people to avoid delays and get their \npassports early, but it will also acknowledge the positive impact of \ninternational travel in promoting understanding, tolerance, acceptance, \nand goodwill throughout the world.\n  On September 5, 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously \nagreed to an identical resolution introduced by Congresswoman Barbara \nLee. It is my hope that this body will do the same. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 339, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 339) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate on the situation in Burma.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I support the resolution offered by \nSenator Kerry on the current crisis in Burma.\n  In his April 16, 1963, letter from a jail cell in Birmingham, AL, Dr. \nKing wrote that ``freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor, \nit must be demanded by the oppressed.''\n  The people of Burma, are demanding freedom. They are peacefully \nmarching in the streets to demand freedom from an oppressor that is one \nof the world's worst human rights abusers. They are demanding freedom \nfrom a government that restricts the basic freedoms of speech and \nassembly, engages in human trafficking, discriminates against women and \nethnic minorities, uses children as soldiers and laborers, imprisons \narbitrarily, abuses prisoners and detainees, and rapes and tortures.\n  This military junta is now engaged in an attempt to violently \nsuppress the Burmese people who refuse to be silenced anymore. Those \nwho have taken to the streets are doing so at great personal risk. \nThousands were killed in a similar uprising in the summer of 1988. This \nbrutal regime is responsible for the destruction of 3,000 villages and \nthe displacement of 2 million people. The people of Burma are saying \nenough is enough.\n  Dr. King also wrote from his jail cell that ``injustice anywhere is a \nthreat to justice everywhere.'' That is why this resolution is so \nimportant and why I am so proud to be a cosponsor. It sends a strong \nmessage to those marching in the streets of Rangoon and Mandalay that \nthe United States is witness to what is happening. It also says that \nthe United States is working to rally the international community \nbehind the Burmese people as they strive for justice after years of \noppression.\n  This resolution recognizes that we can all play a positive role in \nbringing justice and peace to Burma, and that we must work with the \ninternational community to pressure the Burmese Government to lift \nrestrictions on humanitarian aid. It also calls on the United Nations \nto play a unique role in furthering dialogue toward reconciliation and \nconcurs with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations decision to \ndemand an end to the violence, the release of all political prisoners, \nand a political solution to the crisis. Finally, this resolution \nrightly urges that China end its military assistance to the Burmese \nregime, and that it no longer block the efforts of the United Nations \nSecurity Council to condemn the oppressive action of the Burmese junta.\n  I want to end with a quote from the icon of freedom in Burma, Aung \nSan Suu Kyi: ``We will prevail because our cause is right, because our \ncause is just . . . History is on our side. Time is on our side.''\n  We must continue to stand beside the people of Burma in that cause.\n  Mr. SMITH. I wish today to denounce the savage actions of Burma's \nmilitary government. During this past week, a familiar pageantry of \nriot police and soldiers deployed to stop the peaceful demonstrations \nof Burmese monks and citizens. These protestors demanded an end to the \ndictatorship which has governed Burma for most of the past 4\\1/2\\ \ndecades. They carried no weapons, incited no violence, and made no \ndemands beyond those which constitute basic human freedoms.\n  Their military junta reacted as that government always has: with \nsilence, with threats, and then at last with violence. I had hoped that \nthe course of these protests would not conform to Burma's old pattern \nof repression. So often in this decade we have seen the forces of \npeaceful revolution triumph over the institutional relics of an \nearlier, more brutal age. In Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan the old \nregime was toppled with barely a hint of violence. Elsewhere, like \nLebanon, strident democratic blows were struck against the ruling \norder. I remember not two decades ago, when the Soviet Union peacefully \ndissolved, its citizens having had finally enough of communism, misery, \nand the KGB.\n  Sadly, these bloodless successes are not always the norm. Events in \nUzbekistan and Belarus have shown us--as did Tiananmen Square 18 years \nago--that governments which are serious about holding power do not \ntopple easily. They draw on their full arsenal of modern repression, \nfrom electronic surveillance and torture to indiscriminate beatings and \nmurder. This is what has happened in Burma. We hoped for a bloodless \nsuccess, and we are rewarded with a bloody failure. For me, this is \nparticularly hard to bear.\n  I have been involved with Burmese political issues throughout my \ntenure in the Senate. I have cosponsored numerous bills and resolutions \ncondemning Burma's military tyranny and its human rights record. \nCongress after Congress, session after session, I have pushed for \nstricter sanctions on the Burmese regime. In 2003, I was a cosponsor of \nS. 1215, the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, which cut off all \nimports to the United States from Burma and authorized support for \nBurmese democratic activists. I likewise supported H.R. 2330, the House \nversion of that act which was eventually passed into law. Just this \npast summer, as I have done repeatedly before, I cosponsored a bill \nrenewing the sanctions of the Freedom and Democracy Act. In October \n2001, I voted for S.A. 1933 to the Foreign Operations bill, denying \nBurma outside aid unless Rangoon changed its behavior. And in March \n2005, I introduced S. Res. 91, which urged China to stop enabling Burma \nwith military support.\n  It is clear, however, that there is a limit to what my colleagues and \nI can effect from our seats in Washington. The regime which rules Burma \nis nearly impervious to outside pressure. The true wielders of \ninfluence--such as China and India--have been effectively silent thus \nfar on the junta's latest brutalities. And so today, the Burmese \nprotests have ended much the way I feared they would. There has been no \npeaceful overthrow of the government. There is now only the sight of \nthousands of soldiers patrolling the streets, the monks locked in their \nmonasteries, Internet and broadcast communication nearly cut off. We \nwill probably never know how many dissidents were thrown into jail over \nthe past week. We have only the haziest idea of how many Burmese were \nkilled. A regime deserter--a government intelligence officer--claims \nthat thousands were killed. We do know that Japan has confirmed the \ndeath of one of its nationals, a photographer who was caught up in last\n\n[[Page S12387]]\n\nweek's events. And we also know that Burma's emblem of democracy, the \nactivist Aung San Suu Kyi, remains under house arrest. She was allowed \nto speak with the U.N.'s special envoy last Sunday, the first foreigner \nshe has met in 10 months. She has languished under house arrest for the \npast 4 years, and under severe travel restrictions before then. Her \nfather, Aung San, was another famous Burmese leader and revolutionary \nwho was murdered before his dream of an independent Burma realized. I \ncan only pray that history does not repeat itself.\n  I imagine that Aung San Suu Kyi herself, however, would have more \nmixed feelings. Her father fell shortly before achieving a free nation. \nI imagine that such is her dedication, his daughter might readily \naccept the same bargain. Ten years ago, when her husband was dying of \ncancer in London, Suu Kyi was offered the opportunity to go visit him. \nIt was an agonizing choice. On the one hand, she was compelled to be \nwith her husband in the last days of his life, a man she had been \nprevented from seeing for years. On the other, she had absolutely no \ndoubt that once she left the country the regime would not allow her to \nreturn. It is not inappropriate to acknowledge here that the generals \nruling Burma are clever, having survived many threats to their rule. \nBut their semblance of cleverness does not detract from their \nbarbarity. There was much of both in their offer to Suu Kyi. They \ndangled her dying husband in front of her as incentive to leave Burma, \npossibly the cruelest bait imaginable. She declined.\n  I cannot begin to imagine how heartrending that decision was. Aung \nSan Suu Kyi has sacrificed almost everything for her country. I have \nlittle doubt that at some point, perhaps not far in the future, the \nregime will decide to take her life as well. As long as the military \njunta is in power, Suu Kyi and other brave Burmese who dream of freedom \nface a bleak fate. Watching the monks' showdown with police over the \npast week, she must have hoped against hope that this time would be \ndifferent. It would not be like 1988. Today there is the Internet, \nsatellite television, and digital cameras to shame the generals into \nrestraining their response. Sadly, and perhaps predictably, they did \nnot.\n  In a few more weeks, the world will go back to its other interests. \nThe U.N. envoy will make desultory progress in achieving his political \nsolution, and he will go home. But the Burmese people know, as I do, \nthat a political solution is unlikely. The military junta has stayed in \npower through brute force, though it sought legitimacy from Burma's \nmonasteries. After last week's beatings and killings of those monks, \nthat relationship is shattered. Stripped of its last veneer of \nlegitimacy, the government will fall back on its guns. But for its \nweapons, and its will to rule, this regime would long ago have gone the \nway of other bunker regimes, and today be little missed.\n  The one weapon it does not have, however, is time. Sooner or later, \nall tyrannies collapse. The effort of repression is ultimately self-\nimmolating; and then the regime's only lasting historical legacy will \nbe the misery it has inflicted. For the Burmese people, who suffer \nthrough this misery and resist the best they can, life will be \nunbearably harsh. I believe they will continue to resist regardless. My \ncolleagues and I will assist them however we can, in whatever small way \nis open to us. And one day, when the orange robes of the monks line the \nstreets once more and the troops are nowhere to be found, we shall have \nvictory, and a new day will break over Burma. They--and I--await that \nday.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, en bloc, and that any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

\n     and\n       Whereas the State Peace and Development Council continues \n     to restrict the access and freedom of movement of \n     international humanitarian organizations to deliver aid \n     throughout Burma: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to strongly condemn the use of violence against \n     peaceful protestors in Burma, and to call on the Government \n     of Burma to refrain from further violence, release the \n     demonstrators it has arrested, immediately cease attacks \n     against ethnic minorities, release Aung Sang Suu Kyi and all \n     other political prisoners, and begin a meaningful tripartite \n     political dialogue with Suu Kyi, the National League for \n     Democracy, and the ethnic minorities;\n       (2) to call on the People's Republic of China to remove \n     objections to efforts by the United Nations Security Council \n     to condemn the actions taken by the Government of Burma \n     against the peaceful demonstrators;\n       (3) to call on the People's Republic of China and all other \n     nations that have provided military assistance to the \n     Government of Burma to suspend such assistance until civilian \n     democratic rule is restored to Burma;\n       (4) that the Government of Burma should engage in a \n     peaceful dialogue with opposition leaders and ethnic \n     minorities to implement political, economic, and humanitarian \n     reforms that will improve the living conditions of the \n     Burmese people and lead to the restoration of civilian \n     democratic rule;\n       (5) to recognize and welcome the many constructive \n     statements issued by various nations, and particularly the \n     statement issued by the Association of Southeast Asian\n\n[[Page S12388]]\n\n     Nations on September 27, 2007, which demanded an immediate \n     end to violence in Burma, the release of all political \n     prisoners, and a political solution to the crisis;\n       (6) that the United States and the United Nations should \n     strongly encourage China, India, and Russia to modify their \n     position on Burma and use their influence to convince the \n     Government of Burma to engage in dialogue with opposition \n     leaders and ethnic minorities towards national \n     reconciliation;\n       (7) to support the United Nations mission to Burma led by \n     Ibrahim Gambari, and to call on the Government of Burma to \n     allow the mission freedom of movement and access to top \n     government leaders in order to prevent additional violence \n     and to further peaceful dialogue towards national \n     reconciliation; and\n       (8) that the United States should work with the \n     international community to pressure the Government of Burma \n     to lift all restrictions on humanitarian aid delivery and \n     then allow international humanitarian aid organizations to \n     work to alleviate suffering and improve living conditions for \n     the most vulnerable populations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/01/senate-section/article/S12388-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING THE EFFORTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF HISPANIC SCIENTISTS\n\n  Mr. BROWN.
