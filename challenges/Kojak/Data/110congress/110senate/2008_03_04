Mr. President, last Friday I stood on the floor of the \n767 line with workers in Everett, WA, who have put their hearts and \ntheir souls into making Boeing airplanes. I was there as those workers \nlearned that after 50 years--five decades--the Air Force no longer \nwants them to build its refueling tankers. I saw the dismay in their \neyes when they learned their Government is going to outsource one of \nthe largest defense contracts in history to the French company Airbus. \nIt was devastating news for Boeing, for American workers, and for \nAmerica's men and women in uniform.\n  Today, those workers are frustrated, and they are angry, not only \nbecause the tanker contract would mean 44,000 new American jobs in 40 \nStates, including 9,000 in my home State of Washington; they are \nfrustrated and angry because their Government let them down. They are \nfrustrated and angry because their Government wants to take American \ntax dollars, their tax dollars, and give that money to a foreign \ncompany to build planes for our military.\n  I am frustrated and angry, too, because I cannot think of a worse \ntime for a worse decision. Our economy is hurting. We are nearing a \nrecession, if we are not already there. Families are struggling just to \nget by, in part because their factory jobs have been moved overseas.\n  This tanker contract was not just one defense contract, it was a key \npiece\n\n[[Page S1488]]\n\nof our national and economic security. The Boeing 767 tanker would have \nhelped stabilize and strengthen the American aerospace industry. We are \nhemorrhaging manufacturing jobs to foreign countries already, so I \ncannot imagine why, at a time like this, our Government would decide to \ntake 44,000 American jobs, good jobs, and give them to the Europeans \ninstead of securing the American economy and our military while we are \nat war. We are creating a European economic stimulus plan at the \nexpense of U.S. workers.\n\n  I have a lot of tough questions I hope I will get answers to soon \nbecause there seems to be some real disconnect here. For one, how can \nwe, while we are at war across the globe, justify putting a contract \nthat involves military security into the hands of a foreign government? \nOutsourcing a key piece of our American military capabilities to any \nforeign company is a national security risk.\n  Airbus and its parent company, EADS, have already given us reason to \nworry about how hard they will work to protect our security interests.\n  In 2005, EADS was caught trying to sell military helicopters to Iran \ndespite our concern about Iran's support of terrorists in Iraq and \ntheir efforts to develop nuclear weapons. When they were confronted, \nEADS answered that as a European country, they were not supposed to \ntake into account embargos from the United States. Well, that is the \ncompany to which the Air Force is now going to give a major military \ncontract. But that is just one example. In 2006, EADS tried to sell C-\n295 and CN-235 transport and patrol planes to Venezuela--a \ncircumvention of U.S. law. We prohibit foreign countries from selling \nmilitary products containing U.S.-made military technology to third \ncountries without U.S. approval. Part of the reason is because we want \nto keep our weapons from falling into the hands of countries such as \nVenezuela which have threatened U.S. security and mean us harm. We \ncannot trust a foreign company to keep our military's best interests in \nmind, especially one that has a history of trying to sell weapons and \nmilitary technology to unfriendly countries.\n  But you know what, I think this raises a bigger question too. What \nhappens if France or Russia--which is pushing to increase its stake in \nEADS, by the way--decided it wants to slow down our military capacity \nbecause it does not like our policy? Do we want another country to have \nthat kind of control? I think that is one of the questions we need to \nanswer, and we need to answer it now.\n  I also want to know why this Government would choose an unproven \nplane using unproven technology for a program that is so vital to our \nU.S. Air Force. Tankers are so important to our military that Army GEN \nHugh Shelton, who was the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said \nthat the motto of the tanker and airlift forces should be ``try \nfighting without us.''\n  Boeing has 75 years of experience designing planes for our Air Force. \nBoeing's tanker has been a reliable part of the U.S. military fleet for \nso long that we have squadron pilots whose fathers and even \ngrandfathers have flown them. Boeing could have started building these \ntankers immediately.\n  In Everett, the machinists call Airbus's tanker a ``paper airplane.'' \nWhy? Because Airbus's tanker only exists on a sheet of paper. Now, \nalthough Airbus has taken contracts for tankers, it has not yet \nactually delivered a single refueling tanker, ever. Yet our Air Force \njust picked that plane--that ``paper airplane''--to serve one of \nmilitary's most critical functions.\n  Finally, I do not understand why the Air Force did not take jobs into \nconsideration when it awarded this contract. Yet that is what they said \non Friday. The Air Force said simply that Airbus's tanker will be an \nAmerican plane with an American flag on it. Well, you know what, you \ncan put an American sticker on a plane and call it American, but that \ndoes not make it American-made, especially if it was made in France. It \nseems to me extraordinary that when the military is deciding how to \nspend $40 billion in American taxpayers' hard-earned dollars, it would \nnot at least consider the effects it would have on the economy.\n  This is not just $40 billion either, and it is not just 44,000 jobs; \nit is much bigger because this affects Boeing's entire 767 line and all \nof the communities that depend upon it. In Everett, we know this. \nBoeing's health touches everything: how much people spend on groceries \nand clothes and whether they can buy a car or even a home. I think the \nEverett Herald put it in perspective Saturday when it quoted the \ngeneral manager of our local mall, who said:\n\n       When Boeing sneezes, we all grab for the Kleenex.\n\n  This loss is going to be felt in our homes and our businesses and \ncommunities throughout Washington State and the entire country wherever \nthere is a Boeing factory or a Boeing supplier.\n  Now, my colleagues from Alabama came on the floor last night and \ndefended Airbus. They argued that this contract does not outsource \njobs. We still do not really know how many jobs Airbus might create in \nthe United States. That has not been decided. The only thing we know \nfor sure is that much if not most of the initial work will be done \noverseas. And today, guess what. The Europeans are celebrating that. \nThe United Kingdom's Business Secretary is already counting the jobs. \nDo not listen to me. Listen to what they are saying in their papers \noverseas over the weekend after the contract was announced.\n  UK's Business Secretary, John Hutton, quoted in the papers in Europe \nover the weekend:\n\n       The massive contract will secure a number of years of work \n     for the UK industry benefitting not just Airbus UK, but also \n     many other UK suppliers.\n\n  The German Government's coordinator for the aerospace industry said \nover the weekend:\n\n       It is a massive breakthrough for the European aerospace \n     industry on the key American market.\n\n  They are not talking about jobs that might be created in the United \nStates, they are talking about jobs that are being created--and lots of \nthem--in the European Union. For decades, we have been talking about \nthis, and now here we are.\n  What does France's Prime Minister say? He said of the victory over \nthe weekend:\n\n       It testifies to the competitiveness of our industry and \n     does honor to France and Europe.\n\n  They are not celebrating this as an American victory, they are \ncelebrating it as a victory for France and Europe. Europe has provided \nsubsidies for decades to prop up this company, Airbus, and EADS-Airbus \nis a European jobs program that has created an uneven playing field and \nled to tens of thousands of layoffs here in the United States. \nEuropeans are willing to do anything to distort the market and beat out \nBoeing.\n  The tanker they will supply for the military is a result of that \ndecades-long effort. I have for years--and my colleagues know this--\nbeen coming out here and urging the administration and Congress to \nfight to save America's aerospace industry from a European takeover in \norder to save American jobs. We have demanded that Europe stop the \nsubsidies and play by the rules. In fact, because of EADS illegal \ntactics, the U.S. Government right now has a WTO case pending against \nAirbus, the same company to which we are now awarding a $40 billion \ncontract. It took us 100 years to build the aerospace industry in this \ncountry. We have to defend it. Once those plants are shut down and our \nskilled workers move on to other fields, we cannot recreate that \novernight. What did the administration turn around and do? It handed \nAirbus $40 billion of taxpayer money and 44,000 jobs and did ``honor to \nFrance and Europe.'' It is no wonder Boeing's workers are angry. One \nworker said to me: It is a slap in the face. Many others are asking: \nHow could this happen?\n  I am angry too. I am looking forward to asking these questions of the \nadministration. The hard-working Americans in my State and across the \ncountry deserve to know why this administration has given their jobs \nand a contract involving a major piece of our military capability to \nFrance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, what on Earth is going on here? I am \nextremely disappointed. No, I am shocked. This isn't shock and awe; \nthis is shock and shock over the Air Force's decision to choose EADS or \nAirbus\n\n[[Page S1489]]\n\nover Boeing to make our critical new aerial refueling tanker. This is \nthe Air Force, not Alice in Wonderland. I pay credit and associate \nmyself with the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Washington, \nMrs. Murray, and thank her for reserving this time, for taking a \nleadership role, along with her colleague from Washington, Senator \nCantwell. I thank them both for their efforts. We are going to need a \nbipartisan approach to this to see if we can't get some answers.\n  Simply put, it does not make sense that the Air Force would choose a \nforeign entity that has no prior tanker experience to build the next \ngeneration of refueling aircraft for the men and women of our Air \nForce. I met with the Air Force yesterday. I appreciate that. It was \nabout an hour and a half meeting. It was not pleasant. We had what we \ncall ``meaningful dialog.'' I am still not satisfied with their \nconclusion. In fact, I think there are many more questions that must be \nanswered before this bid conclusion should move forward.\n  For example, as the distinguished Senator has pointed out, why can't \nthe Air Force brief Boeing sooner than next week? We already have leaks \nall over this town as to exactly what happened and the specifics of the \nRFP and the bid selection and everything else, but Boeing has not had a \ndebriefing. Yesterday the Air Force said it was OK, that Boeing said: \nFine, we are OK with a briefing next week on Tuesday. That is not the \ncase.\n  The two competitors were originally told that the briefing would be \nwithin 4 to 5 days of the contract announcement. The Air Force is not \nholding up to that bargain. Why did the secondary cargo mission--i.e., \na larger plane--factor so large in the announcement briefing when this \nwas a competition for a tanker? How could an airplane as large as the \nA330, which burns 24 percent more in fuel than the KC-767, possibly be \nvalued as less costly? How did the Air Force evaluate the risk \nassociated with a foreign government owning and subsidizing the Airbus \ntanker? Why were the fixed price options discussed at the announcement \nbrief when the life-cycle cost was supposed to be the only measure? Is \nthe Air Force concerned about delays and other issues stemming from the \nfact that EADS Airbus have never built a tanker with a boom? Will the \nAir Force need new equipment to deal with the repair of a foreign \ntanker? Why does the Air Force place cargo space over fuel efficiency \nand the ability to land and take off from more places? Where is this \nlarger airplane going to land? Is the Air Force prepared to pay way \nmore for the Airbus because of the amount of fuel it takes to fly them \nand the amount of capital it takes to open a brandnew assembly line in \nEurope? Is the Air Force aware that they currently do not use all of \ntheir available cargo space in the fleet? Is the Air Force aware that \nthe Boeing 767 would provide even greater cargo space than they have \nnow?\n  What about the issues regarding the fact that the EADS Airbus company \nmade the Lakota light utility helicopter? The way it was delivered, it \ncan't even fly on hot days. They are putting air conditioning units in \nthat helicopter. That makes it modified and makes it less maneuverable.\n  Is the Air Force at all concerned with the backlash, described by \nSenator Murray, all across this country regarding the fact that they \ndid not consider American jobs, much less the WTO dispute with Airbus \nor government subsidies issue with the EADS proposal? I can tell you, I \nhope I have been able to express my dismay over the Air Force's choice, \nbut the problems simply don't end there. The Airbus frame will be made \nin Europe. There is no question about that. The nose will be made in \nFrance, the wings in Great Britain, and part of the fuselage in \nGermany. Bonjour, the Air Force has certainly gone into the wild blue \nEuropean yonder, and they have never done this before.\n  The Air Force gave no consideration to the fact that Boeing has built \na tanker that lasted over 50 years. With every airframe being built in \nFrance, we are paying for the French national health care system. What \nkind of sense does that make? In fact, they gave more credit to \nNorthrup Grumman for making other defense systems as recently as last \nyear than they did Boeing. That is saying something about this \ncompetition when you consider Northrup won't even be making most of the \nplane. Airbus will. Again and again in this competition, the Air Force \nhas not judged the two bids fairly. Not only did they not consider past \nperformance accurately, they also placed a much higher price on the \ncargo space than they led anyone to believe.\n  As my colleague from Kansas, Congressman Todd Tiahrt, expressed \nyesterday in the meeting with the Air Force, if they wanted an aircraft \nas large as the KC-10, they should have put out an RFP for one. But \nthey didn't. They asked for a tanker, and that is what Boeing proposed. \nAirbus proposed something much different. It is my opinion that the men \nand women flying those aircraft are going to suffer for it.\n  Make no mistake: Unless something changes, we will be dealing with \nthe ramifications of this bid for the next 80 years. It will take \nAirbus longer to start up the assembly line than Boeing, and it will \ntake them longer to produce a viable plane. When they finally do, that \nplane will be just plain too big.\n  I am deeply troubled by this announcement. I expect to see a very \ndetailed documentation on the questions we raised yesterday that were \nnot answered from the Air Force. I also expect them to brief both \ncompetitors quickly. The long and short of it is, if this decision \nholds, it will be at the cost of American jobs, American dollars, if \nnot our national security.\n  I again thank Senator Murray for reserving this time and yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/04/senate-section/article/S1489-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments of my \nleader time, not to interfere in the record with this discussion that \nhas been ongoing between the Senators from Kansas and Washington.\n  Last week we debated housing. Democrats want to raise monthly \nmortgage payments on everyone who wants to buy a new home or refinance \nan existing one. Republicans have a broader, bolder plan. We want to \ncreate the economic conditions that make home ownership easier--more \njobs and higher wages. Our first priority is to help families who are \neither facing foreclosure or seeing the values of their homes drop as a \nresult of other foreclosures nearby.\n  This morning I want to talk about one specific action we can take to \nhelp these families. Home values are falling not only because of cut-\nrate sell-offs by banks but also because areas with high volume and \nvacant homes often see an increase in crime and neglect. One thing \ngovernment has done in the past to the help reverse a slide in home \nvalues is to make tax credits available to people who pick up \nforeclosed homes in affected areas. This worked in the mid-1970s when a \nperiod of easing credit led to overconstruction and higher interest \nrates. Congress responded with a $6,000 tax credit spread over 3 years \nfor anyone who bought a new home for their primary residence. This is \nwhat they did back in the 1970s. Home values were stabilized. Inventory \ndropped, and the housing market recovered.\n  Congress should do the same today. Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, \na real expert in real estate and housing, who spent decades in that \nfield, has a fabulous idea. He saw the good effects of the tax credit \nthat Congress provided back in the 1970s. Now he is proposing a $15,000 \ncredit spread over 3 years for people who buy newer homes with a first \nmortgage in default or single-family homes in the possession of a bank. \nLet me say that again. He is proposing a $15,000 tax credit spread over \n3 years for people who buy newer homes with a first mortgage in default \nor single family homes in the possession of a bank. Buyers must occupy \nthose homes as their principal residence to be eligible. We are not \nabout to let speculators come in and make the current problem even \nworse.\n  This is one idea Republicans are proposing to help families \nstruggling with the painful effects of the housing downturn. I \nmentioned some of these ideas yesterday. We will discuss others as the \nweek goes on.\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\n  A lot of families need urgent relief. They should know the Government \nis doing everything it can, without damaging our long-term economy, to \nhelp them through a very difficult stretch.

Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues, the senior \nSenator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, who did an eloquent job talking \nabout the shocking news that came out last Friday about the Air Force's \ndecision to go with the KC-30 tanker over the Boeing KC-767 plane. I \nknow my colleagues from Kansas want to continue this dialog as well.\n  What we see is a lot of concern and questions that have not been \nanswered by the Air Force. I appreciate the fact that Speaker Pelosi \nalso issued a statement today questioning the decision by the Air Force \nand asking for further congressional review. That is why my colleagues \nare here this morning. We want answers from the Air Force. Frankly, we \ndon't want to wait another week to get them. For 75 years, Boeing has \nbeen making tanker products. They know what they are doing. They \nsubmitted a bid to the Air Force for a more flexible plane with a cost-\neffective life cycle. It has proven boom technology. This technology is \nused to refuel aircraft for the militaries all over the world. Other \ngovernments have already bought this product and have made the decision \nto use this technology. It is amazing to my colleagues and me that the \nAir Force would make this decision about these planes based one bid \nthat is a proven technology and has proven successful for more than 70 \nyears and all of a sudden switch to a product that has yet to be built \nand yet to be proven. The Air Force has made assertions and assumptions \nwithout giving Congress the answers.\n  What I am really amazed about, frankly, is that we are seeing some of \nthe highest fuel costs in America and that impacts our Air Force as \nwell and I want to know why the Air Force picked such a large plane, \nwhen their specs clearly asked for a medium-sized plane. If the Air \nForce wanted a large plane, the Air Force should have simply asked for \na large plane. The Boeing Company could have provided a 777 instead of \nthe 767. But that is not what the Air Force asked. I take the Air Force \nat its word when they say they want to be more energy efficient. In \nfact, the Air Force uses more than half of all the fuel the U.S. \nGovernment consumes each year. Aviation fuel accounts for more than 80 \npercent of the Air Force's total energy bill. In 2006, they spent more \nthan $5.8 billion for almost 2.6 billion gallons of jet fuel, more than \ntwice what they spent in 2003.\n  If anybody thinks fuel costs are somehow magically going to come \ndown, they are not. The Air Force needs to consider the impact of fuel \ncosts in the future. In fact, I believe it is a national security \nconcern as to where the Air Force is going to get fuel in the future.\n  Just last Friday, the Air Force Assistant Secretary told the House \nArmed Services Committee that it wants to leave a greener footprint \nwith more environmentally sound energy resources. Well, if the Air \nForce is coming up to Capitol Hill talking about a greener, more fuel-\nefficient plane and at the same time awarding a contract for a plane \nthat burns 24 percent more fuel than the Boeing KC-767, they do not \nhave their act together.\n  This is what Assistant Secretary Bill Anderson said:\n\n       The increasing costs of energy and the nation's commitment \n     to reducing its dependence on foreign oil have led to the \n     development of the Air Force energy strategy--to reduce \n     demand, increase supply and change the culture within the Air \n     Force so that energy is a consideration in everything we do.\n\n  Well, I certainly want to know what consideration the Air Force gave \nto this new energy mandate in their decision to go with the KC-30 over \nthe KC-767, when the Boeing plane is 24 percent more fuel efficient.\n  Now, one of the things the Air Force stressed in the contract \nannouncement was the size of the KC-30. It is a slightly bigger plane, \nand the Air Force claims to want that larger plane because it can carry \nmore fuel. However, that fuel is going to cost us.\n  Since the Vietnam war, the average amount of fuel offloaded from \nthese air tankers is 70,000 pounds. When these tankers are out \nrefueling planes the average amount of fuel they need to carry to \ncomplete a mission is less than 70,000 pounds, and that is during \ncombat operations when they are very busy, which obviously would be \nless during in peacetime operations. This begs the question: Why did \nthe Air Force choose a foreign-built tanker that has the capacity to \ncarry 245,000 pounds of fuel versus the right-sized plane from Boeing \nthat carries 205,000 pounds of fuel? Why did they choose a plane they \nknow is going to have more expensive life cycle costs and more \nexpensive on fuel costs, instead of buying the right sized plane? That \nwould be like driving a humvee to the Capitol every day when you could \ndrive a more fuel-efficient car. The Air Force has to live up to their \ncommitment to a greener energy strategy.\n  The second issue that is troubling to me is the fact that there is an \nissue about runway, ramp, and infrastructure capacity. The KC-767 \ntanker is a smaller plane, it has ability to land on many more \nairstrips we have access to around the world. The Boeing tanker can \nland on shorter runways, takes up less ramp space, and altogether needs \nless infrastructure. The KC-767 can operate at over 1,000 bases and \nairstrips worldwide.\n  For example, at a strategic central Asian airbase in Manas, \nKyrgyzstan that I think is key to the war on terrorism, the current \nrunway cannot support the KC-30 plane. It cannot support the plane the \nAir Force just selected. However, it can support the KC-767 that Boeing \noffered. Again, it begs the question: why did the Air Force would \nchoose a larger plane when it knows it is going to be unable to land at \nmany bases and airstrips? Are we going to have to pay for the cost of \ninfrastructure improvements of that as well?\n  It is very important, given these fuel issues and these \ninfrastructure issues, that the Air Force prove to Congress that the \ncost-effectiveness throughout the life cycle of this procurement really \ndoes pan out. If we are simply talking about buying cheaper planes up \nfront, but the life-cycle cost of these planes turns out to be \nexorbitant--because the fuel is more expensive, because the plane \ncannot land at various bases--and you have to spend billions more on \nboth of those things, that is very troubling.\n  The reason this is so troubling to me is because I have seen this \nsame issue play out in the commercial marketplace. Airbus planes have \nbeen backed by government financing in the commercial markets, so they \nwere able to put a cheaper plane out in front of many governments \nacross the globe. Boeing, on the other hand, has proven with technology \nto have more fuel-efficient planes, and they were able to show people \nthat the true life cycle costs of their planes were actually more cost \neffective. The end result is a WTO dispute over the financing of Airbus \nby government-backed operations.\n  What I am trying to say is that the private sector has figured it \nout. In the commercial space, fuel-efficient planes are paying their \nway. I wonder why the Air Force did not figure out the same scenario \nand did not figure out that they will save U.S. taxpayers' dollars by \nhaving a more fuel-efficient plane. I also ask the Air Force to explain \nwhen the Boeing tanker is 22 percent cheaper to maintain because of the \nflexibility advantages it has.\n  I have concerns that Boeing worked hard to meet the requirements the \nAir Force set. The 767 platform best matched what the Air Force wanted. \nIf they wanted a bigger plane with more capacity, they simply could \nhave asked for one. Yet here we are with a questionable decision that I \nthink raises concerns about the ability of the Department of Defense to \nmaintain critical skills. We need to make sure there is a homegrown \nworkforce and engineers to deliver products we need.\n  The U.S. Government needs to consider the national security \nimplications of fuel efficiency in this procurement decision. It needs \nto take a look\n\n[[Page S1491]]\n\nat the U.S. workforce and determine whether the loss of high-skill \nmanufacturing jobs is impacting our national security. I plan to ask \nthe Government Accountability Office to investigate these issues and \nreport back to Congress so we can have a full debate and move ahead.\n  I will remind the Air Force that in the conclusion of their testimony \nlast week before Congress, they stated: We will continue to wisely \ninvest in our precious military construction and operations and \nmaintenance. They highlighted energy as the key element wise \ninvestment. I think the Air Force has a lot of explaining to do, and I \nwant to know why they have made this choice. I guarantee you that \nCongress will continue to ask the tough questions until the information \nis clear to everyone in America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I thank my colleagues. I, too, am from a State that is keenly \nimpacted by what is taking place on this bid proposal. The Air Force's \ndecision to award a new tanker contract last week is a crowning \nachievement, not for the Air Force or the United States but for Airbus \nand the Europeans.\n  We were saying in our office, I wonder if in the future our young men \nand women going into the Air Force to fly these planes or to work on \nthese planes are going to have to pass a test in French--``Parlez-vous \nfrancais?''--to be able to determine whether we can work on these \naircraft. And to be able to get maintenance, equipment, and training, \nwell, we are going to have to go to Europe to be able to do that. We \nare going to have to get the people who built them to tell us how to do \nit. I do not think that is right.\n  I also would like to say to my colleagues, I have been around this \nfight between Airbus and Boeing for a long time, and Airbus has \nsubsidized itself directly into the commercial aviation market. They \nhad zero market share 30 years ago. They started a European consortium \ncalled Airbus and EADS to be able to get at Boeing and into the \ncommercial aviation market. They completely subsidized their way into \nit. It got to a point with the subsidies where they were taking over \nhalf of the marketplace in commercial aviation. Now here we go again. \nWe are just now on the defense side of it. Instead of the commercial \nside, we are on the defense side.\n  This aircraft which EADS and Airbus have put together is heavily \nsubsidized by European governments, by European treasuries, to be able \nto get a price point, to be able to compete against a well-known Boeing \naircraft that has been in our fleet for decades, that has worked well \nfor decades, that has been used to train our young pilots and multiple \ngenerations of pilots on this tanker. Now we are going to put those \npilots in an Airbus plane, and they are going to land in fields all \nover the world in an Airbus airplane--our U.S. military risking life \nand limb--while the Europeans make money off of us and get into, by \nsubsidization, a defense marketplace.\n  Make no mistake, this is just a start. This is what the Europeans did \nin commercial aviation. They started subsidizing commercial aviation. \nThey got in one place, got all the market share, and subsidized into \nanother one.\n  They do things called launch aid. I don't know, my colleagues \nprobably are not familiar with launch aid, but launch aid is where \nEuropean governments say: We will give you this much money to start \nthis aircraft, and if you stop producing this aircraft, then you have \nto pay the money back. Well, it then pays them to keep producing the \naircraft, and even selling it at a loss, because then they do not have \nto pay the launch aid back.\n  Well, now they are doing it in a defense contract field, and they \nstart with tankers. The Europeans start with tankers. Then they will go \nwith surveillance aircraft. Then they will move to other airframes, to \nwhere then is it going to be all of our major airframes that are going \nto be made by the Europeans?\n  I like the comment from my colleague from the State of Washington: \nWhat happens if the Europeans are not pleased with what we are doing in \nthe war on terrorism or what we are doing in the defense of Israel and \nif then their governments start saying: Well, I don't like what your \npolicy is in the Middle East. Now, as you know, what they do is they \nsay: Well, we are not going to give you overflight rights. We are not \ngoing to let you fly your planes out of Germany or not let you fly your \nplanes out of Great Britain. We are going to stop you.\n  What if in the future they start saying: We are not going to sell you \nspare parts. Then where are we at that point in time? What do we say to \nthem? I do not know how to use my French enough to plead and beg for \nspare parts, but I really do not want to be in that spot, and I do not \nthink we should.\n  As a friend of mine said to me this morning--he is for a very open \ntrading system--he said: There are two things we should not be \ndependent upon other governments for: one is for your defense, and one \nis for your food. Those are just two things you should not be dependent \nupon another government for. Now we are going to be dependent for our \ndefense on a European government that often goes a different way than \nus. I think this is crazy. For a decision that is going to last--as my \ncolleague, my seatmate from Kansas, said--for up to 80 years, that just \ndoes not seem to be a smart way to go.\n  This is one Senator who is going to fight against this, who is going \nto fight against this in the appropriations process. I do not think it \nis smart. I think it is the wrong thing to do.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, will my colleague and friend yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I say to the Senator, you brought something up that I \nthink is very important. As you look at the various countries that form \nup EADS and Airbus and that will participate in this joint effort, \nwhich is subsidized, even though we have a WTO case against them, what \nhappens if these countries do not agree, as the Senator has pointed \nout, with our appropriate policy in regard to the war against terrorism \nor any other endeavor?\n  The example I would like to make is: Look at the amount of money \nthese countries, in their gross domestic product, give to defense. The \nanswer is almost zero. Look at the amount of investment they give to \nNATO, where we are now fighting al-Qaida in Afghanistan. A few \ncountries will fight with us. Note the word I said: ``fight.'' As to \nother countries that are now receiving this contract, despite the fact \nthey are subsidizing their own product, they are not fighting in \nAfghanistan. They are not contributing to NATO in a positive way. Some \nof them are there, but they do not enter into the battle.\n  Now, here we are, with the American taxpayer paying for the security \nof Europe and Europe really not facing up to the task of funding and \nparticipating in NATO to the extent they can. Yet, in regard to our \nnational security with this particular purchase--and if you do not have \ntankers, you do not have global reach, you cannot go anywhere, you have \naccess denial, and you cannot even fight the war in regard to \nAfghanistan or any future place. Yet they are absent without leave, \nthey are not even there. So I think my friend has made an excellent \npoint and I thank him for his comments. We are going to join in an \neffort to see what can be done because this is harmful not only in \nregards to workers in France, vis-a-vis these workers in America, but \nit involves our national security.\n\n  I think my colleague and my friend from Kansas has made an excellent \npoint.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I appreciate my colleague joining with me. I wish to \nmake two other quick points. One is I think we need a long-term \neconomic model of the impact on our economy versus the impact on the \nEuropean economy. Because I believe if you look at the true cost and if \nyou look at the true impact of these jobs being in the United States \nversus subsidized jobs in Europe, you are going to see the long-term \neconomic impact on this country and on our Government with the taxes \nour workers would pay will be better by building the plane here.\n\n[[Page S1492]]\n\n  Second--and this is a strategic issue--this is a bigger plane that is \nbeing purchased by the military. It is going to need a longer landing \nstrip. Are those longer landing strips going to be available in \ncountries such as Azerbaijan or Kazakhstan or are we going to be able \nto get a longer runway to be able to land on? Now we have a plane that \nwill carry more fuel, but it will take a longer landing strip. We can \nbuild those in the United States. We can build bigger hangars here. Can \nwe around the world so we can have the reach we need?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Kansas yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am listening to the Senator from Kansas, and he makes \na very good point about the infrastructure that will be needed to be \nbuilt to build these larger airplanes. Was any of the cost of building \nthose runways or those hangars to accommodate the larger airplanes in \npart of the bid from Airbus?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I understand from the Air Force yesterday that some of \nit was, but I don't understand if it was--I do not know fully if it was \njust the U.S. cost or if it is also what we are going to have to get \nfrom other countries around the world on costs there for landing, \nlonger landing strips, and bigger hangars to be able to put any of the \naircraft in. So I don't know if that is fully in it as well. But these \nare huge, decade-long projects and costs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator. I think it is a point we have to \nlook at in terms of the costs of providing this military contract to a \nsubsidized foreign company as well as the future costs--not just for \nthose airplanes but for the infrastructure to handle it and our \ncapability of doing that.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, we have just started this discussion, \nand I think it is a big one, I think it is an important one, whether we \nshould be dependent upon European governments for our global reach in \nmilitary for our aircraft. That is what tankers provide us is a global \nreach and whether we should be dependent on the European governments--\nupon the French, upon the Germans, upon the Brits--for our global \nreach. I don't think we should be. I think we have to look at the \nsubsidization of this cost by the Europeans. I think that needs to be \ndiscounted and taken out of this proposal. I think we have to look at a \nlong-term project, and we are going to be talking about this a lot \nbefore we go forward with this--as Chancellor Merkel called it, this \ngiant success for Airbus and the European aviation industry. It may \nhave been that it is at our cost. I am not going to stand still and let \nit happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the regular business? Are we in \nmorning business? Do we have a half hour?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are in morning business and the \nSenator has a half hour.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/04/senate-section/article/S1492-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1492-S1495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am going to speak, and then I understand \nthe Senator from Texas is going to speak a little bit about the coming \nevents of the next 2 weeks which will be the issue of how we address \nthe budget of the United States. This is an annual event, of course, \nand so what I am going to give is a little review of last year's budget \nand where we are going with this year's budget. I regret to say it is a \nreview of what amounts to basically a horror movie because the budget \nwhich was produced last year by the Democratic Congress was a horrible \nthing for the American people in the way of increasing taxes and \nincreasing spending and increasing debt on the American people.\n  Now, we will hear from the other side of the aisle: Well, the \nPresident's budget does this and the President's budget does that and \nthe President's budget does this. However, I think the people who are \nlistening to this discussion should understand the President has no \nlegal responsibility in the area of the budget and producing the \nbudget; that under the Budget Act, the President can send up a budget \nand that is where it stops. The actual budget is produced by the \nCongress of the United States, the House and the Senate. It is not--and \nthis is important--it is not signed by the President of the United \nStates. He cannot veto it. The budget of the United States is purely a \nchild of and a product of the House and the Senate and the U.S. \nGovernment. So it is our responsibility--not the President's \nresponsibility--to produce a budget that is responsible for the \nAmerican people and especially for working Americans, so they are not \noverburdened by the Government, and for our children and \nour grandchildren, so we don't put too much debt on them as a \ngovernment.\n\n  Last year was the first time the Democratic Congress produced a \nbudget in 12 years. They had the benefit of the doubt. When they said \nthey were going to control spending, people gave them the benefit of \nthe doubt. When they said they were going to address the problems which \nwe confront with entitlements because of the baby boom generation and \nthe cost that is going to be put on our children, people gave them the \nbenefit of the doubt. When they said they were going to use pay-go \nrules--this motherhood term--to discipline spending around here, people \ngave them the benefit of the doubt. When they said they weren't going \nto raise the national debt any more than the President was, people gave \nthem the benefit of the doubt. When they said they weren't going to \nraise taxes on the American people, that they were going to find \nrevenues by simply collecting taxes that were already owed, people gave \nthem the benefit of the doubt.\n  Well, the shell game is over. The benefit of the doubt no longer \napplies. The record is in and the record is pretty dismal.\n  The budget from last year produced by the Democratic Congress \nincreased taxes over a 5-year period by $736 billion. It dramatically \nincreased spending. In the discretionary accounts, the Democratic \nbudget last year, as it was finally executed, increased spending over \nwhat the President requested. The President requested a $60 billion \nincrease in discretionary spending. It increased spending or proposed \nto increase spending when you combine the supplemental proposals and \nthe actual budgeting proposals by over $40 billion. It added $2.5 \ntrillion--trillion--to the Federal debt over the 5-year period. This \nterm ``pay-go'' is the most abused term on the floor of the Senate and \non the floor of the House in the area of fiscal discipline: ``Oh, we \nare going to use pay-go to discipline Federal spending.'' We hear that \nfrom every Democratic candidate starting with their Presidential \ncandidates right down to their House Members.\n  Last year on 15 different occasions they either directly waived pay-\ngo or they gamed it in the most cynical manner by changing dates, \nchanging years, moving money here, moving money there, to the tune of \n$143 billion of new spending, which should have been subject to pay-go, \nwhich was not. It was simply added to the deficit and to the debt of \nour children, that our children will have to pay. They didn't do one \nthing about addressing the most significant fiscal issue we face as a \ncountry, which is the pending meltdown of our Nation's fiscal policy \nbecause of the $66 trillion of unfunded liability we have on the books \nas a result of obligations and commitments we have made to the baby \nboom generation which is beginning to retire right now--$66 trillion. \nThe President at least sent up a package which proposed trying to \ndiscipline the rate of growth of entitlement spending--specifically \nMedicare--in very reasonable ways, by asking people such as Warren \nBuffett, for example, to pay a fair cost of their drug benefit--people \nover 65 who have a lot of money should pay some cost of their drug \nbenefit; by using technology more aggressively, by limiting the number \nof lawsuits that are brought against doctors to something reasonable \nalong what is known as the California or Texas models. The President's \nproposals would have limited this liability here as it related to \nhealth care by $8 trillion. It would have reduced it. They were \nreasonable proposals.\n  But the Democratic budget, as passed and as executed, not only didn't \nlimit or reduce in any way this outyear liability, they actually \naggravated it. They aggravated it dramatically, by $466 billion over a \n5-year period. It was totally irresponsible.\n\n[[Page S1493]]\n\n  On the tax side, this tax increase is real dollars--real dollars that \nAmericans are going to have to pay. For 43 million Americans, under the \nDemocratic budget as was passed last year, their taxes will go up by \n$2,300 a year--$2,300 a year beginning in 2011. For 18 million seniors, \ntheir taxes will go up by $2,200 a year--that is a lot of money for \nsomebody--beginning in 2011. For low-income Americans, 7.8 million \nAmericans who do not pay taxes today because the 10-percent bracket is \nin place, their taxes will go up. They will have to start paying taxes. \nFor small businesspeople, 27 million small businesses that file what is \nknown as a subchapter S, which means they basically are taxed as \nindividuals, their taxes will go up on average $4,100. Those are real \ndollars people are going to have to pay in new taxes as a result of the \nDemocratic budget.\n  Let's put it in another context. The Democratic budget, the nightmare \nbudget, the shell budget, added $2.5 trillion to the debt: $736 billion \nin new taxes, $466 billion in new deficit spending in the area of \nmandatory increases, $205 billion over 5 years in discretionary \nincreases over what the President suggested--huge increases, totally \nirresponsible.\n  Equally important, as I mentioned, here is the tax increase, \ndiscretionary increase, the debt increase under the Democratic budget \nand absolutely no mandatory savings, which is the biggest issue of \nconcern for us as a nation as we look into the outyears from the \nstandpoint of being able to pass on to our children affordable \nGovernment. If you give to your children the debts of today, this $2.5 \ntrillion they added, and you put on top of that $66 trillion of debt as \na result of Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security costs that we \nhaven't figured out how we are going to pay for, you are essentially \ngoing to say to our children: I am sorry, you can't have as good a life \nas we have had as a generation. You are not going to be able to send \nyour kids to college. You are not going to be able to buy your first \nhouse. You are not going to be able to live the quality of life \nAmericans have been experiencing throughout the generation of the baby \nboom generation because we are going to put on you so much debt, so \nmany costs, we are simply going to overwhelm you.\n  What did the Democratic budget do to address that? Nothing. A lot of \nlip service. In one of the most obscene--obscene is the only accurate \nterm--actions of budgetary gimmickry, the Democratic budget claimed \nthey were going to raise $300 billion in tax revenues from people who \nowe taxes but weren't paying them. This is how they are going to pay \nfor all their new programs. They are going to raise $300 billion \ncollected from people who owe taxes. Well, yes, those are the \nestimates. There is a huge amount of money out there that isn't being \ncollected today and should be collected. But how much was collected \nunder the Democratic budget of that owed and unpaid balance? Zero. Why \nwas that? Why did they only get zero? Because they actually cut the \ndollars going to the Internal Revenue Service for enforcement. So not \nonly could the Internal Revenue Service not collect the additional \nmoney--and they could never have gotten $30 billion anyway--the highest \nestimate the Internal Revenue Service gave us was something in the \nrange of 20 billion to 30 billion was their best number. They plugged \nthis number in that the Democrats said they were going to get, which is \n$300 billion, and why did they plug it in? Because they wanted to spend \nit. They wanted to spend $300 billion.\n  It is pretty interesting because, if you go back here, you will \nnotice discretionary spending went up $205 billion, right here, and \nthey claimed they were going to pay for that and have a little surplus \nwith this empty number which they never got of $300 billion. Where did \nthe $205 billion actually get paid for? How did it get paid for? It got \npaid for by putting debt--debt--on our children's shoulders.\n  Then, on top of that, of course, they are going to raise taxes by \n$336 billion, as I mentioned. For 34 million Americans, it means a \n$2,300 tax increase.\n  As if this isn't bad enough, their track record now is such a glaring \nexample of fraud and misdeeds and misrepresentation of a shell game, of \nclaiming one thing and doing the opposite in the area of tax policy and \nraising taxes when they said they would not, raising spending when they \nsaid they would not, not addressing entitlements when they said they \nwould. As if that isn't bad enough, we now have the Presidential \ncandidates out there campaigning. On top of the track record of total \ngross fiscal mismanagement, we have Presidential candidates on their \nside of the aisle making proposals to increase spending which dwarf \nwhat is already here, a dramatic rise in spending.\n  Senator Obama, for example, has proposed 158 new programs that we \nknow of, that we can score--158--totaling annual increases in \nspending--annual--of $300 billion a year plus. Senator Obama and \nSenator Clinton say: Well, we are going to pay for this by taxing the \nrich; we will just tax the rich, tax the rich, tax the rich, tax the \nrich.\n  Let's look at the numbers. If we take the top rates in America, which \nare the rates the rich pay, back to the days of Bill Clinton, you take \nthem from 35 percent--they pay 35 percent of their income to taxes \nnow--take it back up to approximately 40 percent, 39.6 percent which \nis, I presume, what they are referring to--and, in fact, that is what \nthey are specifically referring to--they say they are going back to the \nClinton tax rates for the rich. You raise $25 billion in income taxes.\n  Senator Obama has already proposed spending $300 billion plus a year. \nSo he is short $280 billion. From where is that going to come? That is \ngoing to come from raising taxes on all the other Americans who work \nand pay income taxes. He is talking about basically repealing all the \nBush initiatives and, believe me, even if he does that, he cannot raise \nenough money to pay for what he is proposing. So he is talking about \nadding dramatically to the debt. It is a spend-arama, an Obama spend-\narama, which is going to cause us huge problems with taxes.\n  So as we go into this next budget, there is no longer the benefit of \nthe doubt out there for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nThey now have a track record of a budget that raised taxes $736 \nbillion, a track record of a budget that increased discretionary \nspending by $205 billion, a track record of a budget that increased the \ndebt by $2.5 trillion, a track record where they game their own pay-go \nrules--game them--so they spend $143 billion, which they should have \nhad to offset, without any offsets, and a track record of not \naddressing the most significant issue we have today, which is how do we \npay for the future costs of the retirement of the baby boom generation \nand not put that burden on our children.\n  I suspect the budget they are going to bring forward next week is \ngoing to look a lot like the one they passed last year. But when they \nclaim this year they are going to get another $300 billion from some \nwizard behind the screen by collecting taxes that are owed but are not \ncollected, I hope the press and the American people will say: But hold \nit. You already claimed that once. Are you going to do it again?\n  When they claim they are going to discipline spending around here by \nusing pay-go, I hope people will say: Hold it. Last year you said you \nwere going to do that, and you spent $143 billion subject to pay-go.\n  When they claim they are not going to raise taxes, somebody has to \nsay: Hold it. The only way you can pay for your program is to repeal \nthe tax laws as they presently exist and make the taxes go up \ndramatically on all Americans, not just on wealthy Americans.\n  And when they claim they are not going to increase discretionary \nspending, somebody needs to ask: Hold it. Last year you increased \ndiscretionary spending by $205 billion over what the President wanted \nin nondefense discretionary.\n  They have no credibility any longer. So I hope the American people \nand the press, and certainly I hope the Senate, will ask some serious \nquestions of them as they bring forward their budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from New \nHampshire for his leadership as the ranking member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee and somebody whom I think understands the complexities of the \nFederal budget better than just about anybody. I do not claim to have \nthat same\n\n[[Page S1494]]\n\nlevel of understanding, but what I do think I understand is what works \nand what does not work.\n  I will cite as an example a story in today's Wall Street Journal \ncomparing my State, Texas, to another State that I will not name for \npresent purposes, and wondering why the economy is booming, why jobs \nare being created in Texas when jobs are leaving the other unnamed \nState. They cited three main reasons. One is the belief in the benefits \nof free trade and selling our goods and services overseas in a \nreciprocal free-trade arrangement. They cite lower taxes which provide \nmore incentive for productivity. And they cite the fact that in Texas, \nyou have a right to work without having to belong to a labor union. You \ncan if you want to, but you don't have to in order to work. And I add \nto those three items, sensible tort reform, which has not only created \na business environment in our State which says to employers: You are \nnot prey for predatory activity on the part of the trial bar, but you \nare welcome in our State to create jobs. Yes, you are going to be held \naccountable, but we are not going to create a hostile litigation \nlottery which is going to chase jobs and employers out of our State.\n  A lot of those basic principles which have helped make my State, the \nState of Texas, such a welcoming State for economic growth and \nprosperity and creating jobs and opportunity apply to the Federal \nbudget, too, about which I wish to talk.\n\n  Senator Gregg had this chart up which talks about last year's budget; \nfrankly, things that were done last year that I hope we would have \nlearned our lesson this year and will not repeat. For example, last \nyear's budget anticipated a tax increase on the American people of $736 \nbillion. One might ask: From where is that money going to come? Is \nCongress actually going to vote for a tax increase? We may recall that \nthe tax relief that we passed in 2001 and 2003 was not permanent \nbecause we could not get sufficient votes to make it permanent, so it \nwas temporary. A significant portion of that tax relief--the capital \ngains and the dividends reduction--will expire during this budget \nperiod. It will result, if it does expire, without Congress acting, in \neffectively the largest tax increase in American history--but here is \nthe worst part--without a vote of Congress. In other words, by \nCongress's inaction, we will see the largest tax increase in American \nhistory, and that is part of the revenue that this budget that was \npassed last year anticipates.\n  That contradicts the lesson I mentioned a moment ago that we have \nexperienced in my State. We don't have a State income tax. We have \ntried to keep taxes as low as possible. It just makes common sense. You \ndon't have to have a Ph.D. in economics to understand that if you want \nmore of something, then you reduce the burden of producing it through \nlower taxes, through less regulation, and less litigation. If you want \nless of something, then you increase taxes, you increase regulation, \nyou increase litigation. To me, that is the lesson we have learned, not \nonly in my State, as I mentioned, but also in the Congress as a result \nof the tax relief we did pass in 2001 and 2003. We have seen more than \n50 straight months of economic growth with more than 9 million new jobs \ncreated in the United States since 2003. Was that an accident? Was it \nserendipity? No, it was a result of reducing the burden of producing \nincome and allowing taxpayers to keep more of what they earn, and it \nresulted, coincidentally, in some of the highest levels of revenue to \nthe Federal Treasury because more people were working. They were \nincentivized to work harder and, as a consequence, they ended up paying \nmore taxes which generated more revenue to the Federal Treasury, \nbringing the deficit down over what had originally been projected.\n  Of course, keeping taxes low is part of the equation. The other part \nof the equation is spending. As Senator Gregg pointed out, this budget \npassed last year dramatically increased Federal spending. This is one \nof the hardest things Members of the Congress have to do because, of \ncourse, we have people coming to see us every day saying: Senator, I \nwould like your help funding this transportation project or providing \nan appropriation to pay for this or for that. But the fact is, we need \nto be good stewards of the taxpayers' money, and we need to learn how \nto say no because it is in the best interest of our economy and, in the \nlong run, it is in the best interest of the American people because \nwhen we increase spending, we grow the size of the Federal Government. \nAs Government expands, individual liberty contracts.\n  In other words, the bigger Government is, the less freedom we have to \ndo what we want, as long as it is lawful. And what that means in the \neconomic sphere is we are going to generate more economic activity, \nmore revenue, create more jobs and more opportunity in the process.\n  So greater spending, dramatically increasing spending, is exactly the \nwrong thing. We ought to cut spending, eliminate wasteful programs, \nparticularly those--and I have spoken on this issue before. The Office \nof Management and Budget has a Web site called expectmore.gov. You can \ngo there and see a thousand different Federal programs that have been \nsurveyed by the Office of Management and Budget, 22 percent of which \neither there is no evidence that they are meeting their intended \npurpose or effective, in other words, or the Office of Management and \nBudget simply cannot tell. Those are exactly the kinds of programs, the \nkind of waste that ought to be eliminated to reduce spending so that we \ncan spend where it is absolutely necessary on our national priorities. \nBut eliminate that wasteful spending. This budget does not do that.\n  Then, I think the most, frankly, shameful part of this budget is its \nfailure to step up and recognize our responsibility to our children and \nour grandchildren who are depending on us to make sure they are not \nleft with a debt they have to pay but, rather, they are left with, \nhopefully, a better life and better opportunity than we as their \nparents and our grandparents had. I know that is what my parents wanted \nfor me and my brother and my sister. They wanted at least as good a \nlife as they had, hopefully better. That is what every parent and every \ngrandparent wants for their children and their grandchildren.\n  What has this Congress done to make sure that can happen? Frankly, \nnot much. Let me put it this way: not enough because what we see is a \ngrowing debt. This budget passed last year grew the debt by $2.5 \ntrillion. I know it is hard to think in terms of trillions. I doubt \nthere is a human mind that can really conceive of how big that is. I \nmentioned yesterday that a billion seconds ago it was 1976. We are \ntalking about not billions but trillions--a huge amount of money.\n  This budget grew the debt by $2.5 trillion but, frankly, what this \nproposed budget we are going to take up next week will in all \nlikelihood fail to address is 66--6-6--$66 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities of the Federal Government.\n  One might ask: We understand the budget deficit, but what is the \ndebt? The deficit is the amount of money we overspend each year, but \nthe debt is how much we owe to our children and grandchildren, the debt \nwe are simply passing down to them by failing to fix the Medicare \nProgram, failing to ensure that the Social Security Program is on a \nsolid fiscal financial basis. The fact is, there is legislation that I \nhope will be offered during the course of this budget debate that a \ntask force be created.\n  As a matter of fact, the distinguished Democratic chairman of the \nBudget Committee and Senator Gregg, as ranking member, have proposed a \ntask force so we can finally roll up our sleeves and come to grips with \nthis growing financial crisis and the debt we are simply passing on to \nour children and grandchildren.\n  I mentioned that $1 trillion is impossible, perhaps, for us to \ncomprehend, but let me bring it down to a number that we all can \nunderstand; and that is $66 trillion in unfunded liabilities due to the \nCongress's failure to deal with this growing cost of entitlements--\nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. If you divide that by every \nman, woman, and child in the United States of America, it comes down to \nabout $175,000. So $66 trillion in unfunded liabilities, for \nentitlements primarily, boils down to $175,000 for every man, woman, \nand child, including the baby who was born last night. That baby was \nborn into the United States--the most prosperous, the freest Nation in \nthe\n\n[[Page S1495]]\n\nworld--burdened by $175,000 of debt because that baby's adult parents \nand the people they elect to Congress have failed to take \nresponsibility to make sure that baby would be born into a world of \nprosperity, opportunity, and freedom. Instead, the baby has been born \ninto a world that has that freedom and opportunity but also is burdened \nby $175,000 in debt.\n  There are a lot of challenges that lie ahead, and I have other charts \nI won't bother the Members of the Senate with here today, but we have \nto have an important debate here as we write the Federal budget. I \nagree with the Senator from New Hampshire, this is not the President's \nbudget. As a matter of fact, everybody knows what happens to a \nPresident's budget, whether it is a Democrat or Republican in the White \nHouse. It is basically ``dead on arrival'' at Congress. I could say it \nanother way. The President proposes and Congress disposes the budget. \nBut it is our responsibility to write that budget, and we should do so \nin a way that is fiscally responsible.\n  We should also do it in a way that addresses the real pinch that \naverage Americans feel when they fill up their gas tank and find that \ngasoline is $3.25, $3.50 a gallon, on its way to $4 a gallon probably \nthis spring; and when they find that their health care costs continue \nto go up year after year after year such that they have less and less \ndisposable income. Those are the sorts of things we ought to be paying \nattention to--reducing taxes, eliminating the debt, taking \nresponsibility for that, and taking care of those bread-and-butter \nissues that the American people care about, because those are the ones \nthat impact their quality of life on a day-to-day basis.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/04/senate-section/article/S1495-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of S. 2663, which the clerk \nwill report by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2663) to reform the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission to provide greater protection for children's \n     products, to improve the screening of noncompliant consumer \n     products, to improve the effectiveness of consumer product \n     recall programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4090\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 4090, \nthat I wish to call up.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4090.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n              (Purpose: To correct a typographical error.)\n\n       On page 87, line 11, strike ``cigarette'' and insert \n     ``Cigarette''.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, we are today, once again, starting the \ndebate on the Consumer Product Safety reform bill. This is a very \nimportant piece of legislation, and I am sure Senators from all over \nthe country have heard from their constituents about this because we \nsaw last year a record number of product recalls, especially in the toy \narea. We saw last year recall after recall after recall, and some of \nthe news stories that made the headlines were about lead in toys, but \ncertainly the recalls last year were not in any way, shape, or form \nlimited to lead.\n  Lead is a very serious problem. We deal with lead in this \nlegislation. In fact, we virtually ban lead in all children's products. \nThat is a very important new safety rule. If the Senate adopts this \nmeasure, the new safety rule would be that there is a very tough \nscientifically based lead standard for toys.\n  When I say ``virtually ban,'' I do think it is important for my \ncolleagues to understand that we can probably never absolutely get rid \nof lead in any product because there is some lead out in the \natmosphere. It is a naturally occurring element. But we virtually ban \nlead in all children's products.\n  Another thing that we do, which I think is very important, is \nillustrated by this chart, and that is we recognize the changes in the \nU.S. economy. The last time the Senate reauthorized this legislation, \nwhich was in 1990 or 1992, we have to think about what the U.S. economy \nlooked like. If you think about how many imports we had coming into \nthis country from overseas, one of the things this chart illustrates is \nthe number of imports in dollar figures, starting in 1974 and going up \nhere to the year 2006. The actual numbers and the years aren't as \nimportant as the trend line. You can see what is happening with imports \ncoming into this country.\n  We all know we are getting more and more imports, and one of the \nthings I think we need to fight for is our U.S. manufacturing base, but \nthat is not the discussion we are having here today. We are seeing more \nand more imports coming into this country. However, at the very same \ntime, over the very same years, if you go to this bottom chart, again \nstarting in 1974 and going up to this year, you will see what the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission's staff has done year by year.\n  Unfortunately, you see it peak in about 1980 or so, and then it \nstarts to drop off dramatically. Here again, the numbers are not as \nimportant as the fact that you see this downward trend when it comes to \nemployees at the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The reason that is \nimportant--and, by the way, the numbers are 420 full-time employees, \nand at the height of the agency there were about 900. But those numbers \nare not as important as the trend. You can see that today we have less \nthan half of the full-time employees at the CPSC as they did 20 years \nago.\n  The problem is when you compare these two charts. Again, I totally \nunderstand we can work more efficiently today with things such as \ncomputers and telecommunications and all that. We can work more \nefficiently. We can do more with fewer people. I do acknowledge that. \nBut when you look at how the imports have grown and how the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission staff has shrunk, that explains why you see a \nrecord number of recalls. That explains why you see millions and \nmillions of products being pulled from the shelves last year. Because \nas the Consumer Product Safety Commission has become less capable, less \nable to deal with the changes in the import economy, what you are \nseeing is more and more dangerous products coming into this country.\n  I don't think it is an accident. My colleagues need to know that I \ndon't think it is an accident that last year every single toy recall--\nand we will talk more about this in a few moments--but every single toy \nrecall from last year was made in China. None of these were U.S. made. \nIn fact, they weren't made in any other country except China. So we \nneed to reexamine the priorities of this agency. We need to restructure \nthe agency in such a way that it meets the needs of the changing U.S. \neconomy. We need to help this agency right here, when it comes to \ndollar amounts and full-time employees for this agency.\n  Again, it may be another discussion where we try to help the U.S. \neconomy here in the number of imports and try to manufacture more \nproducts here--that is another bill and that will come at some point in \nthe future--but right now this is what we are focused on, is trying to \nmake sure that the Consumer Product Safety Commission is equipped to \nhandle the changes in the U.S. economy.\n  Mr. President, I see Senator Klobuchar is here, and she wishes to say \na few words. I will be on the floor all day today. I encourage my \ncolleagues to come down and talk to me if they have amendments. \nCertainly we have seen a growing list of amendments. My hope would be \nthat all the amendments would be germane and that we could maybe get a \nbipartisan agreement on amendments.\n  I know Senator Stevens has been very good to deal with on this \nlegislation. He and I have not talked about any of the amendments yet. \nI think our staffs have been talking with each other. But I encourage \nmy colleagues to come to the floor when it is convenient, or send their \nstaff over when it is convenient to talk about whatever\n\n[[Page S1496]]\n\namendments they maybe wish to offer. I know we had some meetings last \nnight with various staff people on certain Senators' staffs on the \nRepublican side of the aisle, and certainly we have an open door to try \nto talk through those.\n  One last thing, again for the staff members watching this on C-SPAN \nand for the folks all around this country who are watching it on C-SPAN \n2. We have made many changes in this legislation since it left the \ncommittee, and we have listened and we have worked very hard to try to \nfind common ground on a whole variety of issues. When we started, there \nwere maybe 20 or 30 or 40 controversial parts to this bill. I think we \nare now down to two or three. I am not sure that anyone has put a \nnumber on it, but we have worked very hard to try to come up with a \nbill that can have bipartisan support and something that people all \nover this country can be very proud of.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am proud to be a member of the \nCommerce Committee that passed this legislation through the committee \nunder the leadership of Chairman Inouye, Senator Stevens, and the \nConsumer Subcommittee Chairman Pryor. I am also glad this legislation \nincludes the bill I introduced that finally put a mandatory ban on lead \nin children's toys.\n  This legislation has been called by the Wall Street Journal as ``the \nmost significant consumer-safety legislation in a generation.'' That \ncomes from the Wall Street Journal. But what this is about is not all \nthe details of all the toys, which I am going to talk about in a \nminute, and the 29 million toys that have been recalled and what this \nhas meant to our economy, but what this is about are these little \nchildren.\n  Senator Pryor and I just left an event where two children, their \nfamilies, their mothers, were there to talk about what had happened to \nthem. The first was this little boy named Jacob. His family is from \nArkansas. The mom painted this picture for us. Look at this little boy. \nShe painted this picture that I will never forget, of her standing in \nthe kitchen one day and all of a sudden they see their little boy and \nhe is practically limp. Just like that he went from being a happy \nlittle boy playing.\n  What happened is he had swallowed one of these Aqua Dots toys, one of \nthese toys you put in water and it expands to an animal or whatever it \nis. He had swallowed it. So he is getting more and more limp, and \nfinally the ambulance comes and they end up in the hospital. Within an \nhour, he is completely unconscious. They have no idea what is wrong. \nUnconscious. They thought maybe he had swallowed a little toy, maybe \nsomething that you would think would be in his stomach creating some \nindigestion or something such as that, but the hospital tries \neverything they can think of. They thought maybe he had accidentally \ngotten into their medicine cabinet and they didn't know it and took \nsome medicine and something happened. So they gave him drugs to try to \nreverse it, but he wouldn't wake up. It was a complete puzzle because \nthey didn't know how this could have happened. Nothing they tried \nworked.\n  Finally, 6 hours later--and the doctor said if he hadn't been there, \nhe wouldn't have believed it--with all these tubes connected and \neveryone thinking they are going to lose him, he wakes up and he is \nfine. And they think: How could this happen? What is wrong? And they \nsimply don't know.\n  So they call the company that manufactures these Aqua Dots and they \ntry to write them. The mom gets home the next day and gets on the \nInternet with bloggers trying to figure out what could be wrong. She \nwrites letters to the company, trying to get information.\n  Well, finally, they tested him some more and they tested these Aqua \nDots some more. And what did they find? They found that the Aqua Dots \ncontained a chemical that was really the date rape drug.\n  The date rape drug, as a prosecutor, I can tell you that we handled \nthose cases where women have been slipped one of those drugs in their \ndrink; they are suddenly completely out of it and do not know what \nhappens. You know the crimes that have occurred as a result there.\n  But here is this little boy swallowing a dot, a dot that had the date \nrape drug in it manufactured in China. And that mother stood here with \nSenator Pryor and me and told this moving story and said: This cannot \nhappen to other parents.\n  She said: The Senators in this body, why do they not think if this \nhappened to their kid or their grandkid where they suddenly swallow a \nlittle toy and are out like that. It is like swallowing a gumball, out \nlike that for 6 hours thinking they are going to die.\n  Then there was another mother who came from Oregon. She told the \nstory of her son, whom we see now years later, Colton. When he was very \nlittle, he swallowed a charm they had gotten from some one of those \nlittle vending machines that you put your money into.\n  He swallowed it. And all of a sudden she said he started acting \ncompletely lethargic, not at all like the little toddler he was. And \nthey brought him into the hospital and they found out that charm was 39 \npercent lead, 39 percent lead.\n  Now, their story, unlike the story of little Jacob, did not end \nthere, because he has that lead permanently in his system. And today, \nyears and years later when they go to the doctor, he is still tested \nfor elevated lead levels. And, in fact, even a few days after he got \nhome, after they had gotten the charm out of his stomach, he bit his \ncheek and his cheek swelled up to the size of a golf ball because of \nthe lead that was in his system.\n  That is what we are talking about--moms getting little charms that \ntheir kids swallow, which used to be maybe if you swallowed a penny, \nhaving this kind of health effect.\n  We all know what lead can mean. I certainly know in Minnesota where \nwe had a little boy whose mom was not with us today. The mom was not \nthere because her heart is broken. Her little 4-year-old boy died when \nhe swallowed a charm that turned out to be 99 percent lead. And he did \nnot die from choking, he did not die because it blocked his airway, he \ndied because that lead seeped into his system day after day. And when \nhe died, he was tested at three times the normal lead level.\n  In 2007, nearly 29 million toys and pieces of children's jewelry were \nrecalled because they were found to be dangerous and, in some cases, \ndeadly for children. As a mom and a former prosecutor and now as a \nSenator, I find it totally unacceptable that these toxic toys are in \nour stores and on our shores. As my 12-year-old daughter said when she \nfound out that the Barbies were being recalled, she said: This is \ngetting serious.\n  The provision of the Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act \nthat I authored addresses some of the most serious discoveries of this \npast year. And that is the lead that has been surfacing in these toys. \nThe toy that little Jarnell Brown swallowed that led to his death was \nmade in China. It was 99 percent lead.\n  The toy that little Colton swallowed that nearly led to his death and \nhas led to elevated lead levels in his bloodstream for many years was \n39 percent lead.\n  These deaths, these injuries have been made so much more tragic by \nthe fact that they could have been prevented. These little boys should \nnever have been given these toys in the first place. It should not take \na child's death or severe injury or a child swallowing an Aqua Dot with \na date rape drug to alert us that there is a problem in this country.\n  Parents should have the right to expect that these toys are tested \nand that these problems are found before these toys get to the toy box. \nFor 30 years, we have been aware of the dangers poised by lead. We all \nknow about it from the lead paint standard.\n  But what is ironic to me is we have a Federal standard for lead \npaint, we have a standard, but we have never had a standard for lead in \ntoys or jewelry; never had a standard for those little pieces of \njewelry that will end up in kids' stomachs, or how about teenage girls \nwho are sitting in class and chewing on a charm that they may have \naround their neck--never had a standard; it has all been voluntary.\n\n[[Page S1497]]\n\n  It is not just these cheap trinkets that are being discovered to \ncontain hazardous levels of lead. Last summer the CPSC recalled 1.5 \nmillion Thomas & Friends trains, including the Thomas the Train \ncaboose, the Thomas the Train rail car, the box car, after they were \ndiscovered to be coated with poisonous lead paint.\n  A lot of those parents had bought these toys because they were wood, \nthey thought they would be better for their children. Many of these \nproducts reaching retail for between $10 and $20 apiece were on the \nmarket for almost 3 years before they were discovered to be defective, \nputting hundreds and thousands of toddlers at serious risk for lead \ningestion and brain damage.\n  What is even worse is what happened after the initial recall. This \nshows you how out of hand things have been because there have been no \nset standards and no good regulations coming from the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission.\n  After more than 3 months passed, RC2, which is the company that makes \nThomas the Train sets, realized that their first recall was incomplete. \nThey had asked for a recall and then they found hundreds of thousands \nof additional products, many of which had been sold in the same \npackaging with trains that had already been recalled, were coated with \nlead paint and also needed to be recalled.\n  Clearly, the RC2 Corporation that manufactured Thomas & Friends \ntrains was embarrassed by its safety record. It apologized to its \ncustomers, saying it would make every effort to ensure that this would \nnot happen again. To help encourage customer loyalty, which you can \nunderstand in a competitive market, and to get them to return those \nrecalled toys, RC2 said: Okay, parents, we are so sorry this happened. \nWe are going to give a bonus gift for your trouble.\n  Well, the bonus gift backfired in a big way because it was discovered \nthat 2,000 of these bonus gift trains that they had given to parents \nfor them sending back the recalled products contained lead levels four \ntimes higher than legally allowed, leaving parents of toddlers across \nthe Nation to deal with a double recall. All of these toys are \nmanufactured in China.\n\n  The burden should not fall on parents or kids to tell if a toy train \nis coated with lead paint or if a toy has been assembled so shoddily \nthat it will come apart in a toddler's mouth. How would a parent ever \nthink an Aqua Dot would contain the date rape drug?\n  I think it is shocking for most parents when they realize we never \nhave had a mandatory ban on lead in children's products, all we have \nhad is this voluntary guideline. It is shocking that until this \nlegislation is passed, the Consumer Product Safety Commission cannot \nactually enforce a lead ban in children's toys.\n  In response to a series of letters I wrote to Chairwoman Nord in \nAugust about the danger of lead in children's products, the chairwoman \nresponded on September 11. In that letter, Chairwoman Nord acknowledged \nthat:\n\n       The CPSC does not have the authority to ban lead in all \n     children's products without considering exposures and risk on \n     a product by product basis.\n\n  Now, that is really going to help the family of Colton to find that \nout, that our powerful Federal agency, with which we thought we had \nsolved all these consumer product issues back in the 1970s, that this a \nsafe country, does not have that authority.\n  Chairwoman Nord went on to say that: Were the CPSC to attempt banning \nlead in all children's products, it would likely take several years and \nmillions of dollars in staff and other resources.\n  This response makes it clear that Congress cannot wait for the CPSC \nto act to ban lead from all children's products. We have been waiting \nfor years. These parents have been waiting for years and years. This \nmother who spoke with us today wrote all these letters. She has been \ntrying to lobby by herself on behalf of her son to make sure this did \nnot happen again.\n  And what she told me this morning was her heart broke 2 years after \nher son had this horrible experience when she heard about the case of \nJarnell Brown who had died. She felt her efforts were in vain.\n  Well, this Congress has a duty to make sure they were not in vain. \nParents should not have to wait years for the CPSC to take action we \nalready know is appropriate. The medical evidence is clear and \noverwhelming, lead poisons kids and there must be a Federal ban.\n  To talk a little bit more about the specifics, this legislation \neffectively bans lead in all children's products by classifying lead as \na banned hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous Substance Act. \nThe bill sets a ceiling for a trace level of allowable lead at .03 \npercent of the total weight of a part of a children's product or 300 \nparts per million.\n  To put that in some perspective, California has standards right now \nof .04 for children's toys and .02 for jewelry. The voluntary ban that \nis not even mandatory right now that the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission uses is at .06. We have worked with pediatricians, we have \nworked with consumer experts. We set this at a very smart standard of \n.03 percent of trace levels. That ceiling would take effect in 1 year, \nallowing retailers and manufacturers to comply; 2 years later the \nlegislation would then further drop the amount of allowable lead in \nchildren's products to .01 percent of the total weight of a part or 100 \nparts per million.\n  Now, if the CPSC finds you can actually go below the threshold, which \na lot of pediatricians have argued we can do in this country, that we \ncan even get down to zero lead, that would be great.\n  What this law says is you do not have to be stuck up there at .01, \nwhich is of course a small amount of trace lead. You can, in fact, do a \nrulemaking and go lower for certain products or for all products.\n   This legislation gives the CPSC the power to lower levels even \nfurther as science and technology allow.\n  The legislation before us today also sets an even lower threshold for \npaint. Under this bill, the allowable lead level for paint would drop \nimmediately to 90 parts per million. This lowered threshold is critical \nbecause science has shown that as children put products in their \nmouths, it is the painted coatings which are most easily accessible to \nkids. Every parent of a toddler knows that to be true. They can see, if \nany parent looks in their toy box, all the little teeth marks, and they \nknow they put them in their mouth.\n  Under current law, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has adopted \nthis voluntary guideline of .06 percent. It is voluntary. That is part \nof the reason it takes so long, that is part of the reason we have had \nthis huge delay. This puts in a mandatory guideline at .03 going down \nto .01.\n  This legislation changes what is a bad system, a broken system, and \ngives the CPSC the tools it needs immediately to go after the bad \nactors who used lead or lead-based paint in their products.\n\n  To me the focus is simple: We need to get these toxic toys out of our \nkids' hands, not just voluntarily, not just as a guideline but with the \nforce of law.\n  Millions of toys were being pulled from these shelves, 29 million \nlast year. Right in the middle of Halloween, they were pulling the \nlittle funny teeth that you put in your mouth, Aqua Dots, Thomas the \nTrain, Sponge Bob Square Pants, Barbie dolls, you name it. It gives the \nforce of law to pull these toys from the shelves.\n  As if the appalling number of recalls this year is not bad enough, \nthese recalls illuminated other problems with pulling toys from the \nstore shelves, the daycare center floor or the drawer under the kid's \nbed.\n  This I actually heard from my friends. Because once these recalls \nhappen, every parent runs to the kid's room and says: Okay, I have got \nto find the toy that has been recalled. Now, how are you going to tell \nthe difference between the brunette Barbie doll, the blonde one, the \none that had this outfit on. This is practical when you are a mother. \nHow are you going to tell the difference between this caboose or this \nbox car? So they are looking at these toys trying to figure it out, \nputting them up to the Web site. Because, guess what, there is no batch \nnumber on these toys.\n  I have to tell you, most parents, when they get their kid a toy, do \nnot keep the packaging. My mother-in-law may be an exception to that, \nbut most parents do not keep the packaging. So what this legislation \ndoes is it says:\n\n[[Page S1498]]\n\nThe batch number will be on the toys whenever practical. They are not \ngoing to go on a pick-up stick, but whenever practical, the batch \nnumber will be on the toys so when there is a recall, the parent is \ngoing to be able to figure out which toy it is, and also the batch \nnumber is going to be on the packaging.\n  Why do we need this? Because we do know that large retailers such as \nToys ``R'' Us and Target, the minute there is a recall, they have been \nvery good about stopping all sales; they do it through their computer \nsystem.\n  Well, some of the smaller mom-and-pop retailers do not have that \ncapability, not to mention eBay and those kinds of things. So we want \nto make sure the batch number, in this legislation, requires it not \nonly be on a toy but also on the packaging.\n  This legislation, though, does a lot more than ban lead in children's \ntoys and to help parents identify recalled toys. It brings consumers \nthe protection that has been lacking for almost two decades. As we all \nknow, the CPSC's last authorization expired in 1992, and its statutes \nhave not been updated since 1990.\n  Not surprisingly, the marketplace for consumer practices has changed \nsignificantly in the last 16 years. And we have seen through recall \nafter recall how ill-equipped the Consumer Product Safety Commission is \nto protect consumers. Today, the Commission is a shadow of its former \nself, although the number of imports has tripled, tripled in recent \nyears.\n  So what you have seen is a tripling of imports, products coming in, \nand then what have you seen with the staff? Well, have you seen quite a \ndrop in the staff. The CPSC staff has dropped by almost half, falling \nfrom a high in 1980 of 978 people who worked there. Okay. Well here we \ngo, 978 people. And what do we see in 2007? Well, we have 393 \ntoday. You wonder how are these date drugs getting into our system, \ngetting on to our shores. You don't have the staff adequate to monitor \nthese toys. So while you have seen a tripling of imports coming from \nChina and other places, you have seen an enormous decrease in the staff \nthat regulates them. In fact, much has been made of a guy named Bob who \nis the only official toy inspector at the CPSC. He is retired. He was \nout in a back room testing toys by dropping them to the ground. He had \nall these toys on his desk. That is what we are dealing with, while we \nhave seen a tripling of imports and toys and jewelry that have tested \nto be 99 percent lead.\n\n  What have we seen now with the recalls? We have actually seen a huge \nincrease in the number of recalls. As you know, part of it is because \nfinally you have had the businesses, once this hit the streets and was \nall over newspaper headlines, saying: We finally better start testing \nthese products more frequently, which was a good thing. But we have \nseen in 1980, 681,300 recalls. In 2007, we have seen 28,773,640 \nrecalls, all toys that either were in parents' homes or were sitting \nthere on the toy shelf ready to be bought.\n  Let's look at a comparison so you can see why. It doesn't take a \nrocket scientist. Probably my 12-year-old daughter would see what is \ngoing on. When you look at this comparison, in 1980, you had only \n681,000 toys recalled. Then you go up to 2007, where you had 28 million \nrecalled. Look at the staff comparisons. When you have 681,000 toys \nrecalled, the staff is up here at 1,000. When you have 28 million toys \nbeing recalled, you have a staff that is half of what it used to be. So \nthere is a graphic depiction of what we are dealing with.\n  What does this legislation do? It puts 50 more staff at U.S. ports of \nentry in the next 2 years to inspect toys and products coming into the \ncountry. Not only does this bill give the CPSC the necessary funding \nand staff, it also gives the commission the ability to enforce \nviolations of consumer product safety bills. We have seen too many \nheadlines this year to sit around and think about this problem and say: \nIt is just going to solve itself. The market will take over.\n  The market has been broken. The CPSC has been broken. This is the \ntime that Government comes in, which is reasonable, and works with \nbusiness, as we have done. I am proud of the work Toys R Us has done \nwith us, as well as Target, which has always been helpful in working \nwith us. They know it has had an effect on their bottom line.\n  Here is what this bill does. We can beef up this agency that has been \nlanguishing for years. We can put sensible, responsible rules in place \nthat make it easier for them to do the job. This is not just numbers on \na chart. This is about a little kid that just in the last year, in the \nyear 2007 in the United States, could swallow just a little toy, which \nkids have done for centuries, and end up in a coma, unconscious from a \ndate rape drug. This bill is about numbers. This bill is about our \neconomy. But more than that, this bill is about these kids.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it. I thank Senator Pryor and the \nother members of our committee for their leadership.\n  I see Senator Durbin from Illinois. I thank him for his great \nleadership on this bill. It is the most significant consumer safety \nlegislation in our generation, as the Wall Street Journal has said. We \nhave an opportunity, and we must work swiftly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4094\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have conferred with the distinguished \nSenator from Arkansas, the bill manager. I ask unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendment, call up my amendment No. 4094, and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Reserving the right to object, as soon as he finishes his \n10 minutes on his amendment, we will go back to the pending amendment.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I agree with that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4094.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit State attorneys general from entering into \n  contingency fee agreements for legal or expert witness services in \n   certain civil actions relating to Federal consumer product safety \nrules, regulations, standards, certification or labeling requirements, \n                               or orders)\n\n       On page 58, strike lines 4 through 7 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(g)(1) An attorney general of a State may not enter into \n     a contingency fee agreement for legal or expert witness \n     services relating to a civil action under this section.\n       ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term \n     `contingency fee agreement' means a contract or other \n     agreement to provide services under which the amount or the \n     payment of the fee for the services is contingent in whole or \n     in part on the outcome of the matter for which the services \n     were obtained.''.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I congratulate my friends, Senator Pryor \nand Senator Stevens, the principal cosponsors of this legislation. I \nhad the great pleasure of working with Senator Pryor when he and I both \nwere State attorneys general. As such, we were the chief consumer \nprotection officers for our States and our citizens. I believe strongly \nin the importance of strong consumer protection laws. I believe this \nbill actually does something positive by adding to the resources \navailable to the Federal Government by authorizing the State attorneys \ngeneral under some circumstances to help make sure consumers are \nprotected and the laws are enforced.\n  There is also a concern I have. That has to do with the use of \noutside counsel when it comes to filing legislation on behalf of a \nsovereign State such as the State of Texas, the State of Arkansas, or \nthe like. We have seen examples of abuses in the past where State \nattorneys general have essentially transferred their authority to \noutside lawyers and paid them a contingency fee based on whatever the \nvalue is of what they were able to recover by way of a judgment or \nsettlement. This, unfortunately, has created an anomaly under our \nsystem of government where we have nonelected, nonaccountable private \nsector lawyers who are essentially making decisions on behalf of a \nsovereign State. If the people of my State, for example, don't agree \nwith what\n\n[[Page S1499]]\n\nthey are doing, they essentially have no right nor ability to hold them \naccountable or to demonstrate their displeasure with what these outside \ncounsel have done.\n  There is also a tremendous--and, frankly, tragic from a historical \nperspective--abuse of this contingency fee arrangement when it comes to \noutside lawyers. In my own State, my predecessor, as attorney general, \ngot caught up in one of these tragedies--there is no other word to \ndescribe it--and actually served time in the Federal penitentiary for \ndirecting some of the proceeds in the tobacco litigation to a friend, \nan outside lawyer in the case, something that, obviously, he should not \nhave done and for which he has paid a high price. But it demonstrates \nthe type of temptation and, indeed, the potential for corruption that \nexists when an elected official abdicates their responsibility and \nessentially hands it over to a private individual who is not \naccountable in a way that elected officials and public stewards of the \npublic trust are.\n  What this amendment does is say the State attorneys general who are \nauthorized under this legislation to seek an injunction in Federal \ncourt to enforce Federal law--something I support--should play by the \nsame rules regarding the recovery of costs and attorney's fees. Section \n20(g) of the bill awards costs and attorney's fees whenever the \nattorney general of the State prevails in any civil action under \nFederal consumer protection laws. But the word ``prevails'' is not \ndefined. Under the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Flammable \nFabrics Act, the Federal Government can go to court to seek an interim \nor preliminary injunction against a company pending a determination by \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission whether a product violates \neither act. State attorneys general would be granted the same authority \nunder section 20 of the bill.\n  I support that because I think the additional resources over and \nabove what the Department of Justice and the Federal Government \ncurrently have will help us be more vigilant when it comes to \nprotecting consumer safety. But to charge costs and attorney's fees \nagainst a defendant based on a court's preliminary finding and before \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission determines whether any law was \nviolated would be clearly unjust.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Act already has standards governing when \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission can be awarded costs and \nattorney's fees. So my amendment would make sure these same standards \nwould apply to State attorneys general who would be authorized to seek \nan injunction under the act, that they would be no better off and no \nworse off but actually in the same shoes as the current standard for \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n  My amendment also requires State attorneys general to play by the \nsame rules with regard to contingency fees. We want attorneys general \nto bring civil cases to protect the public interest not to create a \nwindfall for private sector lawyers. I believe this also is consistent \nwith Executive order No. 13433 of May 16, 2007, that prohibits the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission and other Federal agencies from \nentering into contingency fee arrangements with private lawyers, and \nthe same standard should apply to State attorneys general under this \nbill's new enforcement authorities.\n  I have talked to my friend, Senator Pryor, former attorney general of \nthe State of Arkansas. We have had a lawyerly discussion about why \nwould we want to ban contingency fee arrangements when the only \nauthority given to them under the statute is to seek an injunction and \nnot recover money damages or fines. The fact is, creative lawyers can \ncome up with ways to create a fee arrangement, even where only \ninjunctive relief is sought. There is a case that he and I talked about \nwhere basically what happened is the contingency fee was calculated \nfollowing an injunction based on what complying with that injunction \nwould cost the defendant. Some percentage of that cost was then \ncalculated as a contingency fee. Ironically, in that case it wasn't the \ndefendant who paid that fee, it was the taxpayers of the State, in a \nfurther sort of ironic twist. There is a way for contingency fees to be \ncalculated, even where the only authority granted is to seek an \ninjunction.\n  Finally, it is important that the Senate send a strong message about \ncontingency fee arrangements with outside counsel under these \ncircumstances for the purposes of this act because we know the Senate \nwill not be the final word on this--there will be a conference \ncommittee--a strong statement by the Senate that while we believe that \nState attorneys general can perform a useful function in seeking \ninjunctive relief, that we should not put them in a better position \nthan the Consumer Product Safety Commission, nor should we see the kind \nof abuses that can occur with hiring outside counsel under contingency \nfee arrangements.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Arkansas. I congratulate him \non his good work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Texas for \ncoming to the floor and offering an amendment. I don't know if I will \nbe able to support it, but I do commend him because the amendment \nclearly relates to the bill, a very important bill, and it draws us \ninto something perilously close to debate which hardly ever happens on \nthe floor of the Senate. I hope the spirit in which he has offered this \namendment will be respected on both sides of the aisle.\n  I know there are many pressing issues facing us in Congress and few \nopportunities to bring them up. But I hope this bill can pass this \nweek, that we have an honest debate on the merits of the bill, and then \nbring it to passage. I support the bill. I thank Senator Pryor.\n  Senator Pryor of Arkansas has been a leader on this issue. He has \ndone an extraordinarily good job making this a bipartisan bill. All of \nus read the stories last year about toy safety. Many parents came up to \nme in Illinois and said: What am I supposed to buy this year? Is \neverything dangerous? If it says ``made in China,'' am I supposed to \nstay away from it?\n  I didn't have a good answer. I couldn't recommend toys. That is not \nwhat I do for a living.\n  I have to tell you, a lot of the stories that were coming out in the \nnewspapers were troubling, not just for parents but for grandparents \nsuch as me. Magnetic toys, I never had those when I was a kid. All we \nhad were Lincoln Logs and Tinker Toys and all kinds of stuff like \nthat--erector sets. But these were little objects that could stick \ntogether with magnets. Kids could build them into huge forms. My \ngrandson loved them. He had boxes full of this stuff and he would make \nthese huge things with his dad, and always wanted more.\n  Well, I bought it--something to bring around at Christmastime--and \ndid not realize, until the newspaper stories came out, this toy was a \ndanger. Because the reason it worked is, it had these tiny, little, \nrare earth magnets. It looked like a pill, a little black pill. They \nwere on the end of these sticks of plastic, and that is what kept all \nthis toy structure together.\n  It turned out in the earliest design of these Magnetix toys, if a kid \nthrew it on the floor, stepped on it, whatever--ran over it with a \nbicycle--the little magnet could pop out. And that little magnet, for \nmy grandson, who was a little older, was not a problem. But for tiny \nchildren, it turned out to be a big problem. If they popped it in their \nmouth--which little kids, crawling infants would do--and swallowed it, \nand swallowed more than one, those two magnets could come together \ninside their body and cause serious obstruction in their intestines, \nforcing surgery to take care of it, and in the most extreme cases \nkilling a baby.\n  That was the reality of a badly designed toy on sale in the United \nStates. The Chicago Tribune did a front-page story on it. That is when \nI first started paying attention to this more closely, because I \nthought ``I bought one of these for my grandson, and it is a danger''--\nat least it is for smaller children. The Chicago Tribune told the story \nin a very good series, about what happened when they discovered this \ntoy was dangerous.\n  What happened added to my sense of urgency to deal with this issue. \nBecause no sooner did this hazard appear than the lawyers appeared, and \nthe lawyers took these toys and went to\n\n[[Page S1500]]\n\ntheir legal playground and played with them for month after month after \nmonth, while they were still being sold across America. That has to \nstop. If there is a dangerous toy in America, you cannot expect every \nfamily to do a test. You cannot expect every family to be able to \ncertify safety. They expect the Government to do that. That is what we \nare supposed to do--the Consumer Product Safety Commission. When they \ndo not do their job, it puts families and children at risk. So this law \nwe are currently trying to amend may have been good many years ago. \nToday it is not up to the challenge.\n  Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota has been another great ally of Senator \nPryor on this effort. She had a chart earlier, and I want to show you \nkind of a version of it, if you will. This is a little bit different \nchart than hers. It indicates the number of imports coming into the \nUnited States.\n  I talked about toys, but we are concerned about the safety of all \nproducts--electronic products and so many others--coming into the \nUnited States. You can see from the chart, starting back in the 1970s \nand all the way up to today, this dramatic surge in the number of \nimports. Now, this may be hard for people to see, but here are the \nnumbers of full-time employees at the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission--reaching a high number of about 1,000 employees in 1980, it \nlooks like, and then this steady decline of employees, until we are \ndown around 400 employees today. So here is a surge of imported \nproducts, and a dramatic decline, by more than 50 percent, of \ninspectors. Well, what is going to happen? Fewer products are \ninspected, fewer unsafe products are detected, and there is more danger \nin the marketplace.\n  There was kind of a popular cliche on Capitol Hill back in this era: \nGet Government off my back. Well, this is an example of where a safety \nagency fell victim to that mentality and dramatically reduced its \nstaff, at a time when it should have kept up with the imports to \nprotect American citizens. That is what I think troubles many of us.\n  I am the chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee for the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission. We increased the President's request for \nthis agency, I believe from $62 million to $80 million in this year--\nthat is an $18 million increase in real terms, about 30 percent--and \nsaid to the agency: Now staff up. Put the inspectors in place. Protect \nthe consumers across America.\n  I suppose we could have given them more, but I am a little bit \nreluctant, having watched the process for a number of years, to put too \nmuch money too fast into an agency. I am afraid many times they do not \nhire the best people and they cannot adjust to change. Thirty percent, \nI think, is probably tops out of what you can do in any given year \nwithout running some real risks, and even that has to be carefully \nmonitored.\n  So we are hoping in this bill--and I commend Senator Pryor--to see a \nsteady increase in the number of employees and inspectors at this \nagency in the hopes that when we get this done, at the end of the day \nwe will have enough people to do the job.\n  When you look at the millions of dollars worth of toys brought into \nthe United States, and all the attention we paid to those toys, there \nis a legitimate question about: Well, how many people out of about 400 \nat the Consumer Product Safety Commission were actually inspecting \ntoys? Well, it turned out that when it came to certain types of toys, \nsuch as these loose magnets and that sort of thing, there was basically \none man. His name was Bob. I had a picture of Bob standing at his \ninspection station which I had back in the cloakroom and somebody took \nit. I wish I could have brought it out here because Bob became kind of \nlegendary. Bob has since retired. He is retired from the Federal \nGovernment. But we did manage to save a picture of Bob's workspace.\n  Shown in this picture is Bob's testing laboratory for toys imported \ninto the United States. That is not a real confidence builder. It looks \nlike my work bench in my basement in Springfield, IL. In fact, that \nwork bench looks a little better, when I think about it. This is a \nmess. His toolbox is over here, and there is a bunch of toys stacked \nup.\n  Bob, the Federal inspector of toys for the United States of America--\nhe was making do with what he had, and it was not a lot. What he did \nwas draw this little line on the wall about 3 feet up, and then he drew \nanother one at about 6 feet up, and he would take these toys out of the \nboxes and drop them on the floor to see if they broke open. That was \none of Bob's impact tests in his laboratory. I do not want to make \nlight of Bob's contribution to safety in America, but I will bet you \nfamilies across America thought it was a little different process that \nled to an inspection of a toy that might end up in the hands of their \nchild if they bought it in a store in America.\n  The good part about Senator Pryor's bill that I am happy to cosponsor \nis that he goes after this whole laboratory inspection process. We \nshould not and cannot build enough laboratories in the United States \nowned by the Federal Government to inspect every product that comes \ninto our country, but we can certify laboratories in other countries \nthat are recognized to be professional and trustworthy--that is a good \ninvestment--and then make sure that the products go through these \nlaboratories, and make sure when they come to the United States we can \nidentify where they came from, when they were produced and, if there is \na problem, trace them back.\n\n  So Senator Pryor's bill moves in the right direction: more inspectors \nhere, but people also to certify laboratories in the countries of \norigin. If there is a toy coming from China, as an example, it may go \nto an underwriter's laboratory that is open in China that has been \ncertified by the United States as a reliable laboratory, and they will \nhave to give a seal of approval before it is shipped to the United \nStates. That, to me, makes a lot of sense. It is a way to use our money \nwisely and to avoid this kind of sad situation here where you cannot \nbelieve this is going to result in a reliable process.\n  The funding increases in this bill are important, but even more \nimportant, from my point of view, is to make sure this Consumer Product \nSafety Commission is run by people who care, who want this to work. It \nis sad. There are supposed to be five members of this Commission. \nUnfortunately, there are only two who are currently serving.\n  This Commission under current law has to negotiate press releases \nwith companies. If you find a Magnetix toy with a magnet that a child \ncan swallow and can have terrible health consequences and want to take \nthe product off the shelf or recall it, it turns out to be a battle \nroyal between lawyers even negotiating the wording of the press \nrelease. While all this is going on, unsuspecting families are buying \nthese toys. Now Senator Pryor in this bill is going to expedite this \nprocess.\n  Secondly--and this is one that I think is essential--we have to fine \nthose who violate this law in a manner where they will pay attention. \nIf you have a product you continue to sell that is dangerous, that is \non recall and you sell it anyway but figure: My company will make \nenough money that I can pay the fine and live through it to see another \nday, that is not a good outcome--certainly not for the consumers across \nthis country.\n  So what Senator Pryor in this bill does is to increase the fines to a \nlevel where they truly are meaningful, and companies will have to think \ntwice before they would consider selling a product that is facing \nrecall.\n  This package also over time increases the authorization level for the \nagency. It strengthens civil and criminal penalties. It requires third-\nparty certification and testing, as I mentioned. It makes it mandatory \nfor manufacturers of toys and children's products to comply with \naccepted safety standards. It bans the presence of lead in all \nchildren's products. My hat is off to Senator Klobuchar. She has been a \ngreat leader on that issue. It allows for parents to have faster access \nto injury reports and other information to help alert parents to \nproduct safety risks. It improves the way this Commission conducts its \nbusiness.\n  It allows State attorneys general to enforce product safety law in \nspecified instances. I believe it is only injunctive relief they can \nseek, and only if the Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal \nagencies do not move forward to protect the consumers. It restores the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission to a five-member Commission, which \nit should be.\n\n[[Page S1501]]\n\n  I hope my colleagues will look at this bill closely and realize we \nare doing something that is rare. We are taking a law that has not been \ntouched for 18 years and bringing it up to speed.\n  Eighteen years ago, as my chart showed earlier, imports were at a \nvery low level. Imported products have risen dramatically. We have to \nrise to the challenge. It is heartening this bill Senator Pryor brings \nto the floor, along with Senator Stevens, Senator Collins, Senator \nInouye, myself, Senator Klobuchar, and so many others, has a broad \ncoalition of groups supporting it: the Consumer Federation of America, \nthe American Association of Pediatricians, and Consumers Union, to name \na few. One of the CPSC Commissioners, Mr. Moore, has endorsed this \nlegislation, and a number of State attorneys general.\n  Passing a strong, consumer-oriented bill such as this is the next \nstep in safeguarding consumers. I do not think American families should \never have to go through a Christmas or holiday season as they did last \nyear wondering if products on the shelf are safe for their kids. If \nhistory is our guide, we may not have the chance to revisit these \npolicies if we do not pass this bill right now.\n  I want to thank a number of individuals who played a significant role \nin helping me work on this issue and helping others: Rachel Weintraub, \nwho was at the press conference yesterday for the Consumer Federation \nof America; Ami Ghadia and Ellen Bloom of the Consumers Union; Ed \nMierzwinski with U.S. PIRG; David Arkush and Mike Lemov from Public \nCitizen; Cindy Pelligrini with the Association of Pediatricians; Nancy \nCowles with Kids in Danger; and Patricia Callahan and Maurice Possley \nwith the Chicago Tribune. The last two did an exceptional job as \nreporters. This was journalism at its best. They told a story--a \ngripping story--well documented, which caught the attention of this \nlegislator, which led me to take this issue more seriously. My hat is \noff to the Chicago Tribune, Patricia Callahan, and Maurice Possley for \ntheir work on this issue.\n  Finally, let me say this: Passing this law is not the end of the \nstory. My Appropriations subcommittee is going to call the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission in. We are going to keep an eye on them. We \nare going to make sure that taxpayers' dollars are well spent, that \nthere is no question in the minds of those who are running this \nCommission about what Congress wants to achieve with this new authority \nand these new resources. If there is push-back and resistance from this \nagency to change, they are in for a battle. I hope we do not see that.\n  I think American consumers want to know the toys and products they \nbuy off the shelves across America are safe for their families and safe \nfor their kids. We focused on toys, but it is not the end of the story. \nThere are an awful lot of products, many products which we buy every \nday, trusting this Government to put its seal of approval on and some \ninspection behind it. We have to meet our obligation to people who \ncount on us to make sure that government does its job in an effective, \nefficient, and dollar-efficient way. Unfortunately, this agency has \nfallen behind. As it fell behind, so did some of the confidence of \nAmerican consumers about products on the shelves.\n\n  I also think we ought to work with foreign governments. The Chinese \ncame to see me repeatedly during the last holiday season and said: We \nhave gotten the message. We are going to straighten this out. I am \nhoping they live up to that promise.\n  Also, in fairness to China, for example, which has been the butt and \nfocus of many of the critiques when it comes to imports, the fact is \nthat many of the toys they sold were designed by American companies, \nand those companies need to be held responsible for the toy design that \nthe Chinese actually implemented.\n  The last word I will say is for special recognition to two companies \nwhich, during the midst of this toy scandal, did the right thing as \ncorporate citizens of America--one was the chain Toys R Us, and the \nother, a major toy maker, Mattel--when this story came out. The CEOs of \nboth of those companies contacted my office and said: We are going to \nwork with you. We are not going to run away from this issue. We know \nthat if American consumers don't have faith in our stores and in our \ncommitment to them, it will not only hurt our sales, but it will put \nfamilies in jeopardy.\n  Jerry Storch from Toys R Us was at the press conference yesterday. I \ncommented that in the old days, corporate strategy used to be duck and \ncover. If a scandal emerges involving your company or your products, \nyou duck the press and you try to cover it up. Jerry Storch didn't do \nthat. He stepped right up and said: Toys R Us is going to work with you \nto make sure the products are safe. He kept his word and came to the \npress conference yesterday.\n  The same thing is true with Mattel. I think they are genuinely \ncommitted to the safety of kids and families, and I thank them for \ntheir leadership, as well as others, but those two really impressed me, \nthat they would do the right thing from a corporate viewpoint. I hope \nconsumers across America will hold them to their promise, and if they \nkeep it, we will reward them with our business. They deserve it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask that we return to the regular order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Amendment No. 4090 is pending.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to thank my two colleagues who just \nspoke--really, all three.\n  Senator Klobuchar has shown great leadership when it comes to this \nissue. This is a very personal issue with Senator Klobuchar. These \nrecalls and injuries and even deaths of children have affected some \nfamilies in her State, but she has taken this on as a very important \npersonal issue that just so happens to be good for the country.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Durbin for his leadership. He has been \ninvolved in this legislation since the beginning. He has given a lot of \nwise counsel over the course of this legislation. He has a very strong \npassion about this issue. He also has been able to, as he mentioned, \ntalk with Toys R Us and have them come in as one of the largest toy \nretailers, to allow them to show some leadership in the retail \nindustry, which I think has been very helpful and very positive in the \nlast few days.\n  Lastly, I wish to mention Senator John Cornyn. Again, we are going to \nlook at his amendment to see if it is something we can agree to. I have \na few traps running over here, but I told Senator Cornyn a few moments \nago that we would definitely give his amendment a very serious look, \nand maybe it is something we could work on and work through and maybe \nattach to the bill. But I have some work to do on my side.\n  I wish to say a few words about one provision of the consumer product \nsafety legislation we are working on right now. It has to do with the \nCommissioners. This is an agency that, when it was formed in the 1970s, \nhad five Commissioners. No one can really tell us why, but sometime in \nthe 1980s or 1990s, it went down to three Commissioners. It may have \nbeen an appropriations issue, and it was perhaps a pragmatic decision \nat the time. No one is really sure about that. However, I feel \nstrongly--and I have talked to several colleagues, and they see the \nwisdom in this--that we really need five Commissioners on the CPSC. The \nreason is because the CPSC deals with over 15,000 types of products. It \nhas a huge amount of jurisdiction that is really too much for three \nCommissioners to handle.\n  In fact, I have had the opportunity to talk to Commissioners from the \nFederal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, as \nwell as former Commissioners from the CPSC. All of them agree that \ngiven the broad jurisdiction the CPSC has, it would be very helpful to \nhave five Commissioners. For one thing, it gives a broader variety of \nperspectives and opinions, but another thing that happens as a matter \nof practice is the five Commissioners, whether by design or because it \njust happens this way, tend to start to specialize in certain areas.\n  Again, given the 15,000 types of products the CPSC oversees, we could \nunderstand how we might need a little bit of specialization and we \nmight need the Commissioners to focus on specific areas because it will \nhelp the Commission be stronger overall. So we change the law in our \nlegislation. We go from\n\n[[Page S1502]]\n\nthe three-Commissioner setup we have today and we move it to five \nCommissioners. We return it back to the way the Commission was \noriginally designed. We feel as though this will be a very positive \ndevelopment.\n\n  As part of this issue as well--in a little different section of the \nbill but nonetheless related--I believe and the cosponsors believe we \nneed to reauthorize this Commission for 7 years. Part of that is \nbecause we need to help retool and rebuild this Commission over a \nseveral-year period.\n  One of the things we make very clear in the legislation is we don't \ntry to fix everything on day one. There is a lot that needs to be \nfixed, a lot that needs to be addressed, but as a practical matter, \nrealistically, we can't fix everything in 1 day. Rome wasn't built in a \nday, and you can't rebuild the CPSC in one fiscal year. What we are \ntrying to do is phase this in over time and make sure we do it the \nright way, make sure we do it the smart way. That is why I believe that \na 7-year reauthorization makes good sense under the circumstances.\n  The last point I wish to make this afternoon, or at least right now, \nis that we have a provision in this bill that I think will really \nbenefit families in a very practical way; that is, we have a provision \nin this legislation to put identifying marks on products.\n  We have all been in the situation where big brother gets a G.I. Joe \nor whatever it may be and passes it down to little brother, or your \ndaughter gets a set of dolls from a neighbor whose kids don't play with \nthose dolls anymore, or whatever the case may be, and we never even saw \nthe original packaging on a lot of that stuff. We don't know when it \nwas made. We don't know how old it is. We don't know anything about it. \nAll of a sudden, we read something in the paper or see something on \ntelevision about a recall. Right now, we don't have any way of knowing \nwhether it is this particular toy that has been recalled.\n  So what we are trying to do is set up a regime here where--and by the \nway, we worked with the manufacturers on this to make sure this is a \npractical, sensible solution, and we think it is--but to actually stamp \nthe products with different identifying numbers, maybe batch numbers, \nlot numbers, whatever--not to get into all the technical aspects of \nit--so that when there is a recall, when there is a problem, or there \nis some sort of hazard that has been identified, families can look at \ntheir product, look at their toys, and know if that is a product that \nis subject to recall.\n  So we are trying to be very practical in how we approach this. We are \ntrying to beef up the number of Commissioners. We are trying to make \nthis a 7-year reauthorization, but we are also trying to do things that \nhelp families make the determination to keep their families safe, and \nthis is something which I think has been lacking in the current system. \nHopefully we will be able to measure in the number of injuries and in \nthe number of deaths and even the number of recalls that happen and the \namount of litigation--we hope all of that will go down when it comes to \nconsumer product safety. Hopefully, we will be able to look back and \nsee this as a good piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up two amendments I have at the desk. They \nare amendments Nos. 4095 and 4096.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am sorry, \nwhat were the two amendments?\n  Mr. DeMINT. If I can respond to the chairman, two amendments--one is \nthe House bill, which is 4095, and the other relates to the \nwhistleblower provision, which is 4096.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I am sorry. Was the request just to talk about those?\n  Mr. DeMINT. No. They are at the desk. I wanted to call them up and \nspeak about them later.\n  Mr. PRYOR.

The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I think we have some colleagues who may be \non their way to the floor shortly. I would encourage our Senate \ncolleagues to come to the floor and offer amendments if they have \namendments or offer constructive suggestions if they have those or even \nif they just want to come down and speak. We would really like to get \nthis legislation wrapped up this week. So far, the cooperation has been \nexcellent on both sides.\n  Again, I wish to commend Senator DeMint and Senator Cornyn for coming \ndown and offering and addressing amendments that are germane. One of \nthe concerns I had is that we might see the floodgates open up on this \nlegislation and come in with all kinds of nongermane amendments. So I \nthank colleagues on both sides of the aisle for keeping the amendments \ngermane and on point.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Who seeks recognition? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment I wish to offer. I \nwill not do it at this point because in order to offer the amendment, I \nhave to ask unanimous consent that the current amendment be set aside. \nI will describe at least what I am intending to offer. I am going to \nspeak for a couple of minutes because there will be time later to \nconsider this amendment.\n  This amendment does not deal directly with the underlying \nlegislation. It certainly deals with consumers and this bill deals with \nconsumers. I first applaud my colleague from Arkansas for the work he \nhas done on the bill. I have a couple of amendments to the bill that I \nwill offer as we move along. But this amendment that I wish to offer \ndeals with something else that is urgent and important, and either I \nget it done on this bill or the next authorization bill that comes \nalong.\n  The price of oil is somewhere around $103 a barrel at this point. It \nis bouncing around up in that stratosphere, and the price of gasoline, \ndepending on where one lives, is $3, $3.25, $3.50, some analysts say \ngoing to $4 a gallon. Even as the price of oil has ratcheted way up, \nthis Government of ours and the Department of Energy is taking oil from \nthe Gulf of Mexico by awarding royalty-in-kind contracts to companies\n\n[[Page S1503]]\n\nwith to the Federal Government. Instead of putting this oil into the \nsupply pipeline by allowing companies to simply sell it, our Government \nis actually putting oil underground in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  I support the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but I do not support \nfilling it when oil is $103 per barrel. Putting 60,000 to 70,000 \nbarrels per day, every single day, underground makes no sense at all. \nThat puts upward pressure on gas prices. The EIA Administrator \nestimated this morning at an Energy and Natural Resources hearing that \nthe Government's action is raising prices about a nickel a gallon. The \nfact is, I believe it is more than that.\n  In any event, I do not think we ought to be taking oil out of the \nsupply pipeline as a deliberate policy of the Federal Government and \nsticking it underground in these caverns. That makes no sense to me.\n  This issue came up in the hearing this morning. We have had hearings \npreviously on this topic. I have indicated I intend to offer \nlegislation. My legislation would do two things. It would say, at least \nfor the next year: Let's take a pause on sticking oil underground and \ntaking it out of the supply. Let's take a pause as long as oil is above \n$75 a barrel. When oil is above $75 a barrel, let's at least, for the \nnext year, not be taking it out of the supply and sticking it \nunderground.\n  Here is what is happening. On this chart, these are places that our \nFederal Government is now putting oil underground--Bayou Choctaw, West \nHackberry, Big Hill, and Bryan Mound. We are getting oil from the Gulf \nof Mexico and putting it underground in these salt domes.\n  The price of oil is subject to a lot of things including excess \nspeculation these days which I have described on the floor of the \nSenate previously. We had a hearing on this topic. Here are comments \nfrom Fadel Gheit, a top analyst from the Oppenheimer & company. He \nsays: There is absolutely no shortage of oil. I'm absolutely convinced \nthat oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a barrel. Oil speculators \ninclude the largest financial institutions in the world are speculating \non the future's market for oil. I call it the world's largest gambling \nhall.\n  He is talking about the futures market on which these prices are \nmade.\n\n       I call it the world's largest gambling hall. . . . It's \n     open 24/7. Unfortunately, it's totally unregulated. . . .This \n     is like a highway with no cops and no speed limit and \n     everybody is going 120 miles an hour.\n\n  We have hedge funds that are speculating every day in a significant \nway in the oil futures market. We have investment banks that are \nspeculating in the oil futures market. In fact, we now read that \ninvestment banks are actually buying storage facilities so they can \ntake oil off the market, put it in storage, and wait until the price \ngoes up. We have not had that before. This is not about a supply-and-\ndemand relationship of oil. It is about speculators who are driving up \nthe price of oil and a futures oil market that is rampant with \nspeculation.\n  Even as that is occurring and we see oil bouncing at $103 a barrel, \nwe have a policy in the Federal Government to take oil from the Gulf of \nMexico and stick it underground. That makes no sense to me at all. What \nwe ought to be doing is, the royalty-in-kind oil we get from those \nwells that belongs to the people of the United States that comes to our \nGovernment ought to go into the marketplace to be sold, to be part of \nthe supply system. The Federal Government gets the money for it because \nit was the Federal Government's payment for that oil as part of the \nroyalty. The oil goes into the supply pipeline and, as a result of \nthat, we put downward pressure on gas prices.\n  Instead, as a matter of deliberate policy, our Government has decided \nto stick it underground in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is now \nabout 60,000 to 70,000 barrels a day, and it is going to increase to \n125,000 barrels a day in the second half of this year. It is oblivious \nto all common sense to be putting upward pressure on gas prices as a \ndeliberate policy of the Federal Government. It makes no sense.\n  As I indicated, my amendment would very simply say: Let's take a \npause; let's use a deep reservoir of common sense, take a pause during \nthis year, during a 1-year period, that if the price of oil remains \nabove $75 a barrel, we ought not put that oil underground.\n  The average price, by the way, in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve of \noil that has been stored is about $27 a barrel. Why on Earth would you \nbuy oil at $103 a barrel, put upward pressure on gas prices, and stick \nthat expensive oil underground? It makes no sense.\n  I indicated that I do not intend to speak at length about this \namendment. I have spoken about this before and will later. I see \nSenator Barrasso from Wyoming is on the floor. He was part of the \nhearing in the Energy Committee this morning. He and I talked about \nthis subject. He and I have some of the same concerns. I visited with \nhim, perhaps, about cosponsoring this amendment at some point.\n  With that, I don't know whether we have been able to clear offering \nthis amendment. I understand not at this point. In order for me to \noffer an amendment--in order for anybody to offer any amendment I have \nto ask unanimous consent to set the pending amendment aside. So if I \nwere to offer that, I understand that has not yet been cleared. My hope \nis we will be able to clear it so I will be able to offer this \namendment later this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken with the manager of the bill and I will \nwithhold asking unanimous consent to offer this amendment that I \napparently cannot yet get. However, I would like to come back later \nthis afternoon and hopefully we can clear my offering this amendment.\n  I understand my colleague from Wyoming is seeking recognition. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak in morning business for not more than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                   Craig and Susan Thomas Foundation\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, years from now, young people in Wyoming \nwill talk about the many events that have helped shape their lives--\npeople such as their parents, their friends, and their teachers, places \nsuch as the Tetons, Devil's Tower, and the Wyoming Range, and some will \nsay that Craig and Susan Thomas helped change their lives. They will \nsay there was a foundation. Almost out of the blue they will say that \nit gave them a scholarship, that it encouraged them to succeed, and \nthat it helped them back into school. And one of those individuals will \nbe able to say: I now have a great job, I have a family, and I get to \nkeep living in Wyoming. These young people will say: If it wasn't for \nthe Craig and Susan Thomas Foundation, I don't know where I would be \ntoday.\n  We know the Craig Thomas who fought every day for the people of \nWyoming, advocating before each of you with a Western common sense that \nis legendary, but on the weekends and on his time in Wyoming, for \nnearly two decades, the one thing our friend Craig Thomas dedicated \nhimself tirelessly to was the young people of Wyoming. Every kid--top \nof the class, middle of the class or simply in the class--Craig Thomas \nwould want to meet with them, would want to talk with them, want to \nlaugh with them. He even played Hacky Sack with them in his cowboy \nboots. He would find out how they were doing, what they were thinking, \nwhat they were going to do with their lives. He would tell them to find \nout what it was they liked to do the best and then do it.\n  Craig believed everyone should be a good citizen, learn as much as \npossible, and then have a chance to be happy. But for economic reasons, \nfor family challenges or just a raw deal, we know some of these kids \nface tall hurdles. Some kids have a harder time, and Craig was always \nthere to help.\n  Many of my colleagues know Craig also had a wonderful partner in his \nmission for Wyoming kids, Susan Thomas. A lifelong teacher herself in \ndevelopmental education, she joined him proudly in reaching out to \nWyoming's youth. Together they did an amazing job. I saw them do it. I \nknow many of my colleagues also saw it when Craig would bring members \nof Susan's classes through the Capitol each year. They would come to \nwatch, to learn, and to be invited in.\n  Craig and Susan inspired kids across Wyoming and kids right in this \narea\n\n[[Page S1504]]\n\ntoo. When Craig passed, the letters came streaming in. They came from \nyoung adults who said that when Craig Thomas told them they could do \nsomething, that they could be anything they wanted to be, when he \nhelped steer them toward achievement, it made a difference in their \nlives. He inspired and he improved their lives.\n  Today, March 4, 2008, Susan Thomas is in Cheyenne to launch the Craig \nand Susan Thomas Foundation. It is a foundation that will reach out, \nthat will search out, that will find the young Wyoming people who need, \nas Susan says it, a leg up in getting back on a horse after falling \noff.\n  Technically, it is a foundation that serves at-risk kids by helping \nthem into programs--programs from cosmetology to culinary schools, \nvotech to high tech, mechanical to anything they are interested in \nachieving.\n  The Craig and Susan Thomas Foundation is also ready to identify these \nyoung people through many avenues, through the traditional school \nsystems but also through people active in the community. For those \npeople who champion the causes of Wyoming's young people, the \nfoundation will give them special leadership awards.\n  This is a program for kids who may not qualify for other programs, \nkids who deserve our attention, kids whom we should not ignore, kids \nwhom our Senator Craig Thomas almost instinctively knew how to help, \nhow to lift up. The Craig and Susan Thomas Foundation will continue to \nfind them, thankfully, and to help them.\n  This is an exciting day, and congratulations to Susan Thomas, who, \nwith courage and love, carries on Craig's legacy for inspiration, for \nhope, and for a better life for all of Wyoming's young people.\n  We miss Craig very much. We are still touched by his deeds. Good \nluck, Susan, and our very best to you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, let me start our conversation this \nafternoon about the consumer product safety bill with a chart. I will \ncome back to it in a few minutes, but as the camera focuses on this \nchart, these are the toys that were recalled in the last year. You can \nsee it starts in March of 2007 and goes to February of 2008. \nRepresented on this calendar are the record number of recalls that we \nsaw last year. I am sure members of the public recall over the summer \nmonths--May, June, July, August, and even into September--there were a \nseries of newspaper articles, news magazine stories, television, radio, \nin addition to Internet stories about the excessive number of recalls.\n  Really, this matter came to the public's attention through the toy \nrecall issue. Now, of course the Consumer Product Safety Commission \ndeals with a lot more than just toys. Toys are very important, and it \nis a big piece of what they do, but the CPSC does a lot more than toys. \nBut this chart shows the toys, to give a sense of how many recalls we \nare looking at every year. And what we have done is, we have picked one \nitem that would represent that recall every month. You can see that \nmost months it is four or five recalls in that given month.\n  So the CPSC has been very busy. Unfortunately, that is part of the \nproblem. They are overwhelmed with the marketplace today, and it has \nbeen very difficult for the CPSC to keep up with the tremendous number \nof imports.\n  By the way, every single toy on this calendar is from China--every \nsingle toy. I didn't come here to pick on China today, but facts are \nfacts. Last year, in 2007, every toy recall was from China.\n  One of the things we are trying to accomplish in this legislation is \nto make sure imported toys meet our safety standards. This is a very \nbasic function of Government; that is, to provide for the health and \nsafety and the general welfare of the people. The Consumer Product \nSafety Commission is on the front line of doing that.\n  Now, I want to talk about this again in a few moments, so I will \nleave it up and allow people to look at it if they want. But before I \ndo, I want to talk about another provision in the legislation that some \nhave found to be controversial. To be honest with you, some of this \ncontroversy is because people have looked at the previous version of \nthe bill.\n  In the previous version of the bill, we had an attorney general \nenforcement provision that was very aggressive and somewhat open, and \npeople were very concerned that the attorneys general might go wild, so \nto speak, and start to initiate litigation and bring lawsuits that the \nCPSC was reluctant to bring.\n  Regardless of how the committee bill was drafted, that has changed in \nthis legislation. I want to be very clear for my colleagues and, again, \nfor staff members who are watching in their offices on Capitol Hill, \nthat has changed dramatically. I want to go through those changes, if I \nmay, very quickly.\n  First, when we talk about adding State attorneys general to this \nenforcement mechanism for the CPSC, we are talking about putting more \ncops on the beat or, as someone said the other day, ``more feet on the \nstreet.'' You can call it what you want, but the idea is that we have a \nchoice to make. If we want to enforce CPSC decisions, we can do it one \nof two ways: We can hire more people at CPSC and maybe the Justice \nDepartment and pay another $5 million, $10 million, $20 million, $50 \nmillion, or whatever it may be for enforcement personnel, who are \nFederal employees, or we can turn this responsibility over to the \nStates and allow the States a piece of this so if there are problems in \ntheir home States, they can go after their problems with no Federal \ntaxpayer expense. And that is the route we have chosen in S. 2663.\n  I know there are some, especially in the business community, who fear \nthe attorney general. When I say that, I mean the State attorney \ngeneral. They have seen what happened in the tobacco case several years \nago. They have seen what has happened in a few other cases since then, \nand they fear what the attorney general can do, and will do, given the \nopportunity. Well, let me say a couple of things about that.\n  First, I was the attorney general of my State, and I know how that \noffice works and I know how attorneys general think and the approach \nthey take to problem solving. I would say that most attorneys general \nhave resource issues like everybody else. They are strained in terms of \nhow much time and attention they can devote to certain matters. Most \nAGs--not all but most AGs--have the consumer protection ability in \ntheir State offices right now. There are very few who don't.\n  The other thing that is very important about the attorney general is, \nin the States, the attorney general position is a very respected \nposition. If you take a poll around the country and ask various people \nin their States, they have a high degree of respect for the attorney \ngeneral because, by and large, these men and women have done a great \npublic service for their States. In fact, we have to remember, as \nMembers of the Senate, these attorneys general are elected by the very \nsame people we are. I think it is 44 States--I can't remember the exact \nnumber--where the attorney general is popularly elected. There are a \nfew that are not. I think Tennessee has the State supreme court appoint \nthe attorney general. But, regardless, most State AGs are elected by \nthe people, and the people trust them.\n  The other thing I wanted to say about attorneys general is, in \ngeneral, the reason the State attorneys general act is because Congress \nfails to act. We saw that in the tobacco case. Several years ago--\nagain, this has been about 10 years ago now or a little more--there was \na bill in Congress to regulate tobacco and to fundamentally change \nFederal tobacco law and the national tobacco policy. Again, I don't \nremember exactly what year this was--it was sometime in the mid-1990s, \nI don't remember exactly, but that bill got bogged down. That bill did \nnot make it out of the Congress, and it never became law.\n  That was the triggering mechanism for the States' tobacco litigation \nto rev up. I think it had existed before that, but once the Congress \nfailed to act,\n\n[[Page S1505]]\n\nonce people here in Washington couldn't address and couldn't resolve \none of the Nation's great problems, the States acted. And that is the \nnature of it.\n  So one thing I encourage my colleagues to think about is to think \nabout our acting and our taking care of the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission so we don't see that patchwork out in the many States, where \nState legislators come in with these great ideas about consumer product \nsafety legislation, where State AGs don't try to get creative and come \nup with some sort of master plan for litigation. Let's avoid that. \nLet's pass this S. 2663, the CPSC Reform Act. Let's pass this and allow \nthe State AGs some enforcement responsibility but also keep this in the \nFederal purview.\n  Let me talk briefly about that. S. 2663 would authorize the State \nattorneys general to bring a civil action to seek--and this is very \nimportant--injunctive relief only for clear violations of the statute \nor clear violations of orders by the CPSC. So I need to be very clear.\n  What we are talking about is enforcement only. We are talking about \ninjunctive relief only. That means no money damages. That is what we \nare talking about. We are talking about the States watching the CPSC, \nmaybe the best example, maybe doing a recall somewhere in the State. \nThey find that product is still on the shelves; it should not be. Maybe \nit is showing up in Dollar Stores, maybe some retailers like small guys \nor whatever ignoring it. The State attorney general can step in and get \nthose products off the shelf.\n  You all know as well as I do the way that is going to work in the \nreal world is the minute the attorney general shows up at that store, \nthey are going to get those products off the shelves. That is the way \nit works.\n  It is like a friend of mine told me--one time I called him up and I \nwas the attorney general. He said: Oh, man, my worst nightmare is to \nhave the attorney general call me at my office because you never know \nwhat the AG is going to do. It is like having ``60 Minutes'' show up in \nyour front lobby or something.\n  But, nonetheless, that is the way it is going to work. The mere fact \nthat the States have this authority gives a local hammer to the CPSC \nthat they do not have right now. Right now, what we have to do is rely \non the Justice Department or we have to rely on CPSC employees to turn \naround and try to enforce those out in the various States; try to track \ndown all of these products wherever they may be.\n  It is hurting enforcement. The States and the State attorneys general \nare naturally in a better position to know what is going on in their \nState, and they are in a better position to enforce the CSPC orders in \ntheir State. That is the way it is.\n  Let me say a few more things. I want to get back to this chart. The \nConsumer Product Safety Commission bill we are talking about now not \nonly limits the attorneys general in the two ways I have mentioned, \nthey have to follow the CPSC, and it has to be for injunctive relief \nonly, but also this requires that the State would serve written notice \non the Commission 60 days prior to them filing. So they have to \nactually notify the Commission.\n  The fourth thing, the fourth out of five safeguards that are built \ninto this legislation, is that the Commission, if they so choose for \nwhatever reason, can intervene in that litigation.\n  The last thing is that if the Commission has a pending action going, \nthe States cannot get in that action. Here again, we want to make sure \nthat the CPSC remains in the driver's seat. One of the myths about this \nlegislation that I have heard--and, quite frankly, it has been mostly \non this side of the aisle and this is in the business community--is if \nwe pass my bill, what is going to happen is there are going to be 51 \ndifferent standards out there, there is going to be litigation coming \neverywhere. That is not the case. Again, because of Senator Stevens' \nwork that he did to make this bill a bipartisan bill, what we are left \nwith is these very tight controls on the attorneys general. \nNonetheless, I think there is value, good value in the States having \nthat enforcement mechanism on a State level.\n  The other thing I wanted to say before I turn to this chart is this \nis not a new approach. This is not a new approach. In fact, for over a \ndecade State attorneys general have been able to seek injunctive relief \nunder the Federal Hazardous Substance Act, a statute enforced by the \nCPSC. This authority has not resulted in varying interpretations of law \nthat have been a concern--if we give the States some authority, we are \ngoing to have all of these 51 jurisdictions out there doing all of \nthese different things. That is not the case. We have a 10-year track \nrecord with the Hazardous Substances Act and the States have not abused \nit. They have not abused it. So we know the States can play a very \nimportant role with the CPSC and with the Federal Government.\n  And, by the way, there are lots of other examples--I do not have to \nget into all of those right now, but lots of other examples where there \nis a Federal component and a State component to something where the \nStates are allowed to do some enforcement or play a State role, an \nimportant State role. I think that is what this has as well.\n  Let me go to this ``toxic toy'' calendar again. Here again you see \nthese toys that look very familiar, like Thomas up here. Here is the \n``Evil Eye'' up here in June of 2007. If I am not mistaken, this is one \nwhere they actually had kerosene in the eyeballs. Can you imagine that? \nThey sell these little rubbery or plastic eyeballs that actually had \nkerosene in those. And this was a children's toy. It is hard to \nbelieve.\n  But you see tops, you see Sesame Street characters, you see little \nthings such as building blocks, you see little scooters, dart boards, a \nwagon, you see all kinds of things. Some of these might have had lead \npaint, some of these may present choking hazards. But you can see how \nbusy the Consumer Product Safety Commission is.\n  Again, part of our legislation is to give them the resources they \nneed in order to do these recalls. But you can imagine with all these \nrecalls and how busy they are--you know, they are over here in \nSeptember of 2007. They do these toy recalls. Well, suddenly it is \nOctober, and they are working on five more. They do not have time to go \nback to the State of Arkansas or the State of Delaware or Wyoming or \nwherever it may be in order to go back and enforce what they had been \ndoing in the previous month. They do not have time for that or have the \nresources for that.\n  Again, I think the way we have this structured is very positive. Let \nme give a few examples of what we are talking about here. Let's start \nwith this first month, March of 2007. See this airplane right here? The \nbatteries can overheat in this airplane and cause a fire. This animal \nfarm, this little farm right here, these little pieces can fall off and \nthey become a choking hazard. This keyboard can catch fire. This easel \nhas lead in it.\n  Then we go over here to April. We see on the infant bouncer, which is \nright here, this little infant chair, a falling hazard out of the seat. \nThere may have been something in the design or construction that made \nchildren susceptible to falling out of this.\n  This puzzle has a choking hazard. Again, maybe these knobs come off \nor something will break off, I am not quite sure, but a choking hazard; \nthis activities chart, a choking hazard; the bracelets that you see \nhere, lead poisoning. Again, you can go down this list. This infant \nswing right here is an entrapment hazard. I am going to tell you, these \nentrapment hazards are terrible stories. I have talked to those \nfamilies before. We had a case in Arkansas a few years ago. It was not \nwith an item here, but it was with a crib type playpen. I am going to \ntell you, it collapsed on the child and choked the child. It was \nterrible. Unfortunately, we see that all over the country.\n\n  This ``Evil Eye'' eyeball, they are ``evil eyes'' because they are \nfull of kerosene. It is hard to believe. Seriously. Think about that. \nIt is hard to believe that any company with any sense at all--I mean, \nunbelievable--would actually put kerosene in the little toys. Think \nabout it. I do not know why in the world they would ever do that. But \nthat is exactly what they did.\n  Again, we can go down a long list of what can go wrong with these \ntoys. But this is why the marketplace needs some supervision. The \nmarketplace needs something such as the CPSC and someone on a State \nlevel, such as the\n\n[[Page S1506]]\n\nState attorneys general, to make sure these toys are not present in the \nstream of commerce in the various States.\n  Again, the attorneys general provision of this proposed bill has been \na little bit controversial, but it should not be anymore because we \nhave built in the safeguards. We have tried to find the consumer \nprotections. We have tried to make the right policy but at the same \ntime make sure that the attorneys general have the right parameters on \nthem and also keep the CPSC in the driver's seat and to make sure that \nthe State AGs can only seek injunctive relief.\n  That is a very important point, that injunctive relief, because what \nthat means is there are no money damages with an injunction. They are \ngoing out there to force someone to do something such as pull something \noff the shelf or stop selling something or whatever the case may be. \nThat is a very positive development.\n  I have heard from a few groups in the last several days on this \nconcern about contingencies: We should not have any contingent fees. \nWell, realistically, as a practical matter, I do not think you are \ngoing to see any contingent fees with injunctive cases. It is very rare \nto find injunctive cases with a contingency fee. I guess it can happen. \nI have seen one example where some lawyers tried to do that.\n  The other thing about the State AGs, given the nature of these \nclaims, I do not think you are going to see very many States use \noutside counsel. Usually the States bring in outside counsel when there \nis something very complicated, where there are a lot of costs, or it is \na long-term piece of litigation that is going to take years and maybe \nmillions of dollars to repair, very complicated. Again, this is not one \nof those types of cases. This type of case is you see a CPSC finding, \nfor example, they say the evil eyeballs, kerosene-filled eyeballs \ncannot be sold in the United States. Some AG is out, they look around, \nthey see it being sold in a Dollar Store, they see it being sold in \nsome discount store somewhere, and they can go after that store and \nmake them get them off the shelves.\n  Again, I think what you will see here is probably very little \nlitigation. I think once that attorney general tells them, we are about \nto come after you, in my experience as attorney general, most people \nwill respond to that and respond to that very quickly. They do not want \nthe publicity, they do not want the hassle of selling something such as \nthat.\n  The last thing I was going to say on the contingent fees is \ncontingent fees, of course, are used in lots of different types of \nlitigation. But if you think about it with injunctive relief cases, \nthere is no money to base a contingent fee on. So if you are going to \npull a bunch of ``Evil Eye'' eyeballs off the shelf, how does the \ncontingent fee work? I think more often than not, much more often than \nnot, you will not see any contingent fee cases. I do not think they \napply.\n  The last thing I was going to say on the outside counsel, most States \nhave a process you have to go through to get outside counsel. In fact, \nwhen I was attorney general of Arkansas, we never went through the \nprocess. We knew about the process; we never went through it. But you \nactually had to get approval of the State legislature and have the \nGovernor sign off on it. They did that before I became AG. I do not \nthink they ever did that when I was there. I do not think they have \ndone it since. Everyone has a different process, but usually the States \nwill have to go through an RFP type process that can take months. \nAgain, we already have a provision in here where they have to send \nnotice to the CPSC for 60 days. So I would be surprised if you see the \nStates want to stretch out this timeframe, because usually what they \nhave done is they have found a dangerous product in their State, and \nthey are trying to get rid of it.\n  We have worked very hard to listen to everyone's concerns about the \nState AGs. We have tried to meet these concerns. We have tried to make \nsure the concerns are valid. We have tried to meet those and tried to \nmake sure we can keep this bill bipartisan, and hopefully get the 50 \nvotes on this bill as it is written right now.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 4095 and 4096\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nspeak on two amendments I called up this morning. I appreciate the \nopportunity to speak. These amendments certainly relate to the consumer \nproduct safety bill my colleague from Arkansas has done such a great \njob ushering through committee and onto the floor. It is clearly a very \nimportant issue for us as a nation.\n  Last year, we were reminded a number of times of the problems when \nthe safety of our products is not ensured. We saw some products coming \nin from other countries that gave us cause for concern, as well as from \nwithin our own country. In the food and drug area, we have certainly \nseen problems there. So we need as a Congress to make sure we do \neverything we can to ensure the products that are sold in this country, \nparticularly for our children, are safe.\n  This was an issue the House of Representatives took very seriously. \nThey have worked for a number of weeks, if not months, on a consumer \nproduct safety bill. Speaker Pelosi was very involved with the bill, as \nwell as Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton. They produced a \nbill that had been vetted by a number of people. It had support from \nconsumer product groups, as well as from a number of manufacturers, \nwhich is key, that we cannot ignore in the Senate. We need to make the \nproducts safe, but we also need to make sure we do not put such a \nburden on American businesses that they cannot create the jobs and grow \nthe opportunities in the future. That is a delicate balancing act which \nI believe the House achieved.\n  In a remarkable vote, the House voted unanimously to support the \nconsumer product safety bill they had on the floor. That bill does a \nnumber of things we talk about here.\n  Let me first read a quote from Chairman Dingell, who is the chairman \nof the Committee on Energy and Commerce. It was his committee that \nworked so hard on this bill. He said, in a New York Times editorial:\n\n       Let's hope that the Senate acts expeditiously and with the \n     same bipartisan commitment as the House.\n\n  It is a quote I very much appreciate. We were here in the Senate \ndisturbed, a few weeks ago, when we worked real hard to pass a \nbipartisan Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that we hoped the \nHouse would act on in the same bipartisan fashion. Unfortunately, the \nHouse decided they needed to include some provisions, some special \ninterest provisions that allow plaintiffs' lawyers to sue the \ntelecommunications companies that are helping us intercept messages \nfrom suspected terrorists.\n  I am afraid we are doing the same thing now on the Senate side that \nour House colleagues did. We have a very important issue in front of \nus, which is consumer product safety. The House has sent us a \nbipartisan bill with clear support from all our constituencies. Yet we \nhave decided on the Senate side to add some special interest \nprovisions, specifically for plaintiffs' attorneys and union bosses.\n  The House bill does a lot of the things I believe in and I think most \nof my Senate colleagues believe need to be done.\n  First of all, it requires there be third-party testing of children's \nproducts for lead and other hazards to ensure that unsafe toys never \nmake it to the shelves.\n  It also requires, as my colleague from Arkansas was mentioning \nearlier today, that manufacturers place distinguishing marks on \nproducts and packaging of children's products to aid in the recall of \nthose products. It can be years later that a product is found to be \ndefective and recalled, and we need to have a way to identify those \ndefective products and recall them and to notify consumers of safety \nproblems.\n  The bill the House passed unanimously also replaces the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission's aging testing lab with a modern, state-of-\nthe-\n\n[[Page S1507]]\n\nart lab that will allow them to find which toys are safe and which ones \nare not.\n  It improves the public notice about recalls so we have a better \nsystem of letting the public know when we find a safety problem.\n  It preserves a strong relationship between industry and the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission to ensure that industry continues to share \ninformation we can use to determine the safety of products.\n  It also restores the full panel of five Commissioners to the \nCommission.\n  This bill is a bill we should pass in the Senate. We know if we go \nthrough the process this week of adding amendments and changing the \nbill, even if we ultimately pass a bill, we are looking at weeks if not \nmonths in conference with the House to come out with a final bill.\n  We have an opportunity. If we pass this amendment, which is a \nsubstitute to the underlying bill, passing the House bill, we can send \na new bill, a consumer product safety bill, to the President that can \nbe implemented right away.\n  Again, this is a bill that passed 407 to nothing in the House, with \nthe Democratic leadership taking the initiative on this bill and \nRepublicans agreeing. What we are doing here in the Senate is adding a \nnumber of provisions that are not for consumer product safety but \ndesigned to create loopholes for special interests.\n  One is the whistleblower protection provision, which I have a \nseparate amendment to strike. There are ways we can fix this provision. \nWe have a Federal standard we apply to our own agencies that does not \ncreate an open-ended litigation process but focuses more on protecting \nthose who make us aware of a problem that an employee tells us about. \nWe need to do that in industry.\n  I am certainly willing to work with the majority on this issue. I \nbelieve Senator Cornyn has an amendment that applies that Federal \nstandard, which would improve this legislation, provide whistleblower \nprotection, but at the same time not create a playground for \nplaintiffs' attorneys as well as create an opening, as this bill does, \nfor disgruntled employees to wreak havoc inside an organization.\n  The way the bill is set up, any employee--who may be aware he is \ngetting ready to lose his job for incompetence or something else--can \ncomplain about a safety issue, which may or may not be real, and that \nemployee is basically guaranteed a job for life because this bill does \nnot allow a company to fire someone who complained about a safety \nproblem. Even if there was not a safety problem, all the employee has \nto do is say they had a reasonable belief there was a safety problem.\n\n  Folks, it is hard enough to do business in this country today. It \nseems everything we do in this Congress makes it more expensive and \nmore difficult for our companies to compete in a global economy. \nCountries throughout Europe lowered their corporate tax rate to 25 \npercent. China has lowered its corporate tax rate. We continue to keep \nours at a level that makes it very difficult for our companies to \ncompete. We need to realize, as we seek consumer product safety, \nparticularly safety for children, we do not need to put unnecessary \nburdens on our companies and make it more difficult for them to operate \nin this country.\n  The whistleblower provision in this bill does not improve consumer \nproduct safety, but it does create a potential for increased problems \nwith folks who are manufacturing in this country. We need to realize \nforeign-based companies are not faced with this same provision. It is \nonly those that are American owned, operating here, that have to follow \nthis whistleblower law the Senate is attempting to add in the consumer \nproduct safety legislation. So what we have are American companies at a \ndisadvantage to companies in other parts of the world that do not have \nto comply. My amendment would strike this provision. Perhaps we can \nreach a compromise and protect the whistleblower without damaging our \ncompetitiveness as a nation.\n  Mr. President, these are two amendments, and I have a number of \nothers that get at some of the problems in the bill. But, again, I \ncommend the chairman for his work and the commitment by this body to \nimprove consumer safety in this country. I hope we can work together in \na bipartisan fashion to create a bill that is focused on safety and not \nso much on doing favors for our different constituencies.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n5:30 p.m. be used for debate on DeMint amendment No. 4095; that the \ntime be equally divided between Senator DeMint and Senator Pryor or \ntheir designees; and that following the use or yielding back of time, \nthe Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the DeMint amendment No. \n4095, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the DeMint amendment. \nSenator DeMint, by the way, has been very constructive in our meetings \nand in our discussions. His staff met with my staff last night. The \nmeetings to date have been constructive and positive. We are hoping \nthat they might actually lead to some improvements to the legislation, \nbut we will have to wait and see to know how some of this works out.\n  I think it is very important for colleagues to understand what this \namendment does that Senator DeMint is offering first and that we will \nvote on at 5:30, and that is it would take the work the Senate has done \non this legislation so far and throw it out the window and adopt the \nHouse-passed measure. Now, there are a lot of differences between the \nHouse and the Senate versions. Senator DeMint was correct a few moments \nago when he talked about how there are a lot of similarities as well, \nand that is exactly right. I think I can be fair in my discussion when \nI say that at least my impression is that when the House started their \nprocess last fall, they were doing it--again, from my perspective--more \nin terms of a reaction to a lot of the news stories everybody was \nseeing about dangerous toys and children's products that were setting \noff alarm bells all over the country. I think their bill started as a \nreaction to that. That is not a bad way to start a bill; I am not \ncritical of the House in any way on it. I am proud of what they did and \nglad they got it through their committee and actually passed it on the \nHouse floor. I believe it was the very last day they were in session \nlast year--if not the last day, it was the last week. So I am proud of \nwhat they have done. I would say their bill is a pretty good bill.\n  Part of the reason, though, or the primary reason their bill has a \nlot of similarity to ours is during that process--and this is just \nlegislation; I am not critical at all, but during that process they \neventually looked at our bill that we were working on in committee, and \nthey took about half or so of it--maybe about 60 percent of it--and did \nsome cutting and pasting and just put it in their legislation. Again, I \nam honored that they did and flattered that they did because we had \nbeen working hard in the Commerce Committee to make sure the reform we \nwere talking about was comprehensive and was good.\n  I would say generally, in broad strokes, there are two or three major \ndifferences between the House bill and the Senate bill as the Senate \nbill exists today. One is that we have more enforcement in our \nlegislation. We have more transparency in our legislation. We have more \ncomprehensive reform in our legislation than the House bill does. \nAgain, I am not taking away from the House bill. I appreciate their \nbipartisan effort over there, so I don't want my words to be \ninterpreted as in any way critical. But I do think our bill is better. \nOurs is bipartisan--and so is theirs, by the way--with Senator Stevens \nand Senator Collins. I have spoken with several of my Republican \ncolleagues over the last few days, and I would hope they would consider \njoining\n\n[[Page S1508]]\n\nus as cosponsors. I would love for them to consider doing that today. I \nhad some discussions yesterday with a handful of Republicans who said \nthey were interested in at least considering cosponsoring. So we are \nwaiting to hear back from some of those offices today, but we would \nlove to add more Republican cosponsors if at all possible.\n  Let me go through some of the primary differences in what the House \nbill does and what the Senate bill does. There are many. Again, the \nbills are largely similar because the House adopted a lot of what we \ndid, or more or less adopted what we did in the committee. A lot of \nthat has not changed at all, or it has changed very little. So let me \nrun through a few points, five or six points.\n  First, I would say the Senate bill is more transparent. When I say \nthat, what I am talking about is, under our bill--again, the bipartisan \nSenate substitute--what I am talking about is there is more information \npublicly available to people under the Senate bill. We have seen this \nhappen on many occasions. I was going to tell this story later. We have \nsome charts to this effect I didn't want to bring out right now because \nwe will get into this in more detail later. We are going to talk about \nseveral examples of incidents where people were injured and where they \nhad bought and used a product that the CPSC had known about and known \nabout the dangers of it, but the CPSC was in negotiations or in \ndiscussions with the manufacturer about doing a recall. In fact, there \nis one incident we are going to talk about later--and it may be \ntomorrow at this point, depending on how the rest of the day goes--\nthere is one product we are going to talk about where a baby crib \ncollapsed, and it caught a young girl's hand in that crib. I think she \nwas roughly about a year old. We will get the facts on this when we go \nto it. I think she did end up avoiding serious injury, but it was \nscary. There were some moments there for the parents.\n  So the father called the manufacturer of the crib and the \nmanufacturer played dumb. They say: Gosh, we didn't know. We never \nheard of this problem before. We didn't know our cribs had this \nproblem. Are you sure you had it set up the right way? Are you sure she \nwasn't abusing it somehow? All of those kinds of things.\n  The father found out later that by the time he called, that company \nhad 80 complaints about that crib doing exactly the same thing. But \nbecause there is no transparency under the current law, there was no \nway for the father to find out.\n  If our bill passes, we will set up a database that is searchable \nwhere you can go and look at a specific product and know if there have \nbeen complaints about it before. This will be a huge benefit to parents \nand grandparents all over the country. We need to do this. The House \nbill doesn't have that provision. The House bill has a study. It says: \nYes, we ought to study this idea of a database, but they don't have a \ndatabase. In fact, the database we are talking about, we are not \ninventing this out of whole cloth. We are using another Federal \nagency's idea which has worked very well, and that is NHTSA, the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration. I would encourage--here \nagain, I mentioned this before--all of the staff people who are \nwatching in their offices and who think their boss might be undecided \non this legislation or undecided on this one point, I would encourage \nthem right now to go to the NHTSA Web site, and there is a little area \nyou can click on that talks about recalled products. I encourage you to \ndo that and go through that and see first how easy it is to use; \nsecondly, the quality of the information that is on there.\n\n  Again, we are going to show this later with charts to show all of my \nSenate colleagues how easy it is, but also how balanced and how fair it \nis. The industry has had some concerns they will be smeared, that they \nwill be slandered or libeled with all of these complaints. But I think \nthe NHTSA Web site shows it can be done in a very responsible way and \ndone in a way that does help the general public.\n  Another difference I want to talk about, the second difference \nbetween the House version and the Senate version is, the Senate bill--\nthe bill we are on right now--adopts what they call ASTM963-07, which \nis a standard that is widely accepted by the industries. ASTM stands \nfor the American Society for Testing and Materials, and that has just \nkind of become a lingo--ASTM has become a lingo in the consumer product \nworld for a set of standards. ASTM963-07 has become a widely \nrecognized, widely utilized standard.\n  What we do is, we codify that standard. If our bill passes, it is not \ngoing to be voluntary. It is not going to be--some people may be \nfollowing it, and some people may not. We are going to codify it. We \nwill make it law. Again, these are standards that the industry has been \nusing and has accepted. This is not a controversial piece of this \nlegislation. However, this ASTM963-07 is not in the House bill. So the \nHouse bill keeps the status quo. They say they are going to assess the \neffectiveness. Well, it has already been assessed. It has been out \nthere for years and years and years. Again, it is basically universally \nagreed that these are good safety standards that set the standard for \nindustry and should be adopted into Federal law.\n  The third difference with the House bill I wanted to talk about is \nthis idea of punishing companies when they do the wrong thing. The \nSenate committee passed the bill out of committee with a $100 million \ncivil penalty--$100 million. It went from $1.8 million to $100 \nmillion--over 50 times what is in existing law.\n  The House, in the meantime, passed a provision that had a $10 million \npenalty. Well, the concern I have with the $10 million penalty--civil \npenalty--is that for a lot of these big companies, $1.8 million can \njust be the cost of doing business. Again, we have some charts on this \nthat we may show in the next couple of days--it can be the cost of \ndoing business for some of these big companies--$10 million is better. \nIt gets their attention. But what we do is, we set our cap under the \nSenate bill at $10 million unless there are aggravating circumstances. \nIf there are aggravating circumstances such as maybe you have a repeat \noffender, maybe you have some particularly egregious behavior, or maybe \nyou have a company that just absolutely does not have any regard for \nU.S. safety standards. Again, a lot of these products that are \ndefective are coming in from overseas. Maybe they don't have the \nquality control over there. I don't know. They maybe have a chronic \nproblem or whatever it may be. The Senate bill allows you to take the \n$10 million max and do an additional $10 million, again, if there are \naggravating circumstances.\n  Quite frankly, I hope the CPSC never has to use that, but the fact \nthat they have that ability maybe will put a little fear in some people \nwhen they make some of these decisions about cutting corners on lead \npaint or making defective products, whatever they may be.\n  So, again, the Senate bill has a 10-plus-10 provision, which is $10 \nmillion max in lesser aggravating circumstances, and then you can go \nfor an additional $10 million. The House bill just has the flat $10 \nmillion.\n  Another difference, and I would call this the fourth difference \nbetween the Senate bill and the House bill, is that the Senate bill has \na protection for employees who notify the CPSC of violations. Now, this \nis important. You don't want employees to be punished for doing the \nright thing. We all know how it works in the real world. It happens \nwhere an employee will, over the objections of a company--over the \nobjections of his employer--go and inform the CPSC about some safety \nviolation. It does happen. Again, we have examples. We have charts if \nanybody wants to see them, or we have memos and background, news \narticles, et cetera, if people want to see those. But the truth is, you \nhave to keep this in perspective.\n  What we are talking about with our so-called whistleblower provision \nis a provision where an employee--it is basically only triggered when \nan employee of a company tells the CPSC about a dangerous product.\n  This is fundamental stuff. This employee is out there letting the \npublic know, basically telling the Government there is a dangerous \nproduct that is either in the U.S. market or about to get to the U.S. \nmarket. Again, that employee for doing the right thing should not be \nfired or demoted or whatever the case may be. If we set up a process in \nour law that is based on existing law where the employee goes\n\n[[Page S1509]]\n\nthrough the Department of Labor process, it is well established, we \nadopt what this Congress has passed in previous years as the standard \nwe would like to see on our whistleblower statute. The House bill has \nno such protection. We feel as if this is an important improvement in \nthe legislation because we think we will get more information to the \nCPSC if the employees understand they are protected.\n  Let's talk about misinformation about this one provision. In the \nCommerce Committee bill, we actually had a bounty for these employees \nfor turning in companies. We had a bounty in the bill. When I talked \nwith Senator Stevens, that was not acceptable to him. He made it very \nclear that he thought it would cause a lot of heartburn on the \nRepublican side. He was very adamant we take that provision out, and we \ndid.\n  We have also done some other things to build in some safeguards. For \nexample, if an employee files a frivolous claim with the Department of \nLabor, he can be subject to a $1,000 penalty. I don't have to go \nthrough all that today.\n  Our Senate bill, we believe, is balanced, we believe it is fair, we \nbelieve it is in the public interest to have this information come \nforward and the employee not be punished at work for telling the \nGovernment about a safety violation.\n  The fifth matter I wish to talk about is lead. I heard someone say \nthis bill is the ``get the lead out'' bill. This bill does, for the \nfirst time, in a very historic manner, set a standard for lead in \nchildren's products. Most Americans believe there is a standard for \nlead in children's products. There is not a standard. There is a \nstandard for lead in paint but not for children's products.\n  Every pediatrician with whom I have ever talked and every \npediatrician who has testified either on the House side or the Senate \nside and every scientist will tell you of the dangers of lead. It is \nbasic scientific medical knowledge today that lead is bad for children.\n  What we do in the Senate version of the legislation is we essentially \nban lead. We do not completely ban it because we understand that lead \nis a naturally occurring element. We are going to have trace amounts of \nambient lead in the atmosphere. We acknowledge that in our legislation. \nAnd our legislation, when it comes to lead, is more aggressive in \ngetting the lead out of children's products. We do it quicker, and I \nthink we do it in a better way than the House bill does.\n  The last point I wish to mention on the seven major differences \nbetween the House version and the Senate version is the DeMint \namendment--and that is what we are talking about today--to make sure \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission has the funding it needs to do \nwhat we want it to do.\n  The Senate version is a 7-year reauthorization. The DeMint amendment \nwould flat line the funding at a 10-percent level after 2009. Our bill \nactually has a slower ramp-up or it does have a ramp-up in resources, \nbut we acknowledge there is a lot of work to be done with this \nCommission. We cannot just give it a year or two of increased \nappropriations and then flat line it and hope it is going to be OK. \nWhat we need to do is continue to invest in this Commission to make \nsure long term we set it up for success.\n  The Senate version has that major advantage over the DeMint \namendment. The current version has a big advantage over the DeMint \namendment when it comes to providing the resources to the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission.\n  On that point, I say this: My colleagues all know, because they have \nseen my voting record, there have been times when I have been pretty \nmuch a deficit hawk around here and times when I have tried to shrink \nGovernment and different efforts such as that. I am not a person who \nbelieves we ought to throw money at a problem because I think generally \nwhen we do that, we do not get a very good result. I have seen that \ntime and time again on the Federal level. But this is an exception. \nThis is one of those times when I think we are being targeted, I think \nwe are being responsible, I think we are slowly ramping up this \nCommission and not throwing a bunch of resources at it right now, but \nwe are measuring out those resources over time, over a several year \nperiod.\n  I think what we will see in 7 years is a much stronger CPSC than we \nhave today. It is not just about the CPSC as a commission being \nstronger. That may, in and of itself, be OK, but what is good about our \nlegislation, the Senate version, is I believe very strongly we will \nhave a big improvement in safety all across America.\n  We talk about toys, and toys are a very important piece of what the \nCPSC does, but they do all kinds of things. Part of this legislation is \nto have a Federal standard on portable gas cans and the caps that are \non gas cans. We have seen that problem in many incidents around the \ncountry because there is no common standard on gas caps on these gas \ncans.\n  What we will be able to do with this legislation, with the Senate \nversion, is to make the consumer product safety world much safer. \nAgain, my hope is that when we stand here, say, 5 years from now, we \nwill see a precipitous decrease in litigation, we will see a decrease \nin recalls, we will see a decrease in injuries, and we will see a \ndecrease in deaths as a result of consumer products and consumer \nproduct violations.\n  I say to my fellow Senators, it looks as if we are going to vote on \nthe DeMint amendment at 5:30 p.m. today. I encourage Senators and their \nstaffs to look at the DeMint amendment and look at how it weakens the \nSenate version of the Consumer Product Safety Reform Act. It does \nweaken the Senate version. The DeMint amendment is basically--well, it \nis exactly accepting everything the House has done. We can do better \nthan that. We can be stronger. In fact, I have talked with several \nHouse Members who like what we are able to do in the Senate version. \nThe DeMint amendment puts us where the House is, and we need to have \nthe Senate's stamp on this legislation so we can go back home and tell \nthe people what we are doing for them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask that \nthe time come out of the Republican time, because I think the \nRepublicans have 55 minutes, or something like that, and the Democrats \nonly have 28 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is acceptable to our side. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I think it would be helpful for us to \nspend some time before the fiscal year 2009 budget bill is before us to \nreview the fiscal year 2008 budget. This is something we could not do \nlast year. Last year, the majority was in their first year and in sort \nof a honeymoon phase. They had the benefit of the doubt and no recent \nrecord to be saddled with. They could make pledges and promises, they \ncould make forecasts and make predictions, and we were under an \nobligation to wait for those results. The charge of tax and spend was \nfrom the past. Perhaps things were different.\n  Well, the Democrats' 2008 budget raised taxes by $736 billion. It \nassumed the largest tax increase ever, hitting 116 million people. It \nfailed to extend middle-class tax relief, as promised. The Democrats' \nfiscal year 2008 budget\n\n[[Page S1510]]\n\nincreased spending by $205 billion. It hiked nondefense discretionary \nspending $205 billion over 5 years. That is $350 billion over 10 years. \nIt manipulated reconciliation to spend $21 billion in entitlements. It \nallowed entitlement spending to grow by $466 billion over 5 years.\n  The budget and its supporters repeatedly ignored, waived, or \ngimmicked pay-go to the tune of $143 billion. The Democrats' fiscal \nyear 2008 budget grew the debt by $2.5 trillion. It passed the debt \nalong to our children, who will each owe $34,000 more. The Democrats' \nfiscal year 2008 budget ignored entitlement reform. It failed to offer \nany real solutions to the $66 trillion entitlement crisis.\n  The budget and its supporters rejected reasonable proposals to \naddress this entitlement crisis and, instead, allowed entitlement \nspending to grow by $466 billion over 5 years. The budget wildly \noverstated revenues from closing the tax gap to justify more spending. \nThat bill was, in fact, a classic Democratic tax-and-spend bill.\n  The majority had a clean slate, a new dawn. They went with the worst \npolicies of the past--bigger taxes, bigger spending, bigger debt, and \nlarger government. One example will show we are dealing with what can \nonly be described as either cold cynicism about the value of their \nrhetoric or gross ignorance of government realities. The SCHIP \nauthorization bill increased entitlement spending $35.4 billion over 5 \nyears and $71.5 billion over 10 years. However, a blatant budget \ngimmick drastically cut the program's funding in 2013 by 85 percent to \navoid a pay-go point of order. Nobody seriously expects this funding \ncut to occur. Nobody seriously believes this qualifies as paying as you \ngo. Yet both claims were made on this floor.\n  I voted against the fiscal year 2008 budget. The budget represented a \n6.8-percent increase in domestic Federal spending in 1 year. And let us \nlook at the debt figures. We see the debt is increasing unimaginably. \nWe are seeing a tremendous growth in the deficit, increasing by $440 \nbillion. We see mandatory spending growing unchecked by $411 billion in \nfiscal years 2008 through 2012. We spend more than $1 trillion of the \nSocial Security surplus. Unfortunately, what we end up with is a growth \nin the debt of over $2.2 trillion.\n  Yet the deficit is increasing while more taxes are expected to be \ncollected. If the tax increase goes into place--and that happens \nbecause there was no provision to make the tax cuts that were passed in \nthe Republican Congress in 2001 and 2003 permanent--by default these \ntaxes are going to increase by over $736 billion. So we have a deficit \nthat is increasing even though we have a dramatic increase in revenues \nwhich were taken into account in this budget. That is going to be the \nlargest tax increase in the history of this country contributing to \noverspending.\n  We are entering a new phase in our economy, a time when the negative \neffects of the housing crunch are coming due. But the housing problems \nare attacking the prosperity that resulted from our earlier tax \npolicies. The tax cuts we put in place in 2003 stimulated the economy. \nAs a result of those tax cuts, there was more money available for local \ngovernments to help pay for their programs, including State \ngovernments. There was more money available for the Federal Government. \nThat is why it was so easy for the majority party to put together that \nbudget last year, because of the large amount of revenues coming in to \nthe Federal Government. I attribute that to the fact that we cut prices \nfor the working men and women of this country, primarily those who own \ntheir small businesses and, by the way, who put in more than 40 hours a \nweek. Many times they work 7 days a week to keep those small businesses \noperating, supporting their communities. That is where we generate the \nrevenue.\n  Now that our economy is trending in the wrong direction, and when we \nneed the benefits of a reasonable and progrowth tax policy, the reality \nis going to be that we are going to depress our economic growth. We are \ntalking about increasing taxes on corporations that do business all \nover the world. Well, they are in a competitive environment. They have \nto compete with other countries. We cannot constrict our economy to \nstrictly American borders. We have to extend beyond that. If we want to \nget our economy going, we are going to have to talk about trade. We are \ngoing to have to talk about doing business all over the world.\n  Let's look and see how individuals are going to be impacted by this \ntax increase that will happen by default because we do not keep it from \nexpiring in the outyears. A family of 4, earning $40,000 a year--that \nis if both the husband and the wife are working and making $20,000 \neach--will face a tax increase of $2,052. We have 113 million taxpayers \nwho will see their taxes go up an average of $2,216.\n  Now, if we look at this a little further, we see that over 5 million \nindividuals, families who have seen their income tax liabilities \ncompletely eliminated, will now have to pay taxes. That is the new tax \nbracket we have created to provide tax relief for many of those working \nfamilies. So that is going to expire. When that expires, that is going \nto impact 5 million individuals and families who will begin to have to \npay taxes that they were allowed to get by without having to pay so \nthey could pay for the education of their kids, so they could pay for \nhealth care, so they could pay for the needs of the family, food and \nshelter.\n  We are not talking about individuals who are making a lot of money in \nthis case. Forty-five million families with children will face an \naverage increase of $2,864; that is the marriage penalty. Fifteen \nmillion elderly individuals will pay an average tax of $2,934. These \nare the people who are on retirement. Twenty-seven million small \nbusiness owners will pay an average tax increase higher than any of \nthose groups that I mentioned of $4,712. That is where our economic \ngrowth is generated--or was generated.\n  People of Colorado have asked me: How is this likely to affect me as \na Coloradan? Let me talk a little bit about how this could affect \ntaxpayers of the State of Colorado.\n  In Colorado, the impact of repealing the Republican tax relief would \nbe felt widely. For example, more than 1.6 million taxpayers statewide \nwho are benefiting from a new low 10-percent bracket would see their \ntax rates go up; 590,000 married couples could face higher tax rates \nbecause of an increase in the marriage penalty; 432,000 families with \nchildren would pay more taxes because child tax credits would expire; \nand 310,000 Colorado investors, including seniors, would pay more \nbecause of an increase in the tax rate on capital gains and dividends.\n  Remember, seniors who have retired have a lot at stake when we talk \nabout capital gains taxes and dividends because they put their money in \nthe stock market. They have put it in investments. As retired \nindividuals, they are finding that they are beginning to pull that out \nfor their retirement. The consequences are that without that tax break, \nthey would not have been able to save as much money toward their \nretirement.\n  Tomorrow, we are going to get our first glimpse of the majority's \nproposed fiscal year 2009 budget. We have more clarity now on what we \ncan actually expect when pay-go--which some refer to as ``tax gap''--\nand spending curbs and other terms are thrown at us by the supporters \nof that budget. We know that last year the words might have implied one \nthing, but the numbers said an entirely different story: Spending went \nup, the deficit went up, and taxes went up. Let's hope this year is a \nbetter year for the taxpayers and the citizens of this country.\n  I yield the yield floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will retract that and not set aside \nthe pending amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4104\n\n  I would like to speak on an amendment I intend to submit at the \nappropriate time.\n  There are six chemicals that are often included in plastic toys. What \nthose chemicals do is essentially make the toy softer, more pliable--\nergo, more attractive to children.\n  This is my communications director's young son. His name is Max \nGerber. He is 8 months old in this picture.\n\n[[Page S1511]]\n\nHe is sucking on his favorite book. I ask unanimous consent that I \nmight show you what that book looks like.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This is that book. The book is called ``Hello Bee, \nHello Me.'' As you can see, it is an attractive book. It was studied in \n2006, and it was found to be loaded with phthalates. But this is what \nbabies do; they put everything in their mouths.\n  Phthalates all too often are found in high quantities in children's \ntoys and other products. Studies have found that they are linked to \nboth birth and other serious rare reproductive defects. When these \nyoung children chew or suck on a toy with phthalates, these chemicals \ncan leech from the toy into the child and enter the child's \nbloodstream.\n  They interfere with the national functioning of the hormone system, \nand they can cause reproductive abnormalities and result in an early \nonset of puberty. Parents across the country actually have no idea of \nthese risks.\n  These chemicals have been banned in the European Union, five other \ncountries, and my home State of California, and eight other States are \nnow proposing similar bans. I believe this is the appropriate time for \nthe Federal Government to shield children from these chemicals.\n  Now, of course, my communications director, like many parents, had no \nidea that this book contained high levels of phthalates. But it is not \njust books; phthalates can be found in a variety of soft children's \ntoys such as rubber ducks and teethers like this one.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may show you that teether.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is this. It is very flexible. It is loaded with \nthese chemicals.\n  So you can see Max is a little bit older, chewing on a teether. Tests \nfound that teether contained a high level of phthalates.\n  In 2006, the San Francisco Chronicle sent 16 common children's toys \nlike this teether to a Chicago lab to test whether they contained \nphthalates. They did, in fact.\n  The results should alarm parents everywhere. One teether contained a \nphthalate level of five times the proposed limit. A rubber duck sold at \nWalgreens had 13 times the amount of phthalates now permissible under \nCalifornia law. The face of a popular doll contained double \nCalifornia's new phthalates limits.\n  Another study tested 20 popular plastic toys. The results were \nequally troubling. A Baby I'm Yours doll sold at Target contained \nnearly 32 percent of phthalates. A toy ball sold at Toys R Us was found \nto contain 47\\1/2\\ percent phthalates. Three types of squeeze toys--a \npenguin and two ducks--contained high levels of phthalates. They were \nalso bought at Wal-Mart and Target.\n  So I would like to, if I can, if I will be cleared to do it, send an \namendment to the desk. The amendment would replicate what will be \nCalifornia law in 2008 and ban the use of the chemical phthalates in \ntoys as California has done and eight States are continuing to do.\n  The European Union banned phthalates in 2006. That is all these \ncountries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, \nEstonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, \nLatvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, \nPortugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. They \nhave all banned the use of these chemicals in children's toys. Fiji, \nKorea, and Mexico have also banned or restricted phthalates in \nchildren's products.\n  Beginning next year, toys containing more than trace amounts of \nphthalates cannot be sold in California stores. My home State was the \nfirst State to ban phthalates in toys and other children's products. \nGovernor Schwarzenegger signed the legislation, which, as I say, will \nbecome effective in January of 2009. Eight States are following \nCalifornia's lead. Legislation has been offered in Washington State, \nMaryland, Hawaii, Illinois, Vermont, West Virginia, Massachusetts, and \nNew York.\n  Unfortunately, toys containing phthalates are still available to \nchildren across this country. I think it is time for the rest of the \ncountry to follow the lead of California, the European Union, and other \nnations because without action the United States risks becoming a \ndumping ground for phthalate-laden toys that cannot legally be sold \nelsewhere. I think American children deserve better. Parents in every \nState should be able to enter any toy store, buy a present for their \nchild, and know they are not placing their son's or daughter's health \nat risk.\n  This amendment follows the same standards already set by the European \nUnion and California. It bans the use of six types of phthalates in \ntoys. Three of the phthalates are banned from all children's toys; \nthree others are banned from toys children place in their mouths. The \namendment clearly states these chemicals cannot be replaced with other \ndangerous chemicals identified by the Environmental Protection Agency \nas carcinogens, possible carcinogens, or chemicals that can cause \nreproductive or developmental harm.\n  Now the science. The science involving phthalates is still evolving; \nhowever, we know exposure to phthalates can cause serious long-term \neffects. Some of the potential health effects and defects are highly \npersonal and difficult to discuss. They are problems no parent would \never want a child to experience.\n  I have two anthologies here which I will make available, a phthalates \nresearch summary and a paper which summarizes several of the works of \nscience.\n  Here are some of the effects: Pregnant women with high levels of \nphthalates in their urine were more likely to give birth to boys with \nreproductive birth defects. That is a University of Rochester 2005 \nstudy. Phthalate exposure has also been linked to the premature onset \nof puberty in young girls as young as 8 years old. That is a 2000 study \npublished in Environmental Health Perspective. A 2002 study linked \nphthalate exposure levels to decreased fertility capacity in men. And \nphthalates found in household dust have been linked to asthma symptoms \nin children. That is a Swedish study. The evidence that phthalates \ncause health problems continues to mount. Young children whose bodies \nare growing and developing and extraordinarily sensitive are \nparticularly vulnerable when exposed to phthalates in the toys around \nthem.\n  Now, many American toy retailers have already stepped up when it \ncomes to phthalates. I am very grateful for this. Target has already \neliminated phthalates from baby changing tables. Late last year, they \nannounced that most toys they sell will be phthalate-free by fall of \n2008.\n  Wal-Mart and Toys R Us announced they will voluntarily comply with \nCalifornia's standard nationwide. These are two huge retailers that \nwill voluntarily comply with the California standard. They informed toy \nproducers that beginning in 2009, they will no longer sell toys that \ncontain phthalates.\n  These retailers should really be commended. I would like to do so. \nThank you, Wal-Mart, thank you Toys R Us and thank you, Target.\n  This action also underscores the emerging uneasiness about those \nchemicals, with toy retailers acknowledging that parents do not want to \nunwittingly provide their young children with toys that could prove \nhazardous to their health. The amendment I hope to enter levels the \nplaying field in the toy industry, requiring every toy store and \nmanufacturer to comply with the standards being voluntarily put in \nplace.\n  I do wish to underscore an important point: This voluntary action, \nwhile highly commendable, should not take the place of an official \nregulatory standard.\n  Candidly, I can't imagine why we have waited this long. We always \nwait until the States take action. Some manufacturers have marketed \nproducts as phthalate free, but tests conducted by independent \nlaboratories have found phthalates. Parents wishing to purchase \nphthalate-free toys must be able to know what it is they are buying. I \nfirmly believe only a legal standard with the full weight of the law \nand potential legal consequences behind it will make that guarantee.\n  I wish to read from a letter from the Breast Cancer Fund:\n\n\n[[Page S1512]]\n\n\n       On behalf of the Breast Cancer Fund and our 70,000 \n     supporters across the nation, I am writing to express our \n     strong support for your amendment to the Consumer Product \n     Safety Commission Reform Act . . . which would prohibit the \n     manufacture, sale, or distribution in commerce of children's \n     toys and child care articles that contain phthalates.\n\n  It goes on to describe phthalates. It is signed by Jeanne Rizzo, \nR.N., Executive Director.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 3, 2001.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Breast Cancer Fund \n     and our 70,000 supporters across the Nation, I am writing to \n     express our strong support for your amendment to the Consumer \n     Product Safety Commission Reform Act (S. 2663) which would \n     prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution in commerce \n     of children's toys and child care articles that contain \n     phthalates.\n       Phthalates are a family of industrial chemicals used in a \n     wide variety of consumer products including plastics, nail \n     polish, perfumes, skin moisturizers, baby care products and \n     toys, flavorings and solvents. These chemicals don't stay in \n     the plastics they soften or in the countless other products \n     in which they are used. Instead, they migrate into the air, \n     into food and/or into people, including babies in their \n     mother's wombs. Phthalates have been found in indoor air and \n     dust and in human urine, blood, and breast milk. What's \n     especially troubling about phthalates is that they are \n     powerful, known reproductive toxins that have been linked to \n     birth defects in baby boys, testicular cancer, liver problems \n     and early onset of puberty in girls--a risk factor for later-\n     life breast cancer. The European Union and 14 other \n     countries, including Japan, Argentina and Mexico, have \n     already banned these chemicals from children's toys.\n       BCF was one of the primary sponsors of AB1108--a bill \n     recently signed into law by Governor Schwarzenegger which \n     made California the first State in the Nation to ban the use \n     of phthalates in toys and other childcare articles. Now 12 \n     other States have followed suit and have introduced--or are \n     considering introducing--legislation to ban phthalates in \n     toys and other products.\n       Obviously, there is nothing more important to the future of \n     this country, and the world than ensuring our children are \n     healthy today. By supporting your amendment, Congress has the \n     opportunity to protect children from dangerous, unsafe and \n     unnecessary exposures to toxic chemicals in the products they \n     play with every day such as teethers, toys and childcare \n     items. Thank you for your critically important leadership on \n     this issue.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                     Jeanne Rizzo,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Many organizations support the amendment, and I ask \nunanimous consent to have a list of those printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Alaska Community Action on Toxics, Breast Cancer Action, \n     Breast Cancer Fund- Center for Environmental Health, Center \n     for Health, Environment and Justice, Citizens for a Healthy \n     Bay, Clean Water Action Alliance of Massachusetts, Coalition \n     for Clean Air, Commonweal, Environment California, Healthy \n     Child Healthy World, Health Education and Resources, Healthy \n     Building Network, Healthy Children Organizing Project, INND \n     (Institute of Neurotoxicology  Neurological Disorders), \n     Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, Institute for \n     Children's Environmental Health, MOMS (Making Our Milk Safe), \n     Minnesota PIRG, Olympic Environmental Council, Oregon Center \n     for Environmental Health, Oregon Environmental Council, PODER \n     (People Organized in Defense of Earth  her Resources), \n     Safe Food and Fertilizer, Sources for Sustainable \n     Communities, The Annie Appleseed Project, US PIRG, WashPIRG, \n     Washington Toxics Coalition, WHEN (Women's Health  \n     Environmental Network).\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It has been a long time since I had a small child, \nbut I used glass nursing bottles, not fancy flexible bottles. I used \ncloth diapers. The toys were not as flexible as they are today. My \ndaughter grew up fine. One of the real hazards of this society is \nchemicals and how chemicals are used, and we don't know how they are \nused. When it comes to children's toys, I didn't know you could make \nplastic that way, so soft, so flexible. The reason you can is because \nof all the chemicals added to it. When these chemicals have a toxic \nfactor and you know these chemicals are going in a child's mouth and \nyou know they leach out of the plastic into the child's system, it \nsimply isn't right. We ought to stop it.\n  People out there know that. People out there want this. I would have \nliked to have taken the time to have had a committee hearing on this. \nBut candidly, this bill came up. And because this is already law in so \nmany places--the European Union, 5 other nations, California, 8 other \nStates ready to pass it--and you have retailers who understand and are \nwilling to take voluntary action, it seemed to me the legal standard \nshould be established. That is what this bill does.\n  I call up my amendment which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4104.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution in \n commerce of certain children's products and child care articles that \n                     contain specified phthalates)\n\n       On page 103, after line 12, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 40.

I wish to address a question to the distinguished \nchairman of the committee who has done fine work on this bill. I would \nat some point like a vote on this amendment, if possible. I am happy to \nset it aside if that is helpful and not ask for the yeas and nays at \nthis time, but I do want to vote. I believe children are at stake in \nthis.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator from California for being so gracious. \nWhile she was speaking, I talked to some of the Republican staff. I \nthink they need a little more time and maybe even people on our side \nneed a little more time on the amendment. If possible, I ask the \nSenator from California to set it aside. We will have a vote at 5:30. \nWe have several Senators who we think will come and speak on the DeMint \namendment. We will be working with the Senator as this goes along.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate that. Out of deference to the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, I am happy to do so.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Bingaman and Menendez be added \nas cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that time under the quorum be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a very important \nissue that is intended to protect Americans and to protect our \nchildren.\n  Before I make my comments, I wish to give a shout out to Senator Mark \nPryor, who has been leading this effort on behalf of the Senate. I \nworked with Senator Pryor during his time as attorney general from \nArkansas. If there is one thing that typifies the reality of attorneys \ngeneral, they are protectors of the people. Mark Pryor, as attorney \ngeneral of Arkansas, was a great example of a protector of the people \nof Arkansas, and he has continued that fine tradition in the Senate by \nmoving forward in the Commerce Committee and being the lead person in \nputting together this legislation that will protect American consumers, \nin particular American children.\n  I wish to begin today by sharing a story about a brave 4-year-old boy \nfrom Severance, CO, by the name of Tegan Leisy. Tegan and his family \nfound out about toy hazards the very hardest of ways.\n  Last year, when Tegan was only 3 years old, he suddenly and \ninexplicably became very sick. He was vomiting and in a lot of pain. \nTegan's parents rushed him to the emergency room, and the doctor took a \nseries of x rays. The x rays showed something in Tegan's stomach that \nlooked like a metal object. The doctors said the object would pass in \n72 hours and not to worry. Unfortunately, it did not pass.\n  Tegan remained in severe pain, so Tegan's parents took him back to \nthe hospital. This time they admitted Tegan, and they held him for \nobservation. Over the next 2 days, the doctors x raying Tegan found \nthere was an object inside his stomach that was not moving.\n  On the third day, the surgeon decided to operate. What did they find \nin the 3-year-old young man's stomach? They found six magnets--six \nmagnets--from toys that Tegan had swallowed. The magnets had stuck \ntogether, and it created 11 holes in Tegan's intestines. The doctors \nhad to remove 6 inches of his intestines that day during surgery.\n  Think of that, Mr. President. Think of that, all those who are \nwatching this debate on the Senate floor today. A 3-year-old boy had to \nhave portions of his intestines removed because he swallowed pieces \nthat had come off his toys. Tegan is, in fact, one of the lucky ones. \nHe is alive because of the good work of doctors who saved him and \nbecause his parents helped him catch the problem on time. Not all kids \nin America are that lucky today.\n  Congress created the Consumer Product Safety Commission, now more \nthan 30 years ago, to protect American consumers against death or \ninjury from unsafe products. However, the agency is grossly underfunded \nand understaffed. The CPSC estimates that products it is authorized to \nregulate are related to 28,200 deaths and 33.6 million injuries each \nyear. Over 28,000 deaths a year. Yet the agency only gets $63 million a \nyear to carry out its mandates.\n  As a result, stories such as Tegan's are commonplace across America.\n  In the last few months, newspapers have run stories on hundreds of \ncases of unsafe chemicals in toothpaste, contaminated dog food, and \ntoys tainted with toxic levels of lead.\n  I support the CPSC Reform Act for several reasons. First, this bill \nwould restore funding for the CPSC so that it can stop dangerous \nproducts and toys from even reaching the marketplace. If a dangerous \nproduct reaches the shelf, it is often too late.\n  Second, the bill finally takes steps to ban lead in children's toys. \nExposure to lead can cause serious neurological and developmental \nhealth problems in children. In the past year, millions of children's \ntoys have been recalled for containing hazardous levels of lead. The \ntoys have included metal jewelry, train sets, and Halloween costumes. I \nsee no reason why Congress would pass a Federal law banning lead in \npaint, but not in children's toys.\n  Third, the CPSC Reform Act would grant State attorneys general the \nability to bring a civil action on behalf of its residents to obtain \ninjunctive relief against entities that the Attorney General believes \nhas violated a consumer product safety. I had the great privilege of \nserving as Colorado attorney general for 6 years. As an attorney \ngeneral, you want to do everything in your power to protect the \ncitizens of your State. The narrowly tailored watchdog power granted in \nthis bill would have given me another tool to help protect the citizens \nof Colorado from unsafe and hazardous products.\n  There are many other fine provisions in the CPSC Reform Act. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support the bill and to help restore \nAmerican confidence in the safety of the toys and other products that \nare sold in the marketplace. We must do what we can to prevent parents \nacross the country from experiencing the nightmare that Tegan's parents \nexperienced.\n  This Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act will take major \nsteps in moving forward the solution to an issue that is facing \nAmerican consumers every day in our Nation.\n  I conclude my statement by making this comment: There has been a lot \nof discussion here about a particular provision of this legislation \nthat gives attorneys general the opportunity to come in and to enforce \nthe law. It is appropriate whenever you have a situation such as this \nto throw more cops into the situation to try to make sure consumers are \nprotected. This is an area of law where attorneys general from across \nthe country--both Democrats and Republicans--have been waging the war \non behalf of consumers for a very long time. They do not do it based on \nRepublican or Democrat. They do it based on what is good to protect the \nAmerican consumer.\n  So for those colleagues on the other side who will argue against \ngiving this power to the attorneys general of America--I would say \nthey, frankly, are mistaken, that when you look at the history over the \nlast 30 years of attorneys general taking the lead role in terms of \nenforcing the laws of our country to protect consumers, this is exactly \nthe kind of situation that calls out for giving that power to the \nattorneys general of the United States of America.\n  So I am hopeful we can come together as a Senate, as a Congress, and \npush legislation that gets to the President's desk and that he signs \ninto law so we protect the kids of America, we can protect the \nconsumers of America, and keep situations such as the one I described \nin Colorado from occurring again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in\n\n[[Page S1514]]\n\nthe Record a letter, dated February 29, 2008, from the National \nAssociation of State Fire Marshals. It is addressed to Senator Inouye \nand Senator Stevens, where they endorse this legislation, this Senate \nbill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                          State Fire Marshals,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 29, 2008.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \n         Transportation, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \n         Transportation, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Inouye and Stevens: The National Association \n     of State Fire Marshals (NASFM) consists of state public \n     safety officials committed to the protection of life, \n     property and the environment from fire and other hazards.\n       NASFM deeply appreciates all you have done to produce a bi-\n     partisan substitute for the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission Reform Act (S. 2663), and we support the \n     substitute language without reservation. However, NASFM \n     believes that these compromises go far enough. We would \n     prefer that this legislation be settled in the next Congress \n     if further reductions in fines and federal and state \n     authority become necessary as a result of floor amendments or \n     in negotiations with the House of Representatives.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John C. Dean.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be listed \nas an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I understand we are trying to \ndivide the quorum calls, so until some other Senator comes and wants to \nspeak, I will seek the appropriate parliamentary position.\n\n\n                       Florida Democratic Primary\n\n  But I wish to take this opportunity to speak about the bill, the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission. I also wish to speak about another \nunrelated subject, but one in which we are having a potential train \nwreck coming on the American political scene if, in fact, the worst \nwere to happen, and we did not have a nominee in the Democratic Party \nfor President all the way down into late August, going into the \nconvention in the State of the Presiding Officer--Denver, CO--where the \nDemocratic National Convention will be. Because then the issue would be \nso raw as to whether to seat the Florida and the Michigan delegations \nat the convention.\n  Now, the reason I am making these remarks is I have talked to a \nnumber of our colleagues, and what I am about to tell you our \ncolleagues don't know about the State of Florida in this fracas that is \ngoing on. Because most people think it was the Florida Democratic Party \nthat suddenly got all riled up and shifted the Democratic primary in \nFlorida ahead of the permitted time of February 5 and shifted it a week \nearlier to January 29. Not so. It was the Republican Legislature of \nFlorida passing a law that was signed into law by the Republican \nGovernor that changed, by law, Florida's date from its previous date of \na primary in March to January 29. At the time the legislature did this, \na year ago, in the annual legislative session, in early 2007, the rules \nof the Democratic National Committee said any State moving ahead \nearlier than February 5 would be penalized with half of its delegates \ntaken away. Interestingly, that is what the rules of the Republican \nNational Committee said as well. But when the Florida Legislature moved \nthe date--and by the way, here is another fact that my colleagues of \nthe Senate are surprised about when I tell them. When the bill came \nforward, it was an election reform bill, an election machine reform \nbill that was clearly going to pass on final passage in the Florida \nLegislature.\n\n  It had a provision put forth by the Republicans in the legislature of \nmoving the primary date early, to January 29. The Democratic leader of \nthe Florida Senate offered an amendment to put it back to comply with \nthe rules of the Democratic National Committee to February 5. That \namendment was defeated, and then the bill went on to final passage \nsince the main part of the bill was election machine reform--something \nwe are sensitive about in Florida, by the way--and the Governor signed \nit into law, thus making part of the bill January 29. But then, once it \nbecame the law--and nobody is going to change that in Florida; that is \nthe law. That is the date of the election. That is the date around \nwhich all of the State election machinery would operate, and the State \nof Florida would, in fact, pay for that election. And indeed they did--\n$18 million worth of paying for.\n  Then an interesting thing happened on the way to this crisis. The \nRepublican National Committee said: No, Florida, you moved your date \nearly. You broke the rules. Our rules say we are going to take away \nhalf your delegates. That is exactly what the Republican National \nCommittee did. The Republicans went on to have a primary election, \nrealizing they were only going to get half their delegates. But that is \nnot what the Democratic National Committee did. The Democratic National \nCommittee rules said: We are going to take away half your delegates. \nBut over the course of the summer, some on the Democratic National \nCommittee got so riled up about Florida jumping ahead of South \nCarolina, which wanted the privilege of being the first Southern State \nto have a primary, that they convinced the Democratic National \nCommittee to exact the full measure of punishment--not what the rules \ncalled for, to take away half the delegates--but instead take away all \nthe delegates.\n  Then, another interesting thing happened. Those who wanted to punish \nFlorida decided to concoct a pledge that they would force all of the \nPresidential candidates to sign, and the pledge said they would not go \ninto Florida to campaign. Campaigning was defined as having staff, \nhaving an office, using telephones, even holding a press conference. \nBut, by the way, there was an exception. They could go into Florida and \nraise money.\n  So my colleagues can see how this has created a highly distasteful \nbad taste in the collective mouths of four and a quarter million \nregistered Democrats in Florida, almost half of whom turned out on \nelection day, January 29, when they were being told: Your vote is not \ngoing to count. Well, it is pretty precious to us in Florida that our \nvote count, and our vote count as intended, and 1.75 million Florida \nDemocrats turned out. That was far in excess of twice the number that \nhad ever turned out in any Presidential primary held in the State of \nFlorida before. The Democratic National Committee still says they are \nnot going to allow Florida's votes to be counted. Well, all of this \nfracas is coming full circle.\n  Now, by the way, it wasn't that a lot of us didn't try. A whole bunch \nof us in the Florida congressional delegation first tried to work a \ncompromise. We tried to say if everyone would get in the order that \nthey wanted, the first four original States could end up being the \nfirst anyway. But, no, they were not about to listen to a compromise. \nThis is back in the summer. This is in August. This is in early \nSeptember, before the final decision became effective in September from \nthe DNC of cutting off all the delegates in Florida. Congressman Alcee \nHastings and I even filed suit in Federal district court against Howard \nDean and the Democratic National Committee on the constitutional \narguments that due process and equal protection of the laws under the \nBill of Rights in the Constitution was violated. The Federal judge who \nheard the case in December decided he bought the argument of the DNC, \nthat a court case from the 1970s--a Wisconsin case, in fact--applied, \nand that\n\n[[Page S1515]]\n\nthe DNC could do whatever it wanted in the setting of its rules.\n  So what we come to is an unfortunate turn of events where, if the \nrace is close, and delegates pledge delegates and decisions of \nsuperdelegates going into the summer, and if Florida and Michigan, \nwhich have a different set of circumstances, which are both being \ndenied, were to make the difference, and if they are not seated at the \nDemocratic National Convention, it is finally dawning on the partisan \nparty leaders that how are Florida and Michigan and the people of those \nStates going to feel 2 months hence after the Democratic National \nConvention, when election day, November 4, comes around. That is \nstarting to make some people very nervous.\n  So I call on all the reasonable heads--as the Good Book says, come \nlet us reason together--to honor the fact that almost 2 million Florida \nDemocrats went and voted and they expect their vote to count and count \nas they intended it to count. I call on the reasonable leadership to \ncome together for the sake of unity and allow us to go into a \nconvention in a unified fashion so that we can have a very legitimate \nelection process for the leader of our country for the next 4 years.\n  I understand there are other Senators who wish to speak, so I will \ndefer my comments about the Consumer Product Safety Commission bill, of \nwhich I am a cosponsor, until a later time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4095\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes on \nmy amendment that I believe we will be voting on at 5:30 today. This \namendment brings up the House-passed consumer product safety bill. This \nwas a bill that had extraordinary bipartisan support. It was led by \nSpeaker  Nancy Pelosi and Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton. \nThey worked together for a number of weeks to create a bill that did a \nlot of the things we had hoped to do in the Senate, and Chairman \nDingell has encouraged us to take up the House bill and pass it today.\n  I see Senator Stevens has come to the floor, and I know he wants to \nspeak on this bill. I would be glad to yield my time or part of my time \nand then follow Senator Stevens, if he would like me to. I think we \nhave the balance of the time until 5:30 together, and I understand the \nSenator from Alaska needs 5 minutes. I yield 5 minutes to Senator \nStevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator is very generous for sharing \nhis time. I have come to the floor to speak on his substitute bill.\n  I hope the Senate realizes this is a complete substitute, and it will \ntake the House bill and replace it for the actions that the Senate has \ntaken through our Commerce Committee and on the Senate floor so far. \nWhile there are some portions of the House bill that are positive, and \nI am pleased to say we will be happy to work with them in conference. I \nmust oppose this amendment because it would gut this entire bipartisan \ncompromise that is now before the Senate.\n  Consumer product safety has been before the Senate before, and we \nhave not been able to get to this point. We have gotten to this point \nbecause Senator Pryor, Senator Inouye, Senator Collins, myself, and \nothers have worked together to bring to the Senate a bill that has \npositive safety provisions that are not currently in the House bill. I \nurge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment because what we have \ndone in this bill will provide some very positive changes that I \nbelieve the House will be willing to accept in conference. The \ndifficulty is this amendment would not include those additional \nprotections. We would have to go back and start all over again in the \nlegislative process to address the additional provisions we have added \nto this bill.\n  I believe we can get through the amendment process in the next couple \nof days, and it is my hope we can go to conference and this bill will \nbe sent to the President as soon as possible. I believe the country is \nready for a change and a reemphasis on consumer product safety, \nparticularly as it relates to children.\n  I am the father of 6 children, grandfather of 11, and I hope to have \nmore--at least grandchildren. That is supposed to be funny. I think we \nought to be able to take this compromise bill to conference, and I \nwelcome that. I promise I will confer with my colleague with regard to \nthe changes we might make in conference, but this is not the time to \nend this bipartisan process.\n  If there is one thing the Senate needs, the one thing Congress needs, \nit needs bipartisanship to move forward on the business we should act \non during this Congress. This is a product of that, the product of a \nlong, hard conference on a bipartisan basis.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment. It is my hope the \nSenate will allow us to go to conference on the bill on which we worked \nso hard.\n  I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I agree with a number of points the \nSenator from Alaska just said, particularly the importance of working \nin a bipartisan fashion on a bill as important as consumer product \nsafety. That is exactly what I am proposing with this amendment because \nthis is something that not only had bipartisan support in the House, it \nhad unanimous support in the House.\n  The Senator from Alaska also mentioned the importance of moving \nquickly. He suggested that my amendment might actually slow this bill \ndown. In fact, the opposite is true. If we were to adopt this \namendment, the consumer product safety bill could go to the President \ntonight. This is a bill that has been thoroughly vetted and includes a \nlot of good provisions about which I would like to speak. But even my \ncolleagues who would like to vote for the final Senate bill--I don't \nknow whether my amendment will be adopted or not tonight--can still \nvote for the Senate bill even if they vote for the House bill.\n  Voting for this amendment is voting for a good, clean, bipartisan \nconsumer product safety bill that we might not have at the end of this \nprocess. As all of us know, the longer this debate goes on, the more \nnongermane amendments will be added to the bill, and the possibility of \nthis bill being passed and going to conference and actually coming out \nwith a bill we can all support--we don't know what the odds of that \nare. But we do know if we pass the House version of the bill tonight, \nwe will have a new consumer product safety bill that does a number of \nthe things all of us want. I will mention a few of those.\n  One of the items we talked about is not just to count on companies to \ntest their own product safety but to have a third-party testing, \nparticularly of children's products, for lead and other hazards. The \nHouse bill sets that up.\n  We also require manufacturers to put distinguishing marks on their \nproducts so that in the event of a recall, we would know how to \nidentify the products that are out in the marketplace that need to come \nback. Consumers would know which ones are safe and which ones are not.\n  It also replaces the aging testing labs the Commission uses now and \ninstalls a state-of-the-art testing system that will help us determine \nmore quickly which products are safe and those that are not.\n  We create a new system of advising the public when we have found a \nsafety problem through using the Internet, radio, and television, and \nwe preserve the strong relationship between industry and the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission, so we get the information from them on a \nconstant basis if there are any safety problems or even improvements in \nsafety in different product categories. And we restore the full panel \nof Commissioners to the Commission, which is not in place right now.\n  The House bill had support from a total range of Members. From the \nmost conservative Republican to the most liberal Democrat, they agreed \nto come together without further delay and pass a bill that we need.\n  The groups from the outside that look at these issues, particularly \nthe manufacturer groups, such as the National Association of \nManufacturers and the Chamber of Commerce, that represent millions of \njobs across this country--and that is really what we\n\n[[Page S1516]]\n\nare talking about here. The Senate bill would actually put an \nadditional burden on American-based manufacturers that our foreign \ncompetitors do not have. If there is one thing we do not need to do as \na Congress, it is to make it even more difficult to do business in this \ncountry, to put our workers at a further disadvantage to workers from \noverseas by adding an unnecessary burden to this consumer product \nsafety bill, provisions that do not necessarily improve safety but do \nmake it increasingly difficult to be competitive as an American \nmanufacturer. We need not do that.\n  The Senate bill has some problems, and we have a number of amendments \nwe can add. Right now, my amendment has the support of the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, chamber groups; business journals, such \nas the Wall Street Journal, are supportive of this amendment, and they \nare not supportive of the Senate version, frankly.\n  So we have a better alternative tonight. I encourage my colleagues to \nset aside partisanship, to set aside maybe particular special interests \nwe may want to do some favors for in the Senate bill. The House set \nthat aside, and they did the right thing. That is really what I am \nencouraging my colleagues to do tonight: Do the right thing.\n  This is not a bill I created. This is a bill which is supported by \nSpeaker  Nancy Pelosi and Chairman Dingell, as well as the Republicans \non the House side. We probably will not have another opportunity this \nyear as a Senate to vote for a bill that has unanimous support in the \nHouse. Yet we have it on the floor tonight. I encourage my colleagues: \nDo the right thing. Let's practice what we preach for once and be \nbipartisan and support an amendment that will get a consumer product \nsafety bill to the President right away so we can start the \nimplementation process.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time. I know my colleague, the \nchairman, wishes to speak before the vote. I yield the remainder of my \ntime. He can have the rest of that time. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina for \nhis gracious allotment of time and tell him how much I appreciate his \nspirit of cooperation and trying to come together and find as much \ncommon ground as we can on not just his amendment that is pending but \nother amendments and other matters. He has been a true gentleman in how \nhe has conducted himself, and I appreciate that.\n  I wish to say a few words about the DeMint amendment. Really, all the \nDeMint amendment does is it cedes us to the House version of the bill. \nIt is significantly different. As I said before, the House, during \ntheir process, basically took about half, maybe a little more of the \nSenate committee bill and basically cut and pasted it into their \nlegislation. So we have a little bit of, I guess you can say pride of \nauthorship in the House version. There are a lot of good provisions in \nthe bill.\n  The House version is different in several material ways. I went \nthrough some of those before, but let me touch on about 8 or 10 more \nitems right now. And I can do this very quickly.\n  First, the Senate bill gives a financial responsibility in the sense \nthat it requires, under certain circumstances, manufacturers to put \nfunds in escrow or to get insurance in the event of a recall. It is not \nautomatic, but it allows the CPSC to do that under cases that might \nwarrant that action. The DeMint amendment takes that away.\n  The Senate bill has a specific provision on portable gasoline \ncontainers and makes it clear that there will be a national standard. \nAgain, the DeMint amendment takes that away.\n  The Senate bill has several provisions on all-terrain vehicle safety. \nIt sets a national standard. It sets all kinds of benchmarks that need \nto be met, and it makes the Federal law very clear about ATV safety \nstandards in this country. Unfortunately, the DeMint amendment takes \nthat away.\n  The Senate bill also contains a garage door opener standard. We all \nknow how dangerous garage door openers can be. They do not have to be. \nThere is technology available. We set a national standard which is a \ngood belt-and-suspenders type of standard. Again, we are talking about \ngarage doors that have a track record of causing injury, in some cases \ndeath, not just to children but mostly to children. The DeMint \namendment takes that standard away.\n  The Senate bill also contains a provision on carbon monoxide \npoisoning, specifically with generators. Again, this has been a \nproblem, not just with Katrina and Rita and other situations such as \nthose but just generally for people who use these generators in various \ncontexts. There has been a carbon monoxide poisoning problem. The \nSenate bill takes care of that problem. Unfortunately, the DeMint \namendment takes that away.\n  The completion of a cigarette lighter rulemaking is something that \nhas been pending with the CPSC for quite some time. We clarify that \nthere will be a national standard. We set that standard. We pretty much \ntell the CPSC what needs to happen with this issue. Unfortunately, the \nDeMint amendment takes that away.\n  The last point I want to make--there are several other points I could \nmake, but the last one I want to mention is under certain \ncircumstances, the Senate bill provides for the destruction of imported \nproducts that violate our safety standards. This is important because \nif we do not destroy those products, somehow, some way, oftentimes they \nend up in the U.S. market even though they are not supposed to, but \nalso we see the dumping of these products in Third World countries. If \nwe do not take a principled stand on this issue, we are just going to \nbe dumping our problems on other countries. Unfortunately, the DeMint \namendment takes that away.\n  I am certainly not critical of Senator DeMint or critical of the \nHouse. The House came together in a bipartisan way. The bottom line is, \nwe just have a stronger bill in the Senate. It is a bill of which we \ncan be proud. It is a bill people in our home States would love to see \nus pass. I tell you, most people in Arkansas, most people around the \ncountry in the other 49 States probably could not tell you what CPSC \nstands for, but they could tell you they want stronger and tougher \nprotections when it comes to imported products. They want to make sure \nsomeone is watching to make sure the toys they buy for their children \nand grandchildren are safe. They want to make sure that someone in the \nFederal Government is watching to make sure products, such as lighters, \nare safe and products as simple as gasoline cans are safe and that when \nyou use a portable generator, you do not get carbon monoxide poisoning. \nPeople in our country expect those kinds of standards, and that is \nexactly what the Senate bill does. It is good not just for the CPSC, \nbut it is good for this country.\n\n  As I have said before, we have several specific differences I have \njust articulated, differences between the House version and the DeMint \namendment, which is basically the House version. The bottom line is, \nthe Senate bill has more transparency, more enforcement, and more \ncomprehensive reform. This bill is something of which we can all be \nproud. Not that we go home and brag to people in our home States about \ngetting something right up here, but this will give every Senator in \nthis Chamber an opportunity to go to their home State and talk about \nsomething good the Senate is doing for this country, something that is \nnonpolitical, something that is bipartisan, something that is good \npublic policy, and that is the Senate bill.\n  Again, the House bill is good. It is OK. It is an improvement over \ncurrent law. I do not have any criticism of our House colleagues for \ndoing what they did, I really do not, especially considering that about \nhalf of that bill is really the Senate committee bill. Regardless of \nthat, I do not have any criticism of them, and I do not want anything I \nhave said to be interpreted as criticism. But the Senate bill is \nstronger, it is better, it is more comprehensive, it is better for the \nAmerican people, and I think it will, over time, lessen the amount of \nlitigation, and I think over time you will see fewer recalls and you \nwill see consumer confidence in products they buy go up.\n  Overall, this is a very good bill for the people of this country. I \nencourage my colleagues to vote no on the DeMint amendment, and on \nfinal passage of the Senate bill, whenever that happens--tomorrow or \nthe next day--I\n\n[[Page S1517]]\n\nencourage all my colleagues to vote yes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I move to table the DeMint amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Motor Coach Safety\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last Sunday marked the 1-year anniversary \nof a tragic bus crash outside Atlanta, GA, which was transporting \nmembers of the Bluffton University baseball team from my State of Ohio \nto play baseball in Florida. The crash took the lives of Tyler Williams \nand Cody Holp, Scott Harmon, Zack Arend, and David Joseph Betts. The \ndriver, Jerome Niemeyer, and his wife Jean were also killed in the \ncrash. Most of the other 33 passengers were treated for injuries.\n  While the investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing, one \nthing is clear: Stronger safety regulations could have minimized the \nfatalities and injuries resulting from the crash.\n  John Betts, who lost his son in this accident, sees upgrading the \nsafety laws for motor coaches as an opportunity to save the lives of \nfuture riders. One year ago, Mr. Betts made a promise to his late son. \nHe promised to dedicate himself to motor coach safety. Thus, through \nthis tragedy, a movement began to adopt commonsense safety regulations \nthat lower the risk of injury or fatality in accidents. Mr. Betts \nlaunched a Web site to educate the public about motor coach safety. He \nagrees to do regular interviews so he can use his own heartbreaking \nexperience to gain momentum for his cause.\n  Mr. Betts visits his son's grave twice a day. Of his visit the other \nday, he said:\n\n       I just asked him to give me strength, give me wisdom, give \n     me the words to keep fighting to make sure something good \n     comes from something so bad.\n\n  Last fall, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and I joined this \neffort, introducing the Motor Coach Enhanced Safety Act. This bill, \nwhich has the support of Mr. Betts and countless safety advocates, \nwould codify recommendations from the National Transportation Safety \nBoard. It surprised me--and it will surprise my colleagues--that the \nsafety improvements in this bill are not already standard safety \npractice. They include such basic and logical safety measures as the \nuse of seatbelts and fire extinguishers. These are not new \ntechnologies. These are safety features widely used in other \ntransportation equipment. They are commonsense. They save lives. They \nshould be a given, not some distant goal.\n  Many of the injuries sustained in motor coaches could be prevented by \nincorporating high-quality safety technologies that exist today but, \nunfortunately, are not widely used, such as crush-proof roofing and \nglazed windows to prevent ejection.\n  Unfortunately, the Bluffton University baseball team's bus crash was \nnot an isolated incident. Senator Hutchison quickly pointed to the many \naccidents in Texas while this bill was being drafted, such as the crash \ninvolving the Westbrook High School girl's soccer team in 2006.\n  As a father of four and recently a grandfather, it upsets me to know \nmotor coaches are such unregulated vehicles that our kids don't have \nthe option to buckle up. The tragedy of these and other motor coach \naccidents has created motivation and hope in Mr. Betts and others for \nincreased safety in this industry in the future. It is our job to take \nthat motivation and that hope and turn them into action.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the Motor Coach Enhancement Safety \nAct. Passage of this bill would undoubtedly mean saved lives in the \nfuture. It is my hope in the future parents will not have to endure the \nanguish and the rest-of-his-life grief that John Betts and other \nfamilies' members have experienced.\n  For those who suffered from the tragedy in Atlanta of the Bluffton \nbaseball team on March 2, 2007, I offer my thoughts and prayers.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 5 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Air Force Aerial Refueling Tanker Selection\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I was pleased to learn last week that the \nAir Force had made a selection for the development and procurement of \nits new aerial refueling tanker fleet. I am told that the replacement \nof the 1950s-era fleet of KC-135s had been the Air Force's No. 1 \nprocurement priority. By the time the last one is replaced, it will be \nover 80 years old. It is good to see the Air Force move forward to \nreplace these aging aircraft.\n  GEN Arthur Litche, the commander of Air Mobility Command, whose \nmission it is to provide rapid global mobility and sustainment for \nAmerica's Armed Forces, recently said:\n\n       Tanker modernization is vitally important to national \n     security.\n\n  I have been told this acquisition selection process is the most \ndocumented selection process the U.S. Air Force\n\n[[Page S1518]]\n\nhas ever conducted. Last Friday, Secretary of the Air Force Michael \nWynne said:\n\n       Today's announcement is the culmination of years of \n     tireless work and attention to detail by our Acquisition \n     professionals and source selection team, who have been \n     committed to maintaining integrity, providing transparency, \n     and promoting a fair competition for this critical aircraft \n     program.\n\n  The Air Force advises us that 25,000 American workers at 230 U.S. \ncompanies located in 49 States will support the assembly of these \naircraft. The winning proposal was submitted by the team led by \nNorthrup Grumman and includes EADS North America and General Electric \nAviation. It was judged to provide the best value for the U.S. Air \nForce and for the U.S. taxpayer. General Litche said the winning \nproposal gives the military more passengers, more cargo, more fuel to \noffload, more availability, more flexibility, and more dependability.\n  I am pleased to congratulate the winners of the competition, and I \nlook forward to the day when this new aircraft joins the fleet.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There were children's jewelry and toys that were covered in \nlead paint. There were toys with detachable magnets that can cause \nfatal intestinal obstructions. There were stuffed animals with small \nparts that can detach and become a choking hazard. There was a \nchildren's craft kit containing beads that when swallowed became \ningested into the child's digestive system; and what came out of those \nbeads was the same chemical compound, believe it or not, as GHB, which \nis the date rape drug.\n  The Laugh & Learn Bunny became a choking hazard. This magnetized \nbuilding set, as shown on this chart--over 4 million units were sold--\nthose magnets became ingested into the child's digestive track. Thomas \nthe Train, over 1.5 million units were sold, and lo and behold those \nwere painted with lead paint. And then the Barbie accessories--675,000 \nunits of those were sold--had lead paint. And there were other toys. In \nfact, one of them was some kind of little doll where the nose came off. \nIt was exactly the size that could get into a child's windpipe and \ncause them to choke to death.\n  As a matter of fact, one of the children's hospitals in Florida I \nvisited about this very thing gave me a plastic thimble of about the \nsize they said they hand out to the children's parents because they \nwant them to see the size of anything that could detach--if it did from \na toy--that is a choking hazard for a child.\n  So in visiting with this team of emergency room doctors, they showed \nall these things in real life to me and told me about the invasive \nsurgery that then they had to do on children that was traumatic for a \nchild who is 4 or 5 years old.\n  Then, I had the very sad duty to visit with a momma and a daddy in \nJacksonville, who left two of their children in a room with a disco \nball toy. What happened? It became overheated because it was \nilluminated. It became overheated. It caught fire, and it emitted \nenough carbon monoxide to kill both the children.\n  Now, these incidents simply should not be happening. Yet with this \nbill Senator Pryor is managing on the floor, we can better ensure \nAmerican parents do not have to face another summer of recalls.\n  So this act is going to do a number of things. It would increase the \nnumber of professional staff who work at the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission. It would ensure consumer access to information about these \nproducts. It would eliminate lead from children's products. It \nincreases civil penalties for wrongdoers. And it protects employees \nfrom retribution who report violations of consumer product safety. This \nbill also requires the first mandatory standard for toy safety, and it \nrequires third-party testing of toys and other children's products.\n  What has come to the floor is a combination of different legislation. \nWhat this Senator had contributed was S. 1833, the Children's Products \nSafety Act, which would require third-party testing of products \nintended for children aged 7 and under. I am very pleased it has been \nincluded in this overall package.\n  There are two provisions that are critical. First, the third-party \ntesting provision ensures that all of those toys and products undergo \ntesting by a third party prior to entering the stream of commerce. Any \nthat did not have the third-party testing would be banned from \nimportation. Now, why is this necessary? Because we were letting the \nChinese industry police itself, and it wasn't doing it, and the \nGovernment of China wasn't doing the inspecting. So we had the \nsubstandard and indeed unsafe toys coming to the American consuming \npublic.\n\n  Second, this bill would set the first mandatory safety standards by \nadopting the ASTM--the international consumer safety specifications for \ntoy safety. That is often referred to as standard F-963. ASTM is a \nnonprofit standard-setting organization. It is an independent \norganization that involves the CPSC--the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission--consumer groups, and the industry in toy standards and the \ndevelopment process. The standards contain 100 other toy safety \nspecifications, including testing for shock points, flammability, \ntoxicity, and noise.\n  These standards, in their development process, also provide a fast, \ncollaborative process to address these changing conditions. So when the \ndetachable magnet issue arose last year, the ASTM standards development \nteam recognized the seriousness of the issue. They came up with a new \nmagnet safety standard 9 months after the problem was first reported.\n  Well, under the provisions of the bill, the updates to the ASTM \nstandard will automatically be incorporated into the Federal toy safety \nstandard, unless for some reason the CPSC would determine that it \nwasn't going to improve the public safety. So as a result, the \nconsumers are going to have the benefit of new toy safety standards \nimmediately after the adoption of this legislation.\n  Taken together, these provisions will ensure that toys will be tested \nby a rigorous third-party testing process that is constantly updated to \naddress new and emerging hazards to our children. Third-party testing \nhas been endorsed by a number of consumer groups and a number of the \nmanufacturers that realize we have a problem here. So we need to build \na consensus and get this legislation passed.\n  Last year, over 46 million children's products were recalled--can my \ncolleagues believe that, 46 million recalled--and almost a fifth of \nthose were recalled after a child was seriously injured or killed. It \nis not enough just to recall these toys; we need to make sure they \nnever enter the stream of commerce in the first place, and this bill \nprovides that safety.\n  I wish to say there is also something in here about generators, \nportable generators. If you live in a coastal State such as mine and \nyou get hit by a big hurricane--and especially gasoline stations are \nlearning they need them because people need to be able to drive\n\n[[Page S1519]]\n\ntheir cars and they can't get gasoline--well, in any kind of natural \ndisaster such as that, people really rely on these portable generators \nto provide electricity. Unfortunately, every year, a number of people \nare severely injured or killed by the carbon monoxide poisoning that \nresults from improper generator use. They crank this thing up in an \nenclosed room, and they ultimately are harmed or killed as a result of \ncarbon monoxide.\n  Section 32 of the CPSC Reform Act requires the CPSC to complete a \nlong-pending rulemaking on portable generator carbon monoxide poisoning \nwithin 18 months of the enactment. When this rule is finalized, it is \ngoing to require new technologies to stop these tragedies, and it will \nsave lives. It is a wonder that the CPSC hadn't already done this when \nfolks such as myself are articulating what has happened with the deaths \nin the aftermath of a hurricane and have asked them to do it. Now we \nare going to bring it to fruition because it is going to be required \nunder this legislation.\n  I again thank my colleague, Senator Pryor, who is shepherding this \nlegislation through a tortuous legislative process. I hope all of our \ncolleagues will join in supporting this critical legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum, unless the Senator from Arkansas--it looks as if his eloquent \nself is rising to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, before my dear colleague from Florida \nleaves the floor, I would like to acknowledge his work on this \nlegislation. He has been a real go-to guy on these toy issues. In fact, \nhe had filed a bill--before we even filed our bill that became the \ncommittee bill, he filed a bill that basically--I don't want to say we \ntook verbatim, but we took large pieces of it and all the concepts of \nit and incorporated his legislation, and it really became the bedrock \npiece of the committee bill, which has now been amended and \nsubstituted, and now it is the bipartisan bill the Senate is working \non. So Senator Bill Nelson of Florida really deserves a lot of credit \nfor helping to get the ball rolling and getting things moving in the \nright direction.\n  In fact, we have so many colleagues who have helped in this process, \nand I will thank them more as the week goes on. But I think of Susan \nCollins of Maine, who came in probably, I don't know, several months \nago--I don't remember exactly when--and she had a very important role. \nOf course, Senator Stevens really worked hard to make this bipartisan. \nBoth of them are Republican cosponsors.\n  Again, for all of the Senators who are listening, I would love to \ntalk to more Republican Senators about maybe possibly becoming \ncosponsors in the next day or two because, as we saw from the vote \ntonight, this bill does have broad-based bipartisan support. I \nappreciate the effort all of our colleagues have done, but I did want \nto single out Senator Bill Nelson, who has been so instrumental in \nmoving this forward.\n  Mr. President, if there is no one else who is planning on speaking, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it looks as if we are at the close of our \nbusiness today. Tomorrow, I look forward to returning to the \nconsideration of S. 2663, the Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform \nAct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/04/senate-section/article/S1519-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1519-S1520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COLLOQUES REGARDING H.R. 6\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have been asked about the timing of the \ncolloquy that I entered into with Senators Inouye and Feinstein on \nDecember 13, 2007, during consideration of H.R. 6, the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act of 2007.\n  Immediately prior to the vote on cloture, on the motion to concur \nwith an amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the \ntext of H.R. 6, I was recognized on the Senate floor and requested and \nobtained consent ``that a colloquy between myself, Senator Inouye and \nSenator Feinstein be inserted in the record at this point.''\n  Agreement among the three of us on the content of that colloquy was \ncritical to both my vote for cloture and my later vote for final \npassage, as I indicated in my own statement prior to final passage that \nwas submitted later in the day. The colloquy between Senator Inouye, \nSenator Feinstein, and me read in its entirety, as follows:\n\n                   NHTSA Regulations on Fuel Economy\n\n       Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support this bill and, in \n     particular, the provisions that require the Department of \n     Transportation, through the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration, NHTSA, to set new fuel economy standards for \n     vehicles that will reach an industry fleet wide level of 35 \n     miles per gallon by 2020 based on my understanding that these \n     new Federal standards will not be undercut in the future by \n     regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency \n     regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles.\n       I believe that we have taken historic steps in this \n     legislation by putting in place ambitious but achievable fuel \n     economy standards that will reduce our Nation's fuel \n     consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In this \n     legislation, the Senate and House have come together and \n     established the appropriate level of fuel economy standards \n     and have directed NHTSA to implement that through new \n     regulations. In this legislation, the Congress has agreed \n     that the appropriate level of fuel economy to reach is 35 \n     miles per gallon in 2020, or an increase of 10 miles per \n     gallon in 10 years.\n       But it is essential to manufacturers that they are able to \n     plan on the 35 miles per gallon standard in 2020. We must \n     resolve now with the sponsors of this legislation in the \n     Senate any ambiguity that could arise in the future when EPA \n     issues new rules to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from \n     vehicles pursuant to its authority under the Clean Air Act so \n     that our manufacturers can have certainty. With that in mind, \n     I want to clarify both Senator Inouye's and Senator \n     Feinstein's understanding and interpretation of what the \n     Congress is doing in this legislation and to clarify their \n     agreement that we want all Federal regulations in this area \n     to be consistent. We do not want to enact this legislation \n     today only to find later that we have not been sufficiently \n     diligent to avoid any conflicts in the future.\n       The Environmental Protection Agency has authority under the \n     Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from \n     vehicles and to delegate that authority, as the agency deems \n     appropriate, to the State of California. This authority was \n     recently upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, and it is not our \n     purpose today to attempt to change that authority or to \n     undercut the decision of the Supreme Court. We simply want to \n     make clear that it is Congressional intent in this bill that, \n     with respect to regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, any \n     future regulations issued by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles be \n     consistent with the Department of Transportation's new fuel \n     economy regulations that will reach an industry fleet wide \n     level by 35 miles per gallon by 2020.\n       Does the Senator from California and original sponsor of \n     this legislation, Mrs. Feinstein, agree with my view that the \n     intent of this language is for EPA regulations on greenhouse \n     gas emissions from vehicles to be consistent with the \n     direction of Congress in this 35 miles per gallon in 2020 \n     legislation and consistent with regulations issued by the \n     Department of Transportation to implement this legislation?\n       Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, of course, we have worked hard to come \n     together on this legislation directing NHTSA to issue new \n     fuel economy regulations to reach an industry fleet wide \n     level of 35 miles per gallon by 2020, and it is our intent in \n     the bill before us that all Federal regulations in this area \n     be consistent with our 35 miles per gallon in 2020 language.\n       Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator for her clarification of her \n     intent.\n       Does the chairman of the Commerce Committee, the \n     distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, agree with my \n     understanding of the intent of this bill that any regulations \n     issued by the Environmental Protection Agency be consistent \n     with the direction of Congress in this legislation and \n     regulations issued by the Department of Transportation to \n     implement this legislation?\n       Mr. INOUYE. Yes. I agree that it is very important that all \n     Federal regulations in this area be consistent and that we \n     provide clear direction to the agency that has responsibility \n     for setting fuel economy standards, the Department of \n     Transportation.\n       Mr. LEVIN. I thank my distinguished colleague from Hawaii, \n     Mr. Inouye, for his clarification.\n\n  With the colloquy accepted and placed in the Congressional Record, I \nvoted to invoke cloture. Sometime after the vote on cloture, later in \nthe day, a separate colloquy between Senator Feinstein and Senator \nInouye was inserted in the Congressional Record. It was placed in the \nRecord immediately following the Levin-Feinstein-\n\n[[Page S1520]]\n\nInouye colloquy, quoted above, although it was, in fact, presented for \ninclusion in the Record at a later point in the day, as noted by \nSenator Inouye in the second sentence of the Inouye-Feinstein colloquy. \nTheir colloquy reads as follows:\n\n                           Agency Management\n\n       Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I have worked for many months \n     with the Senior Senator from California and the original \n     sponsor of this legislation, Mrs. Feinstein, to draft a sound \n     policy to increase fuel economy standards in our country. I \n     stated earlier today that ``all Federal regulations in this \n     area be consistent.'' I wholly agree with that notion, in \n     that these agencies have two different missions. The \n     Department of Transportation has the responsibility for \n     regulating fuel economy, and should enforce the Ten-in-Ten \n     Fuel Economy Act fully and vigorously to save oil in the \n     automobile fleet. The Environmental Protection Agency has the \n     responsibility to protect public health. These two missions \n     can and should co-exist without one undermining the other. \n     There are numerous examples in the executive branch where two \n     or more agencies share responsibility over a particular \n     issue. The Federal Trade Commission and the Federal \n     Communications Commission both oversee telemarketing \n     practices and the Do-Not-Call list.\n       The FTC also shares jurisdiction over antitrust enforcement \n     with the Department of Justice. Under the current CAFE \n     system, the Department of Transportation and the \n     Environmental Protection Agency work together. DOT enforces \n     the CAFE standards, and the EPA tests vehicles for compliance \n     and fuel economy labels on cars. The President himself \n     foresaw these agencies working together and issued an \n     Executive Order on May 14, 2007, to coordinate the agencies \n     on reducing automotive greenhouse gas emissions. The DOT and \n     the EPA have separate missions that should be executed fully \n     and responsibly. I believe it is important that we ensure \n     that the agencies are properly managed by the executive \n     branch, as has been done with several agencies with shared \n     jurisdiction for decades. I plan on holding hearings next \n     session to examine this issue fully.\n       Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to thank the chairman of the \n     Commerce Committee, and I would like to clarify what I \n     believe to be the intent of the legislation I sponsored to \n     increase fuel economy standards in the United States.\n       The legislation increasing the fuel economy standards of \n     vehicles by 10 miles per gallon over 10 years does not impact \n     the authority to regulate tailpipe emissions of the EPA, \n     California, or other States, under the Clean Air Act.\n       The intent was to give NHTSA the ability to regulate fuel \n     efficiency standards of vehicles, and increase the fleetwide \n     average to at least 35 miles per gallon by 2020.\n       There was no intent in any way, shape, or form to \n     negatively affect, or otherwise restrain, California or any \n     other State's existing or future tailpipe emissions laws, or \n     any future EPA authority on tailpipe emissions.\n       The two issues are separate and distinct.\n       As the Supreme Court correctly observed in Massachusetts v. \n     EPA, the fact ``that DOT sets mileage standards in no way \n     licenses EPA to shirk its environmental responsibilities. EPA \n     has been charged with protecting the public's health and \n     welfare, a statutory obligation wholly independent of DOT's \n     mandate to promote energy efficiency. The two obligations may \n     overlap, but there is no reason to think the two agencies \n     cannot both administer their obligations and yet avoid \n     inconsistency.''\n       I agree with the Supreme Court's view of consistency. There \n     is no reason to think the two agencies cannot both administer \n     their obligations and yet avoid inconsistency.\n       The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \n     California in Central Valley Chrysler-Jeep v. Goldstone has \n     reiterated this point in finding that if approved by EPA, \n     California's standards are not preempted by the Energy Policy \n     Conservation Act.\n       Title I of the Energy Security and Independence Act of \n     2007, H.R. 6, provides clear direction to the Department of \n     Transportation, in consultation with the Department of Energy \n     and the Environmental Protection Agency, to raise fuel \n     economy standards.\n       By taking this action, Congress is continuing DOT's \n     existing authority to set vehicle fuel economy standards. \n     Importantly, the separate authority and responsibility of the \n     U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate vehicle \n     greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act is in no \n     manner affected by this legislation as plainly provided for \n     in section 3 of the bill addressing the relationship of H.R. \n     6 to other laws.\n       I fought for section 3. I have resisted all efforts to add \n     legislative language requiring ``harmonization'' of these EPA \n     and NHTSA standards. This language could have required that \n     EPA standards adopted under section 202 of the Clean Air Act \n     reduce only the air pollution emissions that would already \n     result from NHTSA fuel economy standards, effectively making \n     the NHTSA fuel economy standards a national ceiling for the \n     reduction of pollution. Our legislation does not establish a \n     NHTSA ceiling. It does not mention the Clean Air Act, so we \n     certainly do not intend to strip EPA of its wholly separate \n     mandate to protect the public health and welfare from air \n     pollution.\n       To be clear, Federal standards can avoid inconsistency \n     according to the Supreme Court, while still fulfilling their \n     separate mandates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/04/senate-section/article/S1520-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL SPORTSMANSHIP DAY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today marks the 18th annual National \nSportsmanship Day. This initiative, the largest of its kind in the \nworld, is a program of the Institute for International Sport based at \nthe University of Rhode Island. Since 1991, the program has promoted \nthe highest ideals of sportsmanship and fair play among not only the \nyoung people of Rhode Island but also among youth in every other State \nand, indeed, around the world. This year alone over 7 million children \nin more than 14,000 schools throughout the United States and countries \nas diverse as Ghana, Nigeria, India, Australia, and Bermuda, will \ncelebrate National Sportsmanship Day.\n  Our appreciation of sports is deep-rooted. The ancient Greeks, for \nexample, recognized ``a sound mind in a sound body'' as the foundation \nof a good education. But a complete individual not only develops the \nmind and body, he or she also develops and exhibits fairness and \nhonesty, key elements of sportsmanship.\n  This year, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the famed Olympic Gold medalist, \nserves as chair of the National Sportsmanship Day program. She and the \nprogram's founder, Dan Doyle, remain committed to the goal of making \nsports a more positive force in society. They hope to achieve their \nobjective by focusing this year on improving parental involvement in \nathletics, encouraging parents to be good sports on the sidelines so \nthey can be good models of ethical behavior for their children.\n  I am proud that Rhode Island is the home base of this program, and I \nhope it enjoys continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/04/senate-section/article/S1520-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1520-S1521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHNNIE CARR\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is with sadness that today I note the \nloss of a great American and a hero of the civil rights movement, Mrs. \nJohnnie Carr.\n  Mrs. Carr passed away in Montgomery on February 22, 2008, at the age \nof 97, but her lifelong struggle for equality in America will be an \ninspiration for many years to come.\n  I had the great privilege to know Mrs. Carr personally. I was always \nstruck by her deep faith and commitment to improving our State. She was \nan independent thinker, and her remarkable strength served her well as \na leader.\n  Mrs. Carr lived all her life in Montgomery, where she was a foot \nsoldier in the fight for equality. She was a founding member of the \nMontgomery Improvement Association, an organization that proved \ninstrumental in the important civil rights events in Alabama during the \n1950s and 1960s.\n  Carr was the schoolmate, friend, and partner of Rosa Parks, who was \nthe recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal and who was honored, 2 \nyears ago, by having her body lie in honor in the Rotunda of the U.S. \nCapitol.\n  Fred Gray, lawyer for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and author of \n``Bus Ride to Justice,'' a valuable history of the civil rights \nmovement in Alabama, points out that Johnnie Carr was one of the \norganizers of the bus protest. Gray eloquently notes that her boycott \n``Set in motion the modern civil rights movement and gave birth to a \nworld leader, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a future Nobel Peace Prize \nLaureate.'' That protest succeeded as a result of unified African-\nAmerican community leaders like Johnnie Carr.\n  Later, in 1964, Carr became the lead plaintiff in the historic school \ndesegregation case, Carr v. the Montgomery Board of Education, a \nvictory for color-blind public education and one of many important \ncases heard by U.S. District Judge Frank M. Johnson. Indeed, this case \nwas the first time that the U.S. Supreme Court approved ``quotas, \ngoals, and time-tables'' as corrections for past discrimination, Gray \nwrites.\n  She committed her entire life to equality and her faith, which \nprovided her the courage to make a difference.\n  It is fitting that Mrs. Carr followed Dr. King as president of the \nMontgomery Improvement Association. For more than four decades she led \ncampaigns to promote voter registration and integrate public \nfacilities.\n\n[[Page S1521]]\n\n  Always a strong leader, Mrs. Carr promoted cooperation and consensus \nduring a difficult period in our Nation's history. She reached across \nracial lines to promote positive change for Alabama, serving as both an \nactive member of Hall Street Baptist Church and as a missionary for the \nMontgomery Antioch District.\n  Many individuals and organizations have recognized Mrs. Carr's long \nhistory of leadership and advocacy. It is a privilege to lend my voice \nto the choir of those who have honored the spirit and dedication of \nthis American hero.

A bill to improve the protections afforded under Federal law \nto consumers from contaminated seafood by directing the Secretary of \nCommerce to establish a program, in coordination with other appropriate \nFederal agencies, to strengthen activities for ensuring that seafood \nsold or offered for sale to the public in or affecting interstate \ncommerce is fit for human consumption; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Commercial \nSeafood Consumer Protection Act. I am joined by Senator Stevens, the \nVice Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee. I thank him for his work on this important issue.\n  The average American eats approximately 16 pounds of fish and \nshellfish each year. Given this fact, it is essential that Americans \nhave confidence in the safety and quality of the seafood they consume. \nYet just last year, Americans faced news reports of tainted seafood \nimports reaching their kitchen tables. The Commercial Seafood Consumer \nProtection Act will help prevent such contaminated seafood from ever \nreaching the mouths of consumers.\n  The Commercial Seafood Consumer Protection Act would work to ensure \nthat commercially distributed seafood in the United States is fit for \nhuman consumption by strengthening the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration's, NOAA, fee-for-service seafood inspection program, \nSIP. Specifically, the bill would increase the number and capacity of \nNOAA laboratories that are involved with the SIP under the National \nMarine Fisheries Service.\n  The bill would further direct the Secretary of Commerce and the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to work together to create an \ninfrastructure that provides a better system for importing safe \nseafood. This new system would provide a means to inspect foreign \nfacilities, and examine and test imported seafood. It would also \nprovide technical assistance and training to foreign facilities and \ngovernments.

A bill to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and \nDepartment of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 to provide \nenhanced agricultural input into Federal rulemakings, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that I call \nthe Farm Red Tape Reduction Act.\n  This act will give farmers a voice in Federal rulemakings whenever a \nnew Federal regulation threatens to impose severe economic pain on \nfarmers.\n  As we saw with small businesses, many times the Government overlooks \nthe plight of the little guy, who does not have the resources or know-\nhow to weigh-in with big Government agencies in Washington. In 1976, \nCongress created the Office of Advocacy to ensure that small businesses \nhave an advocate in Government and a seat at the table when new \nregulations affecting them are drafted. I want to share that same \nsuccess now with farmers.\n  The idea is simple. This act would help provide a more transparent \nGovernment that listens to the people most affected by the regulations. \nIt will hold the Government more accountable for its actions. It is a \nmessage that the Federal Government is meant to serve to its citizens, \nnot bully them. We want to make this an easy process. Citizens should \nbe heard while the Government is deciding on a regulation that affects \nthem--not after the decision is made. The difference is subtle, but \nimportant. Listen to farmers and agriculture first--be inclusive.\n  Cutting unnecessary red tape will provide greater flexibility for \nagriculture businesses by removing barriers to enterprise. Encouraging \nenterprise is essential if the United States is to compete in a global \nenvironment.\n  Farms and other agricultural businesses will benefit from simplified \nrules.\n  This measure will help in cutting red tape with a view to improving \nthe environment for agricultural business. My experience on the Small \nBusiness Committee tells me that there are currently dozens of \nregulatory proposals before Federal agencies--but most without a true \nassessment of impact on the very people they will most affect.\n  The question we must ask ourselves is this: Are all these initiatives \nnecessary and what are the consequences? I want agencies to look into \nthis question. The best way to do that is to hear from the folks most \naffected.\n  The Office of Advocacy celebrated its 30th anniversary this year. The \nRegulatory Flexibility Act, RFA, is 27 years old and the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, SBREFA, is 11 years old.\n  The common theme: They have all gone a long way in making agencies \naware of the unique concerns of small business. With the passage of \nthese laws small business concerns were given a voice at the table, \nthey have been putting that voice to use ever since--with great \nsuccess.\n  These laws have been successful. Early intervention and improved \ncompliance have led to less burdensome regulations. For example, in \nfiscal year 2001, involvement in agency rulemakings helped save small \nbusinesses an estimated $4.4 billion in new regulatory compliance \ncosts.\n  Similarly, in fiscal year 2002, efforts to improve agency compliance \nwith the RFA on behalf of small entities secured more than $21 billion \nin first-year cost savings, with an additional $10 billion in annually \nrecurring cost savings. Most recently, in fiscal year 2003, they \nachieved more than $6.3 billion in regulatory cost savings and more \nthan $5.7 billion in recurring annual savings on behalf of small \nentities.\n  If we can add farmers to the table and save them any portion of that \nkind of money--just that fact will make this bill a success.\n  Just as important is that these laws have not hindered the \ndevelopment of regulations. In fact, these laws are credited with \nhelping regulators come up with better plans. Plans that work--because \nthe people who will be regulated are involved in the development of the \nrules. This gives them some ownership and that makes successful \ncompliance and implementation.\n  Our economy and the lives of farmers is constantly changing--this is \ndue in no small part to what we are doing today--making changes to farm \nlegislation, new technologies, new trade deals, new regulations of \nevery kind being implemented year round. This creates new and constant \nchallenges for analyzing regulatory impacts on farmers. If there was \never a time farmers needed a voice at the table when new regulations \nare made--it is now.\n  It is not my intention to throw out regulations simply as a matter of \nprinciple if, for example, they involve costs for businesses. I am more \nconcerned with obtaining solid impact analyses that can serve as a \nbasis for informed decision-making.\n  It is also quite clear that better regulations will be possible only \nif those affected also play their part, since it is they who will be \nresponsible for implementation.\n  What I have heard from some who oppose this, is that they are \nconcerned about the burden of red tape. However, they are not concerned \nabout the burden of red tape on farmers. They are concerned about the \nburden of red tape on Washington regulators working to impose red tape \non farmers.\n  Surely the Senate should be more concerned with red tape on our \nfarmers than red tape on our Washington regulators. We should have a \nrulemaking advocate for farmers just as we have one at Small Business \nAdministration for small businesses. Advocates do not have the power to \nchange standards or stop regulations, only inform them. We should all \nsupport a more informed process so burdens are reduced and regulations \nare more effective and widely supported. We all know what having a USDA \nrulemaking advocate means in Washington; there will still be 20 \nofficials from other agencies in the room working to regulate farmers. \nBut now, there may be one from USDA also in the room.\n  This bill has received support from the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, the National \nCotton Council, the American Soybean Association, National Milk \nProducers Federation, South East Dairy Farmers Association, National \nAssociation of Wheat Growers, USA Rice Federation, Western United \nDairymen, and the National Pork Producers Council.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bill and join me in helping \nfarmers and agricultural business reduce unnecessary bureaucratic red \ntape by including them at the table.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2691\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 470\n\n       Whereas armed groups have been moving freely among Sudan, \n     Chad, and the Central African Republic, committing murder, \n     banditry, forced recruitment, mass displacement, gender-based \n     violence, and other crimes that are contributing to \n     insecurity and instability throughout the region, \n     exacerbating the humanitarian crises in these countries and \n     obstructing efforts to end violence in the Darfur region of \n     Sudan and adjacent areas;\n       Whereas, on February 2, 2008, rebels stormed the capital of \n     Chad, N'Djamena, in their second coup attempt in two years, \n     prompting clashes with forces loyal to President of Chad \n     Idriss Deby that caused more than 100 civilian deaths, \n     thousands of displacements, and an estimated 10,000 refugees \n     from Chad to seek refuge in neighboring Cameroon;\n       Whereas, on February 2, 2008, the United States Embassy in \n     N'Djamena was forced to evacuate employees' families and all \n     nonemergency staff and urged United States citizens to defer \n     all travel to Chad;\n       Whereas, on February 2, 2008, the United States Government \n     condemned the armed attack on N'Djamena and expressed \n     ``support [for] the [African Union]'s call for an immediate \n     end to armed attacks and to refrain from violence that might \n     harm innocent civilians'';\n       Whereas, on February 12, 2008, the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that recent \n     offensives by the Government of Sudan in Darfur have prompted \n     up to 12,000 new refugees to flee to neighboring Chad, where \n     the UNHCR and its partners are already struggling to take \n     care of 240,000 refugees from Sudan in eastern Chad and some \n     50,000 refugees from the Central African Republic in southern \n     Chad;\n       Whereas cross-border attacks by alleged Arab militias from \n     Sudan and related inter-communal ethnic hostilities in \n     eastern Chad have also resulted in the displacement of an \n     estimated 170,000 people from Chad in the region, adding to \n     the humanitarian need;\n       Whereas there have been allegations and evidence in both \n     Chad and Sudan of government support for dissident rebel \n     militias in each other's country, in direct violation of the \n     Tripoli Declaration of February 8, 2006, and the N'Djamena \n     Agreement of July 26, 2006;\n       Whereas, on January 16, 2008, the United Nations' \n     Humanitarian Coordinator for the Central African Republic \n     reported that waves of violence across the north of that \n     country have left more than 1,000,000 people in need of \n     humanitarian assistance, including 150,000 who are internally \n     displaced, while some 80,000 have fled to neighboring Chad or \n     Cameroon;\n       Whereas, since late 2007, arrests, disappearances, and \n     harassment of journalists, human rights defenders, and \n     opposition leaders-- particularly those reporting on military \n     operations and human rights conditions in eastern Chad-- \n     mirror the repressive crackdown in the aftermath of an attack \n     on N'Djamena in April 2006, and conditions have only worsened \n     since the February 2008 attempted coup;\n       Whereas, on September 27, 2007, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Security Council Resolution 1778 (2007), \n     authorizing a limited United Nations peacekeeping mission \n     (MINURCAT) and a concurrent European-led force (EUFOR), which \n     is permitted to ``take all necessary measures'' to protect \n     refugees, civilians, and aid workers in eastern Chad and \n     northern Central African Republic;\n       Whereas, despite the explicit support of President Deby, \n     deployment of both the 3,700 EUFOR troops and the 350 \n     MINURCAT officers has been hampered by political and security \n     delays as well as insufficient resources; and\n       Whereas continuing hostilities will undermine efforts to \n     bring security to Sudan's Darfur region, dangerously \n     destabilize volatile political and humanitarian situations in \n     Chad and the Central African Republic, and potentially \n     disrupt progress towards peace in southern Sudan: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses the concern and compassion of the citizens of \n     the United States for the hundreds of thousands of citizens \n     of Sudan, Chad, and the Central African Republic who have \n     been gravely affected by this interrelated violence and \n     instability;\n       (2) calls upon all parties to these conflicts to cease \n     hostilities immediately and uphold basic human rights;\n       (3) urges the governments of Chad and Sudan, with support \n     from other key regional and international stakeholders, \n     including France, Libya, and China, to commit to another \n     round of inclusive negotiations towards a sustainable \n     political solution for national and regional stability \n     facilitated and monitored by impartial third-party \n     leadership;\n       (4) calls upon the governments of Chad and Sudan to \n     reaffirm their commitment to the Tripoli Declaration of \n     February 8, 2006, and the N'Djamena Agreement of July 26, \n     2006, refrain from any actions that violate these agreements, \n     and cease all logistical, financial, and military support to \n     insurgent groups;\n       (5) urges the Government of Chad to increase political \n     participation, strengthen democratic institutions, respect \n     human rights, improve accountability and transparency as well \n     as the provision of basic services, and uphold its commitment \n     to protect its own citizens in order to redeem the legitimacy \n     of the Government in the eyes of its citizens and the \n     international community;\n       (6) calls for diplomatic and material support from the \n     United States and the international community to facilitate, \n     implement, and monitor a comprehensive peace process that \n     includes an inclusive dialogue with all relevant stakeholders \n     to end violence, demobilize militias, and promote return and \n     reconstruction for internally displaced persons and refugees; \n     and\n       (7) encourages the United States Government and the \n     international community to provide immediate and ongoing \n     support for the multilateral peacekeeping missions in Darfur, \n     eastern Chad, and the northern Central African Republic, \n     along with adequate assistance to meet the continuing \n     humanitarian and security needs of the individuals and areas \n     most affected by these interrelated conflicts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/04/senate-section/article/S1530-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 471--DESIGNATING MARCH 1, 2008, AS ``NATIONAL \n               GLANZMANN'S THROMBASTHENIA AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON (for himself, Mrs. Murray, and Ms. Klobuchar) submitted \nthe following resolution;

Res. 472\n\n       Whereas it has been almost 7 years since the horrific \n     terrorist attacks against the United States and its people on \n     September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas al-Qaeda and affiliated or inspired terrorist \n     groups remain committed to plotting attacks against the \n     United States, its interests, and its foreign allies, as \n     evidenced by recent terrorist attacks in Great Britain, \n     Algeria, and Pakistan, and disrupted plots in Germany, \n     Denmark, Canada, and the United States;\n       Whereas the Nation remains vulnerable to catastrophic \n     natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, which \n     devastated the Gulf Coast in August 2005;\n       Whereas the President has declared more than 400 major \n     disasters and emergencies under the Robert T. Stafford \n     Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act since 2000, in \n     response to a host of natural disasters, including tornadoes, \n     floods, winter storms, and wildfires that have overwhelmed \n     the capabilities of State and local governments;\n       Whereas acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other \n     large-scale emergencies can exact a tragic human toll, \n     resulting in significant numbers of casualties and disrupting \n     hundreds of thousands of lives, causing serious damage to the \n     Nation's critical infrastructure, and inflicting billions of \n     dollars of costs on both the public and private sectors;\n       Whereas in response to the attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     and the continuing risk to the Nation from a full range of \n     potential catastrophic incidents, Congress established the \n     Department of Homeland Security on March 1, 2003, bringing \n     together 22 disparate Federal entities, enhancing their \n     capabilities with major new divisions emphasizing information \n     analysis, infrastructure protection, and science and \n     technology, and focusing its more than 200,000 employees on \n     the critical mission of defending the Nation against acts of \n     terrorism, natural disasters, and other large-scale \n     emergencies;\n       Whereas since its creation, the employees of the Department \n     of Homeland Security have endeavored to carry out this \n     mission with commendable dedication, working with other \n     Federal departments and agencies and partners at all levels \n     of government to help secure the Nation's borders, airports, \n     sea and inland ports, critical infrastructure, and people \n     against acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other \n     large-scale emergencies;\n       Whereas the Nation's firefighters, law enforcement \n     officers, emergency medical services personnel, and other \n     emergency response providers selflessly and repeatedly risk \n     their lives to fulfill their mission to help prevent, protect \n     against, prepare for, and respond to acts of terrorism, \n     natural disasters, and other large-scale emergencies;\n       Whereas State, local, territorial, and tribal government \n     officials, the private sector, and ordinary individuals \n     across the country have been working in cooperation with the \n     Department of Homeland Security and other Federal departments \n     and agencies to enhance the Nation's ability to prevent, \n     protect against, prepare for, and respond to natural \n     disasters, acts of terrorism, and other large-scale \n     emergencies; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States can assist in \n     promoting the Nation's overall preparedness by remaining \n     vigilant, reporting suspicious activity to proper \n     authorities, and preparing themselves and their families for \n     all emergencies, regardless of their cause: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the \n     establishment of the Department of Homeland Security, \n     commends the public servants of the Department for their \n     outstanding contributions to the Nation's security and \n     safety;\n       (2) salutes the dedication of State, local, territorial, \n     and tribal government officials, the private sector, and \n     individuals across the country for their efforts to enhance \n     the Nation's ability to prevent, protect against, prepare \n     for, and respond to acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and \n     other large-scale emergencies;\n       (3) expresses the Nation's appreciation for the sacrifices \n     and commitment of law enforcement, fire service, and \n     emergency medical services personnel, emergency managers, and \n     other emergency response providers in preventing, protecting \n     against, preparing for, and responding to acts of terrorism, \n     natural disasters, and other large-scale emergencies;\n       (4) urges the Federal Government, States, local \n     governments, Indian tribes, schools, nonprofit organizations, \n     businesses, other entities, and the people of the United \n     States to take steps that promote individual and community \n     preparedness for any emergency, regardless of its cause;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of S. Res. 472 submitted earlier today \nby Senator Lieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 472) commending the employees of the \n     Department of Homeland Security, their partners at all levels \n     of government, and the millions of law enforcement, fire \n     service, and emergency medical services personnel, emergency \n     managers, and other emergency response providers nationwide \n     for their dedicated service in protecting the people of the \n     United States and the Nation from acts of terrorism, natural \n     disasters, and other large-scale emergencies.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Lieberman in \nsupport of S. Res. 472, commending the employees of the Department of \nHomeland Security on the Department's fifth anniversary, and honoring \ntheir partners at all levels of Government, the private sector, and the \nmillions of men and women in law enforcement, the fire service, \nemergency-medical services, and other emergency-response professions \nwho risk their lives to protect us.\n  Five years ago, on March 1, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security \ncommenced operations as a new organizational umbrella over 22 federal \nagencies and with new responsibilities for developing and coordinating \nan integrated, all-hazards approach to planning for, mitigating \nagainst, responding to, and recovering from major disasters.\n  Creating DHS was a critical part of our national response to the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. We are safer today because of \nthe work of the Department's dedicated employees and because of their \nsupport and coordination with State, local, tribal, and non-profit \nagencies with emergency-management, prevention, and response \nresponsibilities.\n  The Department was severely tested in the Hurricane Katrina \ncatastrophe of 2005, and extensive investigation by the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs identified serious flaws in \nthe Department's response. But, spurred by legislation that Senator \nLieberman and I authored in 2006, the Department has taken significant \nstrides in improving its response and recovery capabilities. The \nDepartment's responses to recent disasters, such as the wildfires in \nCalifornia, the Patriots' Day storm in Maine, and the\n\n[[Page S1547]]\n\nrecent tornadoes in the South, visibly demonstrate these improvements.\n  The task of integrating the 22 agencies and more than 200,000 \nemployees that compose the Department has not always gone smoothly. As \nthe Government Accountability Office justly observed in a progress \nreport on DHS last summer, however, ``successful transformations of \nlarge organizations, even those faced with less strenuous \nreorganizations than DHS, can take 5 to 7 years to achieve.'' The \nDepartment has made significant progress. Congress must help it make \nmore.\n  On this noteworthy anniversary, I salute the men and women of DHS and \nall of their partners who protect our borders, transportation hubs, \ncritical infrastructure, seaports, and--above all--our people. This \nSenate resolution is a small but heartfelt expression of our gratitude, \nour respect, and our commitment to the future of this Department.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 472) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 472\n\n       Whereas it has been almost 7 years since the horrific \n     terrorist attacks against the United States and its people on \n     September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas al-Qaeda and affiliated or inspired terrorist \n     groups remain committed to plotting attacks against the \n     United States, its interests, and its foreign allies, as \n     evidenced by recent terrorist attacks in Great Britain, \n     Algeria, and Pakistan, and disrupted plots in Germany, \n     Denmark, Canada, and the United States;\n       Whereas the Nation remains vulnerable to catastrophic \n     natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, which \n     devastated the Gulf Coast in August 2005;\n       Whereas the President has declared more than 400 major \n     disasters and emergencies under the Robert T. Stafford \n     Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act since 2000, in \n     response to a host of natural disasters, including tornadoes, \n     floods, winter storms, and wildfires that have overwhelmed \n     the capabilities of State and local governments;\n       Whereas acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other \n     large-scale emergencies can exact a tragic human toll, \n     resulting in significant numbers of casualties and disrupting \n     hundreds of thousands of lives, causing serious damage to the \n     Nation's critical infrastructure, and inflicting billions of \n     dollars of costs on both the public and private sectors;\n       Whereas in response to the attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     and the continuing risk to the Nation from a full range of \n     potential catastrophic incidents, Congress established the \n     Department of Homeland Security on March 1, 2003, bringing \n     together 22 disparate Federal entities, enhancing their \n     capabilities with major new divisions emphasizing information \n     analysis, infrastructure protection, and science and \n     technology, and focusing its more than 200,000 employees on \n     the critical mission of defending the Nation against acts of \n     terrorism, natural disasters, and other large-scale \n     emergencies;\n       Whereas since its creation, the employees of the Department \n     of Homeland Security have endeavored to carry out this \n     mission with commendable dedication, working with other \n     Federal departments and agencies and partners at all levels \n     of government to help secure the Nation's borders, airports, \n     sea and inland ports, critical infrastructure, and people \n     against acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other \n     large-scale emergencies;\n       Whereas the Nation's firefighters, law enforcement \n     officers, emergency medical services personnel, and other \n     emergency response providers selflessly and repeatedly risk \n     their lives to fulfill their mission to help prevent, protect \n     against, prepare for, and respond to acts of terrorism, \n     natural disasters, and other large-scale emergencies;\n       Whereas State, local, territorial, and tribal government \n     officials, the private sector, and ordinary individuals \n     across the country have been working in cooperation with the \n     Department of Homeland Security and other Federal departments \n     and agencies to enhance the Nation's ability to prevent, \n     protect against, prepare for, and respond to natural \n     disasters, acts of terrorism, and other large-scale \n     emergencies; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States can assist in \n     promoting the Nation's overall preparedness by remaining \n     vigilant, reporting suspicious activity to proper \n     authorities, and preparing themselves and their families for \n     all emergencies, regardless of their cause: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the \n     establishment of the Department of Homeland Security, \n     commends the public servants of the Department for their \n     outstanding contributions to the Nation's security and \n     safety;\n       (2) salutes the dedication of State, local, territorial, \n     and tribal government officials, the private sector, and \n     individuals across the country for their efforts to enhance \n     the Nation's ability to prevent, protect against, prepare \n     for, and respond to acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and \n     other large-scale emergencies;\n       (3) expresses the Nation's appreciation for the sacrifices \n     and commitment of law enforcement, fire service, and \n     emergency medical services personnel, emergency managers, and \n     other emergency response providers in preventing, protecting \n     against, preparing for, and responding to acts of terrorism, \n     natural disasters, and other large-scale emergencies;\n       (4) urges the Federal Government, States, local \n     governments, Indian tribes, schools, nonprofit organizations, \n     businesses, other entities, and the people of the United \n     States to take steps that promote individual and community \n     preparedness for any emergency, regardless of its cause;
