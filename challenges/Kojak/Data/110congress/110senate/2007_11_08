It is lonely and often windy where they live. The \nexpectations are impossible to meet, problems too vast to completely \novercome, requests for action endless, and opportunities to be loved \nfar too infrequent. No one knows what it is like to walk the road which \nthey walk. No one knows the personal sacrifices they have made. No one \nknows the burdens they carry. But You do, and I ask that You might come \nup underneath them on that road and carry those burdens with them. Let \nthem know of Your enduring presence and the counsel of Your great \nwisdom. May these men and women--those viewed by many as the powerful \nof the Earth--yield to Your great power that they might serve humbly, \nfaithfully, and effectively on behalf of the people of this Nation.\n  Bless us, we pray, in the Name of Jesus Christ.

Mr. President, before I turn to the Senator from Florida, I \nwish to say that I sit through these prayers every day. It is really \ngood for me to do that. But the words that were uttered by Dr. Swanson \nthis morning, as Johnny Cash says in that song, ``you've been reading \nmy mail'' were really important to me, and I am sure every Senator \nlistening to this prayer felt the same way I did. I am going to get a \ncopy of that prayer and read it once in a while because he was talking \nabout me when he gave that prayer and talking about Senator Nelson, \nSenator Baucus, and all of us.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, he was talking about all of us \nin lifting the burdens and the burdens we gladly bear. The pastor's \nprayer reminded us of our need to have a servant heart, to serve the \nNation.\n  Dr. Swanson is very much a part of our Orlando community. He is my \npersonal pastor, as Grace and I are members of the First Presbyterian \nChurch of Orlando. He is illustrative of the great pastoral leadership \nwe have had in Orlando.\n  A few weeks ago, we had my 30-year friend, the just-retired pastor of \nthe First Baptist Church of Orlando, Jim Henry, here. He is one of the \ngreat leaders of the faith. We have had in this Chamber Rev. Sam Green \nof St. Mark A.M.E. Church, now Bishop Sam Green in a district in South \nAfrica, another one of the great pastors of our region in central \nFlorida. We will be having another one of the great pastors, Rev. \nWillie Barnes of the Baptist Church in Eatonville, FL, another one of \nmy personal friends and one of the great pastors we have been blessed \nto have in our region. What they talk about, as Dr. Swanson said so \neloquently in his prayer, is the unity of what was taught in the \nancient Scriptures and the New Testament; that is, servant leadership. \nThat was so well expressed in the life of Jesus, who was a role model \nas a leader but as a servant leader.\n\n[[Page S14106]]\n\n  We welcome these pastors, and particularly we welcome Dr. Swanson \ntoday to the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period \nfor the transaction of morning business for 1 hour, with the first half \ncontrolled by the majority and the second half controlled by the \nRepublicans. Following morning business, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the veto message on H.R. 1495, the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act. There is 30 minutes of debate on the veto message. \nSenators Boxer and Inhofe will control 7\\1/2\\ minutes each, and the \nother 15 minutes in support of the veto is under the control of the \nRepublican leader or his designee.\n  For planning purposes, Members can expect a rollcall vote on the veto \noverride about 11:40 this morning. As I have indicated, we will vote on \nthe President's veto override. The House of Representatives voted \nyesterday 361 to 54 on the veto override.\n  This is one of the bipartisan measures we have done. We have had \nSenators Boxer and Inhofe working together on legislation, which any \nday should be a day of celebration, and they have worked so hard on \nthis legislation. I am confident Members on both sides of the aisle \nwill support the two managers.\n  Later this afternoon, we will receive the Defense appropriations \nconference report from the House which will include a continuing \nresolution to keep Government agencies funded until the middle of next \nmonth. We hope to reach agreement so we can dispose of that matter \nquickly and send it to the President today. It is essential we do this \nquickly so we can send our men and women in uniform, who have \nsacrificed so much in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world, the \nsupport they deserve. It is about $470 billion.\n  Finally, I have had some discussion with the distinguished Republican \nleader to try to work out an agreement to dispose of the Mukasey \nnomination. I thought I had that all worked out. Last night, a little \nwrinkle appeared, but I hope we can reach agreement on that today as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/08/senate-section/article/S14106-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nDisaster Assistance Program in the farm bill.\n  From the beginning, farming has been hard work. In the Book of \nGenesis, for example, God told Adam:\n\n       [T]hrough painful toil you will eat of [the land] all the \n     days of your life . . . By the sweat of your brow you will \n     eat your food.\n\n  Drought and floods, frost and hail have plagued farmers ever since. \nIt is hard work, yet they stick to it. It is vital work to put food on \nAmerica's table. It has been true since Adam: All farmers suffer \ndisasters. In farming, it is not a matter of if, it is a matter of \nwhen.\n  For example, early this year, Congress passed yet another ad hoc \ndisaster assistance package, and I was proud to back that package. But \nfor some farmers, it was too little; it was too late. Producers are \nstill reeling from disasters that occurred 2 years ago. For some \nproducers who had a disaster in the spring of 2005, assistance will not \ncome until late 2007 or early 2008.\n  Today is November 8, and the regulations for that disaster bill we \npassed in May have not even been published. Yet some Senators are \nalready calling for an extension of that disaster bill through 2007 to \ncover this summer's crops. Unfortunately, if history repeats itself, \nCongress will get around to passing another disaster bill around 2010. \nThis is no way to provide disaster assistance.\n  I wish to show a picture of Dave Henderson's farm in Cut Bank, MT. \nDave is probably one of the best farmers in Montana. Just look at his \nlush field of grain. This is what Dave's wheat and barley fields \ntypically look like. During a normal year, Dave raises about 35 bushels \nof wheat per acre and about 54 bushels of barley per acre. That is \nnormal--35 bushels of wheat and 54 bushels of barley. But 2007 was \nanything but normal for Cut Bank, MT.\n\n  From October 1, 2006, through September 1, 2007, Cut Bank received 2 \ninches of rain. We can see the picture on the left, the result of that \nlack of rain. You don't raise a crop with 2 inches of rain all season.\n  On my right is a picture of a normal year, and on my left is what \nhappens when there is no rain, about 2 inches over most of the growing \nseason. That is all he received.\n  This fall, Dave harvested about 4 bushels of wheat per acre, and his \nbarley averaged about 3 bushels per acre. You cannot pay your bills \nwhen your crop is about 10 percent of normal. How much assistance do \nyou think Dave received from the disaster bill we passed in May? What \ndo you think? The answer is nothing. Why? Because he did not plant \nbefore the February 28 cutoff date. Consider this: If Dave had planted \nwinter wheat instead of spring wheat, he would have received a disaster \npayment. But he didn't. He planted spring wheat instead of winter \nwheat, so he didn't get a disaster payment.\n  Congress can do better for our farmers. Because of Dave and thousands \nof farmers and ranchers across the countryside, I am proud we included \na reliable disaster program in our farm bill. In the future, farmers \nwill know that if they suffer a disaster, help will be on the way. It \nwon't make them rich, but it will help them get by.\n  I am proud and grateful for the support of the disaster program we \nhave in our farm bill, the support it has received from all around the \ncountryside and from a broad range of agricultural groups.\n  I have a letter, which I am showing, from the National Farmers Union \nsigned by over 50 groups from all across our country. This letter is \nsigned by 50 different farm groups. We can see the whole list. I know \nthe print is a bit small: National Farmers Organization, Ohio, Oregon, \nPennsylvania, ARCAF, just to name a few. It is a large group: American \nFarm Bureau, Cape Cod Cranberry Growers, Texas Sheep and Goat Raisers \nAssociation, National Grape Cooperative Association, and the \nIndependent Community Bankers of America.\n  Why bankers? They have just as much at stake as farmers do. They rely \non each other. Bankers will more likely give a loan to a farmer if he \nthinks\n\n[[Page S14107]]\n\nthe farmer is going to have some kind of income with a crop or \nreasonable disaster assistance program. But a banker is less likely to \nprovide that loan if it looks as if that farmer is not going to have \nany income or if there is not a good disaster assistance program, \nassuming if there is hail, drought, or whatnot.\n  I have another letter of support from the National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation representing cattle ranchers all across the country, \nshowing a broad array of support. It is not just farmers but also \nlivestock producers who very much want and support the agricultural \nDisaster Assistance Program that is in the farm bill. These letters \ndemonstrate how important reliable disaster assistance is to all \nsectors of agriculture. It doesn't matter if you are a cattle rancher \nin Montana or a cranberry grower in Cape Cod; when disaster strikes, \nthis program will provide a reliable safety net.\n\n  One more interesting point. In addition to helping farmers, the \ndisaster program in the farm bill is good for taxpayers. The program is \nonly available to farmers who purchase crop insurance, and that is why \nit is also good for taxpayers. Let me explain that a little more.\n  Those farmers who purchase high levels of insurance are eligible for \nmore assistance when they face natural disasters. If you purchase low \nlevels of insurance, you get probably less assistance. The program, \ntherefore, creates a powerful incentive for farmers to purchase high \nlevels of crop insurance and take measures to manage their own risk. \nWhen farmers purchase crop insurance, taxpayers save money on disaster \nassistance.\n  Now, I will put up a chart that shows this a little more graphically, \nby definition. This graph compares the disaster payments made to sample \nMidwestern farms that are under both the ad hoc and new disaster \nprogram. The ad hoc is in blue, and in the disaster program, in the \nfarm bill, the bars are in red. Under the ad hoc disaster bills, \nfarmers' payments would have been about $9,000 for a 75-percent crop \nloss--$9,000 for a 75-percent crop loss--compared to only $3,000 under \nthe new program. If you had a 50-percent crop loss, the ad hoc payment \nwould be $3,400 but, under the new program, $3,300.\n  You might ask: What in the world is going on? Why in the world would \nwe, in our farm bill, provide disaster assistance at the lower level, \nwith a 75-percent crop loss, than in the ad hoc program? As I mentioned \nearlier, it is because of crop insurance. You are more likely to get \nmore assistance when you purchase crop insurance. That is a good thing. \nThat saves taxpayers money because we will be paying out fewer dollars \nunder the disaster program.\n  The program also saves taxpayers money by basing payments on whole-\nfarm losses. In the past, disaster payments were based upon losses to \nindividual units or individual crops on the farm. Farmers were never \nasked if the farm's other units or their crops had bumper harvests. So \nit was based on a unit. One crop disaster got payment in the ad hoc \ndisaster programs, even though your whole farm was doing real well on a \nnet basis. You may have had hail to a small part, but the rest of the \nplace was great. That often happens in my part of the world. That \ndoesn't make sense.\n  So we have changed that disaster assistance based on the whole farm \non a net basis, and I think that is fairer to the taxpayers. The \nprogram will look at all the crops on a farm and only provide \nassistance if the entire farm has suffered a loss. When disaster \npayments are based on whole-farm losses and not individual unit losses, \ntaxpayers save money and assistance is delivered to those who need it \nthe most.\n  In closing, our farmers deserve a disaster program that is \ndependable, that is timely, and is equitable. Our taxpayers also \ndeserve a program that is fiscally sound and requires farmers to manage \ntheir risk; i.e., crop insurance. This disaster program accomplishes \nboth. It is a win for agriculture and it is a win for taxpayers.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to reject any attempt to weaken or cut \nthe disaster program. Farmers such as Dave Henderson deserve better, \nfarmers producing in other parts of the country deserve better, and our \ntaxpayers deserve better.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nfor the Record the letters I referred to earlier.\nThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the \n    Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Cattlemen's\n\n\n                                             Beef Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 1, 2007.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Baucus: On behalf of the National Cattlemen's \n     Beef Association (NCBA), and the farmers and ranchers it \n     represents across the Nation, I am writing to express support \n     for the Permanent Disaster Relief Trust Fund that was \n     approved by the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month \n     as part of the Heartland, Habitat, Harvest and Horticulture \n     Act of 2007 (S. 2242). It takes nearly two years for a cow to \n     produce her first calf, and a significant amount of effort \n     and expense is invested in each breeding animal. For this \n     reason, the impact of natural disasters such as hurricanes, \n     wildfires, tornadoes, blizzards, floods or prolonged drought \n     can be particularly stinging for cattle producers. \n     Appropriate and timely agricultural disaster assistance from \n     the permanent disaster relief program will provide critical \n     assistance to producers when they need it most.\n       In the past, Congress has moved to pass disaster assistance \n     on an ad hoc basis in an effort to help those impacted by \n     catastrophic weather events. It has become abundantly clear, \n     however, that this reactive system of addressing agricultural \n     disasters is no longer an effective or viable means of \n     providing timely aid when it is needed. Producers struggle \n     with difficult management, movement and sale decisions in the \n     midst of a disaster, and the situation is only worsened by \n     the uncertainty that accompanies legislative action. Natural \n     disasters will continue to occur, and NCBA submits that a \n     different approach is needed. While the Permanent Disaster \n     Relief Trust Fund is not perfect, it represents a significant \n     step toward prudent fiscal planning that will serve the \n     interests of both Congress and beef producers.\n       Livestock producers are accustomed to dealing with adverse \n     weather conditions, and most do their best to plan for them. \n     In fact, beef producers have actively sought out measures to \n     mitigate their risk of loss in the case of weather related \n     disasters. An example would be strong producer participation \n     in the Risk Management Agency's (RMA) Pasture, Rangeland and \n     Forage Insurance Pilot Program, which was made available just \n     last year to provide livestock producers in certain \n     geographic areas with a mechanism to insure against losses in \n     forage production. Cattle producers applaud the objectives of \n     this program, and NCBA is committed to working with RMA and \n     others to ensure that workable risk management tools are \n     available to producers.\n       Nevertheless, during periods of extreme and prolonged \n     disaster, access to Federal disaster assistance programs is \n     important to the viability of many livestock operations. In \n     the most devastating instances, when producers have \n     experienced tremendous grazing forage losses or even \n     livestock mortalities, the Permanent Disaster Relief Trust \n     Fund will provide crucial support as producers struggle with \n     additional expenses for supplemental feed, grasslands \n     restoration and herd rebuilding.\n       There will no doubt be challenges in implementing the \n     permanent program, and it is likely that some provisions will \n     need refinement. But, the central tenets of the Permanent \n     Disaster Relief Trust Fund, such as no disincentives for the \n     development and adoption of other insurance and risk \n     management options, eligibility criteria based on actual \n     livestock and/or forage production losses and requirements \n     that any disaster assistance funds are to be directed to only \n     those producers directly impacted by disaster conditions, are \n     a step in the right direction.\n       There is no `silver bullet' solution to addressing \n     agricultural disaster assistance, but NCBA appreciates your \n     efforts on this issue. We look forward to working with you to \n     see the inclusion of this program in the 2007 Farm Bill as it \n     moves through the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   John Queen,\n\n                                                        President,\n     National Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 November 5, 2007.\n     U.S. Senate,\n      Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Each year, weather-related disasters are \n     likely to occur in many communities across the country. While \n     ad hoc assistance has always been appreciated in the past, \n     the 2007 Farm Bill presents an opportunity to establish a \n     predictable program for future disasters. We urge you to \n     support\n\n[[Page S14108]]\n\n     the Supplemental Disaster Assistance Program and oppose any \n     efforts during floor consideration of the 2007 Farm Bill to \n     redirect funds away from the disaster program.\n       According to the Congressional Research Service, 34 ad hoc \n     disaster packages have been approved since fiscal year (FY) \n     1989, totaling $59 billion. Each approved measure requires \n     the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to recreate an \n     implementation plan that often results in new guidelines and \n     sign up requirements. A standing disaster program will ensure \n     a consistent and reliable implementation strategy is in place \n     for any future weather-related disaster. Furthermore, the \n     program works in concert with current risk management \n     programs, such as crop insurance and the Non Insured \n     Assistance Program, by requiring producers to purchase \n     coverage and providing an incentive to purchase higher levels \n     of coverage.\n       Many of our organizations have expressed strong support of \n     ad hoc disaster assistance in the past, but have witnessed \n     the increasing difficulty in securing help. Earlier this \n     year, Congress approved emergency ad hoc disaster assistance \n     for losses that occurred in 2005, 2006 or 2007. \n     Unfortunately, the assistance is just now reaching producers \n     for losses sustained in 2005, which is a long time to wait.\n       Again, we urge you to support the Supplemental Disaster \n     Assistance Program and oppose any efforts to redirect \n     resources to other farm bill programs.\n           Sincerely,\n       Agriculture Committee of the Midwestern Legislative \n     Conference of CSG.\n       American Agriculture Movement.\n       American Association of Crop Insurers.\n       American Beekeeping Federation.\n       American Corn Growers Association.\n       American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       American Sheep Industry Association.\n       American Soybean Association.\n       American Sugar Alliance.\n       California Dairy Campaign.\n       California Farmers Union.\n       Cape Cod Cranberry Growers Association.\n       Colorado Wool Growers Association.\n       Idaho Wool Growers Association.\n       Independent Community Bankers of America.\n       Iowa Farmers Union.\n       Kansas Farmers Union.\n       Maryland Sheep Breeders Association.\n       Michigan Farmers Union.\n       Montana Farmers Union.\n       National Association of Farmer Elected Committees.\n       National Association of State Departments of Agriculture.\n       National Barley Growers Association.\n       National Bison Association.\n       National Cotton Council.\n       National Family Farm Coalition.\n       National Farmers Organization.\n       National Farmers Organization-Wisconsin.\n       National Farmers Union.\n       National Grape Cooperative Association.\n       National Sunflower Association.\n       North Dakota Farmers Union.\n       Northeast States Association for Agricultural Stewardship.\n       Ohio Farmers Union.\n       Oregon Cattlemen's Association.\n       Pennsylvania Farmers Union.\n       R-CALF United Stockgrowers of America.\n       Ricebelt Warehouses.\n       Rocky Mountain Farmers Union.\n       South Dakota Farmers Union.\n       Southern Peanut Farmers Federation.\n       Texas Sheep & Goat Raisers Association.\n       United Dairymen of Arizona.\n       United States Cattlemen's Association.\n       U.S. Canola Association.\n       U.S.A.

Mr. President, I wish to rise and speak on the Water \nResources Development Act, and I wish to, first of all, thank Chairman \nBoxer and Ranking Member Inhofe of the EPW Committee for all the work \nthey have done on the WRDA--Water Resources Development Act--and I wish \nto particularly thank my colleague, Max Baucus, as he is chairman, and \nI am the ranking member of the subcommittee overseeing the Corps of \nEngineers and the Water Resources Development Act. I voted for it on \nthe floor, and today, when the vote comes to override the veto of the \nPresident, I am going to vote to override the veto. I wish to enter \ninto the record today, specifically and candidly and briefly, exactly \nthe reasons why.\n  No. 1, the Water Resources Development Act is an authorization, not \nappropriations. To characterize it as overspending is not correct \nbecause it is the appropriations bill where we do that.\n  No. 2, authorizations set priorities, priorities upon which the \nAppropriations Committee makes decisions based on the money it has and \non where best to spend the resources we have.\n  No. 3, as for the size of the authorization, everyone should know \nthat up until the year 2000, this Senate, and the House on the other \nend of this building, biannually passed Water Resources Development Act \nreauthorizations. We have gone 7 years without prioritizing the Corps \nof Engineers and the water resources of this country.\n  Think about what has happened in those 7 years--Rita and Katrina in \nparticular; from my standpoint, in my State of Georgia, a category 4, \n100-year drought threatening the drinking water of millions and \nmillions of Georgians, North Carolinians, Tennesseans, and Alabamans. \nIn this bill is money for the North Metro Planning District of Georgia, \na consolidation of all the governments in the region, to coordinate \nwater resource development so we can better deal with retention, saving \nwater as it flows downstream so we can have drinking water assurances \nand we can have backup that allows us to assure our citizens when \nanother 100-year drought, category 4 drought comes, that we will have \ndone the planning necessary to deal with it, which right now has not \nbeen done. For this bill to be vetoed is to say no to an imminent \npriority in my State and for tens of millions of people in the \nSoutheast.\n  So while I have complete respect for the President of the United \nStates, and I commend him on so many things and don't like to vote \nagainst him, he is wrong to veto this bill. I will be proud to vote to \noverride that veto because I wish to prioritize infrastructure for our \ncountry on a timely basis; I wish to give the appropriators the \nindications of what we, as a Congress, think are the most needed \nprograms to be appropriated; I wish to deal with the ramifications and \nthe disaster of Katrina and Rita, to see that it doesn't happen again; \nI want the Everglades project to go forward; and I want my State and my \npeople to have the drinking water and the water resources necessary.\n  For us to delay or for us to deny would be wrong. We will have fights \non the appropriations bills over how much money to spend. We should \nnever have a fight on our responsibility to prioritize the needs of our \nStates or the needs of our citizens. I commend Chairman Boxer, I \ncommend Senator Inhofe and Senator Baucus for their hard work, and I \nwill join with them in voting to override the veto and set the \npriorities for the citizens of my State and for the United States in \nthe years to come on their water resources.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ.

Mr. President, I rise during a period of morning \nbusiness to talk about two very important topics. For the last 40-some \ndays we have been discussing the nomination by President Bush of Judge \nMukasey to be the next Attorney General. It is a nominee to the \nPresident's Cabinet.\n  First, I believe the President ought to be accorded great deference. \nThe President gets to pick the team to work with him. This is a Member \nof the Cabinet. It is an appointment that at this juncture, \nrealistically, may not last much more than a year or so. It is not a \nlifetime appointment to the court, it is to serve on the President's \nCabinet, but it is to the very important job of Attorney General. It is \na job in which, in this particular time in history, it is terribly \nimportant that we\n\n[[Page S14109]]\n\nhave someone of measured judgment, someone of impeccable credentials, \nand someone with a fine-tuned ear to following the rule of law.\n  In Judge Mukasey, when his name first surfaced, we had a consensus \nnominee. He was referred to as someone who would get swift \nconfirmation. He was further referred to as someone who had not only \nthe judicial experience but also had significant experience in dealing \nwith cases relating specifically to issues of terrorism. He has 15 \nyears of experience as a Federal judge in the Southern District of New \nYork. During that time he presided over several national security \ncases, in which cases he demonstrated his ability to faithfully \nadjudicate difficult issues of law and fact.\n  It seems to me somewhat unfair to require the nominee for Attorney \nGeneral to now jump through hoops that even the Senate itself has not \nbeen willing to tackle head on, on the issue of waterboarding. I \nbelieve that is a bit of a red herring. I think at the end of the day, \nwhen it is all said and done, it is time we move forward on the \nconfirmation of this good man, a good man who now has had the vote of \nconfidence from the Judiciary Committee; that his nomination be brought \nto the floor so we can give the United States an Attorney General, \nsomeone at the head of the Justice Department, someone we desperately \nneed at this point in history.\n  There is no question that I believe it is time, after 48 days of his \nnomination being pending as of today, that the Senate take up this \nnominee and move it swiftly forward. Judge Mukasey has answered all the \nquestions that have been presented to him. He has answered them to the \nbest of his ability. He has not been able to answer questions that are \nin the nature of hypotheticals. He has not been able to answer \nquestions that are in the nature of things that may be a part of \nclassified programs that are not available to him at this point in time \nand that might, in fact, not be the kinds of questions any other \nnominee to be Attorney General could answer in the course of his \nnomination.\n  In writing to members of the Judiciary Committee, Judge Mukasey \nwrote:\n\n       Some of you told me that you hoped and expected that I \n     would exercise my independent judgment when providing advice \n     to the President, regardless of whether that advice was what \n     the President wanted to hear. I told you that it would be \n     irresponsible for me to do anything less.\n\n  He went on to say that if he was confirmed, he would review any \ncourse of interrogation techniques currently used by the U.S. \nGovernment and determine whether any technique would be unlawful and \nadvise the President accordingly. He committed that to the President, \nto the Congress, and to the American people.\n  I take him at his word. This is a respected man. This is a respected \njudge. He has a track record. This is not a Johnny-come-lately. His \nnomination should be confirmed. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor \nof the nomination of Judge Mukasey to fill the vacancy of Attorney \nGeneral which has been open for much too long and this good man may \nbegin his service to our country at this very important post at this \nvery important juncture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/08/senate-section/article/S14109-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14109-S14110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OVERRIDING THE WRDA VETO\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I want to touch on another subject that \nis terribly important to the State of Florida. It has to do with the \nWater Resources Development Act which for a long time has been pending \nbefore the Congress, and which is so long overdue. When this matter \ncomes to a vote, I will vote to override the President's veto, \nprimarily because in this bill there is nearly $2 billion for the long \noverdue and critically important work of restoring Florida's \nEverglades. This is a bipartisan project. This is a project of unique \ncooperation between the State and Federal Government.\n  The history of Florida's Everglades is fascinating. About 100 years \nago it was decided that man could conquer all and, in fact, the Army \nCorps of Engineers should endeavor, through many projects, to drain the \nEverglades so they could be utilized for farming and that the water \nwould be moved out. So a series of canals was dug and all sorts of \nefforts were put in place to drain the swamp, to drain the Everglades.\n  Now we find ourselves a century later understanding that these well-\nintended Floridians of those days were terribly misguided. The \nEverglades is a jewel to the State of Florida; it is a jewel to the \nNation. It is an environmental masterpiece, the wildlife, between the \nplants and animal life, but also it is an essential water resource for \nthe people of Florida.\n  Some years ago, under the leadership of my predecessor in office, \nSenator Graham, who had been Governor of Florida, and many other \nFloridians, working in partnership with Governor Bush and later when \nSenator Nelson came to the Senate, along with Florida's Governor, they \ncrafted this Everglades Restoration Program. For 5 years this bill has \nbeen delayed. It has meant delaying substantial Federal involvement in \na multitude of necessary projects, including the Comprehensive \nEverglades Restoration Plan. It is the funding that has been missing. \nThe State has done its part. The Federal Government has, so far, been \nabsent.\n  I agree with the President and the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire that this bill lacks fiscal discipline. It seeks to spend too \nmuch on programs that have little need or reason for Federal support. \nBut I also have to recognize that the longer we wait for the Federal \nGovernment to meet its Everglades commitment, the more expensive the \ncost and the more damage that will be irreversible to this fantastic \necosystem. In the past 5 years the cost of the Indian River Lagoon \nproject alone has increased by more than $100 million. Seven years ago, \nthe State of Florida and the Federal Government entered into an \nagreement:\n\n     to restore, preserve and protect the South Florida ecosystem \n     while providing for other water-related needs of the region. \n     . . .\n\n  Since that time, the State of Florida has invested more than $3 \nbillion in this effort; but the Federal Government, originally intended \nto be an equal partner in the restoration, has yet to meet its \nobligations--spending only a fraction of Florida's investments on \npreplanning efforts.\n  The Everglades belong to Florida, but they are a national treasure. \nThe Federal Government has committed to restore the Everglades and it \nis high time they follow through on this commitment. What exists today \nis more than 2 million protected acres of what was once deemed \nworthless swampland slated for development. Indeed, development did \noccur and road construction has almost irreversibly impeded the natural \ncleansing flows of the Everglades. But because of the work of the State \nof Florida and numerous environmental organizations, we are reversing \nthe damage of development. Once on a path to destruction, the \nEverglades now teems with wildlife, endangered and rare species, and \ncontributes greatly to south Florida's environmental health. But the \nwork is far from complete. A substantial portion of the work lies \nahead.\n  No single bill Congress approves will have as much positive impact on \nFlorida's environment as this one. It is, in fact, more than an \nenvironmental project. It is also a water project. Over the last \nseveral weeks, we have been hearing reports about the scarcity of water \naround Atlanta, where several million Americans reside. It has come to \nthe point that Florida, Georgia, and Alabama had to have a serious \nconversation with the Department of Interior about water flows from the \nriver that flows from Georgia all the way into Alabama and Florida. In \nFlorida it is the Chattahoochee River.\n  The serious nature of that problem can also be reconciled with the \nserious problem we would see in south Florida if our water supply were \nimpeded. This is not only an environmental project, it is also a water \nresources project. It is about the water that is necessary to sustain \nlife and to sustain the people, the several million people who live in \nsouth Florida.\n  I believe it would be a very important moment for us to override the \nveto, to move forward with the Everglades Restoration, the Indian River \nLagoon, the Picayune Strand--these are very important projects--and a \nscore of other projects around the State of Florida, all related to our \nenvironment that is such an important part of the Comprehensive \nEverglades Restoration. But more than that, it is part of Florida's \nfuture and part of the legacy we leave our children.\n\n[[Page S14110]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning, while I was working out in \nthe gym, on the air came one of my friends, a gentleman with whom I \nenjoy serving, who has a great sense of humor--Senator Schumer from New \nYork. He was being interviewed by the CNBC team, which is a great and \nenjoyable team to watch: Mark Haines and Becky Quick and others--David \nFaber. He said the Democratic Party had been disciplined because they \nhad used pay-go as a way to control spending here in the Congress.\n  I almost fell off the treadmill, because that statement is so \noutrageous that it could only be made by somebody from New York who \nsees things in big pictures, sees the forest but misses the trees. The \nstatement represents, or implies, that pay-go is a fiscally \ndisciplining event around here when just the opposite is what has \noccurred. Pay-go has become a term of art which has a nice name, and \nwhich is thrown out by some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle as their representation of fiscal discipline, but in fact it has \nbecome a mechanism for spending money at an outrageous rate in \nentitlement and mandatory accounts.\n  I don't call it pay-go anymore, I call it ``Swiss-cheese-go.'' The \nrecord is now pretty clear. Since this Congress came into being under \nthe control of the other party, with the representation that pay-go was \ngoing to be used to discipline spending around here, there have been 13 \nmajor incidences--these don't count the minor ones--major incidences of \npay-go being waived, manipulated, or manhandled so that it didn't apply \nto spending.\n  Items which should have not been allowed to occur, spending \ninitiatives which should have been subject to the pay-go rules have \nbeen ignored, manipulated, or gimmicked so that pay-go did not apply on \nthese 13 incidents, which now total $143 billion--billion--in new \nspending.\n  So when Senator Schumer spoke on CNBC this morning--I think he was \nbeing asked by Mark Haines--Mark Haines said to him: Will pay-go \nsurvive? Senator Schumer said: Sure, it will survive. We are committed \nto this type of fiscal discipline.\n  What Mark Haines should have asked is: What happened to pay-go? Why \nhave so many holes been put in the process? Why has the Democratic \nleadership allowed it to be waived, manipulated, and gimmicked so that \n$143 billion of spending, which should have applied to pay-go, which \nshould have had pay-go applied to it, has simply been allowed to pass?\n  Well, it is very simple. Pay-go was never meant to discipline \nspending. It is a fraud to represent that pay-go is used to discipline \nspending. Honestly, if we as a Congress had to sign financial \nstatements the way we make people sign financial statements in the \ncorporate world as a result of the Enron case--you know, the heads of \nour various corporations have to actually sign their statements, and \nthey are subject to criminal penalty if they are inaccurate.\n  If we were forced to sign a fiscal statement that said we were using \npay-go to discipline spending, we would all go to jail because if we \nsigned that statement we would be defrauding the American people at a \nlevel that would make Enron look like a little exercise.\n  Now, $143 billion of fraud has occurred under the alleged pay-go \nrules because pay-go, which should have applied, has not been applied. \nBut this is just the first step in the exercise of profligate spending \naround here. This is one of the more ingenious ones because under the \nname of pay-go, we are representing that we are controlling spending, \nwhen, in fact, using pay-go, we are actually spending $143 billion.\n  There is the second step, which is the discretionary side. This is \nall entitlement spending, of course. Now, $23 billion is being spent \nover what the President requested this year. We hear from the other \nside of the aisle: Well, it is only $23 billion. It is being spent on \ngood causes. Everything gets spent on a good cause around here.\n  Then in the Labor-HHS bill, which represents $11 billion of that $23 \nbillion, obviously many good causes are listed. But what people fail to \nmention is, first, $23 billion is a lot of money. In fact, there are \nsomething like 30 States in this country which could operate their \nentire budgets on $11 billion; $23 billion would probably be the budget \nof almost every State in this country.\n  But this builds the baseline. This $23 billion is not the end of the \nnumber we are spending, it is the beginning of the number of the add-\nons. When you take it out to 5 years, the baseline jumps by $133 \nbillion. If we take it out to 10 years, that is $313 billion--billion--\nof additional spending.\n  So this is not just $23 billion of new spending that is being spent \nabove what the President believes is necessary in order to operate the \nGovernment, it represents $313 billion of spending over 10 years. That \nis a big number. That is a massive number. You could do a lot with that \namount of money. You could cut a lot of taxes, for example. You could \neliminate the double tax on people who are married, which is going to \ngo back up in 2010, if you did not spend this money.\n  You could give higher tuition tax credits to people trying to get \ntheir college degrees if you did not spend this money. You could extend \nthe capital gains and dividends tax rates, which disproportionately \nbenefits senior citizens, especially the dividends tax rate if you did \nnot spend this money.\n  This is real money. Real money--$23 billion this year totals $313 \nbillion over a 10-year period. So you take this $313 billion and you \nattach it to the swiss-cheese-go attack here of $143 billion. You are \nup to half a trillion dollars, half a trillion dollars that this \nCongress has spent in 10 months. They have only been in charge for 10 \nmonths--half a trillion dollars.\n  Multiply that out. My goodness, you are up to $2 trillion over the \nterm of this Congress, theoretically. Now, $2 trillion, that is even \nreal money by Democratic terms. I think colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle would even agree that $2 trillion is a lot of money.\n  Now, that might be a bit of hyperbole, but the half a trillion \ndollars is not. That is how much this Congress has cost the American \npeople in the first 10 months in office, while they have been living \nunder the fiscal discipline of pay-go, while they go on TV shows and \nsay: We are disciplined because we believe in pay-go.\n  As a result of that, we get half a trillion dollars of new spending.\n  Well, that is a lot. We have a bill on the floor right now that \nregrettably follows on with this exercise in excess and profligateness. \nThe farm bill alone has $34 billion of gimmicks in it to try to avoid \nbudget discipline, $34 billion of gimmicks. That is huge. I think it \nadds four new major subsidy programs for new crops, including asparagus \nand camellia--I do not even know what that is--and a variety of other \ncrops; creates or authorizes programs which study or work to alleviate \nstress on farmers; adds Chinese gardens in places; does a little \ngimmick which is even creative by the creativeness of this place, \ncreates a new standard of creativeness where they now are taking \nentitlement spending and freeing up entitlement spending by giving tax \ncredits.\n  In other words, they create a new tax credit, and the purpose of that \ntax credit is to pay for items which historically have been paid for by \nentitlement spending under the farm bill, mandatory spending. Since \nthey no longer have to pay for that with mandatory spending, they have \ncreated an extra $3 billion they could spend on new farm programs.\n  So the farm bill itself is a continuation of this exercise in making \nthe concept of pay-go superfluous. And, certainly, the claims that pay-\ngo applies around here are fraudulent. It is about time, hopefully, \npeople start paying attention.\n  When you are up to half a trillion dollars of new spending in 10 \nmonths, much of which has been done outside of the budget window, so \nthat the budget rules have not been allowed to apply to it, that gets \nto serious money. It gets to a serious lack of fiscal discipline.\n  I hope we would change this course, but we do not appear to be \nchanging\n\n[[Page S14111]]\n\nthis course. We actually appear to be aggravating this problem by \nbringing forward bills such as the farm bill, which continues this \nfailure of fiscal discipline.\n  Who has to pay for all of this? Well, I see those young pages. They \nare enthusiastic, they smile, they help us out. Regrettably, every day \nthey are here--most of them have been here for a little while--we add \nabout a billion dollars to their debt.\n  Interesting how this adds up. But that $500 billion has been put on \nthe books in the last 10 months. We are not going to pay for it. Our \ngeneration is not going to pay for it. These pages and their generation \nare going to have to pay for it. It is all debt. It is not fair to \nthem, and it is certainly not fair to the American people to represent \nthat we are exercising some sort of fiscal discipline around here under \nthe term ``pay-go,'' when, in fact, just the opposite is happening. \nThat is used as a stalking horse, not for fiscal restraint but for \nspending.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I just have one question for the Senator from New \nHampshire. As I understand it, the President is going to ask for $196 \nbillion for 1 more year in the war in Iraq, not paid for.\n  So would the Senator be voting against the President's request for \n$196 billion, unpaid for, to continue the war in Iraq?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, that is a good question, an excellent question. And \nthe answer is, the first obligation of a Federal Government is to \ndefend the country. And when you have soldiers in the field, you do \nthat. You pay for them being in the field.\n  I would suggest the way we could pay for that, in fact, would be that \nwe not waive the pay-go rules for this $143 billion of spending which \nhas nothing do with national defense or, alternatively, we could \neliminate the $23 billion of nondefense spending which has been added \nby the Democratic Party in this year's budget cycle. That would save us \na significant amount of money.\n  So I would be happy to pay for it by cutting either of those \naccounts. But, in any event, I am going to pay for soldiers who are in \nthe field.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would be honored.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can the Senator tell me how many Presidents in the \nhistory of the United States of America have proposed tax cuts in the \nmidst of a war?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, I would be happy to respond to that if I knew the \nanswer, but I do not. But let me talk about the tax cuts. The tax cuts \nwhich were put in place were put in place prior to 9/11. As a practical \nmatter, had they not been in place, the effect of the burst of the \nInternet bubble in the late 1990s, which was the occurrence of a \ndramatic expansion of the economy with a paper expansion of equities \nbeing issued for companies which had value in the late 1990s, was a \nspeculative event.\n  That collapse, coupled with the 9/11 attack which put this country \ninto trauma, both physically and politically, but also economically, \nwould have led us into a very severe recession if we had not had those \ntax cuts.\n  The fact that we put those tax cuts in place early in this \nadministration has led to economic growth, which has led to 43 months \nof growth, 8.7 million new jobs, and interestingly enough, those tax \ncuts have actually led to our revenues today being at a historic high. \nOver the last 3 years we have collected more money in revenue growth \nthan we have received at any time in our history.\n  We are now getting 18.7 percent of gross national product in \nrevenues, when historically we usually get about 18.2 percent. And the \nvast majority of that revenue growth has come directly from the cut in \ncapital gains rates, as we have received over $100 billion of new \nrevenue in just the capital gains activity.\n  So I would say, first, the tax cut was not put in place during the \nwar. It was put in place at the beginning of the war; and, secondly, it \nhas had the right effect, which is to energize economic expansion and \nenergize revenue to the Federal Government.\n  I do appreciate that question.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \nDemocratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 11 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for my \ncolleague from New Hampshire, and he and I have had many conversations \nabout our views on spending and budget policy.\n  Although he is critical of the pay-as-you-go approach, which the \nDemocrats have brought to Congress since we came into the majority this \nyear, the fact is, the Republicans, the so-called fiscally conservative \nparty, never, ever initiated pay as you go.\n  What is ``pay as you go''? It is something with which every family is \nfamiliar. If you want to buy a new washer and dryer, do you have the \nmoney? If you do not have the money, you do not do it. You may borrow \nthe money, but we are trying to avoid that.\n  Pay as you go says, if you want to spend new money on new projects, \nyou either have to raise taxes or cut spending. If you want to cut \ntaxes, you either have to increase another tax or cut spending. It is \njust that simple.\n  The Republicans, the fiscally conservative party, or so they brand \nthemselves, did not initiate this. The Democrats did. And we are living \nby it.\n  The Senator quarrels with some of the conclusions on various bills. \nBut he has to concede, I hope, the point that we are doing this, and \ndoing it in a fiscally responsible way, and it is painful. It is not \neasy. It was far easier when the Republicans controlled Congress. They \ngave tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America, adding to our \ndeficit without cutting spending on programs, without increasing other \ntaxes. They gave tax cuts.\n\n  When the Senator from New Hampshire says that when the President \nasked for $196 billion for the next year for the war because he wants \nto stand behind our soldiers, he expresses a partial sentiment we all \nshare. We don't want to shortchange the soldiers in any way. But isn't \nthe fiscally and morally responsible way to fund a war to pay for it? \nThe documentary of Ken Burns on World War II talked a lot about the \nsacrifices Americans made to fund the war. It ran up quite a debt. \nFamilies across America bought U.S. savings bonds to help fund the \ndebts of America. It was a special effort, a special sacrifice. This \nPresident, this administration has never asked for that level of \nsacrifice from anyone other than the soldiers and their families.\n  Instead, what he has said to the rest of America is: While we wage a \nwar that costs almost $200 billion a year, $10 or $12 billion a month, \nwe are going to give tax cuts to the wealthiest. So when my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire comes to give us pious exhortations about fiscal \nsoundness, I am at a loss to understand how he can continue to vote for \nthe war and $196 billion that is not paid for. If he believes we have \nto pay as you go, why wouldn't he want to pay for the war as we go? \nClearly, he makes an exception.\n  When the President receives a bill such as the Labor-Health and Human \nServices legislation, which has $10 billion more in spending than he \nasked for, he says he will veto it. What is included in that $10 \nbillion? For the first time since the President came up with the notion \nof No Child Left Behind, we are going to make a massive investment to \nhelp school districts get test scores up, improve the education of \nkids. The President vetoes it. He voted for the test. He voted for the \ncritique of schools but would not provide the resources for those \nschools to improve test scores.\n  There is also money in there the President didn't ask for, for \nmedical research at the National Institutes of Health. I would take \nthat one on, on the stump, with the President any day. Let's have a \ndebate on that. Should we spend $196 billion on the war in Iraq or \nshould we at least put enough money in to improve medical research at \nthe National Institutes of Health? It is a small amount in comparison. \nMost Americans believe as I do, that a strong America begins at home. \nIt begins at home with health insurance for our children, a bill the \nPresident vetoed. It begins at home with better schools for our kids, \nwhich the President is about to veto on the Labor-Health and Human \nServices legislation.\n\n[[Page S14112]]\n\nIt begins at home when we realize medical research is important for all \nof us. None of us knows what tomorrow may bring. We want to know if we \nare stricken, or someone in our family, we can count on the best minds \nin America looking for the cures. The President says we can't afford \nthat. He is going to veto it.\n  Shortly, we will vote on something called the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act, $23 billion over 5 years and $23 billion is a lot of \nmoney. How does it compare with the war that costs us $12, maybe $15 \nbillion a month? The $23 billion for water resources development is \nmoney invested in America to build our infrastructure, the levees, the \nlocks and dams, the things that are critical for America to function \nand succeed. The President says we can't afford that. He vetoed the \nbill. I hope we override it.\n  In the meantime, I hope the Labor-HHS bill, the one that includes \nmoney for No Child Left Behind and medical research, is a bill the \nPresident will reconsider and sign. If he does not, I hope on a \nbipartisan basis we will override that veto as well.\n  This President, for 6 years, never discovered his veto pen. Now he \nhas found it. He has used it to veto our efforts to change direction in \nthe policy in Iraq. He has used it twice to veto stem cell research to \nfund cures for diseases which threaten Americans and their families. He \nhas used it to veto the Children's Health Insurance Program. He now \nthreatens to use it to veto money for our schools. A pattern is \nemerging. This President, when he gets up in the morning and looks out \nthe window of White House, sees Iraq. He does not see America and the \nAmerican families who count on us, those families going to work every \nday who don't have health insurance for their children, those families \nsending their kids to school who are disappointed with test scores and \nbelieve their kids can do better and we can do better, and those \nfamilies who want the American economy to be strong, creating good-\npaying jobs here at home that cannot be outsourced.\n  The President's veto pen is defining his Presidency. As it comes to a \nclose, it is telling us his priorities. His priority is a war, a war \nthat has cost us over $500 billion and, even more importantly, almost \n3,900 American lives. America's priorities are not only to be safe and \nsecure but also to make sure this economy grows and the people in \nAmerica striving for opportunity and for a better day tomorrow have a \nchance through the programs we are supporting in this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I have been listening with interest to my \ncolleagues from New Hampshire and Illinois talk about tax cuts and pay-\ngo and all those issues we deal with on a daily basis. It strikes me \nthat the thing that seems to get lost by our colleagues on the other \nside when it comes to reducing taxes is that when you reduce taxes, you \nactually get not less government revenue but more. History has proven \nthat. It has proven it time and time again, going back in the 1920s \nunder Harding, the 1960s under Kennedy, the 1980s under Reagan, and \ncurrently. If you look at what has happened, when you reduce the \nmarginal income tax rate and the capital gains tax rate, you actually \nnot only see the job growth we have seen--as my colleague from New \nHampshire noted, 8.7 million new jobs--22 consecutive quarters of \neconomic growth, lowest unemployment numbers in a generation, but you \nalso see a dramatic increase in Government revenues.\n  It was predicted, at the time of the tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, that \nall this money was going to be lost because somehow the Government \nwasn't going to have enough money to do things because we were going to \nreduce the tax burden on the American people. What has happened is the \nexact opposite, which has been a historical fact, that when you reduce \ntaxes on hard-working people, they take the realization of paying less \ntaxes, they reinvest that, create more jobs, and you get more \nGovernment revenue.\n  If we look at the last several years, we have seen Government \nrevenues coming into the Treasury increasing 12 percent, 13 percent, \nthis year 9 percent, at least the last numbers I had. But the fact is, \nrevenues have been going up. We reduced the tax burden on the American \npeople. Everybody says: But it just helped those on the wealthy end of \nthe income spectrum. Again, I submit that when you reduce marginal \nincome tax rates, as we did, everyone on the income scale benefits. \nPeople on the lowest income scale went from a 15-percent marginal \nincome tax rate down to 10. They benefited directly as a result of the \ntax relief enacted by the Republican majority.\n  Frankly, this is a philosophical debate that goes on in the Congress \nyear after year after year, but we happen to believe that when you \nallow the American people to keep more of what they earn, allow them to \ninvest that in their family and their community, you get a much better \noutcome than when you send your dollars to Washington, DC, and allow \nthe Government to spend it for them. When you allow the American people \nto put their dollars to work, you create more jobs, grow the economy, \nand you see the dramatic expansion in Government revenues that we have \nseen over the past 3 years.\n  When it comes to the capital gains tax rate, that again has led not \nto less Government revenues but to about a 65-percent, somewhere in \nthat neighborhood, increase in capital gains tax revenues coming into \nthe Federal Treasury over the period since 2004, when the 2003 tax cuts \nwere enacted. Since that period, we have seen a dramatic increase in \ncapital gains tax revenues.\n  Everybody can put up their charts and talk statistics, and we have a \nlot of that in Washington, but you cannot create facts. You are \nentitled to your opinions but not your own set of facts. In this case, \nthe facts are clear. That is, when you reduce marginal income tax rates \nand capital gains tax rates, the American people respond. We have seen \nmore Government revenue as a result.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/08/senate-section/article/S14112-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14112-S14113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FOCUSING ON IMPORTANT WORK\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the clock is ticking on calendar year 2007. \nThere is not a lot of time left. We have a pileup of legislation that \nhas yet to be enacted. If you look at the accomplishments so far in \nthis first year of the Democratic majority, there has been very little \naccomplishment and very little in terms of milestones. In fact, if you \nlook at the milestones, they are not milestones you would be very proud \nof. It seems to me much of the agenda in the Congress in this last year \nhas been about embarrassing the President or creating showdowns with \nthe President or satisfying some liberal special interest group, rather \nthan doing the work of the people. That is the cause of the low \napproval ratings the American people have of the Congress.\n  Part of the agenda has been, we have a President whose approval \nratings are not that good. Let's see if we can create showdowns with \nhim and try to embarrass the President. The reality is, the President's \napproval ratings are about three times that of the Congress. One of the \nreasons the American people have a low opinion of the Congress is \nbecause of all the partisan fights and a lack of a record of \naccomplishment and not focusing on the problems they want to see \nsolved. Those are the challenges and the problems that face this \ncountry going forward.\n  When Congress has an 11-percent approval rating, our colleague, \nSenator John McCain, says: When you get to that low a level of approval \nrating, you are talking about paid staff and blood relatives. \nRegrettably, that is probably the case. But nevertheless, we can change \nthat by focusing on the important work of the American people and \nactually moving the agenda forward.\n  By way of example, because I do think numbers are important, I am a \nbig believer in facts and numbers. President Reagan used to quote John \nAdams who said: Facts are stubborn things. If you look at fiscal year \n2008, we have zero spending bills signed into law. In fact, it has been \n20 years since we reached this time on the calendar without a single \nspending bill having been sent to the President for signature. It has \nbeen 20 years since it took\n\n[[Page S14113]]\n\nthis long to confirm an Attorney General. SCHIP is a good example. They \nknew that was going to be vetoed. It was vetoed. They had the veto \noverride vote and it was sustained. So they came up with a new SCHIP \nbill which actually spent more money but covered fewer children than \nthe original bill sent to the President.\n  My point is, many of these initiatives that are being undertaken by \nour colleagues on the Democratic side are designed to prove a political \npoint, not to solve problems. The American people want us to solve \nproblems, which is precisely why the approval ratings of the Congress \nare so low.\n  The Labor-HHS appropriations bill which was passed by this body \nyesterday is $9 billion over budget. There are 33 States with operating \nbudgets that are lower than the $9 billion in overspending contained in \nthe Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill that passed the \nSenate yesterday.\n  These are some pretty staggering numbers when we think about it. We \nhave $3 gasoline, oil at $93 a barrel, and no Energy bill. Again, it is \nbogged down in the Congress, languishing because of the political \nbickering going on back and forth.\n  We have the alternative minimum tax that is going to kick in this \nyear. Only 54 days until 2008, and we still don't have a solution to \nthat. On the other hand, in terms of numbers, we have had 57 votes in \nthe Congress, the House and the Senate, on Iraq. I have to say, because \nI serve on the Armed Services Committee, what is going on in Iraq and \nour national security, there is nothing more important when it comes to \nthe role of Government than to protect the American people. But there \nhas been a lot of political debate about Iraq over the course of the \npast 10 months, much of which was designed to promote showdowns with \nthe President, to create political opportunity for Members on the other \nside to earn points with liberal interest groups. That is 57 votes on \nIraq in the last 10 months at the same time that we don't have an \nEnergy bill, at the same time that we haven't passed a single \nappropriations bill, that we haven't confirmed an Attorney General, \nthat we have FISA legislation, the lack of passage of which is \ninhibiting our ability to catch bad people and terrorists trying to do \nharm to the American people.\n  These are all numbers and facts that I believe the American people \nwant to see this Congress address, rather than engaging in political \narguments that are designed for no other reason than to prove a \npolitical point or to embarrass the administration or to satisfy a \nliberal special interest group.\n  I submit we still have time. We don't have a lot of time, but it \nwould behoove the Congress and the Democratic leadership in the Senate \nand House to work together to try to solve the problems the American \npeople care about, rather than engaging in more political arguments, \nrather than sending the President bills the Congress knows he is going \nto veto.\n  Let's get after some of these more important issues, such as the high \ncost of energy, passing appropriations bills that control Federal \nspending and I think adhere to the American people's sense of fiscal \nresponsibility and a belief that the American Congress ought to be \nresponsive to the American people by being responsible in the use of \ntheir tax dollars.\n  So I see our time is winding up in terms of morning business, and I \nknow the WRDA bill is pending before the Senate. We are going to take \nthat up. But I simply hope in the remaining days of this calendar year, \n2007, we can actually do something that will create a record of \naccomplishment for the American people rather than continuing to have \nthe Democrat majority in the Senate trying to make political statements \nand score political points.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield my time.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the veto message on H.R. 1495, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Veto message to accompany H.R. 1495, a bill to provide for \n     the conservation and development of water and related \n     resources, to authorize the Secretary of the Army to \n     construct various projects for improvements to rivers and \n     harbors of the United States, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the \nveto message occur at 11:45, with half of that debate time equally \ndivided between Senators Boxer and Inhofe and the remaining half under \nthe control of the Republican leader.\n  This has been approved by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could, I will take a couple minutes at \nthis time.\n  I have been watching the Congress pretty closely now for 35 years as \na Member of the House and the Senate, and I have been involved in end \nof sessions 19 times in the Senate, but I must say, it is about as big \na mess as I have ever seen. We are not going to have a single \nappropriations bill down to the President signed for the whole year, \neven by the end of this week.\n  The bill that is on the way, the Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education appropriations bill, which is $9.8 billion above what the \nPresident asked for and has lots of problems, is going to be vetoed, \nand will be back up here next week. Hopefully, we will find a way \nbefore this week is out to pass the Defense appropriations bill so our \nmen and women will know they are going to get the assistance they need, \nthe equipment they need, the protections they need. That would be the \nfirst appropriations bill to get to the President that he might \nactually sign.\n  It is true right across the board. All year long, it has been about \npolitical positioning. It has all been about fighting over Iraq. There \nare so few things where we have come together and worked together and \ngotten something produced.\n  Thank goodness a couple weeks ago we did the Amtrak authorization \nbill. I have urged, all year long: Let's quit finding issues we can \nfight over, and let's find some issues we can work together on, get \nbipartisan agreements on that would help the American people.\n  I believe, actually, the WRDA bill, the Water Resources Development \nAct, is one of the few things we can look at and say we did something \ngood for our country and for our constituents this year. It is \nbipartisan. It has been laboriously developed over the last 5 or 6 \nyears--a long time coming.\n  It is one of the few areas where we actually do something \nconstructive, where you can see physically something the Federal \nGovernment has done. It creates jobs. It provides safety and \nprotection, safe drinking water. It is one of the only bills that I \nthink actually produces a positive result.\n  I have always been proud of the Corps of Engineers because the Corps \nof Engineers is one of the few Government entities that actually does \nsomething, produces something--something you can see and feel and helps \nthe quality of life. We are always involved in social welfare programs, \ngiveaway programs, and we are always trying to find a way to raise \ntaxes and do things that are not good for our constituents. This one \nactually does something good.\n  Sure, there are disagreements. There are some programs in here that \nprobably are not sufficiently justified. I know from past experience, \nalmost every President has opposed this type of bill. I remember Jimmy \nCarter did not like the Corps of Engineers. We had a fight with him \nover river projects, water projects, the same thing with George H.W. \nBush, the same thing with Bill Clinton. He had people in his \nadministration, in the Office of Management and Budget--oh, they didn't \nlike water resources projects.\n  Here it is again. The President has vetoed this bill. So I must say, \nI am not boasting about it, but I have no qualms about saying the \nPresident's views notwithstanding, I will vote to override his veto on \nthis legislation.\n\n[[Page S14114]]\n\n  This is about flood protection. This is about water and sewer \nprojects. It is about doing something about water and the proper \nsalinity in the Gulf of Mexico. These are good, deserved, justified \nprojects that should go forward.\n  So I will vote to override the veto. Perhaps the President did the \nright thing in some respect, but I buy the argument it is an \nauthorization. It is not an appropriations bill. I have always in the \npast found that if you get a project authorized and then you go get the \nappropriations, you do not have a problem. Well, we kind of got away \nfrom that. We have gotten into difficulty. But I understand why the \nPresident vetoed it. He is trying to hold the line on spending. \nCongratulations. That is good. I am going to be supporting him on most \nof his vetoes.\n\n  I cannot imagine any vetoes that might be forthcoming where I would \nnot support the President--beyond this. But in this case, I believe \nthis bill is in the best interests of the country. I know it is very \nbeneficial to my State. A quarter of the State probably would not exist \nif we did not have flood control projects. My State is a poor State. We \nare still struggling to make sure people have safe drinking water, so \nthey do not have to haul the water to their house, believe it or not, \nhere in 2007. Ports and harbors are critical for the future economic \ndevelopment and competitiveness of this country in a global economy.\n  So I look forward to having a brief discussion. I look forward to the \nvote. I will vote to override the President's veto.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes on the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I, too, stand in strong support of \noverriding President Bush's veto of the WRDA bill. I do so because this \nWRDA bill is absolutely crucial for our entire country and nowhere more \nso than my State of Louisiana.\n  This is a real hallmark in our continuing recovery from the \ndevastating 2005 hurricanes--Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. This is an \nenormously important step in that continuing recovery. That is true for \nmany reasons, but the most fundamental is a simple one. Unfortunately, \nit is a fact many people forget. So much of the devastation to the \nGreater New Orleans area, in particular, immediately following \nHurricane Katrina, was not because of an act of God. It was manmade. It \nwas not because of the size and ferocity of Hurricane Katrina, as bad \nas that was. It was because of fundamental flaws and mistakes made by \nthe Corps of Engineers in building our levees in Greater New Orleans.\n  Now, that does not explain all of the flooding, by any means. It does \nexplain at least 70 percent of the catastrophic flooding of the New \nOrleans area. So that is why this authorization bill, to move forward \non crucial Corps of Engineers projects, and to do it right, with proper \noversight from outside, independent experts, is so very important.\n  One of the first things I did coming to the Senate in early 2005 was \nto go to the EPW Committee to begin my work on this WRDA bill. I worked \nrelentlessly on it there with my colleagues and then followed the bill \nto the conference committee. So this is a very important, momentous \nstep in our recovery with regard to closing MRGO, with regard to \nfundamental coastal restoration, with regard to a true 100-year level \nof protection, with regard to important projects in other parts of the \nState, the Port of Iberia, protection for Vermilion Parish, work in the \nCalcasieu River, bank stabilization in the Washita and Black Rivers.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's \nfinish this job. Let's finally get this work done today. Let's override \nPresident Bush's veto of WRDA.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, when the quorum call is resumed, I ask \nunanimous consent that the time be divided equally between the two \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. With that unanimous consent request having been granted, \nMr. President, I again suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes on the override.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senate.\n  I came here to just spread the Record with a couple of minutes of my \nobservations about the WRDA bill and to suggest that the President of \nthe United States made a mistake. This bill should not have been \nvetoed. This bill is totally an authorizing bill.\n  Now, I don't want to say he made a mistake and then talk technical \nlanguage that nobody understands, but in the Congress, we have a way of \nspending money. We have a way of spending money called appropriations, \nand we have a way of spending money that is an entitlement, such as \nSocial Security or veterans' pensions, and then we have another way \nwhere we just authorize a program to be funded later, if at all--to be \nfunded later, maybe--and that is an authorization bill.\n  This WRDA bill is the result of a 7-year effort on the part of the \ncommittee of jurisdiction to put together a composite of all of the \npublic works projects from around the country so that when somebody \nseeks to get them funded, they can say they have been authorized by the \nCongress. However, that doesn't mean they will ever get funded. If we \ndon't have enough money, the programs that are included in WRDA won't \nget funded, and if they get funded, there will be an opportunity for a \nPresident to veto a bill that contains the money, the expenditures.\n  So as I see it--now I am speaking to the President of the United \nStates, not my friend in the chair--Mr. President: You should have \ntalked to some of us who have been here and who would have told you \nthat no matter what numbers you put down on this bill, we don't spend \nany money unless and until we appropriate it, and we may never \nappropriate it. Many bills are authorized and the Congress never gets \naround to saying we have enough money to pay for them.\n  So I am going to vote to override the President so we will have this \nauthorizing bill called WRDA on the books for those projects that from \ntime to time Members will say to the Appropriations Committee: It is \ntime to spend money for this and it is time to spend money for that, or \nthe appropriators may say: We don't have enough money for any of it.\n  For instance, in my State of New Mexico, there is a provision for a \npark along the Rio Grande River where we have a greenbelt of sorts, and \nit will be a rather startling park for the city of Albuquerque if it is \never done. But it may never get done. It is just authorized by the WRDA \nbill after years of work. My office worked very hard on that program \nfor a long time, and we were fortunate to get it in this bill, and \nmaybe someday we will get to fund it.\n  So I say to the President of the United States: I assume you \nunderstand you will get overridden on this bill, and I would assume \nrather handsomely. Many of us would listen to you if you are talking \nabout spending too much money, but this one is not that; it isn't \nspending too much money because it doesn't spend any money. It may \nnever spend any money. But when it does, those will be the \nopportunities for vetoes or for people to argue that you are spending \ntoo much.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senate for listening.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S14115]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, Senator Inhofe will be here shortly. We have both been \nin a hearing on global warming, and on that one, we don't see eye to \neye, but on this override, we very much see eye to eye.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong \nsupport for the President's veto of the Water Resources Development Act \nof 2007, and I urge my colleagues to oppose the attempt to override \nthis veto. This legislation is fundamentally flawed, authorizing nearly \n1,000 new projects without any method for prioritizing the needs of our \nnational water infrastructure.\n  When the House and Senate went to Conference on WRDA, the Senate bill \ntotaled $14 billion and the House bill $15 billion. Somehow this \nresulted in a final conference report totaling $23 billion and 900 new \nprojects--300 more than either of the House- or Senate-passed bills had \nincluded. These items are just further additions to the growing backlog \nat the Corps of Engineers.\n  Buried among these projects are valid infrastructure needs including \nhelping to protect the gulf coast against future hurricanes. However, \nas stated in the November 5, 2007, Washington Post editorial entitled \n``Fiscal Plunge: A vetoed $23 billion water bill is not worth saving,'' \n``The bill would indeed authorize about $1.9 billion for coastal \necosystem restoration and protection in Louisiana to help the state \nrebuild its defenses against hurricanes. The president supports that; \nhe just thinks that Congress could have authorized it without also \nlarding on billions of dollars' worth of economically and \nenvironmentally questionable projects.'' I will ask that the editorial \nbe printed in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  I know that many are arguing that we have to pass legislation in \norder to begin or complete important water infrastructure projects \nthroughout the United States. However, I believe that we should be \npassing a bill that will authorize legitimate, needed projects without \nsacrificing fiscal responsibility.\n  In August, the Senate passed the Honest Leadership and Open \nGovernment Act of 2007 with the supposed intention of bringing \nintegrity to the system of earmarking appropriation and authorizations \nbills. Unfortunately, within 10 days of its enactment, the Senate \napproved the conference report for WRDA that is just more of the same \nearmarks and then some. Prior to congressional consideration of the \nconference report, the Director of OMB and Assistant Secretary of the \nArmy for Civil Works sent a letter to Congress stating that the \nexcessive price and number of projects in this legislation would result \nin a Presidential veto. I am pleased that the President followed \nthrough on that statement and rightfully vetoed this water resources \nbill full of pork projects and unchecked Government spending.\n  When issuing his veto of the Water Resources Development Act on \nNovember 2, 2007, the President stated, ``This bill does not set \npriorities. The authorization and funding of Federal water resources \nprojects should be focused on those projects with the greatest merit \nthat are also a Federal responsibility . . . This bill promises \nhundreds of earmarks and hinders the Corps' ability to fulfill the \nNation's critical water resources needs . . . while diverting resources \nfrom the significant investments needed to maintain existing Federal \nwater infrastructure. American taxpayers should not be asked to support \na pork-barrel system of Federal authorization and funding where a \nproject's merit is an afterthought.''\n  During Senate consideration of this bill, Senator Feingold offered an \namendment that I was pleased to cosponsor that would have established a \nsystem to give clarity to the process used for funding Corps projects. \nOf course, that amendment was not adopted because this Congress values \npet projects over national priorities. I believe that this Congress has \na duty to protect taxpayers' dollars and ensure that they are used for \nthe most cost effective and critically needed projects. This bill fails \nto provide for any clarity or prioritization in the funding process and \nwould result in further confusion and irresponsibility in how Corps \nprojects are funded.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the attempt to override the \nPresident's veto of the Water Resources and Development Act of 2007.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Fiscal Plunge: A Vetoed $23 Billion Water Bill Is Not Worth Saving.\n\n       Ah, the theatrics of Washington. On Friday, President Bush \n     vetoed the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), a bill \n     that would authorize $23 billion in spending on water \n     projects by the Army Corps of Engineers. Lawmakers of both \n     parties were critical. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid \n     (D-Nev.) said that the veto shows ``President Bush is out of \n     touch with the American people and their priorities.'' \n     According to Mr. Reid, one of 81 senators to vote for the \n     WRDA (it passed the House 381 to 40), the bill would \n     ``strengthen our environment and economy and protect our \n     natural resources'' and fund projects ``essential to \n     protecting the people of the Gulf Coast region'' from \n     hurricanes. The veto is ``irresponsible,'' Mr. Reid declared.\n       After almost five years in which he did little to check the \n     spending of a Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. Bush is a \n     bit late in trying to recover his party's reputation for \n     fiscal conservatism. But even discounting for the White \n     House's political posturing, this is hardly an example of an \n     ``irresponsible'' veto. To the contrary, that word might \n     better be applied to the WRDA itself. The bill would indeed \n     authorize about $1.9 billion for coastal ecosystem \n     restoration and protection in Louisiana to help the state \n     rebuild its defenses against hurricanes. The president \n     supports that; he just thinks that Congress could have \n     authorized it without also larding on billions of dollars' \n     worth of economically and environmentally questionable \n     projects. And he's right: After all, the Senate and the House \n     versions of the legislation tipped the scales at $14 billion \n     and $15 billion, respectively. Then, in conference committee, \n     lawmakers added more pet projects to bring the total up to \n     $23 billion.\n       The silver lining in the bill is that it takes some \n     tentative steps toward reforming the Army Corps, providing \n     for independent review of projects worth more than $45 \n     million. But this modest change is much weaker than what the \n     overhaul reformers in the Senate had advocated. Thus Mr. \n     Bush's valid concern, expressed in his veto message, that the \n     WRDA ``does not set priorities'' among the $58 billion in \n     projects authorized in past bills. Indeed, though it has a \n     high nominal price tag, the WRDA only promises projects, \n     essential and otherwise, that have to compete for the $2 \n     billion the Army Corps spends each year. So the WRDA is \n     largely a hollow political exercise. Given the overwhelming \n     margins by which both houses passed the bill, though, Mr. \n     Bush's veto is almost certain to be promptly overridden. This \n     time, Congress's empty gesture will trump the president's \n     futile one.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think it is important to note the historic significance \nof what I think is about to happen here because only 106 times in the \nentire history of the United States of America has the Congress \noverridden a Presidential veto--only 106 times. The first time was in \n1845 over the funding of military equipment. Then-President Tyler \nbypassed Congress and tried to buy some equipment that Congress had not \napproved of. Congress was able to stop that when his veto was \noverridden on the bill.\n  The point is, there is, in our Constitution, a separation of powers \nand a balance of powers. I think when there is overwhelming support \nacross party lines, overwhelming support from our communities from the \nbottom up, to pay attention to our infrastructure, to pay attention to \nthe needs of our economy, to pay attention to the needs of the American \npeople--when there is overwhelming bipartisan support, why would a \nPresident cast a veto?\n  As I asked rhetorically before the President vetoed this WRDA bill, I \nsaid: Do we have to fight about everything? Aren't there some things on \nwhich we can agree? But it was not to be. I think if, in fact, we do \noverride this veto--which I fully expect we will do, but I never count \nanything until it is done--I think what we are saying to the President \nis, he should respect us, he should respect the Senate, the House, and \nthe American people. We were elected too. We are close to the people. \nWe know what their needs are.\n\n[[Page S14116]]\n\nIf, in fact, we do override this ill-advised veto, the American people \nwill win today.\n  This water resources bill is 7 long years in the making. If we \noverride this veto, Mr. President, we are fulfilling a promise to the \npeople of Louisiana. We promised them, after Katrina, we would rebuild. \nThe President went there and said:\n\n       I will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild \n     their communities.\n\n  I say to the President: When you vetoed this bill, you stood up \nbefore the people of Louisiana and said: Sorry. One flick of the veto \npen, and the President turns his back on the people of the gulf coast.\n  I think testimony to that fact was given by Senators Landrieu and \nVitter. The fact is, Congress is stepping in to do the right thing \ntoday. We are a separate but equal body, and we are showing across \nparty lines that no matter who the President is, there are some moments \nin time when he needs to come to the table and work with us. This was \none of those times because the WRDA bill is going to help ensure \nAmerica's water infrastructure and flood control needs are met.\n  Again, it puts the gulf coast on the path to recovery. But it does \nother things. In my State, it is going to finally take care of our \nproblems in Sacramento, where 300,000 people, potentially, could be \nharmed and hurt and damaged because we have not done what we had to do \nto protect them. We do it in this bill.\n  Yesterday, we heard from Senator Bill Nelson about the major \nrestoration of the Everglades that is in this bill--another promise \nmade by Republicans and Democrats alike. The Everglades is a national \ntreasure--actually, a worldwide treasure. Yet we go to communities all \nover this Nation, from sea to shining sea, and we look at the \ncommunities and say that we will work with them on flood control, on \nmaking sure goods can move through our ports, and on recreation.\n  The Corps and the BLM run many recreation areas that see millions of \nvisitors every single year. So it is about recreation, commerce, flood \ncontrol, and it is about environmental restoration.\n  It enacts the most sweeping reforms for the Corps in more than 20 \nyears. I know Senator Feingold did not believe we did enough Corps \nreform. I respectfully say to Senator Feingold that we went very far. \nAs a matter of fact, I believe we brought more independent review to \nthis process because before--I agree with the Senator--the Corps was \njust going off on its own. So communities across our country have \nwaited long enough for these vital projects.\n  As Senator Inhofe said yesterday--and I see he is here now--this is \nan authorization bill. This doesn't spend a penny, but it is very \nimportant because it says we believe these projects are worthy of \nfunding. Then those projects will go through a very tough \nappropriations process, and every one of these projects, as far as I \nknow, draws on local funding, or State funding, and Federal funding.\n  This WRDA bill comes from the people--from the people up. When I go \nto little communities back home--I went to one in Napa, where there is \na flood control program; it is essential. It is a senior citizen \nretirement community, and our folks are frightened because they see \nwhat happens when California experiences these incredible shocks of \nnature, such as the fires, and now we are on the precipice of doing the \nright thing.\n  I hope we override this veto. I look forward to the remarks of \nSenator Inhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Boxer for all of her work \nand efforts. One thing that is kind of interesting about this is, it \nshows you this bill has the support of everyone, philosophically, \nacross the whole scope. One of the ratings that came out recently rated \nme as the No. 1--ACU rating--conservative Member of the Senate, and \nSenator Boxer was No. 97. So she is a proud liberal, I am a proud \nconservative, and we proudly both support this bill. That is an \naccurate statement.\n  Let me say to Senator Boxer and the Democrats who have been so \nsupportive, they have done a good job talking about what we have done \nover the last 7 years. This is 7 years of work, Mr. President. It is \none we have all worked together on. To the right, to my conservative \nfriends, let me say the President cast his veto. I think the veto was \nill-advised. When the President comes through with his vetoes of big \nspending bills that exceed the budget--maybe SCHIP when it comes in--I \nwill support sustaining his veto, or when Labor-HHS comes along that \nwill be over and above the budget, I will be one of the first ones on \nthe floor to support the President in sustaining the veto.\n  Last night, we had a lot of time. We weren't confined to a short \nperiod of time. I had an opportunity to do something I enjoy, and I had \nsome kind comments about it from some of my Democratic friends. I was \ngiving the history, back to 1816, of authorization versus \nappropriations. It is interesting because right now we are continuing \nto make that same argument. I think that is the strongest argument in \nfavor of this bill. What is at stake is the authorization process.\n  I am going to ask my conservative friends to support this override \nfor two reasons. First of all, as was said by many before me--and I \nhave to say it again--it doesn't spend a cent. This is not a spending \nbill. If your idea is it is out of range, and you cannot support it \nbecause it spends too much, that is the wrong way to look at it. We \nhave worked 7 years to put together this bill. Mr. President, there are \n751 projects in the bill, and each one has gone through an \nauthorization process, whereby we have received a report from the Corps \nof Engineers on each one, and it has taken a long time to get this \ndone.\n\n  One of the critics said last night: Why should we authorize more? We \nhave not appropriated all that we have authorized in the past. That is \nmy point. We have 751 projects and probably, judging from the past, we \nwill only authorize maybe 70 percent of those, and they would not be \nauthorized at the highest level. So that is why we have the discipline \nin place to keep excessive spending under control.\n  Let's just say--and it will not happen because we are going to \noverride the veto--we did not override the veto and we don't have this \nbill. There is no way of coming back with a different bill. It cannot \nbe done procedurally. We know that. We would be operating to \nappropriate for what has not been authorized. That absolutely would not \nwork. It takes all of the preparation, criteria, and reports out of the \nprocess.\n  So, anyway, we don't know how many of these will ultimately be \nfunded. I have to tell Senator Boxer I will be down here opposing some \nof the things we are authorizing today because that is the way the \nsystem works. That is where we have to have fiscal discipline. We have \nrule XVI, which says, if the appropriators come out and appropriate \nmoney that exceeds that which we authorize, it will take a 60-vote \npoint of order margin on rule XVI. I will come down and personally \nlodge that point of order.\n  So I say this: This bill does offer the maximum fiscal discipline, \nand I ask my conservative friends to join us in this veto override, and \nthen join me in sustaining the vetoes on spending bills. Again, this is \nnot a spending bill.\n  Mr. President, I understand the yeas and nays are automatic.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I come to the floor as chairman of the \nBudget Committee to simply say this bill doesn't spend a dime. This is \nan authorizing bill. This bill authorizes projects. That makes them \neligible for appropriations. That is all it does. It says to the \nAppropriations Committee that these projects have been reviewed, and \nthey are authorized by the appropriate responsible committee.\n  That is the first and necessary step, but it is not the step that can \nspend a dime. The Appropriations Committee is the only committee here \nthat can actually create spending from this bill. So I think it is very \nimportant for people to realize that basic fact.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank very much the chairman and ranking \nmember for a very professional job of managing this bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nhis comments. He is exactly right. If there was time, I would repeat \nsome of the things we talked about last night that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota was very complimentary on regarding the history of \nappropriators versus authorizers since 1816.\n  I believe what is at stake is the authorization system, which I \nbelieve is the only discipline we have in the appropriations process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote the yeas are 79, the nays are 13.\n  \n  The online version has been corrected to read: The PRESIDING \nOFFICER. On this vote the yeas are 79, the nays are 14.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to say while colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle are here how important this moment is. It is very \nunusual for a Congress to override a Presidential veto. This is only \nthe 107th time it has been done in the history of the country. The \nfirst one was in the 1840s. President Tyler tried to buy some military \nequipment without getting the approval of Congress and that started the \nfirst successful override.\n  Today I think we sent a message, as Republicans and Democrats, to the \nexecutive branch. Mr. President, why should we have to fight over \neverything? We shouldn't have to argue over making sure our \ninfrastructure is strong. I say to Senator Inhofe, whom I don't see on \nthe floor at the moment, but to his staff: Thank you so much for \nworking with our staff. This has been quite an experience. As most of \nyou know, Senator Inhofe and I don't exactly see eye to eye on \neverything, but on this, we were very much a team.\n  I thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, for his strong support in \nworking with us. I know it was a little annoying when he saw me coming \ndown the hall every time. He sort of ducked, because he knew I was \nsaying: When are we going to do WRDA?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Byrd. I think it is \ninteresting that he stands up to get order, because he teaches us every \nday what the Constitution means. The Constitution means that we, in \nfact, are an equal branch of Government. Today I think we proved that \npoint.\n  I say to Senator Landrieu and Senator Vitter, who isn't on the floor \nat the moment, but I want to say about Senator Landrieu what a fighter \nshe is for her State. This bill fulfills a promise the President made \non that very dark and gloomy night when he went out, with the eerie \nlights behind him, because he was right at ground zero of Katrina, and \nhe said he would keep his commitment to the people of Louisiana; that \nhe would protect them. Yet and still he vetoed this bill.\n  I say to both Senators from Florida, whom I see on the floor, \nSenators Nelson and Martinez, how proud I am to have worked with them \nto make sure we fulfill our commitment to the Everglades. The trip I \ntook with Senator Nelson and his wife, my husband and I, is embedded in \nmy memory forever, and this bill sets us on a course we must follow.\n  I say to communities all over the country, including my own, we know \nyou have flood control needs, we know you need to keep up with imports \nand exports and make sure our ports function right. To those who want \nto preserve the environment, have restoration of the environment, we do \nthat here. So this is a very important bill. The recreation industry is \ncounting on us.\n  This is one of those rare moments, in a very divided Senate, that we \ncome together. I couldn't be more proud.\n  In closing, I thank the following staffers, who have worked night and\n\n[[Page S14118]]\n\nday: Bettina Poirier, Ken Kopocis, Jeff Rosato, Tyler Rushforth, Andy \nWheeler, Ruth Van Mark, Angie Giancarlo, and Let Mon Lee. Also, I thank \nSenator Baucus's staff: Jo-Ellen Darcy and Paul Wilkins; and from \nSenator Isakson's staff, Mike Quiello. I mentioned Senator Inhofe's \nstaff in that recitation of names. Without them, the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 2007 would never be law.\n  I am proud to advise my colleagues that it is now law. When that last \nvote was cast, and when our Presiding Officer announced the vote, this \nbill became the law of the land. We can be very proud it is.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, may I take a moment to thank the \nchairwoman of this committee again for fulfilling the promise she made \nto have this bill--that was 7 years in the making--become law. And as \nof about 10 minutes after 12, eastern time, it did become law.\n  People in Louisiana and throughout the gulf coast are cheering, dirt \nis being turned, levees are being built, and wetlands are being \npreserved. This Congress has kept its word to the people of Louisiana \nand the gulf coast, and for that this Senator is very grateful.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/08/senate-section/article/S14118-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  ENDA\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last night the House passed the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act with a strong bipartisan vote. The \nHouse bill prohibits employers from discriminating against workers on \nthe job because of their sexual orientation. It protects Americans from \nbeing fired, denied a job or promotion, or otherwise intentionally \ndiscriminated against because of their sexual orientation. Although the \nbill is narrower than many of us had hoped, the House action is still a \nmain step in the long journey toward full civil rights for every \nAmerican.\n  In the Senate, I will work to move the Employment Non-Discrimination \nAct this Congress. The bill that the House passed is being held at the \ndesk, and I am working with leadership to move this bill forward as \nquickly as possible.\n  This Nation was founded on the principle of equal justice for all. \nThat noble goal represents the best in America--that everyone should be \ntreated fairly and should have the chance to benefit from the many \nopportunities of this country. The House action brings us closer to \nthat goal.\n  Forty-three years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964. At that time, some in our country were \nviolently opposed to outlawing racial discrimination, and it was very \ndifficult for Congress to reach a consensus. But the best in America, \nand the best in the Senate, prevailed. My first major speech in this \nbody as a freshman Senator was on that Civil Rights Act. I said then \nthat I ``firmly believe a sense of fairness and goodwill also exists in \nthe minds and hearts'' of Americans, and that laws creating the \nconditions for equality will help that spirit of fairness win out over \nprejudice, and I still believe that today.\n  Since the 1964 act was passed, we have seen enormous progress in this \nbeloved Nation of ours. Civil rights laws giving national protection \nagainst discrimination based on race, national origin, gender, age, and \ndisability have made our Country a stronger, better, fairer land. \nAfrican Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and Asians have made \nextraordinary advances in the workplace. People with disabilities have \nnew opportunities to fully participate in our society. The workplace is \nfar more open to women in ways that were barely imagined four decades \nago. In countless businesses, large and small, glass ceilings are being \nshattered. Women and girls have far greater opportunities in the \nclassroom and in the boardroom.\n  But that progress has left some Americans out. Civil rights is still \nthe Nation's unfinished business. Today, it is perfectly legal in most \nStates to fire an employee because of sexual orientation or gender \nidentity. Many hard-working Americans live every day with the knowledge \nthat, no matter what their talents and abilities, they can be denied a \njob simply because of who they are. Many young students grow up knowing \nthat no matter how hard they study, the doors of opportunity will be \nlocked by prejudice and bigotry when they enter the workplace.\n  Although some States have outlawed job discrimination based on sexual \norientation and gender identity, in most of the country, workers have \nno recourse at all if they are fired because simply because of who they \nare. That is unacceptable, and we have a duty to fix it, and to do so \non our watch.\n  In the past 40 years, our Country has made great progress in \nguaranteeing fairness and opportunity.\n  When we passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of \n1965 and then the fair housing acts of 1968 and 1988, we took \ncourageous steps, and we were proud that the Senate did the right thing \neach time. We must also do the right thing--the courageous thing--\ntoday. In the 1960s, these laws were controversial. But today, none of \nus, Democrat, Republican, or Independent, would question that they were \nthe right steps to take, and we must take the right steps today.\n  Over the years, the Senate has recognized time and again the \nimportance of our goal of equal employment opportunity. Even if we have \nsometimes disagreed about its proper interpretation, there is no \ndivision among us that the principle of equal employment opportunity is \na core American value.\n  That is what the Employment Non-Discrimination Act is all about--\nequal job opportunities for all Americans. By extending the protection \nof title VII to those who are victimized because of their sexual \norientation, we are moving closer to that fundamental goal. No one \nshould be denied a job simply because of who they are.\n  That ideal is at the heart of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\n  In 1996, we fell one vote short of passing the bill in the U.S. \nSenate. In the decade since, public support for outlawing such \ndiscrimination has only grown stronger. Now that the House has acted, I \nhope that we will be able to finally succeed in the Senate in passing \nthe Employment Non-Discrimination Act this Congress, and I look forward \nto the coming debate.\n  America stands for justice for all. Congress must make clear that \nwhen we say ``all'' we mean all. America will never be America until we \ndo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/08/senate-section/article/S14118-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14118-S14139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for the benefit of all Senators, we are \nnow back on the farm bill. The farm bill was laid down 2 days ago, on \nTuesday. We have asked the other side if they want to offer amendments, \nbut we have seen no amendments. We have one amendment pending. The \nGrassley-Dorgan or Dorgan-Grassley--I don't know which came first on \nit--amendment is pending. But we have heard from the leader on the \nother side that they want to offer amendments.\n\n[[Page S14119]]\n\n  We are here. We are on the farm bill. We have asked for amendments, \nand in the intervening 48 hours, or 2 days since we laid the bill down, \nI have not seen one amendment from the other side that has been \nproffered to be taken up. So here we sit. We are trying to get a handle \non how many amendments there will be, trying to reach some agreement, \nas we always do, to have a package of amendments that we could go to \ntoday and tomorrow, spill over into next week, and then reach some \nagreement, as we always do around here, on how many amendments on their \nside, on this side, reach an agreement, get a time limit set up on \nthese amendments, and then get to a finish on the farm bill I hope \nsometime next week before we leave for Thanksgiving. I know there is \nsome other business the majority and minority leaders probably want to \nconduct next week, but we have to get this farm bill done. It is a good \nbill.\n  I remind my fellow Senators and others who may be watching that this \nfarm bill passed the committee unanimously. There was not one vote \nagainst it. It is a bipartisan bill. I think regionally it is a \nbalanced bill, for all the regions of the country. I think it addresses \nthe real needs of our farmers and ranchers, as well as the other titles \nof the farm bill that are encompassed in the farm bill. Energy--we have \nput a lot, again, into promoting biofuels and bioenergy. In \nconservation, there are big increases for conservation all over this \ncountry. In research, we have money for continuing a strong, robust \nresearch program. In nutrition, we have met our obligations to the \nneediest in our society, providing substantial increases in the Food \nStamp Program in terms of the benefits and indexing them for inflation, \nmaking sure we have more money for the Emergency Food Assistance \nProgram, for our food banks around the country.\n  In all the different areas that are covered by the farm bill, I think \nwe have met our obligations to move ahead. We have done so in a very \nfiscally responsible manner. This farm bill meets all the pay-go \nrequirements we instituted here in the Senate earlier this year--that \nwe would not increase the deficit but that we would pay for things by \nfinding offsets in other areas. The Finance Committee met, and the \nFinance Committee came up with some loophole closing, some tax \ncollections. I daresay there is not any increase in taxes; it is simply \ngoing after taxes that are already owed but are not being collected.\n  I commend both Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley and all the \nmembers of the Finance Committee for their help. With their help, we \nwere able to put in a disaster program for the farm bill, a new \ndisaster payment program--much better than what we have ever had in the \npast, I would add. Also, we were able to get some funding for some \nconservation programs and some of the energy programs. This has been a \nvery bipartisan approach on this bill by committee, I would say, \nbetween the Agriculture Committee and the Finance Committee.\n\n  We are out here on the floor, and I think we can move ahead in good \nfaith by agreeing upon whatever amendments we can agree on on both \nsides. These are negotiations that take place in every bill in which I \nhave ever been involved. They took place on the last one I was the \nmanager on here, the appropriations bill on Education, Health and Human \nServices, and Labor. But you can't negotiate if you do not have \nanything to negotiate on.\n  I say again to my friends on the other side of the aisle, if there \nare amendments, if we bring them forth we can discuss them, and maybe \nwe can reach some agreement on a package of amendments that we can then \nget to and start disposing of, one way or the other.\n  That is where we are. I see my friend and ranking member, Senator \nChambliss, is on the floor. I thank him for all of his good work on the \ncommittee. We have worked hard on this bill, and I think we have a good \nbill, one that, as I said earlier, I could basically support without \namendments. I assume there will be amendments--some I may support, some \nI may not; some Senator Chambliss may support, and some he may not \nsupport. But that is the way we do things around here. Then we will go \nto conference and work it out. I am just hopeful we can get some \namendments proffered here and brought over so we can look at them.\n  I say the same thing on our side too. I have heard of amendments \nother than the Dorgan and Grassley amendment, and I say if we have \nMembers who have amendments they want to offer on the farm bill, they \nor their staffs ought to bring them to us as soon as possible so we can \ntake a look at them, see if they are relevant to the farm bill. If they \nare relevant to the farm bill--I say this very clearly and \nforthrightly--every amendment that is basically relevant to this farm \nbill will be considered and disposed of one way or the other. That is \nreally what we have to focus on, amendments that are relative to the \nfarm bill.\n  Again, I hope Senators on both sides would, if they have amendments, \nbring them forth so we can put a package together and we can get to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, my friend, my \ncolleague, for his comments. I concur with exactly what he said, that \nwe do need to have amendments filed so we know where we are. My \nunderstanding is, as of right now there are 67 amendments that have \nbeen filed. I don't know whether all of them are relevant. We have the \nlist, but we will have to see which ones are and which ones are not.\n  But I think the biggest obstacle we have is the majority leader made \nthe decision to fill the tree.\n  We have had some discussion, not debate by any means, on the \nGrassley-Dorgan amendment the other day. I understand there is some \nconversation about filing cloture on that amendment which is fine if \nthat moves us ahead.\n  But until the leadership on the Democratic side makes a decision as \nto whether we are going to limit amendments, what those amendments are \ngoing to be, then I think we are kind of limited as far as moving \nahead.\n  Let me say to Members on both sides of the aisle, particularly on our \nside of the aisle, that if you have an amendment, if you will file the \namendment and, while you cannot call it up because the majority leader \nhas filled the tree, come on over while we have got some time and talk \nabout your amendment. It will certainly speed up the process when we do \nget to the point, as the chairman says, and I think he is exactly \nright. On every bill such as this, we will ultimately come up with a \nlist of amendments. I would hope all of them are germane. There may be \nsome that have to do with something else, as the Senate always has on \nevery major piece of legislation. We have some that may not be farm \nbill related that will have to be considered. But that is for \nnegotiation and agreement.\n  But if anybody has an amendment, I would say: Come over, make sure \nyour amendment is filed, talk about your amendment, and at the point in \ntime when the amendment ultimately is considered, it simply will speed \nup the process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I appreciate first off the bill that came \nout of the Ag Committee. It was a consensus product. There was a lot of \nbipartisanship support for it. I think it is important we move it \nforward.\n  What is happening here now is delaying something that is of critical \ntiming to the producers in this country; they need to know what the \nrules are before they go into planting season next year.\n  By running out the clock, which essentially we have done this week, \nand unless we come to some agreement on amendments, we are going to \nlose next week. Then we are into December, and it is going to be \nawfully difficult to get a bill conferenced and on the President's desk \nbefore the end of the year.\n  I, for one, have an amendment, along with Senator Domenici and \nSenator Nelson, that has been filed. So I would say to my friend from \nIowa that we are more than happy, if the leadership on the majority \nside would be agreeable, to us calling up amendments.\n  But as was noted by my colleague from Georgia, the current state of \nplay is they have filled the amendment tree, thereby making it \nimpossible for us to get amendments called up, pending, under \nconsideration, debated, and voted upon.\n  But I have one that I think is very important, it is very relevant. \nYou talk\n\n[[Page S14120]]\n\nabout amendments that are relevant to the farm bill that would expand \nthe renewable fuel standard. That was something that was supported by \nthe Senate in the Energy bill. I have my doubts about whether we are \ngoing to get an energy bill this year. But I cannot think of anything \nthat is more important to farm country right now than making sure we \nhave a higher renewable fuel standard, particularly in the short term.\n  2008 is critical. We are already at 7\\1/2\\ billion gallons. Where the \ncurrent renewable fuels standard sits that was passed in 2005, we are \ngoing to, and have, eclipsed that. If we do not raise this renewable \nfuel standard in 2008 in the short term, we are going to have a \nterrible crunch out there.\n  We are already seeing ethanol plants that are stopping construction, \nthose that are under construction that have stopped it. We have some, I \nknow of one in North Dakota that ceased operations for a while because \nthe margins are not there.\n  This is a very relevant amendment to the underlying farm bill, one \nthat would strengthen the energy title in the bill and one which is \ncritically important, from a timing standpoint, to producers across \nthis country and those who would invest in the renewable energy \nindustry. I would add, because I think this is a very important point \nnot just for farm country, not just for our farmers and those in rural \nareas of this country who have benefited from ethanol production \neconomically, but also it is important for our energy security.\n  We have got a very serious problem. Oil is approaching $100 a barrel. \nWe need to be increasing the amount of renewable energy we produce, \nhomegrown energy in this country, so we can lessen that dependence upon \nforeign energy. We have an opportunity to do that. The ethanol industry \nin this country has done remarkably well, thanks, in large part, to the \nrenewable fuels standard enacted in 2005. But we have been overtaken by \nevents. We are passing, we are blowing by that 7\\1/2\\ half billion \ngallons. We need to get the new renewable fuel standard in place.\n  The amendment we have offered--it is a bipartisan amendment--would do \nthat. It would get us to 8\\1/2\\ billion gallons in 2008, which is \ncritically important. We are running into a wall out there. It is \ndramatically affecting the ability of this industry to compete and to \nmake sure that it continues to operate profitably and move us in a \ndirection that lessons our dependence upon foreign energy.\n  So I would simply say to my colleagues, to the Senator from Iowa, the \nchairman of the committee, the ranking Republican, Senator Chambliss, \nthat it would be very advisable, and I think advantageous, for us to be \nable to come to some agreement on amendments because delay, in the end, \nis not an option.\n  We cannot afford to go into next year without a farm bill. I would \nlike to see this amendment considered. I hope the majority would make \nway for us to be able to offer amendments. This whole notion of filling \nthe tree, I am not sure exactly what that accomplishes, other than to \nshut us down, at least in the short term.\n  So I would simply say we have an amendment, we are ready to do \nbusiness as soon as the other side decides they want to open this bill \nfor amendment. I hope we can do that and do it soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I would like to speak for 20 or 30 \nminutes on the farm bill, if I might. I would first like to associate \nmyself with the remarks of Senator Thune, the distinguished ranking \nmember of the committee, Senator Chambliss, and our distinguished \nchairman, Senator Harkin.\n  Let me point out that Senator Harkin did something very unusual. \nAfter handling one bill on the floor of the Senate, he then had the \nchallenge of trying to move the farm bill, which is sometimes about as \neasy as pushing a rope. But he did it through committee in a day and a \nhalf. I think that is a record.\n  I have been through seven farm bills, two technical farm bills that \nwere really farm bills, and I have never seen committee action be \nexpedited in that fashion. So I wish to thank the chairman for that.\n  There were some differences of opinion. Obviously, we always have \nthat. But he handled it very well. So I am in agreement with the \nchairman and with the ranking member and Senator Thune, and I think \nalmost everybody on the Agriculture Committee, that we would like to \nsee action on this bill.\n  This morning, once again, I had the privilege of being on the ``Farm \nShow'' in Topeka, KS, America, on good old WIBW. That is where the farm \nbroadcasters always ask you: Where is the farm bill? How is it coming?\n  I said: Well, it is not. We have sort of a briar patch we have gotten \nourselves into in regard to something called filling the tree, that is \na fancy word around here meaning you cannot climb up the tree and climb \nout on a limb and drop our acorn or your amendment down to see if it \nwould be considered.\n  On the other side of the fence, let me say Chairman Harkin has done \nsome work, and I think he has done the homework to the extent to show \nin the last three farm bills not many nongermane amendments ever popped \nup on the floor in regard to the farm bill. That is a good thing.\n  Now, I am not going to be in a position to try to determine what is \ngermane and what is not, but as I recall, there was only one amendment, \nI think it was by Senator Kyl on the estate tax, I do think that is \nobviously germane to farmers and ranchers, but that is obviously a tax \nmeasure, but that was perhaps ruled out of order.\n  But hopefully we can get an agreement and say X number of amendments \non your side and X number of amendments on our side and then proceed. I \nwould hope we would not have to go to cloture to even debate the farm \nbill.\n  But farmers, ranchers, their lenders, whether it be in Iowa or \nwhether it be in Georgia or whether it be in the Dakotas or in Kansas, \nthey need answers now. I hope we do not get into a situation where our \nonly option is to simply extend the current bill.\n  Now I am going to get to my prepared remarks. I have some points I \nwould like to make. I will try to make them as short as possible. As I \nindicated to my colleagues, this is my ninth farm bill, either as a \nstaffer or a Member. If you include the technical corrections I talked \nabout, which sometimes means a complete rewrite of the farm bill, we do \nnot usually say that, we usually say it is a technical correction, I \nhave lost count.\n  Sometimes those technical corrections may seem somewhat covert but on \nmost occasions they are not. Each farm bill debate is unique. \nCertainly, this one is as well. I would like to start off by saying \nthere is some good news. I wish to thank the manager of this bill for \nincluding some important provisions I helped author. Senator Conrad and \nI have been working on our open fields bill for quite some time. I am \nglad to see it included. It is clearly a win-win for sportsmen and also \nsportswomen, as well as farmers and ranchers who take advantage of the \nprogram. So that is a good thing.\n  I also appreciate the authors for working with me to address my \nconcerns regarding the rural utility services broadband loan program. \nThe reforms included do represent a very real bipartisan consensus. \nThat was an effort to bring broadband Internet to more Americans. That \nis in the bill.\n  The committee bill includes crucial and very important language on \nrural hospitals. Senator Harkin was a leader in that effort, that will \nmake a real difference in many of our rural communities. The rural \nhealth care delivery system is always under pressure in keeping what we \nhave. As a member of the Finance Committee I know that as well. We need \nto strengthen and preserve what we have and then improve it.\n  Finally, I also wish to thank Chairman Harkin and our ranking member, \nSenator Chambliss, and their staff for creating an agriculture security \ntitle in this legislation. This is something we have worked or on for \nseveral years.\n  Now, despite the fact that our Nation enjoys but does not apparently \nappreciate the fact that production agriculture does provide this \ncountry and a very troubled and hungry world the very best quality food \nat the lowest price in the history of the world, we have heard a lot of \nrepeated calls for dramatic reform of our farm programs.\n  Now, while targeted and pertinent reforms in some of our programs are \ncertainly needed, and this bill takes major\n\n[[Page S14121]]\n\nsteps to do that in answering those calls, it seems to me we must be \ncautious of what lurks under the banner of reform.\n  We must be mindful of the unintended consequences of our actions. \nNowhere in this bill is that more evident than in the livestock title. \nI represent a State where cattle outnumber people more than two to one. \nCattle represented 61 percent of the agriculture cash receipts by \ngenerating over $6 billion in 2005. That is a lot of money.\n  I tell you this, so you understand that when I say the livestock \nindustry is vital to Kansas and the country and our economy out there \non the high plains and also to our livelihoods.\n  Now, competition issues are nothing new to this body. I understand \nthat. I agree that our producers need to be able to compete in today's \nmarkets. It is the role of the Government to protect producers from \nunfair practices and monopolies, and I understand the calls from some \nfor increased Government involvement and oversight.\n  At the same time, we must take careful steps to ensure that in any \naction we might take, we do not suffer from the law of unintended \nconsequences and risk the significant gains the livestock industry has \nexperienced. It has changed dramatically.\n  During this debate, we have heard from several Members about how farm \nbill debates rarely fall along party lines and traditionally follow \nregional interests. This may seem odd to those who have not worked on a \nfarm bill before, but that is the case.\n  Agriculture in one region can mean something different, very \ndifferent, than agriculture in some other region. These differences do \nnot just include the crops and the commodities that are produced, there \nare significant differences in practices, farming practices, and input \ncosts, what it costs to have a successful cropping operation and risk; \nrisk, which is a big-time consideration among the different regions.\n  We have low risk in certain States, where I have often said in jest, \nwhere they simply put the seed in the ground, they do not farm it, it \njust comes up, as opposed to other areas where we have high risk, we \nreally have to farm the ground and other areas.\n  As a Senator from a State with higher risk agriculture, and there are \nmany of us representing these States, many of our current farm programs \nunfortunately have not worked for our constituents. However, some of \nthem do. In recent years, they have represented a lifeline to our hard-\npressed producers who needed a lifeline, and it has been their only \nlifeline.\n  In particular, I am talking about direct payments and crop insurance. \nI will come back to that and come back to that and come back to that. \nThis is why it is vital that as a Federal Government, we craft farm \nprograms that do not merely benefit one region or one crop but that we \ndraft legislation that is national in scope.\n  So reducing programs that benefit one region to increase programs \nthat benefit another region is a dangerous enterprise. I caution my \ncolleagues against taking this route.\n  If we want a farm bill that represents the entirety of agriculture, \nwe must not play games that pit one sector of agriculture against \nanother. I remember the days of the whole herd buyout back when I was \nprivileged to be a Member of the House of Representatives. That may \nhave been of help--I underscore the word may--to the dairy industry, \nbut it put a lot of livestock producers out of business. I underscored \nthat in my mind and to my colleagues at that time, that we must not get \ninto another situation where one section of agriculture is competing \nagainst another and putting them at a disadvantage. We certainly do not \nneed that.\n  For several years now I have been telling everybody who will listen \nabout how the current farm bill does not provide assistance when our \nproducers need it the most. When Mother Nature starts stirring up \ntrouble--and we have seen that in Kansas and other States, either \nthrough a drought for, 2, 3, 4 years, or a flood, or a freeze, or \ntornadoes, I don't know what could come next from Mother Nature--our \nproducers in the field take it on the chin and in the pocketbook. \nYields go down; prices jump up. Again, the only programs that do \nprovide them any cover are direct payments and crop insurance. The \ncountercyclical program currently in the farm bill, which when we wrote \nit we predicted prices would be lower, simply doesn't offer them a \npayment. So if you lose a crop, the only thing you get again is a \ndirect payment and crop insurance. In regard to crop insurance, during \na drought your average production history goes down, and that impacts \nyour crop insurance that will allow you to work with your lender and \nstay in business.\n  This story isn't new to anybody who farms in what we call the \nbreadbasket of the world. Thankfully this bill does not cut direct \npayments. I know direct payments may seem like an easy target or a \nbank, for some, but to those in the fields, our farmers, the direct \npayment program helps them produce the safest, most abundant food \nsupply in the world. Once again, the standard farm program rationale--I \nknow Chairman Harkin has made these comments, I have made them, \neverybody connected with the Agriculture Committee and agriculture in \ngeneral has made these comments--our farm programs are a big reason why \nwe in the United States enjoy a market where we spend only 10 cents of \neach dollar of our disposable income on food. That is one dime. That \nfrees up 90 cents for the consumer to spend on other things, whether it \nbe housing, health care, education, leisure time activity, whatever. \nThat is the lowest in the history of the world. This speech used to be \nmade by leaders in the House Ag Committee some years ago. Then it was \n18 cents, 19, 20. Now it is one dime we spend in regard to food, \nfreeing up 90 cents.\n  Without farm programs, that consumer would have to rely on market \ndisruptions that happen and the fluctuations that happen, they would be \nat a big disadvantage, especially those disadvantaged and living in the \ncities. We need to thank our producers for this. But if you look at \nthis farm bill, you will see that only 14 percent now goes to the \ncommodity title. When Senator Conrad was on the floor earlier this \nweek, he informed us that commodity title payments under this bill \nrepresent a mere one-quarter of 1 percent of all Federal outlays. In \nfact, $6 billion comes out of the commodity title to pay for \ninitiatives in other titles. That $6 billion comes out of the \npocketbooks of the folks who provide the food and fiber for a troubled \nand hungry world for other programs. I am not trying to perjure other \nprograms. They are good programs. But we should not take it out of the \nhides of farmers and ranchers who desperately need help when they lose \na crop.\n  The conservation title receives an increase of over $4 billion, \nappropriate, but it is up $4 billion. A plus-up in nutrition program \nfunding is over $5.5 billion which brings total nutrition title \nspending to two-thirds of the entire bill. I know there are amendments \nbeing considered that will take more out of the commodity program, give \nmore to nutrition programs. I suggest that $5.5 billion in additional \nfunding and two-thirds of the entire bill going to nutrition is \nappropriate. Let's work through that. Let's get at the Nation's \nproblems of obesity and good health and wellness. That is appropriate.\n  Yet I have no doubt that during the course of this debate, Members \nwill come down to the floor and argue for additional cuts to producers \nto fund these other programs. I am not saying our conservation and \nnutrition programs don't need additional funding. I hope I have made \nthat clear. Quite the contrary. I am here today saying this bill \nalready puts enough of that responsibility on the backs of farmers and \nranchers. Let's not pile anymore on.\n  Production agriculture needs a voice in this debate. I am happy to \nstand up for those producers. We have heard it a lot in farm bill \ndebates from critics of any farm bill, 15 percent of producers do \nproduce 85 percent of our Nation's food and fiber. But in the national \nmedia and among many of the sideline groups and organizations, these \nproducers, because of the size of their operations, are either \ndescribed or tattooed as ``rich. `` They say ``How can you not be rich \nif you are farming 10,000 acres? How could you not be rich if you are \nfarming 5,000 acres, whatever is cost efficient in whatever region of \nthe country you farm in?'' In many instances, they are simply taken for \ngranted or ignored. In some cases, they don't even exist. Look at their \ncontribution. That is the key. Look at\n\n[[Page S14122]]\n\ntheir contribution. Kansas is the top wheat and grain sorghum-producing \nState in the country. Since 1996, Kansas farmers have produced an \naverage of 365 million bushels of wheat each year. If you are taking \naway programs that help them in dire straits especially crop insurance \nand direct payments, you are risking that 365 million bushels of wheat \neach year, which I submit is a vital national asset. In 2007 alone, the \nplains States--talking about from North Dakota all the way down to \nTexas--produced more than 1.5 billion bushels of wheat. We don't want \nto do anything that could injure or set back that kind of production. \nThere is a reason we are known as the breadbasket of the world. If we \ncut these direct payments and crop insurance which are vital to \nsustaining this production, who will supply the United States and the \nworld? Who will give ample supplies to the world food program to \nrespond immediately to the humanitarian crises we see daily in the \nworld? What would this do to our prices if we lost these producers? Do \nwe want our grain supply to come from China or Brazil or somewhere \nelse?\n\n  I traveled through much of western Kansas in August. Much of Kansas \nsuffered heavy losses on its wheat crop this year. Western Kansas for a \nchange was different. Many of those producers had a bumper crop, thank \ngoodness. But I want everybody in the Senate to hear this, for many of \nthem it was their first crop after 5 years of devastating drought. \nAgain, under the auspices or the way this farm bill works or doesn't \nwork, they received no help other than direct payments and crop \ninsurance. Stop after stop on my tour, producers and their lenders, \nbankers and farm credit, made clear to me one very important fact: Had \nit not been for direct payments and crop insurance during those 5 \nyears, many of those producers would not have been around to grow that \nbumper crop this year. We are talking about anywhere from 350 to 400 \nmillion bushels of wheat, let alone many other crops.\n  That is why I get concerned when I hear folks talking about cutting \ndirect payments or crop insurance during this debate. It is why I will \nfight and oppose any such proposals should they come forward trying to \nuse the logic I have described in these remarks.\n  I want to make clear to my colleagues who it is they are impacting \nthe most, if they come forward with amendments and attack these \nprograms. They are not going to be attacking this Senator. They are not \ngoing to be attacking some political or some small farm philosophy or \nsome business. They will be attacking the people who feed this country \nand a troubled and hungry world. I have said that three times because \nit is true. They will be attacking the farmer who has farmed land for \n40 years or more, the land that his or her father, grandfather, and \ngreat-grandfather farmed before them. They will be going after the \nyoung family, the husband-and-wife team with two or three young \nchildren and agriculture degrees from Kansas State, Nebraska, Colorado \nState, North Dakota State, all of the land-grant universities \nthroughout the high plains, and the list goes on. The young couple who \nwill return to the farm to raise their families because they believe in \nagriculture, farming, rural communities, and raising their children as \npart of the family in what is called rural America, what we in Kansas \ncall ``real America.'' They get up at 5:30 in the morning. They often \ndon't quit until 10 at night. They are working hard and maybe farming \n2,000 or 3,000 acres. But they are not rich simply because they farm \n2,000 or 3,000 acres. They are not rich simply because they are big \nfarmers. This business of trying to means-test farm programs based on \nthe size of an operation simply ignores reality in regard to production \nand what we produce for this country and the value of that production.\n  It is not the size of the operation. They are still young--I am \ntalking about the farm couple again--so they don't have the liquidity \nbuilt up in their operations that allows them to survive on their own \nthrough droughts that last 2, 3, 4, and, yes, even 5 years. They have \nkept the dream alive. They stayed in business. They secured the \noperating loans they needed because they and their bankers knew they \ncould depend on direct payments and also on crop insurance.\n  When you talk about that next generation farmer and where they will \ncome from and who will replace them, that is the issue. These folks are \nhighly educated. They are feeding this country and the world, but they \nare operating on the margin. The actions we take here have real-world \nimpact. Yes, conservation is important. We are increasing that funding. \nYes, nutrition is important, and we are increasing that program $5.5 \nbillion. Yes, renewable energy programs are important, and we need and \nwe are increasing the funding for these programs. But so are all those \nfarmers out there, especially that next generation.\n  To some here in the Senate, that young family farmer farming the \n2,000 or 3,000 acres is a big farmer. I don't know what that means. Are \nwe talking about aiming the farm program? I don't know. Senator \nChambliss has heard me say this before. I am not sure what that means. \nIf we are going to aim the farm program at only small family farmers? I \ndon't know whether that is somebody 5 foot 3 up in the Northeast part \nof the country who has maybe 40 acres, maybe has a pond and an orchard. \nObviously, the orchard would be organic. They are going to be farming \nspecialty crops now that have a program, over $2 billion worth, \nprobably more by the time we get through. Maybe that person is a small \nfamily farmer. I suspect he is sitting on his glider on his wraparound \nporch. He is only 5 foot 3 so he is a small farmer, and he only has 40 \nacres. He has a three-legged dog named Lucky and he pats him on his \nhead and reads his Gentleman's Quarterly. He is a retired airline pilot \nand his wife works downtown as a stockbroker.\n  I have a big farmer. He is 6 foot 3. He and his wife and three \nyoungsters farm 10,000 acres because it is more cost efficient. Maybe \nsome year they don't hit it very big. Maybe 1 out of 2 or 3 years they \nhit it really big. That production is vital to the food and fiber of \nthis country. So somebody at least has to stand up and say: Wait a \nminute. What are you trying to do in terms of means testing in regard \nto size?\n\n  Now, I used a little cynical or perhaps sarcastic example. I \napologize for that. But that is where we are. Not everybody in America \ncan take the time to come to the farm-to-market sales at their local \ncommunities. They are good. They are great. They are serving more \nvegetables, more fruit, more organic produce. I am all for that. But \nthat is not going to make up what this country needs in regards to 20 \npercent of our GDP and $64.4 billion worth of wheat, corn, sorghum and \ncotton program crops, and enabling in this country, again, every \nconsumer to spend only one thin dime out of their disposable income \ndollar for food.\n  Well, I have some good news for you. Yes, they farm a lot of acres \nout there, these aren't ``big farmers'' or so-called rich farmers, but \nthey are family farmers in every sense of the word, and they are \nstruggling to survive. So consequently, I hope we do not make the \nmistake again of pitting one region against the other or one kind of \ncost input situation or one kind of risk situation against the other. \nWe need truly a national program.\n  I hope before we start offering and passing amendments around here--\nonce we get to that point, if we can get to that point--because we \nthink we can save money or because we have had a questionable GAO \nreport that we think about the impact of our actions in regard to the \nreal world.\n  I commend our chairman, Chairman Harkin. I commend Senator Conrad and \nSenator Baucus on the Finance Committee and Ranking Members Chambliss \nand Grassley for moving us forward without cutting any direct payments. \nChairman Harkin has gone from managing the Labor-HHS appropriations \nbill on the floor--that is a tough challenge--to the Ag Committee farm \nbill markup in a day and a half--that is a record--to now floor \nconsideration of the farm bill in a few short weeks. That is quite a \ntask.\n  Now we find ourselves in a legislative or parliamentary quagmire in \nwhat we call filling up the tree. Well, I really think--I don't know, \nSenator Chambliss--have we agreed to about 10 amendments on each side, \n5 amendments on each side. As a matter of fact, we could take our \namendments, and they would be in order, and then\n\n[[Page S14123]]\n\nmaybe we could not consider somebody else's. But that is not fair, \ncertainly not in the Senate where everybody tries to amend everything. \nSo certainly we could reach some accommodation here with the leadership \nand with yourself and Chairman Harkin to say a reasonable number of \namendments could be offered--maybe 10, maybe 5, maybe 15. I do not \nknow. But obviously we have a long way to go before this bill is ready \nto become law.\n  The people who are waiting are the farmers and the ranchers and the \nbankers and the lenders. We are not going to consider this farm bill, \napparently, unless we have a cloture vote. That may be next week. Then \nwe will have other considerations on the floor as of next week. Well, \nthe farmers and the ranchers and their lenders are in the middle of \nplanning decisions, lending decisions. They cannot wait.\n  There is a school of thought: Oh, just extend the current farm bill. \nThe current farm bill does not work well, as I have said, again, in \nregard to a farmer who has lost his crop. We are sitting here in this \nlegislative briar patch while they wonder what on Earth we are doing \nback here in regard to trying to pass a farm bill.\n  There are still several things in the House and Senate bills that \nstill need some work.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, certainly I will be happy to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I say to Senator Roberts, you have a tremendous amount \nof experience from a legislative standpoint on farm bills. This is your \nwhich farm bill?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I think it is the seventh. But I did not count the \ntechnical corrections that, as I have said, for some cases that really \nrepresented a rewrite of the farm bill.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I know during my first year in the House, you were the \nchairman of the House Agriculture Committee. I was privileged to serve \non the House Agriculture Committee, and you chaired the committee that \nwrote the 1996 farm bill.\n  You talked about farm bills seeking to deliver funding to the small \nfarmer. That is such a difficult issue. It sounds good from a \nlegislative standpoint. It sounds like something we ought to be able to \ndo in practice when, in fact, it is so difficult to do, because what is \na small farmer? I am not sure what a small farmer is in Kansas. It is \nprobably different from what a small farmer is in Georgia. But a large \nfarmer participates in the production of agriculture in America just \nlike whatever that small farmer does.\n  I would simply ask the Senator, what is your thought on the \nproduction by a small farmer versus a large farmer? Who is the one who \nactually puts products into mainstream agriculture from the standpoint \nof the quantity of products that are put into agriculture? In other \nwords, what percentage of farmers produce the products?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Well, as I said before, some of our critics--and we \nshould have critics. We should have oversight. We are not doing \neverything right, that is for sure. And farm bills--I tell you, we \npassed the Rubicon. This is no longer a farm bill. This is a bill that \nshould be titled--I don't know what to put first--but conservation, \nnutrition, food stamps, rural development. We have a brand new section \nfor specialty crops, which is a good thing in that for too long they \nhave been out of the farm program.\n  I must admit I never had a specialty crop producer come in my office \nand want to be part of the farm program because, inevitably, you have \nto put up a lot of rules and regulations, although I understand this \none is done by State grant. I do not know whether we are going to have \na hodgepodge of different programs for specialty crops. But specialty \ncrops are a very important item.\n\n  So is that a small farmer. Do not misunderstand me. Small farmers \nhave a niche market. Small farmers are into organic produce. Small \nfarmers take their produce to a place such as Alexandria, which my wife \ntries to get me up in the morning to go and visit and at least purchase \nsome fresh fruits or vegetables. That is a good thing.\n  But we cannot rely on just those folks or small farmers as opposed to \nthe 15 percent of producers. Of course, the criticism is, they get most \nof the payments, but they produce most of the food and fiber--85 \npercent. If you add that up, as I have indicated, that is 20 percent of \nour GDP. That is $64.5 billion worth in regard to the program crops I \nmentioned earlier. Yet you would think that everybody just takes them \nfor granted. We are not an endangered species. We may be extinct in \nterms of the national media. Nobody pays any attention to production \nagriculture anymore. It is almost as if it is a bad thing to produce \nfood.\n  Go to your grocery store. I am always amazed when we have the \nopportunity to take foreign visitors to a typical American grocery \nstore. It just knocks their socks off and their eyes pop out in regard \nto the variety we have there. But much of that produce in that grocery \nstore on behalf of the consumer is produced by production agriculture. \nThat is not a bad thing.\n  That is the whole point I am trying to make. If you say, OK, somehow, \nif we go back and just limit it in size to a small family farmer, that \ndoes not work out on the High Plains. Yet Kansas is known as the wheat \nState, and we are known as the breadbasket of the world. The High \nPlains produce 1.5 billion bushels of wheat each year. That is what is \nat stake, not to mention the young farmers who do this.\n  Well, I am very hopeful that through this process we can improve our \nagricultural programs to better protect our farmers and ranchers in \ntimes of need and to provide assistance to both those domestically and \nglobally, increasing investments and stability in rural America. I know \nthis farm bill tries to do that.\n  In the end, this bill should be about the men and women in the fields \nand on the ranches working every day to provide the safest, most \nefficient food and fiber source we have seen in the history of the \nworld. Our farmers and ranchers would never put the seed in the ground \nif they did not have any faith and optimism that it would grow and they \nwould have a crop. We owe it to them to make sure we make this the best \nbill possible and do all we can to keep the ``farm'' in the farm bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I, first of all, extend my appreciation \nto the Senator from Kansas. Senator Roberts is not only a great \npersonal friend, but he is someone for whom I have tremendous respect \nin so many areas but in no area greater than agriculture. As I said \nearlier, we served in the House together. He was my chairman on the \nHouse Agriculture Committee. Now he is one of the leaders on the issue \nof agriculture in the Senate and somebody on whom I rely very much in \nmy role as ranking member, as I did when I was chairman over the last 2 \nyears.\n  I just want to say, as we went through this farm bill, with all the \ncomplexities we had to deal with in there, there was one issue that, \nfrankly, was a new addition to the farm bill mix, and that was the \nissue of average crop revenue--an option that is added in the commodity \ntitle. It does not look as if it is going to be of much benefit to \nSoutheastern farmers, but to farmers in the Midwest, it has the \npotential to be a very usable mechanism.\n  I thank Senator Roberts for taking that issue on and really getting \ninto the ``weeds'' and doing the necessary study and homework on the \nissue and coming up with some strong and valuable amendments that have \nmade that provision much better at the end of the day, when this bill \ncame out of committee, than it was when we started.\n  We are still going to have some debate on the provision as we come to \nthe floor now, but without his leadership, without his studying this \nissue, we would not be where we are. I know he feels exactly the way I \ndo. The Presiding Officer is, sure enough, one of those farmers who \nknow what getting dirt under their fingernails means, and I know he has \nan appreciation for this too.\n  We worked very hard over the last decade to improve the Crop \nInsurance Program. It is not perfect, but what we tried to do was to \nput the decision of how many crops to plant, how many acres of each one \nof those crops to plant, in the hands of the farmer and the banker who \nbanks that farmer and him having the ability to use the tools of farm \nprograms, plus the availability\n\n[[Page S14124]]\n\nof a good, solid crop insurance program and to take the decision off \nthe Government mandating to that farmer what he ought to plant and \nputting it in the hands of that farmer.\n  I think we have done that over the years. Still, it is not perfect. \nBut today there appear to be some folks who, for whatever reason, want \nto take some shots at the Crop Insurance Program. I know the Senator \nfrom Kansas feels just as strongly as I do about the fact that we do \nnot need to weaken the Crop Insurance Program. We need to strengthen \nthat program to, again, move away from dependence by farmers on the \nFederal Government and allow them to have the market dictate their \nstream of income and have safety nets in the form of agricultural \nprograms and crop insurance.\n  So I thank him for his leadership, and I thank him for the comments \nhe has made today relative to the product that came out of the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I wish to take just a minute to address \nan issue that appeared in the Washington Post earlier this week. In an \neditorial, the author made some significant statements about the Cotton \nProgram that exists in this current 2002 farm bill. Since we are in \nfarm bill season, we have a constant barrage of editorials that come \nout--some of them in favor of farm programs; most of them seem to think \nfarm programs are an easy target, and therefore they are very negative. \nThis one was very negative. But as with most people who write these \neditorials and publish them around the country, frankly, this editorial \nis filled with total inaccuracies. I want to talk about a couple of \nthose.\n  I want to set the record straight relative to what this author is \ntalking about because there is one particular issue in here that has \nbeen discussed over the last several years that is simply wrong.\n  First of all, this editorial takes on the Cotton Program in the 2002 \nfarm bill and says this program has a very negative effect--if you can \nimagine this--a very negative effect on the ability of cotton farmers \nin the West African countries of Benin, Burkino Faso, Chad, and \nMali. Now, in this editorial the author writes to start with:\n\n       For years, the Federal Government has guaranteed American \n     cotton producers about 72 cents a pound, even though the real \n     market price of cotton has averaged about 57 cents.\n\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. That is just a completely \ninaccurate statement. What the author is talking about is the fact that \nin the 2002 farm bill, there is a target price for cotton of 72.4 cents \na pound, but that simply does not guarantee a cotton farmer 72 cents a \npound. The only correlation between guaranteeing a cotton farmer a \nfloor on the price of cotton and the farm bill is the fact that there \nis a marketing loan available to a cotton farmer, and the marketing \nloan rate is 52 cents a pound.\n  That is the amount guaranteed to a cotton farmer from the 2002 farm \nbill. The fact is, the price of cotton today is in the range of 60-plus \ncents, so what that means is there would be no marketing loan benefits \navailable to a cotton farmer as long as the current price is above the \nmarketing loan rate.\n  So for some off-the-wall editorial writer to come in and say a cotton \nfarmer is guaranteed 72 cents a pound by the 2002 farm bill is \nmisleading and is typical of the statements that are made about farm \nbills by folks who have no idea what they are talking about.\n  Let me point out another inaccuracy. The author goes on to say:\n\n       Since 2002, market prices haven't even covered the cost of \n     producing cotton, but the amount of acres planted in cotton \n     has increased because the government guarantees a higher \n     price.\n\n  Again, the author of this editorial simply has not done their \nhomework.\n  Here are the actual facts: Cotton acreage in the United States in \n2002 was 17.2 million--17.2 million. In 2007--this year--cotton acres \nin the United States are 10.5 million. Instead of cotton acres \nincreasing in the United States, we have seen a 39-percent reduction in \nthe number of acres planted from 2002 to 2007.\n  Furthermore, the author goes on to say:\n\n       Who benefits from the current system of cotton subsidies?\n\n  His answer to his own question:\n\n       About 20,000 American cotton producers, with an average \n     annual income of more than $125,000.\n\n  Let me tell my colleagues who really benefits from the cotton program \nin America as we know it today. We have in the United States today \nabout 20,000 cotton producers. Those cotton producers deliver their \ncotton to gins where it is then processed, and the outcome of ginning \ncotton is a cotton bale. The cotton bale then goes into the marketing \nstream, where it can be sold to domestic cotton mills or exported, as \nmost of our cotton is today. Unfortunately, all of our textile mills \nthat were located all over the Northeast and then in the Southeast \ntoday are located in either the Caribbean region or in China or in \nVietnam or elsewhere. Therefore most of our cotton is exported. But the \nfarms and businesses directly involved in the production, distribution, \nand processing of cotton employ more than 230,000 Americans and result \nin direct business revenues of more than $27 billion.\n\n       Additional economic multipliers through the broader \n     economy, direct and indirect employment surpasses 520,000 \n     workers with economic activity in excess of $120 billion.\n\n  Now, the author of the editorial makes this statement:\n\n       The effects in the cotton-growing regions of West Africa \n     are dramatic.\n\n  The author is talking about the U.S. cotton program's impact on West \nAfrican countries. What they say is, the production of cotton in the \nUnited States under the current farm bill dictates to cotton growers in \nAfrica what they can get for a pound of cotton. Again, nothing could be \nfurther from the truth because I have already noted what happened \nrelative to the decrease in the production acres of cotton in the \nUnited States. Well, guess what has happened in other parts of the \nworld. If we are having such a negative impact on producers in Africa, \ndoes it not stand to reason we are also having a negative impact on \ncotton growers in Brazil and in China and in India and in other cotton-\ngrowing areas? I do not think it would have just a negative impact in \nWest Africa.\n  The fact is, in China, in 2002, the cotton acreage was 10.3 million \nacres. In 2007, cotton acreage in China was up to 15.1 million acres. \nDuring this time that we have been negatively impacting West African \ncotton growers, China has increased its cotton acreage by 50 percent. \nIn 2002, India had cotton acreage of 18.9 million acres. In 2007, that \nwas up to 23.5 million acres, an increase of 24 percent. In Brazil, in \n2002, 1.8 million acres of cotton were planted. In 2007, 2.8 million \nacres of cotton were planted in Brazil. Again, up 55 percent.\n  For the author of this editorial to say the United States cotton \nprogram is having such a negative impact on four West African countries \nis totally ridiculous. This editorial failed to mention the fact that \nin this farm bill the Senate has before it for consideration, we \nprovided significant reforms in the cotton program itself to reduce \namber box government expenditures. The administration of the cotton \nmarketing loan program is reformed to improve the efficiency of the \nprogram. The target price for cotton is the only target price in the \nSenate bill that is reduced. We thereby save $150 million over ten \nyears.\n  The trade title also includes provisions that repeal authority for \nthe supplier credit and GSM-103 program, measures that are necessary \nfor the United States to comply with the Brazilian cotton case and the \nWTO. That creates a savings of $50 million. Also, we have significantly \nreformed the payment limitation provision, and the Adjusted Gross \nIncome limitations are reformed, which saves $456 million.\n\n  None of this is mentioned in this grossly mischaracterized, \ninaccurate article that is aimed solely at a program that provides over \n520,000 American jobs.\n  If we examine the production of cotton in China during the same 2002 \nthrough 2007 period that I alluded to a minute ago, China increased by \n57 percent, India has increased by 122 percent, Brazil increased by 79 \npercent, and the U.S. increased cotton production by 6 percent--6 \npercent versus 57, 122, and 79 percent in those other three countries.\n  The article insinuates U.S. cotton production alone resulted in the \noverproduction of cotton when, in fact, U.S.\n\n[[Page S14125]]\n\ncotton production in 2006 represented only 17.7 percent of the world \nproduction and is estimated to be just 15.1 percent in 2007.\n  One other fact that is conveniently left out of this article is, if, \nin fact, the U.S. cotton program has a direct impact on the C-4 \ncountries in West Africa, it was not that many years ago when the price \nof cotton worldwide was $1 per pound--$1. There is no mention of the \nfact that if we had a negative impact, certainly we had a positive \nimpact when the price of cotton was $1 a pound.\n  As one would expect, the editorial cites economic studies by \norganizations with anticotton agendas that show U.S. cotton production \nimpacting world prices. However, several independent analyses show \nminimal price impacts attributable to the U.S. cotton program on these \nWest African countries and any other country. The most recent economic \nstudy by researchers at Texas Tech University show world price impacts \nof 3 percent or less attributable to the U.S. cotton program.\n  West African cotton farmers receive less than 40 percent of the world \nmarket price. Why is that the case? These West African countries are \nrampant with fraud and corruption and the issues that typically are \npresent in underdeveloped countries. Growers in China and India are \npaid between 90 and 100 percent of the world price for their cotton, so \nsomebody other than the West African cotton farmers is receiving the \ndifference. It is pretty obvious there is a lot of corruption going on \nin the West African cotton industry. But, again, this article \nconveniently fails to mention that point.\n  West African cotton yields are going down, while cotton yields in \nother countries are increasing.\n  Here are the real facts that are conveniently left out of this \narticle:\n  From 2001 to 2005, the average yield in the C-4 countries fell by 15 \npounds per acre, down to 353 pounds per acre. Average yields in India \nincreased by 77 pounds per acre. Average yields in China grew by 272 \npounds per acre. Brazilian yields have increased by 668 pounds per acre \nin 10 years.\n  West African farmers also have refused to take the latest, most \ntechnologically advanced assets that are available to them to utilize \nin the growing of cotton--again, a fact that the author conveniently \nleft out of this article. They continue to reject genetically enhanced \ncrops, while the adoption of those genetically enhanced crops in China, \nIndia, and Brazil allow their farmers to reap the benefits of improved \nyields and lower costs. The C-4 countries have little in the way of a \ntextile industry, and the textile industry would like to have cotton \nclose by. That is why we are seeing a huge increase in the production \nof cotton in China, for example.\n  What has the U.S. actually done from the standpoint of impacting the \nWest African countries? Here is exactly what we have done--another fact \nthat is conveniently left out of this article. The United States is \nengaged in a number of outreach activities with West African countries \nthat began in 2004 which are aimed at raising their agricultural \nproductivity, spurring economic growth, and alleviating hunger and \npoverty. These efforts are coordinated by the U.S. cotton industry, \nwith USAID, the Trade Representative's Office, and the Millennium \nChallenge.\n  Now, I could have picked out another crop, be it corn, soybeans, or \nwhatever crop is under attack right now, but this just happened to be a \ntotally inaccurate editorial that appeared in the Washington Post \nearlier this week. Unfortunately it is pretty typical of the criticism \nthat is leveled at farm programs by people who have no concept of the \ncommitment that farmers and ranchers in America--be they a small farmer \nor a large farmer--make to ensure the development of their land and \nproduction of quality agricultural products that ultimately wind up in \nthe grocery store, which allows all Americans to spend less than 10 \ncents out of every disposable dollar on food products. That is the \nlowest--the lowest amount of money that is being spent on food products \nby any country in the world, and that is the benefit the American \nconsumer gets from our agricultural producers.\n  As we move forward over the next couple of days, I am very hopeful my \ncolleagues will come to the floor and talk about what amendments they \nhave. I see the distinguished Senator from Colorado is here to perhaps \ntalk about some issues he has of concern.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I note with some interest that \n``agriculture'' does not appear in the title. It is called the Food and \nEnergy Security Act. I think that in this particular piece of \nlegislation, we are missing the boat, with commodity prices up, doing \nvery well, and generally rural America is in a better position--at \nleast in Colorado--than it has been in recent history. I think this \nwould have been a good time to bring forward some reform in the \nagricultural programs. I am disappointed we don't have any reform in \nthis particular piece of legislation. I do have some amendments I would \nlike to be considered.\n  I noticed that the chairman of the committee said no Republican \namendments are coming forward. That is not true, the amendment tree has \nbeen filled. That means if you bring an amendment, you cannot call it \nup. You don't have that opportunity. So we have some very serious \namendments that I would like to bring up for discussion on this bill. \nOur staff has been working some with the agricultural staff on some of \nthese amendments. We think we will reach agreement on some of them. \nThere may be several on which I would want to have votes. These are \nserious amendments which I think are important--items that ought to be \nbrought up before the Senate for discussion and ought to be reviewed. I \nthink they have some value in what we are trying to propose.\n  I am anxiously hoping that we can put the bill in a posture so that \namendments can be applied. I know the ranking Republican, along with \nSenator Harkin, have worked hard on this piece of legislation. There \nare some good things in it; they are not all bad. I appreciate their \neffort on what they worked on together.\n  There are some things that continue to concern me: We have expansion \nof Davis-Bacon; we have tax increases and some budget gimmicks to make \nit look as if there is not as much spending as there is. Frankly, there \nis a lack of reform. I haven't made up my mind on how I will vote on \nfinal passage of this bill. I am waiting to see what it will look like \nafter amendments have been adopted on the floor, if any, if we get an \nopportunity to do that. Hopefully, we can pass this bill in a way that \nwon't adversely impact our trade agreements.\n  This is another concern that gets brought up in relation to this \nissue. We have to be careful we don't do things that adversely affect \nour trade agreements, which come back and haunt us and reverse policies \nthat may be decided and be applied to the agricultural industry and \nlose some of our export markets, which are so very important. Colorado \nis one of those States in the agriculture area that have benefited by \nthese free-trade agreements--NAFTA in particular--and we continue to \nexport our beef and our grain. They continue to be a valuable part of \nour economy. Agriculture is important to the State of Colorado. But if \nwe can move more toward a market-based way of managing our agricultural \nproduce, I think we would be much better off.\n  So every piece of legislation that has come up in the Senate has a \ntax increase in it, or they call it revenue enhancers. Many of them \nare, frankly, tax increases, or they may be fee increases.\n  I want to take a little bit of time on the floor to talk about tax \nreform. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the issue of taxes. This \nissue is very important to the hard-working men and women of our great \ncountry. I think we need to look seriously at tax reform.\n  I believe the Federal tax burden is excessive and overly intrusive. \nReform of the IRS and the current system is long overdue. In recent \nyears, it has become abundantly clear that we have lost sight of the \nfact that the fundamental purpose of our tax system is to raise \nrevenues to fund our Government. In its current application, the U.S. \ntax system distorts the economic decisions of families and businesses, \nleading to an inefficient allocation of resources and hindering \neconomic growth. Our tax system has become unstable and unpredictable. \nFrequent changes to the\n\n[[Page S14126]]\n\ntax code have caused volatility, and it is harmful to the economy and \ncreates additional compliance costs.\n  The tax system was originally intended to be an efficient system \ndesigned to raise revenues for national defense, social programs, and \nvital Government services. However, the current tax system is now so \ncomplex that approximately $150 billion is spent each year by U.S. \ntaxpayers and the Federal Government just to make sure taxes are \ntallied and paid correctly.\n  This is an enormous expense and is a waste of resources. At present, \nthe United States has instituted a tax system that thwarts basic \neconomic decisions, punishes wise and productive investments, and \nrewards those who work less and borrow more. As it stands, the quagmire \nthat is our existing Tax Code penalizes savings, contributes to the \never-increasing cost of health insurance, and undermines our global \ncompetitiveness.\n  More disturbing is the fact that Americans spend more than 3.5 \nbillion hours doing their taxes, which is the equivalent of hiring \nalmost 2 million new IRS employees--more than 20 times the agency's \ncurrent workforce. On average, Americans spend the equivalent of more \nthan half of one workweek--26 hours--on their taxes each year, not to \nmention the amount of time they work to pay the taxes themselves. At \nthe end of the day, despite our lengthy codified tax law, there is no \nevidence to suggest that Americans really know how much they should be \npaying in taxes in any given year, or why. The Tax Code should aspire \nto be clear, transparent, rather than multifarious and convoluted. \nEverybody should be able to have a basic understanding of the Tax Code, \nknowing how and why they are taxed.\n  The Tax Code's constant phaseins and phaseouts are a nuisance at \nbest, and a negative force at worst, in the daily economic lives of \nAmerican families and businesses, which include farmers and ranchers. \nMoreover, taxpayers with the same income, family situation, and other \nkey characteristics often face different tax burdens. This differing \ntreatment creates a perception of unfairness in the Tax Code and has \nleft many Americans discouraged. At present, how much or little \ntaxpayers pay in tax is sometimes dependent on where they happen to \nlive and the choices made by their employers.\n\n  In 1986, President Ronald Reagan, a true visionary in this area, \nsigned the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which reduced top marginal \nindividual tax rates from 50 percent to 28 percent and increased the \nstandard deduction and reduced the top corporate tax from 50 percent to \n34 percent, and in so doing, this reform act simplified the Tax Code, \nbroadening the income tax base, allowing for lower marginal rates, and \ncurtailing the use of individual tax shelters.\n  While the 1986 act was a step in the right direction, unfortunately, \nit didn't produce a long-lasting transformation of the tax system. \nToday, our tax system bears little resemblance to the simple, low-rate \nsystem promised by the 1986 reform. This is due to constant tweaking \nover the years, as we are seeing in these legislative proposals coming \nbefore the Senate in this particular piece of legislation. More than \n100 different acts of Congress have made nearly 15,000 changes to the \nTax Code.\n  I support broad-based tax reform and a simplified tax system. It is \nmy belief that any reform to the current tax system should benefit the \nmiddle class. The vast majority of taxpayers are the middle class, and \nthey have borne the burden of the current system. While I was a member \nof the Colorado Legislature, we implemented a 5-percent flat tax for \nColorado. I believe we should take a similar approach on the Federal \nlevel.\n  While I would be willing to consider a flat tax, a sales tax, and \nother plans on the Federal level, it is important that any replacement \nplan be simple and fair. The replacement system must provide tax relief \nfor working Americans. It must protect the rights of taxpayers and \nreduce tax collection abuse. Most important, a new system must \neliminate the bias against saving and investment and promote economic \ngrowth and job creation.\n  No one can deny that our Tax Code is in dire need of reform. Its \ncomplexity, lack of clarity, unfairness, and disproportionate influence \non behavior have caused great frustration. Our current Tax Code has \nbeen shaped by goals other than simplicity, by intentions other than \nhelping the taxpayer plan ahead, and by objectives other than expanding \nour economy. Not only has it failed to keep pace with our growing and \ndynamic economy, frequently changes have made it unstable and \nunpredictable.\n  Years of hodgepodge Government interference and ad hoc meddling have \nleft our Tax Code in shambles. While we cannot change the past, we can \nlearn valuable lessons from the same and remedy our mistakes. If we \ndon't take steps to immediately simplify and reform our Tax Code, it \nwill become more complex, more unfair, and less conducive to our \neconomy's future growth. Small reforms are not enough. A total overhaul \nof the existing system is the only chance we have to get our economy \nand deficits back on track.\n  We must act now. We have a responsibility to our constituents and \nthis Nation to resolve the predicament in which our current tax system \nhas put us in. If we here in Congress don't act sooner rather than \nlater in reforming our tax system, it will become more complex and \ncumbersome.\n  Mr. President, here we are again, and we have a piece of legislation \nbefore us that meddles with the Tax Code, takes piecemeal action on the \nTax Code, and leads us more into a deeper quagmire of the complicated \ncode. One of the aspects of our economy that gets impacted more than \nany other is the small business sector. They have to struggle with \nthese. Large corporations have accountants and lawyers on staff. It is \nnot a problem for them. It is a problem but certainly not as great a \nproblem as for a small business, which may be a man-and-wife operation, \nor a business run out of a home, or it may be just a small workforce, a \nsmall business with 10, 15, 30 in the workforce. Many times, we look at \nit as we would a ranch, where it is just a family operation or a farm \noperation. They are the ones who are disproportionately impacted by a \ncomplicated Tax Code.\n  Here we go again, in this particular farm bill, raising taxes and \npiecemealing the Tax Code. I hope the Congress--certainly, it is too \nlate in this session--in the following sessions can come forward with \nserious attempts to simplify our Tax Code to make it fair and to not be \npiecemealing it, as we are seeing it in this particular farm bill and \nother pieces of legislation that have been brought up on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  It is a challenge. It is not an easy task. I have been a part of \nthose discussions on simplifying it, and there are many perspectives. \nIt is becoming essential, and it is getting to the point where I don't \nthink we can continue to ignore the challenges because of the adverse \nimpact it is having on the citizens of this country and the difficulty \nthey have in understanding the Tax Code and how taxes adversely affect \nproductivity, such as farmers and ranchers, which we are trying to \naddress in this bill, and small businesses throughout the country that \nare trying to do their best to be able to make a living for their \nfamilies.\n  So I felt we needed to take a little time to talk about taxes. Again, \nI am seeing a pattern in this legislation that really concerns me.\n  As I said earlier in my introductory remarks, I have not decided if I \nam going to vote for the farm bill. Certainly, it is not a perfect \npiece of legislation. We have to weigh all aspects. Certainly, there \nare some provisions in this legislation about which I have concerns. I \nhope the majority leader and the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, \nworking with ranking members, can get us off this stalemate so \nRepublicans can move forward and can offer amendments. I have a number \nof them that I wish to have an opportunity to offer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for no more than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Trade Policy\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the House of Representatives today passed a \nbilateral trade agreement with the\n\n[[Page S14127]]\n\ncountry of Peru. I was disappointed that there was another ratification \nin our Government of another job-killing trade agreement, a trade \nagreement that will mean more unsafe food at our kitchen tables and \nmore unsafe toys, consumer products, in our children's bedrooms.\n  We have seen this over and over again. We saw it with NAFTA in 1993 \nwhen the year before NAFTA was passed, we had a trade deficit in this \ncountry of $38 billion. Last year, the trade deficit was literally 20 \ntimes that amount. President Bush I said every $1 billion of trade \ndeficit or surplus translates into 13,000 jobs. So a $1 billion trade \nsurplus means a growth of 13,000 jobs in our country; a $1 billion \ntrade deficit means a loss of 13,000 jobs.\n  Do the math. When our trade deficit goes from $38 billion in 1992 to \nupstairs of $700 billion in 2006, we know our trade policy is not \nworking. It is not working for our workers, it is not working when we \nhave layoffs in Lima, Canton, Youngstown, Toledo, or Dayton. We have \nthese layoffs, and look what it does to police, fire, and schools, \nlayoff of teachers. All that comes from a failed trade policy.\n  Yet the House of Representatives again today passed another trade \npolicy. We not only know that trade policy does not work for our \nworkers and does not work for our communities where we have plant \nclosings or, short of that, layoffs of large numbers of workers and \nservices and our communities decline, from Galion to Gallipolis, from \nAvon Lake to Buckeye Lake, but we also know what these trade policies \nmean to consumer protection and food safety.\n  Almost every week for the last several months, we have seen a new \nrecall. It might be toys, it might be tires, it might be toothpaste, it \nmight be vitamins. Yet, literally, almost every week there seems to be \na recall, often from China, but not always.\n  We are setting ourselves up. Think of it this way: In 2006, we \nimported $288 billion worth of goods from China. That $288 billion, \ntens of billions of dollars--if my math is right, that is about $700 \nmillion or $800 million every day from China--tens of billions of \ndollars for toys, consumer products, and food products.\n  Of those tens of billions of dollars, think about it this way: When \nwe buy products made in China, the People's Republic of China, a \nCommunist government, we know that Government puts no real emphasis on \nfood safety, on consumer product safety, or on worker safety. So we are \nbuying products from a country that puts no real premium on the safety \nof those products we are buying. That is the first problem.\n  The second problem is, when we import large numbers of toys, for \ninstance--let's take toys as an example because we have seen that over \nand over--when we import large numbers of toys from China, we know \nAmerican companies such as Mattel go to China and subcontract with \nChinese companies. Then Mattel and these other companies say to the \nChinese subcontractors: You have to cut costs, you have to cut corners, \nyou have to make these products cheaper. What do they do? They use lead \npaint. Why? Because lead paint is cheaper, it is easier to apply, it \ndries faster, and it is shinier.\n  Mattel then brings these products back into the United States after \nthey have told their Chinese subcontractor: You have to cut costs, you \nhave to cut prices, you have to cut corners. They bring the products \nback into the United States with no corporate responsibility on their \npart. They bring them into our country. These toys end up in our \nchildren's bedrooms, these food products end up on our kitchen tables, \nand we have an inspection system that is increasingly falling apart, \nincreasingly disintegrating.\n  We have fewer inspectors than we have ever had at the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission. That Commission, when it began two or three \ndecades ago, was twice the size it is today, and we were not even \nimporting products from China or other places around the world. They \nwere inspecting tires two decades ago, mostly made in the United \nStates. They were inspecting toys two decades ago, mostly made in the \nUnited States under pretty good conditions.\n  Today they have significantly less inspectors and tens of billions of \ndollars of products coming into this country from China, which doesn't \nhave a consumer product safety commission of any import and doesn't \nhave a food regulatory system, which we hold so dear in this country.\n  It is a perfect storm: You trade, buy tens of billions of dollars \nfrom a country that doesn't have consumer product safety rules, you \nhave an American company importing products and is pushing, saying, you \nhave to cut costs, pushing quality and safety aside, and then you have \na Consumer Product Safety Commission in this country underfunded by the \nBush administration, weakened by the administrators and the White \nHouse, that does not protect American children.\n\n  That is the problem with what we have seen at the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission. That is why it is time for Nancy Nord, the \nchairperson of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, to step aside. \nShe is the acting chairperson but, unfortunately, we see a lot more \ninaction from her and from that Commission than action. It is time to \nput a chairperson in place who is not satisfied with saying: Well, we \nare doing the best we can. ``The best we can'' is a chairperson who \nunderstands his or her primary responsibility is to protect the safety \nof our children and the safety of our families.\n  Let me go a little further. Back around the time of Halloween, I \nasked Ohio Ashland University professor Jeff Weidenheimer to test 22 \nHalloween products for lead. He is a chemistry professor. He has looked \ninto lead-based paint applied to consumer products, to toys, for some \ntime.\n  The acceptable level of lead, according to the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission, is 600 parts per million for adults, and for \nchildren, the Consumer Product Safety Commission says the acceptable \nlevel is zero.\n  What Professor Weidenheimer found, of these 22 Halloween products, 3 \nout of the 22 were not safe. They had much too high levels of lead. For \nexample, the Halloween Frankenstein cup, which I mentioned on the \nSenate floor before, contained 39,000 parts per million of lead. Again, \nthe upper level of safety for adults is 600 parts per million. This was \n39,000 parts per million. This was a Halloween Frankenstein cup that \nlikely children are going to put to their lips and some of that lead \nwill clearly end up in their system.\n  Forty years ago, we banned lead in paint. Now we need to ban lead in \ntoys. We need to get tough enforcing safety standards abroad so we will \nnot see these unsafe products coming in. We need to, most importantly, \nhold responsible those importers who are bringing those products into \nthe United States, subsequent to their pushing their contractors to cut \ncorners and cut costs. At the same time, we need a Consumer Product \nSafety Commission that is going to work.\n  A week or so ago, Chairwoman Nord of the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission was lobbying against the legislation submitted by our \ncolleague, Senator Pryor from Arkansas, that will make the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission work better. She said they have an adequate \nbudget, even though their budget is half of what it used to be when it \nwas an agency on the side of the public.\n  Everyone agrees on one point: We want more trade with countries \naround the world, but we want fair trade. First, more than anything, we \nwant a trade policy that protects our workers, protects our country, \nprotects our communities, protects our families on food safety issues, \nprotects our children on consumer product safety issues. It is our \nfirst responsibility as Senators to protect our families and make our \nfamilies safe. Part of the way to do that is a very different trade \npolicy. Part of the way to do that is a very different Consumer Product \nSafety Commission. Part of the way to do that is for Chairwoman Nancy \nNord to step aside and put somebody in whose first, primary \nresponsibility that he or she will recognize is protecting American \nfamilies.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S14128]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I wish to discuss an amendment today \nauthorizing the Minor Use Animal Drug Program. This is a program which \ncarries out valuable research at land-grant institutions across the \ncountry for veterinary pharmaceutical research, such as research being \ndone right now at the University of Wyoming.\n  This program is currently being administered by the USDA in \ncooperation with the Food and Drug Administration. It is identified as \nNational Research Project No. 7. It is called NRSP-7.\n  Minor species industries nationwide represent about $1.5 billion in \nState and local farm revenues each year. Processing and export of minor \nspecies food and fiber projects represent an additional $4.5 billion in \nrevenue each year. Now, individually, these minor species represent \ndrug markets which are too small to cover the high cost of developing \nnew veterinary drugs. As a result, few approved drugs are available to \ntreat diseases in these minor animal species.\n  The USDA established a national Minor Use Animal Drug Program in \n1982. So over the last 25 years, this program has been used to \nfacilitate research for the drug approval process. NRSP-7 offers an \nopportunity for producers of minor animal species, such as sheep, \ngoats, fish, and honeybees, to have veterinary drugs approved for their \nuse. This project is of particular importance to the American sheep \nindustry and to the people in the State of Wyoming. The American sheep \nindustry produces a superior product. Lamb is a delicacy around the \nworld. In fact, our recent guest, the President of France, enjoyed an \nAmerican lamb dinner when he dined at the White House on Tuesday \nevening. I have no doubt his meal was exquisite thanks to the American \nranchers who prepared those animals for the plate.\n  There are over 69,000 sheep producers in the United States. Those \nproducers care for their animals and they produce valuable wool and \nlamb products for the country and the world. In Wyoming, 900 sheep \nproducers care for close to a half million sheep. There are almost as \nmany sheep in Wyoming as there are people, so it is almost a one-to-one \nratio.\n  Nationwide, the sheep industry may be considered minor. Drug \ncompanies may not see profit potential in the sheep industry based on \nthe nationwide numbers. But in Wyoming, we see opportunity, opportunity \nin the sheep industry, and we see a pressing need for development of \nveterinary drugs to promote growth of the sheep industry.\n  The industry is a big part of our heritage in Wyoming. Sheepherders \nhave been incredible stewards of rangelands for more than a century. In \nWyoming, we believe in a ranching way of life. We believe every man or \nwoman who has the courage to work hard on the range can build a future \nfor his or for her family, and they have. The sheep industry has \nsupported that dream for thousands of people in Wyoming over the \ndecades.\n  Sheep ranchers take care of their animals, and their animals provide \na valuable industry. Treating animals for injury or for disease is a \nmajor component of a successful ranching business. The Minor Use Animal \nDrug Program offers sheep ranchers the same opportunity as other \nlivestock operators to maintain a healthy herd and healthy businesses.\n  Having the right drugs to treat animal health problems is of great \nimportance. New threats evolve each year and research carried out by \nthe Minor Use Animal Drug Program helps keep the sheep industry up to \ndate. To give a for-instance, NRSP's No. 7 research has led to approval \nof three drugs for respiratory diseases and two drugs for lung worms in \nsheep. Researchers are currently testing florfenicol for respiratory \ninfections and a progesterone delivery method for breeding purposes.\n  Without sheep-specific research produced for these drugs, producers \nare left to guess at adjusting the doses from what they use in cattle \nand other animals. This can lead to problems of antibiotic resistance \nand it raises questions about drug residues in meat products. NRSP-7 \nprovides the right research on appropriate drugs for responsible uses \nso that sheep producers know they are getting the best treatment for \ntheir animals.\n  The United States is far behind the rest of the world in vaccines, in \nreproductive aids, and in approved antibiotics for sheep and goats. \nNRSP-7 gives American sheep producers a fighting chance to keep up with \nthe competition, and it is international competition.\n  It is not only the sheep industry that benefits from NRSP-7. For the \nlast 25 years, NRSP-7 has facilitated drug approvals for species as \nvaried as pheasants, quail, bighorn sheep, catfish, goats, partridges, \nlobster, shrimp, and the list goes on. At a time in our country when \nquestions about animal disease are running rampant--when we face \nthreats from avian influenza, from brucellosis, and from West Nile \nvirus--it is the role of good government to protect human safety and \nanimal safety.\n  Having well-researched and approved drugs at the ready to meet animal \ndisease threats needs to be a priority for our Nation. NRSP-7 provides \nan opportunity for Government to create a level playing field for all \nagriculture sectors. Authorizing the Minor Use Animal Drug Program \nhelps prepare us for the future and for the future of agriculture \nproduction.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this effort, this amendment to \nauthorize NRSP-7, the Minor Use Animal Drug Program.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the other day the administration issued a \nveto threat against the farm bill that is pending before the body. More \nprecisely, the President didn't say he would veto the bill, his aides \nsaid they would recommend to the President the veto if the bill that is \ncurrently pending before the Senate went to the President.\n  We all know what that means in this town. It may sound like \ngobbledygook to almost anybody listening, but there is a nuance to what \nthey are saying. The nuance is they are seeking negotiating leverage. \nThat is what this is all about.\n  At the end of the day, I don't think the President is going to veto \nthe farm bill. I think that would be a very unwise move on his part. \nBut I rise today to talk about the chief complaint they raised. They \nasserted there is too much spending in this farm bill, so I thought it \nmight be useful to look at the President's proposal and how much it \nspends compared to the spending that is in this farm bill. Since they \nare asserting there is too much spending in the farm bill that has \npassed out of the Senate Agriculture Committee, that is before the \nwhole body now, what about their proposal?\n  Here is what I found. These are not my numbers. These are the \nestimates of the Congressional Budget Office. They say the bill before \nus that came out of the Senate Agriculture Committee will cost $285.8 \nbillion over the next 5 years. But look at what they found the \nPresident's bill would cost over 5 years. Again, this is not my \nestimate. These are the professional estimates of the Congressional \nBudget Office. The Congressional Budget Office said the President's \nproposal over 5 years would cost $287.2 billion. In other words, the \nPresident's proposal costs more than the proposal that came out of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee. I wish to repeat that. The President's \nproposal costs more, over the 5 years, than does the proposal that came \nout of the Senate Agriculture Committee.\n  This is only a 5-year bill. I know the President's people tried to \nmake it into a 10-year bill, but it is not a 10-year bill, it is a 5-\nyear bill. The 5-year scoring of the legislation that came out of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee by the Congressional Budget Office says \nthe bill before us would cost $285.8 billion and the President's \nproposal would cost $287.2 billion. So if our proposal costs too much, \nwhat does he say about his own proposal? What do they say about the \nproposal they have advanced?\n  Interestingly, in addition, we actually came up with the pay-fors. We\n\n[[Page S14129]]\n\nhave completely offset the cost of the bill that is before the Senate. \nThe Congressional Budget Office has so certified. They say we do not \nadd a dime to the deficit. In fact, what they do say is we have a \nslight savings at the end of the day, $61 million over 5 years. That is \nwhat they say about our bill.\n  The President has never said how he would pay for his bill. So we \nhave an irony here. The President criticizes our bill as costing too \nmuch. His costs more. We have specified how this bill would be paid \nfor. He has never specified how his would be paid for.\n  On this question of the cost of this bill, we now have the latest \ncalculations. These are the full and final calculations of what the \nforecast was at the time the last farm bill was written and the \nforecast now for this farm bill. It is very instructive. Again, these \nare the estimates of the Congressional Budget Office and the \nCongressional Research Service. These are not my numbers. These are not \nmade-up numbers, unlike the numbers the White House used the other day, \nin which they tried to make a 5-year bill into a 10-year bill. It is \nnot a 10-year bill. It is a 5-year bill. When you compare it on a 5-\nyear basis to the White House proposal, our proposal costs less.\n  This extends the analysis and looks back at what the Congressional \nBudget Office forecasts the current farm bill would cost in \nrelationship to all Federal spending. They said, at the time, the farm \nbill would be 2.33 percent, 2\\1/3\\ percent of total Federal spending. \nThis is what they are saying the new farm bill will cost over the 5 \nyears of its life: 1.87 percent of total Federal outlays. In other \nwords, the proportion of total Federal spending in this farm bill is \nlower than the proportion of total Federal spending of the previous \nfarm bill.\n  Agriculture's share of total Federal spending is going down and going \ndown about quite a bit--about 20 percent. These are facts. In addition, \nregarding the commodity programs that are the ones that draw all the \nattention and all the controversy, the projection, when the last farm \nbill was written, was that would take up three-quarters of 1 percent of \nFederal spending. It turned out it didn't cost that much. It turns out \nit was one-half of 1 percent of Federal spending.\n  But look at what the Congressional Budget Office is telling us this \nfarm bill will cost in the commodity area. They are saying it will only \nbe one-quarter of 1 percent of total Federal spending; one-half as much \nas the previous farm bill. I didn't see the White House mention that. I \ndidn't see them mention this farm bill is going to cost less as a share \nof total Federal spending than the last farm bill. I didn't see them \nsay the commodity provisions that are controversial provisions, that \nwere projected when the last farm bill was written to absorb three-\nquarters of 1 percent of Federal spending and wound up costing less, \nonly one-half of 1 percent of Federal spending, is now, if this bill is \napproved, going to consume only one-quarter of 1 percent of Federal \nspending.\n  It would be nice if facts were at the basis of an analysis of this \nlegislation. It would be nice if we were dealing with an accurate \ndescription of what this bill costs, in comparison to what the \nPresident's proposal costs. That would be a useful debate to have. \nBecause, as I have indicated, this bill before us costs less than the \nPresident's proposal; in fact, $1.4 billion less than the President's \nproposal. And he is accusing us of having too much money in this bill? \nCome on.\n  In addition, we have completely offset the cost. This doesn't add one \ndime to the Federal deficit or debt. We have completely offset the \ncost. The President has never presented a plan for paying for his \nproposal, which costs even more.\n  In addition, I want to rivet this point: When you look back at the \nlast farm bill, CBO said it would consume 2\\1/3\\ percent of total \nFederal spending. It turned out to be somewhat less. On commodities, \nthey said it would cost three-quarters of 1 percent. Look at this bill. \nThis bill now is estimated to only cost 1.87 percent of total Federal \nspending and the commodity provisions one-quarter of 1 percent.\n  What does this bill do? This bill is critically important to the \nnational economy. It is critically important to people all across \nAmerica. Sixty-six percent of this bill goes to nutrition, 9 percent of \nthis bill goes to conservation, so 75 percent of the cost of this bill \ngoes to nutrition and conservation. Those are needs that are equally \nand evenly spread all across America. Certainly, there are parts of the \ncountry that need more help and some less help but very broadly that \nmoney is evenly distributed across the country. The commodity \nprovisions are less than 14 percent of the cost of this bill, and we \nnow know they will consume only one-quarter of 1 percent of Federal \nspending.\n  In addition, this legislation has a critical national priority--to \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil. Mr. President, $2.5 billion in \nthis bill is dedicated to reducing our dependence on foreign oil, to \ndevelop cellulosic energy that can help transform America's position in \nthe world. Think how different our country would be if, instead of \nspending $270 billion a year buying foreign oil from Saudi Arabia and \nKuwait and Venezuela and all the rest of the major oil producers, so \nmany of whom are in unstable parts of the world--how different our \ncountry would be if that $270 billion were spent here, how different it \nwould be if, instead of relying on the Middle East, we could turn \ntoward the Midwest and the Southeast and the Southwest and the \nnortheast for the energy supplies of America, how different it would \nlook if that $270 billion, instead of going to Dubai, was going to \nAmerica.\n  This bill is important for the country. When the President issues a \nveto threat, saying there is too much money in it, and his proposal \ncosts even more, they have some explaining to do. They have some \nexplaining to do.\n  I hope my colleagues are paying attention.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to once again thank the ranking \nmember of the Senate Agriculture Committee, the Senator from Georgia, \nwho has worked extremely hard to bring this bill to the floor. This is \na bill with strong bipartisan support. He and his staff worked \ntirelessly to produce a professional product, one the country could be \nproud of.\n  I believe he and his staff, working with the rest of us, accomplished \nthat. I believe this is legislation that is going to help change our \ncountry and change it for the better and do it in a way that will \nreduce our dependance on foreign oil and also do it in a way that will \nhelp improve the American competitive position around the world.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will yield.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank you for your kind comments. This is only my \nfifth year in the Senate, but I have never seen a situation evolve in a \nmore bipartisan fashion than we have with respect to this farm bill. I \ncommend you for, No. 1, your insight into ag issues, your insight into \nbudget issues, your insight into finance issues, all of which, when \nmelded together, have been so critical in putting this bill together.\n  Were it not for you and your commitment to the American farmer, we \nsimply would not have this good product on the floor today. I see you \nhave your staffer, Jim Miller, there. Were it not for Jim working very \nclosely with my staff and Senator Harkin's staff, there is no question \nthat we would not be where we are today.\n  But your charts are of significant interest because you and I worked \ntogether on the 2002 farm bill. We both remember there was a lot of \ncriticism directed at that farm bill, exactly the same criticism that \nhas been directed at this farm bill today. As I remember, there was a \nveto threat by the White House in 2002. Is it not true the projected \noutlays in just the commodity title of the 2002 farm bill have been \nsignificantly lower, from an annual expenditure standpoint, than what \nwas presented in 2002?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator has a good memory. The Senator is exactly \nright. We saved $17 billion just from the commodity provision alone \nfrom what was projected at the time the last farm bill was written. \nPart of it was, we did a good job of fashioning an agricultural policy \nthat when prices are higher, the support is reduced.\n  The result was very significant savings for the American taxpayer; in \naddition to that, a food policy that meant the lowest cost food, as a \nshare of national income, in the history of the world. That is a fact. \nAnd by a long\n\n[[Page S14130]]\n\nway. We have the lowest priced food, as the Senator well knows, of any \ncountry in the world, and by a big margin.\n  We are spending 10 percent of our income on food. That includes food \neaten at home and food eaten out. Other countries are spending, most of \nthe industrialized world, 14 and 15 percent. That is just for food \neaten at home. So we are beating them by a country mile.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. If the Senator would continue to yield for a question, \nis it not true when we talk about reforms between the 2002 farm bill \nand this 2007 farm bill, that you mentioned the figure of about 14 \npercent of this farm bill is spent on the commodity title; that in 2002 \nabout 28 percent of the expenditure in the farm bill was dedicated to \nthe commodity title? So when somebody says we have not reformed the \ncommodity title, that we have not reformed this farm bill, would the \nSenator not agree there is significant reform just in the pure dollars \nthat are being dedicated to the commodity title?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, once again, the Senator is exactly right. We can go \nback. These are not my numbers, these are not your numbers, these are \nnot the Agriculture Committee's numbers. These are the numbers of the \nbipartisan, nonpartisan, Congressional Budget Office.\n  When the last farm bill was written, they said the commodity programs \nwould consume three-quarters of 1 percent of the Federal budget. They \nsay this farm bill, the commodity programs will consume one-quarter of \n1 percent.\n  Now, in fairness, they were wrong in the last farm bill. The last \nfarm bill did not cost three-quarters of 1 percent of Federal \nexpenditures, it cost one-half of 1 percent. That is still double what \nthis bill does as a share of Federal spending.\n  Sometimes you wonder when you read these press statements by some of \nthe national media, what are they writing about? They are not writing \nabout this bill because they clearly have not analyzed the bill. It is \nas clear as it can be that we have dramatically reduced the share of \nthis bill going to commodity programs. We have dramatically reduced it \non any measure.\n  In addition, there are, as the Senator well knows, two of the most \nsignificant reforms that have been the goal of reformers, and I have \nalways considered myself a reformer. No. 1, we have the end of the \nthree entity rule, and, No. 2, we have the requirement for direct \nattribution of payments to living, breathing human beings, rather than \npaper entities.\n  Anybody who does not recognize that is significant reform does not \nknow much about agriculture policy.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Well, again, if the Senator would yield, I say this is \nnot a perfect product. It is not maybe exactly what you would like or \nwhat I would or what Senator Harkin would like, or any member of our \ncommittee or this body. But when you take the interest of agriculture \nall across America, I think this farm bill truly represents the needs \nof American farmers. It represents the needs of our nutrition folks \naround the country, whether it be the School Lunch Program, our food \nbanks, or our food stamp beneficiaries.\n  It represents the needs from a conservation standpoint, both farmers \nand nonfarmers who want to maintain the integrity of the land and the \nenvironment. It looks at the needs from a research standpoint, looks at \nthe needs as you mentioned from an oil dependency standpoint, and helps \nmove us in the direction of becoming less dependent on foreign oil.\n  At the same time, it does it, as the Senator well knows because he is \nchairman of the Budget Committee, within the numbers that were given to \nus by the Budget Committee. I daresay this is the first bill that has \nhit the floor this year that does, in fact, stay within the budget \nnumbers.\n  We can argue about that, but the fact is, we were given a budget \nnumber by your committee, and we had to craft a farm bill that gave us \nsignificantly less money than what we had in 2002. With your \nleadership, and Senator Harkin, we have been able to craft a farm bill \nthat fits within those budget numbers.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, let me say if there were a model around here for \nfiscal rectitude, this bill would be it because not only does this bill \ncome in within budget, it came in under the budget. As you know, there \nwas a reserve fund created to take advantage of these opportunities \nthat everyone recognized for our country in energy. So there was an \nextra $20 billion passed by both Houses of the Congress to be available \nfor the Committees on Agriculture to write a farm bill, with the \nthought in mind that those resources would go for the energy \nopportunity and to deal with enhanced conservation.\n  And what happened? This committee has come in only $8 billion above \nthe so-called baseline, so well under the amount of additional \nresources that were allocated by both Houses of the Congress.\n  The occupant of the chair now is a very valuable member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, someone \nwho has a very strong business background, someone who was Governor of \nhis State, someone who balanced budget after budget after budget in \nthat State, and someone who is very attuned to being fiscally \nresponsible, I might add.\n  I want to tell him we have just now gotten the numbers that show what \nour bill costs, the bill that came out of committee, the bill that is \non the floor of the Senate right now, compared to the President's \nproposal.\n  The President, through his staff, did not issue it. We have to make \nthat clear. His staff said they would recommend to him a veto. They \nsaid the problem with it is we spend too much money. Well, now we have \nbeen able to compare what the committee did and what the President \nproposed. Guess what. The President's proposal, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, costs $287.2 billion over 5 years.\n  Our bill, the bill that is on the Senate floor, is $285.8 billion. In \nother words, the President's bill, the President's proposal, cost $1.4 \nmillion more than ours--not by my scoring, not by the Agriculture \nCommittee's scoring, but by the scoring of the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  That is on a 5-year bill. Now, the President came up--the President's \nstaff, not the President--the President's staff came up with all kinds \nof almost bizarre ideas. They tried, in part of our bill, to turn a 5-\nyear bill into a 10-year bill. They did not do that with his proposal. \nBut with ours, they tried to take some of the provisions and make them \n10-year provisions, and they are 5-year provisions.\n  The fact that there will not be money for some of these things if the \nnext farm bill does not find money to provide for them, those things \nwill end. This is a 5-year bill. And the 5-year scoring shows ours \ncosts less than the President's--less.\n  So I would expect by probably late this afternoon, Mr. Conner, who is \nacting as head of the Agriculture Department, will issue an apology to \nus and no doubt have a press conference with the national media and \nacknowledge that the Congressional Budget Office has found that their \nproposal costs more than ours.\n  I wait with great interest and anticipation that press conference by \nMr. Conner to acknowledge that after new review, and after having an \nobjective third-party analysis of our two proposals, they find ours \ncosts less than theirs, and there will be an apology forthcoming to all \nof us who crafted this legislation.\n  I eagerly await the announcement of that press conference. Again, I \nthank the ranking member of the committee for his determination to give \ngood farm legislation for this country, legislation that is not just \ngood for farmers and ranchers, but legislation that is good for \ntaxpayers of this country, legislation that is good for all those who \nbenefit from farm legislation, who are well beyond the farm and ranch \ngate.\n  Because, as I have indicated, 66 percent of the funding in this bill \nis for nutrition, 9 percent is for conservation, three-quarters of the \nmoney in this legislation is spread broadly across America.\n  In addition, there is money for research. In addition, there is money \nfor trade to make us more competitive. There is money for rural \ndevelopment, and there is money for energy to make us less dependent on \nforeign oil. The commodity provisions, the ones that draw all the \ncontroversy, are down to 13.8 percent of the funding. They will account \nfor only one-quarter of 1 percent of Federal spending, according to\n\n[[Page S14131]]\n\nthe Congressional Budget Office. This committee has done its work and \ndone it well.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank the \nstaff of Senator Chambliss, my own staff, and Senator Harkin's staff \nwho worked night and day, weekends, night after night, late into the \nnight on this legislation. They are the unsung heroes. They get too \nlittle attention. We are out front. We are the ones who get talked \nabout as helping to craft this bill. I emphasize the extraordinary \nefforts and performance of staff members from the three Members who \nworked to put this bipartisan compromise together.\n  From the staff of Senator Chambliss, Martha Scott Poindexter is \nsomebody who has great credibility with my office. She has been \nextremely professional, worked very hard, has very good judgment, and \ndeep knowledge. We appreciate the attitude she brought to this effort. \nVernie Hubert is another absolute first-class professional on the staff \nof Senator Chambliss who was great to deal with throughout the process. \nVernie Hubert is somebody who spent the time to understand the \nimplications of this legislation. We are talking about major \nlegislation. It was held up the other day, but this is what I am \ntalking about. This is an incredible effort, to do it and do it right. \nI acknowledge the excellent work of the staff of Senator Chambliss.\n  I have expressed the high regard I have for Senator Chambliss, but \nSenator Chambliss has been ably assisted by Martha Scott Poindexter, \nVernie Hubert, and many more whom I have not dealt with.\n  On the staff of Senator Harkin, I wish to single out Mark Halverson, \nstaff director, and Susan Keith. They have done an extraordinary amount \nof work, brought dedication to this effort. We thank them for it.\n  On my staff, Jim Miller, who knows more about these farm bills than \nany living human being, has such an absolute commitment to helping \nfamily farmers and ranchers. Scott Stofferahn is my staff director back \nhome. He ran the Farm Service Administration in my State. He was a \nleader in the State legislature and is my very close friend and \nconfidant, somebody in whom I have absolute confidence.\n  Tom Mahr, my legislative director, is one of the smartest people I \nhave ever had working for me. He led the negotiations that involved the \nrelationship of Finance Committee funding and Agriculture Committee \nfunding and helped make sure all of this adds up. He did a superb job. \nJohn Fuher is relatively new to my staff but comes from a North Dakota \nfarm family, as straight an arrow as one could ever ask for, somebody \nwho absolutely believes in the importance of family farm agriculture to \nthe economic strength of the country. He comes from a wonderful family \nand acquitted himself very well. I was amazed at the responsibility \nJohn took on in this process. Miles Patrie, another young member of my \nstaff, did a terrific job as well. They were assisted by Joe McGarrey, \nwho is my energy aide and who played a central role in negotiating the \nenergy provisions of this bill.\n  I thank them. Some people have an idea that the people who work in \npublic service have cushy jobs. I wish they could see the work these \npeople have put into this over the last 4 months. I wish they could see \nnight after night, many nights here until 1 and 2 in the morning, \nweekend after weekend, here late on a Friday, then all day Saturday, \nthen all day Sunday, and then right back here Monday morning and then \nlate every one of these nights, week after week after week. To anybody \nwho does not understand the commitment of people who have done this \nwork, the fact is, virtually every one of them could make a lot more \nmoney downtown. They could make a lot more money down on K Street. They \nhave an abiding interest in serving the public and doing right. They \nhave done right on this bill. I am intensely proud of all of them.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ntalk about one of the most important bills that will come before the \n110th Congress and that we will be considering for this country at the \nbeginning of this century, and that is the farm bill. I wish to \nspecifically address both the disaster fund, which has been created \nunder the great leadership of our committee chairs and committee \nmembership, as well as later on address the issue of energy and the \nimportance of the energy provisions in this bill.\n  At the outset, I, again, thank both Senator Harkin and Senator \nChambliss for their leadership in producing a farm bill that has had \ntremendous bipartisan support coming out of that committee. I also wish \nto thank all members of that committee who worked so hard over the last \n2 years to deliver a product we can all be truly proud of as members of \nthat committee.\n  But it is not just the Senators who have the privilege of serving on \nthat committee and coming and speaking on the floor; it is also the \nstaffs of each of the Senators--on my staff, Brendan McGuire and Grant \nLeslie, and others who have worked so hard on this issue, but also \npeople such as Mark Halverson, who have devoted their lives entirely to \nthis legislation for the last couple years, along with Martha Scott \nPoindexter in Senator Chambliss's office. To them I say thank you.\n  I thank Senator Conrad for his great work and understanding of the \nbudget and trying to pull together what truly is a fiscally responsible \nproduct for energy legislation, as we move it forward. I thank Senator \nGrassley and Senator Chambliss for their leadership in helping us pull \nall the pieces of this together.\n  Today I rise to speak briefly about the disaster trust fund which we \nhave created in the farm bill and to voice my continued support for \nthis aspect of the farm bill, with the hope that we are able to get \nthis aspect of the legislation across the finish line, together with \nthe rest of this farm bill, because it is so important to farm country.\n  It is no secret the commodity prices in the business section \nsometimes are not good indicators of how individual farmers and \nranchers are doing. For example, if corn prices are up--as they have \nbeen during the last year--that does not necessarily mean farmers and \nranchers in counties such as those in the Presiding Officer's State of \nNebraska or those in Baca County or Yuma County in Colorado are doing \nwell. That is because sometimes some of our cattle producers in those \ncircumstances are not having an easy time.\n  I can tell you that when we look at $3-a-gallon gasoline and $3-plus, \n$3.10-a-gallon diesel, it creates a hardship on the farmer. But, more \nimportantly, what happens on an annual basis is we have to face the \nweather. Perhaps more than any weather vane, and those from the city \nwho end up watching the weather on the 10 o'clock news, a farmer is \nmore attune to what is happening in the seasons simply because they \nknow the weather essentially is controlling their destiny.\n  They know when the frosts come in the fall. They also know when the \nlast of those frosts leaves, so they can then make sure, as their \nplants start sprouting from the ground, they have the possibility of \ngrowing a crop. They also know, as they watch the clouds that come over \nthe horizon, that when those clouds have a certain look of white on \nthem, there is a possibility there is a hailstorm on the way, and that \ncrop they have worked on--for which they have plowed the ground and \nplanted the seeds and put in the fertilizer and done the irrigation and \nhave nurtured--all of a sudden, in the course of a few minutes, could \nall be gone because a hailstorm wipes out the entire field.\n\n[[Page S14132]]\n\n  That certainly has happened to my family. It has happened to me, and \nit has happened to those of us in this Chamber who have been involved \nin agriculture in our past. From one second to the next, what seems to \nbe a promising and hopeful year--where you can be optimistic about the \nfuture and be in a position where you can make ends meet--can turn into \na situation where all of a sudden you have to wonder whether you are \ngoing to be able to survive into the next year because you do not have \nthe dollars to be able to pay off your operating line at the local \nbank. That happens time and time again across rural America.\n  For example, when you look at the issue of drought, in my State of \nColorado, as is the case in many parts of eastern Kansas and some parts \nof the Presiding Officer's State of Nebraska, we know what drought has \ndone to our communities. We know what drought has done in places such \nas the home State of the Senator from South Dakota over the last \nseveral years.\n  That is why in this body we have come together--the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Thune from South Dakota, Senator Conrad, Senator \nDorgan--a whole host of us, to try to deal with the reality of disaster \nemergencies that affect rural communities in agriculture.\n\n  This picture I have in the Chamber has to do with the story of a \nfarmer in my State who, through no fault of his own, has had to weather \nnow the 6 years of drought that has affected my State that has put many \nfarmers in a position where they either have lost their farms or have \ngotten to the brink of losing their farms.\n  But it is not just the droughts. For sure, we have had those \ndroughts. For sure, in my State, I guess 6 years ago now, in 2001, we \nhad the most horrific drought in the history of our State for an over \n500-year period of time. It was the driest year on record for 500 \nyears. The consequence of that was our farmers and our ranchers in \nrural Colorado suffered a great deal.\n  But it is not just the drought. It also comes with other weather-\nrelated events, such as a blizzard. I show you a picture of the \nblizzard that hit the southeastern part of my State, where thousands \nupon thousands upon thousands of cattle were killed because of this \nunexpected blizzard that piled up drifts that were as high as the \ntelephone and utility posts we see in this picture.\n  You could drive across the southeastern part of Colorado and see \ncarcass after carcass of cattle--dead cattle--on the highways and \nthroughout the fields because of this devastating storm that had \nknocked out the future of so many ranchers in my State. So it is \nimportant we move forward in the proactive manner in which this \nlegislation has moved forward to create a disaster emergency fund.\n  Typically, in Washington, when we see these kinds of disasters, what \nhappens? How do we respond to the farmers and ranchers who provide the \nfood security for our Nation? We move forward and say we must provide \ndisaster emergency assistance.\n  The process, in its typical fashion, follows this order: First, the \nGovernor gets concerned, and then the U.S. Department of Agriculture \ndeclares a disaster. Following that, Congress authorizes emergency \nspending. The bill sometimes gets stalled, and then farmers and \nranchers have to wait not weeks, sometimes months, and, in fact, \nsometimes 2, 3 years before there is any help on the way.\n  That kind of wait, in many cases, is no help at all. So we must do \nthings differently. We must do things differently because, first of \nall, we are not delivering disaster assistance efficiently and \neffectively. Second, we should not be relying on emergency spending to \nprovide disaster assistance. We need to put these expenditures back on \nthe books.\n  (Ms. KLOBUCHAR assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, Congress has passed 23 other ad hoc \ndisaster assistance bills since 1988. Since 1988, 23 ad hoc disaster \nassistance measures have been passed by the Congress.\n  Now, if this is not an indicator of the need for the creation of a \npermanent mechanism to deal with these disasters in farm country, I do \nnot know what better indicator we need. Twenty-three emergency disaster \npieces of legislation have passed this Congress since 1988.\n  I am supportive of that assistance, but we need to deal with this \nproblem in an effective way and on a long-term basis. That is what we \nhave done in the legislation. The members of the Agriculture \nCommittee--and the Presiding Officer, as a member of that committee, \nhas done a tremendous job in her freshman year as a Senator, \ncontributing in a huge way to many of the titles we have included in \nthe farm bill, including helping write significant portions of title \nIX, the energy part of the farm bill. I am very proud of her \ncontribution.\n  But what we have done in this bill with respect to permanent disaster \nassistance is to work with Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus and \nmembers of the Finance Committee, in a proactive way, to create a \npermanent trust fund for disaster assistance.\n  The disaster trust fund will dedicate over $5 billion during the next \n5 years to disaster relief. This will allow us to maintain discipline \nand high standards for determining when to pay out disaster funds, and \nit will allow producers to get help more quickly. The trust fund also \nbrings disaster relief back onto the books so it is part of the budget \nof the national Government. This is a smart and fiscally responsible \nmove.\n  I have spent a lot of time in my life in rural communities--living \nthere, making a living there for part of my life--and as a Senator and \nas attorney general for my State, I have been in all 64 counties in my \nState many times over the last decade.\n  Now, I do not buy the argument that all is well in farm country. I \nbelieve we have huge problems in farm country.\n  During the 1990s, in my State of Colorado, many of the counties in my \nState were deemed to be some of the fastest growing, more robust \neconomic counties in terms of growth in the United States of \nAmerica. The State of Colorado was seen as one of the fastest growing \nStates in the entire Nation, and everybody was singing hallelujah to \nthe kind of economic blessings that were being showered upon my State \nof Colorado. But if you traveled through 44 of the 64 counties in my \nState, you would have to say those counties were, in fact, doing as \nbadly as they were in the 1970s and the 1980s and the 1990s. Indeed, \nnot much has changed. In fact, the economic decline, including \npopulation decline, in those counties continues to be a reality and a \nway of life. In many of those communities where there used to be three \ngrocery stores, now they were down to zero, and in many of them perhaps \none. In many of those places where there used to be three filling \nstations, they were down to zero filling stations and perhaps only one.\n\n  In fact, in the town closest to our ranch, the town of Manasa, CO--\nthis is a story of what has happened there. When I was growing up there \nand going to school at Manasa Elementary, I remember the three stores \non Main Street. I remember the gas stations on Main Street. Well, today \nwe are down to one gas station, and we are down to one small grocery \nstore in the town of Manasa. So not all is well in farm country.\n  So today and this week and next week as we work on this farm bill, it \nis our effort to try to make sure rural America is revitalized. So this \nis an opportunity for us to make sure we reinvigorate and revitalize \nrural America and create a whole new chapter of opportunity.\n  This disaster trust fund which we are creating will help us deal with \ndisasters. The other parts of the farm bill will also create huge \nopportunities for rural America.\n  I will conclude by saying this--because there will be other times \nwhen we will come to talk about other parts of this farm bill. For me, \none of the most exciting chapters of this farm bill for 2007 is, we are \ncreating the opportunity for rural America, for farmers and ranchers to \nhelp grow our way to energy independence. This is not a Democratic or a \nRepublican issue; it is not a progressive or a conservative issue. This \nis an issue of national security for the United States of America. That \nis why so many people have come together to celebrate this agenda that \nwe are embracing on a clean energy future for America. That clean \nenergy future for the 21st century for America,\n\n[[Page S14133]]\n\nin my mind, is based on the inescapable drivers which we see here \ntoday.\n  First, it is about national security because as so many people have \nsaid, our addiction to foreign oil must come to an end because it is \njeopardizing the national security of the United States of America.\n  Secondly, the environmental security of our country requires us to \nstop ignoring the problem of global warming, and what we do with energy \nis inextricably mixed in with how we confront the issue of global \nwarming.\n  Finally, the economic opportunity that comes along with embracing a \nclean energy future for America is an incredible opportunity for all of \nthe United States of America, but it presents a particularly positive \nopportunity for rural America. That is why there are many Members of \nthis Chamber who have come together and supported the passage of a \nresolution which was crafted by Senator Grassley and myself, which is \ncalled the ``25 by 25'' resolution, which sets forth a vision of a \ncountry where we will see our country produce 25 percent of all of our \nenergy needs from renewable energy resources.\n  So at the end of the day, the passage of this farm bill is important \nfor a lot of reasons. It is important for our food security, our \nnational security, our environmental security, our economic security. \nSo we do not have an option on this bill. We cannot not pass this bill. \nThis bill must pass this Chamber with a significant bipartisan vote, as \nI am sure that it will, and at the end of the day, it is my hope \nPresident Bush, as President of the United States, will stand up also \nfor rural America and say he is going to sign this bill because it is \nso necessary for the future of America and for the future of rural \nAmerica.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Colorado for \nhis comments, and the Presiding Officer, also members of the \nAgriculture Committee. We all worked together as has been mentioned. \nThis was a bipartisan effort, and the product, I believe, has broad \nbipartisan support not only in the Agriculture Committee, but I think \nin the entire Senate.\n  It is important we get this bill under consideration. We are \ncurrently being blocked from considering amendments to it, and I hope \nthe majority leader and the leadership on our side can come to some \nagreement about how we are going to proceed with regard to amendments \nbecause we don't have a lot of time left on the clock this year. It is \ncritical that we get a farm bill passed so our producers across this \ncountry who are already beginning to make decisions about next year \nwhen it comes to planting, and lenders who are going to finance them, \nhave some certainty about what the programs are going to be, what the \nrules are going to be as they begin to engage in making those \ndecisions.\n  So I hope we can get this bill moving. It has been on the floor now \nfor the past few days. ``On the floor,'' I use that term loosely \nbecause for all intents and purposes, action on it has been stalled. It \nis important that we come to an agreement about how we are going to \nproceed and what amendments we are going to debate and vote upon. But \nwe need to get a bill through the Senate and into conference with the \nHouse and, hopefully, eventually on the President's desk before the end \nof the year.\n\n  I do want to express my appreciation to the leadership on the \ncommittee: Senator Harkin, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, \nand the ranking member, Senator Chambliss, for their efforts and \nleadership on the bill; also, my colleague from North Dakota, Senator \nConrad, who is chairman of the Budget Committee, and Senators Baucus \nand Grassley, who are chair and ranking member, respectively, of the \nFinance Committee for their efforts in helping us craft funding that \nwould allow the Agriculture Committee to draft a workable and what I \nbelieve is an effective farm bill which will move agriculture forward \nfor the next 5 years.\n  As was noted by my colleague from Colorado, writing farm policy is \nmore regional than it is political. I commend my colleagues on the \nAgriculture Committee who represent literally every geographic region \nin the United States for their tenacity in representing the interests \nof their State as we drafted the farm bill. Most of all, I commend them \nfor the respect they have exhibited throughout this farm bill drafting \nprocess to the various needs of each Member's State.\n  Also, together the committee has drafted a bill I believe is \nsomething we can go home and talk proudly about not only in South \nDakota to my farmers and ranchers, but also to our Native American \ntribes and to every man, woman, and child in South Dakota and across \nthis country who enjoy the safest, most affordable food supply in the \nworld.\n  The 2002 farm bill, which I helped draft as a member of the House \nAgriculture Committee, very successfully provided economic support to \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers when prices dropped below the cost of \nproduction. Yet this same farm bill--this same farm bill saved American \ntaxpayers $20 billion over 5 years when prices improved and its \neconomic safety net components were not triggered, which is good \npolicy, and precisely the way it was intended to work.\n  Thanks to the success of the 2002 farm bill, we had $22 billion less \nin the Commodity Credit Corporation baseline to write the 5-year, 2007 \nfarm bill than CBO had estimated in 2002.\n  This farm bill addresses three of my highest priorities for the 2007 \nfarm bill, and I would like to speak briefly, if I might, to each of \nthose. As I said earlier, first, it must provide an economic safety net \nfor American agriculture.\n  Today's farmers and ranchers face multiple uncertainties thanks \nmostly to the weather. Yet our Nation's farmers and ranchers not only \nfeed every American, they help feed billions of others across the \nglobe. They are expected to provide this food economically--and have \ndone so--often at prices lower than their production costs. Thankfully, \ncommodity and livestock prices are higher now than they have been for \nmost of the past decade, but so are input costs such as fuel, \nfertilizer, and chemicals. Those things have all gone up as well. The \n2007 farm bill needs to continue with safety net provisions that \nsupport agriculture when commodity prices drop because input prices \nwill not drop accordingly.\n  The provision in this farm bill which extends the current farm bill \ncountercyclical program accomplishes this price protection. Yet as I \nstated earlier, it is of no cost to taxpayers when commodity prices \nreach the levels we are experiencing now.\n  Permanent disaster coverage is another farm bill essential I have \nbeen fighting for over the past several years, and I am pleased it is \nalso included in the 2007 farm bill.\n  In agriculture's uncertain economic future, direct and \ncountercyclical payments, a permanent disaster program, and a healthy \ncrop insurance industry are all important to a sound economic future \nfor South Dakota agriculture.\n  So the economic safety net for American agriculture is a critically \nimportant priority in this farm bill. It is addressed. It maintains the \nbasic framework that has worked so well from the 2002 farm bill which, \nas I said earlier, actually has saved the taxpayers billions of dollars \nover what was projected at the time because as prices went up, \ncommodity prices went up, subsidy payments went down, which is \nprecisely the way the farm bill was designed to work. We build upon \nthat in the safety net of the 2007 farm bill.\n  The second priority we need to have in this bill is this farm bill \nneeds to include alternative energy development and expansion. \nAlternative energy; namely, corn-based ethanol, has already changed the \nAmerican agricultural landscape and has given many farmers and local \neconomies renewed hope for the future. However, we recognize the \nlimitations placed on corn-based ethanol, simply due to the number of \nacres that can be devoted each year in this country to producing corn. \nThanks to the groundwork that was laid by corn-based ethanol, \ncellulosic ethanol is positioned to complement corn ethanol.\n  The energy title in this farm bill contains the sustainable \ncellulosic ethanol production incentives that were laid out in my \nBiofuels Innovation Program legislation, which I introduced earlier \nthis year along with Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska. Cellulosic \nethanol produced competitively will not occur on its own. It is \nimperative these incentives are included in the 2007 farm\n\n[[Page S14134]]\n\nbill to kick-start the cellulosic ethanol industry.\n\n  The energy title in this bill also includes $25 million in mandatory \nspending for the Sun Grant Initiative, which is already established in \nland grant universities across the United States and which has made \ngreat strides in research and development of cellulosic ethanol.\n  I want to come back to that point in just a minute, but I also want \nto address what I think is the third important priority in this \nparticular farm bill and that is a sound conservation title.\n  Conservation should not compete with production agriculture; rather, \nit should complement it.\n  Along with uncertain weather conditions, our Nation's agricultural \nlandscape with its fertile and productive farmland is also peppered \nwith millions of acres of marginal and fragile lands. The conservation \ntitle of this farm bill includes an assortment of conservation programs \nthat include tools for farmers and ranchers to exercise sound land \nstewardship in unison with maximizing crop production.\n  My home State of South Dakota is unique in that along with its high \nranking as an agricultural State, wildlife and outdoor recreation \ncontribute mightily to its economy as well. I believe the conservation \ntitle included in this farm bill will assist South Dakota farmers and \nranchers in their efforts to maximize agricultural output, protect and \nenhance its fragile lands, and help keep our State's recreational \nindustry vibrant and healthy.\n  Additionally, $20 million is provided per year to fund the Open \nFields Initiative. Open fields underwrites State programs, such as the \n1 million-acre program in South Dakota that offers incentives to \nfarmers and ranchers who voluntarily open their land to hunting and \nfishing.\n  I believe this farm bill targets a higher percentage of Federal farm \nprogram payments to family-sized farming operations. Several \nmodifications to payment caps and the elimination of the three entity \nrule included in this bill are a step in the right direction to \nproviding assistance where it is most needed: to family farmers and \nranchers across America.\n  However, those who criticize farm policy must be careful in their \ncharacterizations of ``large-scale'' farmers. A family farming \noperation consisting of a father and one or more offspring in today's \nagricultural scale can easily gross several million dollars, while \nproviding a modest living to the family members. We don't want to shut \nthe door of these family operations by taking away economic safety net \nprograms or the conservation tools they need to productively farm.\n  Americans' health and nutrition is a major consideration in this farm \nbill as well. For example, of the total budget outlays in this farm \nbill, 67 percent of the amount falls under the nutrition title, \ncompared to less than 15 percent for the commodity title, and 9 percent \nfor the conservation title. In the Senate farm bill, the Fruit and \nVegetable Program, a part of the School Lunch Act which was previously \nrestricted to a number of States, would be expanded to operate in every \nState in the country. Additional funding would be made available to \neach State based upon the proportion of the population of a State to \nthe population of the United States.\n  Additionally, a provision I offered, which is included in the farm \nbill, expands the fresh fruits and vegetables School Lunch Program to \nover 100 Indian reservations nationwide.\n  Mr. President, one of the problems we encounter when drafting farm \nlegislation, when commodity and livestock prices are higher, is the \nperception that these high prices will last. A farm bill lasts only 5 \nyears. We have no guarantee current prices will remain steady for the \nnext 5 years. Anybody who has been associated with production \nagriculture for any period of time will tell you these prices we are \nexperiencing currently are not going to last permanently.\n  The 1996 farm bill was written during a higher commodity price cycle, \nwith not enough thought given to how the policy would work when prices \ndropped. During the last 2 years of that farm cycle, billions of \ndollars in market loss assistance payments were issued because of an \ninadequate ``safety net.''\n  The current direct payments structure included in this farm bill is a \nfixed payment based upon historical planting, not current crops, \nyields, or prices. This decoupling keeps the United States more \ncompliant with international trade agreements.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support this farm bill. I \nask them to carefully consider the countless hours of discussion and \nnegotiations, the numerous field hearings held by the Agriculture \nCommittee across the country, and the voices of the American people \nthat have been heeded by the Agriculture Committee in writing this \nbill.\n  As noted earlier, this is not a perfect bill. There has been no \nperfect farm bill in my experience, and I have been associated with \nseveral as a former staffer, and now as a Member of the Senate, and \nprior to that, as a Member of the House of Representatives.\n  This is a balanced farm bill that will make America a better place \nfor all of us and will make rural America stronger. It includes the \nimportant components I talked about: A strong safety net that includes \nthe disaster title of the bill, which is something we fought long and \nhard for; a strong energy policy that will help encourage and provide \nfinancial incentives for the development of cellulosic ethanol \nproduction in this country; and a strong conservation title and, as I \nsaid earlier, a tremendous investment in the nutrition title of the \nbill. It is all done in a way the CBO says is paid for.\n  I think it is important, as we move the bill forward, we help people \nacross this country understand what is at stake in a farm bill. I think \na lot of people across the country sometimes fail to grasp the \nimportance of making sure we have a safe and reliable and affordable \nfood supply in this country. If you look at other countries in the \nworld--such as in Europe--they know what it is like to go hungry.\n  One of the reasons we have had farm policies in place for some time \nis because Americans learned during the Great Depression we have to \nhave a strong farm economy that meets the food needs of people in this \ncountry.\n  The other thing I will mention--and I will come back to it because I \nsaid I would--is that this traditionally has been a farm bill that \ndeals with food and fiber for the American people. I believe we are \nmaking a transition as well. In this particular farm bill, it is not \njust about food and fiber, it is also about fuel. I believe we have a \nresponsibility as Members of Congress to do everything we can to lessen \nour dependence upon foreign sources of energy. I am deeply concerned \nabout the future of this country when oil prices are approaching $100 a \nbarrel and gas is over $3 a gallon, with no end in sight. We have \nlittle or no control over that because 65 percent of our petroleum \ncomes from outside the United States from foreign cartels.\n  I happen to believe, as a matter of principle and practice, it is \nbetter for us, as a country, when it comes to buying our energy, to buy \nit from an American farmer where we are adding jobs and growing the \neconomy in this country than giving our money to some foreign cartel \nthat might use it to fund a terrorist organization that will turn \naround and attack the United States. That is why the energy policy of \nthis particular farm bill is so important.\n  I have an amendment that has been filed, along with Senators \nDomenici, Dorgan, Johnson, and Nelson--I believe the Presiding Officer \nis on it as well--which would expand the renewable fuels standard \nbeyond where it is today. The standard we adopted in the 2005 farm bill \ncalls for 7.5 billion gallons of renewable energy by 2012.\n  Mr. President, we are going to hit 7.5 billion gallons by the end of \nthis year. It is important for those who are investing in the ethanol \nindustry, for our farmers and for those making decisions about whether \nto build another plant--and a lot are planned and under construction. \nWe have 13 ethanol plants in South Dakota, and four are under \nconstruction. We have ethanol plants all across the country in some \nphase of construction that have been stopped cold because of the \nuncertainty about the future of the industry. When we blow by 7.5 \nbillion gallons of production of ethanol, we need to know what the \nfuture holds.\n\n  The Energy bill contained a provision that expanded the renewable \nfuels\n\n[[Page S14135]]\n\nstandard to 36 billion gallons by 2022. We have said we hope the Energy \nbill passes, but in the event it doesn't--and that looks to be \nuncertain--we ought to try to get that renewable fuels standard passed \nas part of this farm bill. It improves and strengthens the energy title \nin the farm bill by guaranteeing there is a market not only 10 years \nfrom now, or in 2022, when it calls for 36 billion gallons, but next \nyear, in 2008, when we have already gone by the 7.5 billion-gallon cap \ncalled for in the 2005 bill.\n  This amendment would get us to 8.5 billion gallons by next year. So \nthere would be another billion gallons of ethanol production called for \nin the renewable fuels standard. That is of immediate concern to this \nindustry. We need to grow the industry. If you look at the statistics, \nin 2006, the production and use of ethanol in the United States reduced \noil imports by 170 million barrels, saving $11 billion from being sent \nto foreign and sometimes hostile countries.\n  This is an industry we need to continue to support. When we get 65 \npercent of our petroleum needs outside of the United States, it is \ncritical we continue to develop home-grown energy we can make from \nrenewable sources in the United States, which is not only good for the \neconomy and the environment, but for our energy security. I hope during \nthe course of the farm bill debate, when decisions are being made about \nwhich amendments to allow to be considered and debated and voted upon, \nthe renewable fuels standard amendment is on that list. I think it is \nthat important. I don't think there is anything, frankly, more \nimportant that we can be doing, with the exception of ensuring there is \na good, strong safety net in the bill that will help secure American \nagriculture for the future, help keep this growing renewable fuels \nindustry prospering and expanding and doing what they do best, and that \nis reducing our dependence upon foreign energy, having a renewable \nfuels standard in place that expands dramatically beyond where we are \ntoday.\n  As I said before, there are great incentives in this bill for \ncellulosic ethanol production. People say we are running out of room or \nceiling when it comes to corn-based ethanol. That may be true. We \nbelieve it is about 15 billion gallons that we can get from corn, and \nthen we have to figure out how to make it out of some other form of \nbiomass. But there is investment going on in R and technologies that, \nI believe, is going to be commercialized in the near future that will \nallow us to use switchgrass, wood chips, and other types of biomass. \nThere is a project in South Dakota right now to make cellulosic ethanol \nfrom corncobs on a commercial scale. According to POET Energy, using \nmore of the corn crop for ethanol production, such as corncobs, will be \nable to produce 11 percent more ethanol from a bushel of corn and 27 \npercent more from an acre of corn.\n  So we are already beginning to make a transition from the kernel of \ncorn to the cob and dramatically increase the amount we can produce. \nCouple that with the research going into producing ethanol from \nswitchgrass, blue stem grass, wood chips, and other types of biomass, \nthe sky is the limit.\n  It is important we keep this going. We are facing a serious crisis, \nin my view, if we don't expand the renewable fuels standard. Frankly, I \nhope we increase the blends that are allowed of ethanol, blended with a \ngallon of gasoline, from the current 10 percent to a higher level--I \nhope to 20 percent--which would act in a dramatic way to double the \nmarket for ethanol. These are steps we need to be taking as a country, \nas a Congress, if we are serious--and we need to be serious--about this \nproblem we have today of nearly $100 a barrel of oil, with no end in \nsight to where it is going, and us having no control of that because we \nare so dependent upon foreign sources of energy.\n  The amount of ethanol we produce in this country, it could be argued, \nmaybe isn't all that significant to the amount of gasoline we use--7.5 \nbillion gallons of ethanol, and we use about 140 billion gallons of \ngasoline every year. When you talk about displacing 170 million barrels \nof oil, saving $11 billion from being sent overseas to some foreign \ncountry, a foreign cartel, that is $11 billion that is staying right \nhere on American soil, investing in American jobs and in the American \neconomy.\n  This is an industry we need to keep going. I hope the renewable fuels \nstandard amendment will be included in that list and, as the bill \nprogresses through the process, I hope we can get a product through in \nthe near future so that we can pass it, go to conference with the House \nand, hopefully, ultimately, get a bill on the President's desk. At that \npoint, we will have the challenge of getting the President to sign the \nbill.\n  I think the bill is made stronger by these energy provisions being \nincluded because I think it is so important to America's future--not \njust to the future of agriculture in South Dakota or Colorado or places \nlike that, but to America's future. This farm bill takes us in a great \ndirection, and the renewable fuels standard amendment will make it that \nmuch stronger.\n  I hope we can get into the deliberations about this and that we can \nget working on amendments and voting on amendments and getting a bill \npassed, with a big bipartisan vote, that we can send to conference and \non to the White House that will put in place a policy for the next 5 \nyears that will make agriculture strong, make America competitive in \nthe world marketplace, and make sure we have food, fiber, and fuel for \nAmerica's future.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Committing to Veterans\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ntalk about something that has been a priority for me and for many of my \ncolleagues; that is, our veterans. As we all know, Sunday is Veterans \nDay, the day that is designated for us to thank our Nation's heroes for \ntheir service to our country. It is also a time to ask whether our \ncountry has done enough to repay our veterans for all they have given \nto secure our safety.\n  As thousands return home from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, some \nnow from their fifth tour of duty, I wish I could say the answer to \nthat question is yes. But, tragically, this has not yet been an issue \nof priority for this administration. We have too often failed to \nprovide the care our heroes have earned. From the shameful conditions \nat Walter Reed and VA facilities around the country we saw earlier this \nyear, to a lack of mental health counselors, to a benefits claims \nbacklog of months--and I am even hearing years--our veterans have had \nto really struggle to get basic care. Fighting overseas takes a \ntremendous toll, as we know, on the lives of our troops and their \nfamilies.\n  It is unacceptable to me that those heroes have had to fight their \nown Government for the treatment they have been promised. So today I \nwanted to come out on the floor to talk to my colleagues and to talk to \nPresident Bush about the hurdles our veterans have faced. As we \napproach this Veterans Day, I hope all of us, especially the President, \nwill reaffirm our commitment to our veterans by providing the money, \nthe attention, and the leadership they deserve.\n  I know from personal experience how military service affects veterans \nand their families and how the wounds veterans suffer from their \nmilitary service will shape their lives forever.\n  When I was a student in college at Washington State University, I was \nthere during the Vietnam War, and I chose to do my internship at the \nSeattle VA. I was 19 years old when I headed off to the Seattle VA, a \ntime when men and women who were my own age were coming home wounded \nfrom Vietnam. Every day I got on the elevator at the VA Hospital and \nrode up to the seventh floor and walked into the psychiatric ward, \nwhere those big, heavy doors shut behind me. Day after day, during my \nentire internship, I sat and watched these young men and women, who \nwere my age, as some of them just stared blankly, some of them\n\n[[Page S14136]]\n\nscreamed in anger, many of them felt cut off from their own country, \nand most of them felt their lives had changed forever. As a volunteer \nat the VA during that time, I learned how some of these veterans can \neasily slip through the cracks.\n  That experience also taught me that the doctors and the nurses who \nare there at the VA are really dedicated to trying to take care of \nthese young men and women. It convinced me that the VA system is where \nour veterans can get the best care. Our VA system is uniquely \npositioned in this country to recognize and treat those specialized \ninjuries, those medical conditions, and those mental health challenges \nwhich are caused by combat and military missions. Private medicine \ndoesn't always have the knowledge base or the resources to deal with \nthe unique challenges of a war. That is one reason I will continue to \nfight for better access to the VA, access that allows our veterans to \nget the care they need without the endless waits and redtape. Rather \nthan kicking our veterans into yet another maze of processing and \nanother maze of paperwork, we ought to be working every single day \nuntil we get it right, to provide better access to one of the best \nhealth care systems in the country to those men and women who have \nanswered the call.\n\n  I know from my own experience in my own family veterans are sometimes \nreluctant to seek attention or care they need. My own father was a \nveteran of World War II. He was one of the first soldiers into Okinawa. \nWhen he arrived, he was greeted with mortar. He was injured quite \nbadly. He was put on a ship and sent to Hawaii, where he was in a \nhospital for weeks, recovering from those wounds. I believe he was \nthere about 3 months. At the end of that time, he was then sent back to \nwar.\n  He was a courageous young man of 19 at the time. I didn't know him, \nobviously. He hadn't yet married my mother. I wasn't even a thought for \nhim. I grew up with my dad. He was a disabled veteran. He was in a \nwheelchair for most of my life. Yet the story I told you he never told \nme. How had I found out that my dad was wounded and sent to a hospital \nand recovered under painful circumstances and sent back to war? I found \nout after he died, when I found his diary. That is the typical thing I \nhear from veterans. They are reluctant to tell us of the heroes they \nare.\n  Those two experiences in my life, working at the VA when I was 19 and \nfinding my dad's diary years later, help to illustrate a larger lesson \nthat applies to many of our veterans that we need to remember in the \nSenate and Congress as we develop our policies, and that is often these \nveterans do not want to call attention to their service. Sometimes they \nare suffering so much they don't ask for the help they need.\n  That is why I am so devoted to making sure we have a VA system that \nis ready and able and capable of taking care of all the men and women \nwho served our country--all of our veterans. Sadly, as we both know, we \nare now 5\\1/2\\-plus years into the war in Iraq. Today we know that the \nVA is struggling to provide some of the basic services for our \nveterans. It is surprising to me it took President Bush nearly 3 months \nto announce his head of the VA to lead this beleaguered system. For 3 \nmonths, our VA has been languishing without strong leadership to \naddress the challenges they have. His lack of leadership on that \ncritical appointment sent a signal to me, and to a lot of people, that \nhe is not focused on that cost of war and he is not focused on our \naging veterans who are now going into the system, who are facing long \nwaiting lines and not getting appointments. It underscores to me his \nfailure to count our veterans as a part of the cost of this war.\n  This week we learned the year of 2007 will go down as the deadliest \nyear of the war in Iraq; this year, right now, the deadliest year of \nthe war in Iraq. I know my heart and the heart of the Presiding Officer \ngo out to the families of nearly 4,000 brave Americans who have made \nthe ultimate sacrifice in this war and to the tens of thousands more \nwho have returned with physical and mental illness.\n  The physical wounds our veterans have suffered in Iraq and \nAfghanistan are horrendous. I have worked, along with the Presiding \nOfficer, as a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee to help shine a \nlight on the mental wounds so many of our veterans are suffering from \nthis war. As he and I know, these injuries are very deep and very \npersonal and they can be very devastating, both to that servicemember \nand to his family.\n  This problem is still not getting the attention it needs from this \nadministration. We all know our troops are under tremendous strain. In \nthe past, we were always able to give our servicemembers a break in \nservice to allow them time off from the frontlines to recover from \ntheir physical or psychological or emotional demands. We also know some \nof them are now serving in their third and fourth and even fifth tours \nin this war in Iraq. All of that increases the likelihood they will \nsuffer post-traumatic stress disorder or other mental health conditions \nwhen they come home. In fact, according to our VA's own numbers, fully \na third of all our returning Iraq veterans suffer from a mental health \ncondition.\n  That is an astounding statistic, one-third of the men and women who \nhave gone to Iraq and Afghanistan come home with mental health \nconditions that need treatment and support. But I also know that \nstatistic is probably too low. That is because many of our veterans \ntoday do not seek care, either because of the stigma of mental health \nproblems or because they live in a community where they do not know \nwhom to ask. Today the VA is not reaching out and trying to find these \nmen and women, to bring them in, to give them the support and services \nthey need. I have talked to one too many veterans myself who has told \nme: I didn't know that I could get care at the VA. I didn't know whom I \ncould call.\n  We have a lot of work to do. Earlier this year, I went to Camp Murray \nand spoke with some of the National Guard members who told me they did \nnot want to be labeled with PTSD or traumatic brain injury. They had \ngone to Iraq and come home and they were deathly afraid of having that \nlabel on them because they thought it would hurt their career. One \nsoldier even told me that to be labeled with a mental trauma, \n``jeopardizes his life outside the service.''\n\n  Clearly, this administration and every American needs to work to \nchange that perception, because a soldier who is at home and doesn't \nseek the needed care is an explosive timebomb in his family and his \ncommunity. More than that, we owe them the support and care they \ndeserve. That is part of our job, to make sure these soldiers aren't \nlost when they come home.\n  We have a lot of work to do as well to ensure that when our \nservicemembers do try to get care, they do not have to struggle to \nnavigate this horrendous system they are thrown into to get the \ntreatment they need. So far we have not seen that happening. Last year, \na VA official revealed some of the clinics in this country do not \nprovide mental health care or substance abuse care. Or, if they do, and \nthis was a VA official himself who said this, ``waiting lists render \nthat care virtually inaccessible.'' In other words, that VA official \nwas saying, because the care is not there, we are denying the \nservicemembers the treatment they need.\n  I held a hearing on the issue of mental health care in Tacoma, WA, my \nhome State, a few months ago. Dan Purcell--he is an Iraq veteran--spoke \nto me and summed up the frustration I think is felt by so many of the \nservicemembers I have taken the time to talk to. He said to me he felt \nlike he was being ``treated as a tool that could be casually discarded \nwhen broken or found to be no longer useful.''\n  Can you imagine? A young man who went to serve his country in Iraq, \nserved all of us, fought for our safety and security--no matter how we \nfeel about this war--felt like he was discarded when he came home. That \nis not how any of us want the men and women who serve this country to \nfeel.\n  I think it is shameful our veterans today, across this country, are \nforced to fight to get the mental health care they need. A lot of them \nstruggle to even see a doctor, and they are forced to wait months or \neven years to get their claims processed.\n  Across the country, veterans who have health problems are given \ndifferent ratings and different benefits. In 2003, the administration, \nsurprisingly,\n\n[[Page S14137]]\n\nclosed the door to VA health care for new Priority 8 veterans. Some \nveterans tell me it feels like the VA is fighting them instead of \nfighting for them. That is unconscionable.\n  When this war ends--and we all pray it will be soon--when the news \nfades and the conflicts become another page in our history books, we \nhave to be here to make sure the commitment to our veterans does not \nfade along with that.\n  I wished to come to the floor this afternoon to highlight, on \nVeterans Day, how important it is that we recognize the men and women \nwho serve us; how important our job is to make sure we provide the \ncare. But I am not here just to say what they should do. I think it is \nimportant to talk about what we should do.\n  I think there are three clear areas where we can do a much better \njob, where we can improve. First of all, I believe we can work to make \nsure the mental health care needs of our veterans are met. We need to \nwork to make sure the VA does all it can to raise the awareness of \npost-traumatic stress disorder and combat-related stress. We have to do \neverything we can to make sure they hire more counselors to help treat \neveryone, from the 20-year-old veteran returning from Iraq to the \nVietnam veteran who is still struggling with his legacy of war.\n  We need to make sure all the employees throughout our VA system \nunderstand PTSD, so it isn't the receptionist who answers the phone \nwho, when a veteran says to her: I can't get to sleep at night or I am \nhaving nightmares or I can't remember where my keys are or my kids \ndon't understand me anymore, says: Well, let me see if I can get you an \nappointment. We have one 3 months from now. We need everyone, including \nthe people who answer the phone, to understand post-traumatic stress \nsyndrome and make sure we are reaching out and finding these veterans \nand getting them the care they need.\n  Next, we need to work with the VA to clear up that horrendous backlog \nof complaints our veterans are facing so they can finally get timely \ncare. I hope the President signs legislation soon to ensure the \nDepartment of Defense and the VA are working with the same disability \nrating system and that records are not lost between those two systems.\n  We have worked hard in the Senate to address that issue, since the \nWalter Reed scandal broke. That legislation is within the Defense \nauthorization. I hope we can get it to the President soon, that he \nsigns it, and that the VA and DOD finally break apart those barriers \nthat tell them they cannot talk to each other or will not talk to each \nother, and they can figure out a disability system that does not put \nour veterans into some kind of chaos between two bureaucratic systems.\n  Finally, most important, we, Congress, have to provide enough money \nso our veterans do get the quality health care they deserve. The Senate \nhas approved a bill that provides about $4 billion more than the \nPresident asked us for that is going to take some important steps. It \nis going to improve the conditions at our VA facilities around the \ncountry--such as we saw at Walter Reed. That was symbolic of what is \nhappening in our country, and we have to put the resources into these \nVA facilities so our veterans do not face these dilapidated conditions. \nWe have to invest in new ways to treat military health ailments such as \nPTSD and traumatic brain injury. We don't know the best care for our \nveterans yet. We don't know all the outcomes of PTSD and all the \ntreatments available, and our VA has to have the dollars to do that \nresearch so we can provide the best care possible.\n  That bill provides funding for better prosthetics for thousands of \ntroops who have lost limbs in battle. I know the Presiding Officer and \nI have both talked with veterans and I have to tell you, the veterans \ncoming home today who lose a limb in this war, they want to be able to \nclimb Mount Rainier. They want to be able to run in a marathon. They \nwant to be able to get up and be part of our society, our communities, \nand their families. We owe that to them, and better research on \nprosthetics and the capability of providing that to them is incredibly \nimportant. We provide for the research and the dollars in this bill to \ndo that.\n  It is so frustrating to me that this administration has ignored these \nproblems for so long. We, in the Democratic-controlled Congress, came \nin this year and we have taken action so now I hope the President \nsupports this critical bill and proves his commitment to veterans as \nwell.\n  The men and women in uniform have answered the President's call to \nserve in Iraq and Afghanistan without hesitation or complaint. They \nhave left their loved ones for years. They have put their own lives on \nthe line. Some have come home without limbs; others have returned with \nmental scars. Some, thankfully, have escaped without any injury. But \neveryone, to a person, has earned the respect and the best care \npossible when they come home. If we do not care for our servicemembers \nnow, we will be weakening our military for decades to come.\n  President Bush has been more than willing to use our veterans as \nprops when he argues in favor of this misguided war. I think it is time \nto turn that lipservice into reality and give our veterans the care \nthey need and they deserve. We owe it to our country to ensure we are \nthere to support our servicemembers, to support our veterans, and to \nsupport their families every single step of the way. Mr. President, I \nknow, as you do, that this country is willing to do that, unlike in \nsome of our previous conflicts.\n\n  I did not support the war, but I support the men and women who serve \nin it, and I will work every day to make sure we do our job to care for \nthem when they come home, and I know all Americans feel the way I do. \nThe men and women who serve us are part of the cost of war, and may we \nnever forget that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thought I would talk about agriculture and \nthe farm bill today. I have a number of amendments I would like to \noffer. For example, I have one that we hope will spur the planting of \ncellulosic feedstock on CRP land, which I think is necessary if we are \ngoing to go to cellulosic ethanol, growing switchgrass on CRP land, \nmaintaining the Conservation Reserve Program requirements, and \nproviding a reduced payment, CRP payment, in exchange for allowing that \nswitchgrass to be harvested for cellulosic ethanol. That is just one of \nthe steps we need to take in renewable fuels.\n  Today, I have filed an amendment at the desk called the Farm Red Tape \nReduction Act. I think it is very important to give farmers a voice in \nFederal rulemakings whenever a Federal regulation threatens to impose \nsevere economic pain on farmers. As we saw with small business, many \ntimes the Government overlooks the plight of the little guy who does \nnot have the resources or know-how to weigh in with big Government \nagencies in Washington.\n  In 1976, Congress created the Office of Advocacy to ensure that small \nbusinesses have an advocate in Government and a seat at the table when \nnew regulations affecting them are drafted. I wish to share that same \nsuccess with farmers. We also did something along the same lines in the \nSmall Business Committee about 10 years ago. We introduced--I \nintroduced and we passed something called the Small Business Regulatory \nEnforcement Fairness Act, or SBREFA. That has allowed small businesses \nand small business advocates to have a say in regulations affecting \nthem.\n  I believe we need to do the same thing for farmers. This amendment \nwould help provide a more transparent Government, ensure that the \nGovernment listens to the people most affected by the regulations, and \nit would hold the Government accountable for its action. It is a \nmessage I think we all want to take to our constituents; that is, the \nFederal Government is meant to serve its citizens, not bully them. We \nwant to make it an easy\n\n[[Page S14138]]\n\nprocess. Citizens should be heard while Government is deciding on a \nregulation that affects them, not after the decision is made.\n  The difference is subtle but important: Listen to farmers and \nagriculture first, to be inclusive. Cutting unnecessary redtape will \nprovide greater flexibility for agricultural businesses by removing \nbarriers to enterprise. Encouraging enterprise is essential if the \nUnited States is to compete in a global environment. Farms and other \nagricultural businesses will benefit from simplified rules. This \nmeasure will help in cutting redtape with a view to improving the \nenvironment for agriculture and business.\n  My experience on the Small Business Committee tells me there are \ncurrently dozens of regulatory proposals before Federal agencies but \nmost without a true assessment of the impact on the very people they \nwill affect. What are the initiatives necessary? Are they all \nessential? What are the consequences? I want the agencies to look into \nthat question.\n  It is not my intention to throw out regulations simply as a matter of \nprinciple if, for example, they involve costs for agriculture. I am \nmore concerned with obtaining solid impact analysis that can serve as a \nbasis for informed decisionmaking. It is also quite clear that better \nregulations will be possible only if those affected also play their \npart since they will be responsible for implementation.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                               Carbon Cap\n\n  Speaking of burdens, Mr. President, this morning the Environment \nCommittee conducted a hearing on the proposed Lieberman-Warner carbon \ncap legislation. I addressed then how I think this proposed legislation \nwill hurt farmers in the farm economy.\n  As part of the farm bill discussion, I want people who are focusing \non agriculture and the impact on farmers to know what could be \nhappening to them if we were to pass the Lieberman-Warner bill. Now, I \nhave great respect for both of these gentlemen. I also am concerned \nabout reducing emissions, but I believe this legislation will be very \nexpensive for them. It will make it much more expensive for all of us \ncooling our homes in the summer, heating them in the winter. It will \nmake more expensive the electricity we need to light our homes. It will \nmake more expensive the gasoline we need to power our cars and trucks.\n  An economist at that hearing today gave testimony that the Lieberman-\nWarner bill would cost American families and workers at least $4 \ntrillion--that is trillion with a ``t''--$4 trillion over the life of \nthe bill. She expects a net loss of some 1.2 million jobs by 2015, and \nannual losses of U.S. production will top $160 billion in 2015, rising \nto at least $800 billion to $1 trillion in production lost per year in \nthe outyears.\n  The bill's sponsors have tried to say that farmers will be spared \nsome of the pain by goodies they put in the bill, but no farmer should \nfail to understand that the farm costs of this bill far outweigh its \nbenefit.\n  Already record-high prices farmers now face will go even higher under \nLieberman-Warner. For years, ammonia fertilizer cost farmers $250 \ndollars a ton. No one thought it would break through $400, and now we \nhave seen $500 per ton. Even corn at $6 a bushel cannot support where \nfertilizer prices are heading. As one who buys a small amount of \nfertilizer, 13-13-13 fertilizer, I have seen the cost of fertilizer go \nup because nitrogen very often comes from natural gas. Well, Lieberman-\nWarner would make expensive fertilizers' main ingredients much more \nexpensive.\n  Now, electric utilities competing for natural gas to meet their own \ncap requirements can pay higher natural gas prices and then just pass \nthem on to all of us as consumers of natural gas. But farmers will have \nto look to Middle East countries to import their fertilizer. That would \nmake farmers dependent on Persian Gulf imports. Farmers will also face \nhigher fuel costs to run their trucks and tractors, higher drying \ncosts, and higher transportation costs to get their products to market.\n\n  The Lieberman-Warner ag offset program could decimate small farm \ncommunities. Electric utilities that lack the technologies to cut \nemissions to levels demanded by the bill will have to take full \nadvantage of the bill's so-called offset provisions. They will have \nbillions of dollars to spend to retire cropland for its sequestration \nbenefits. Those of us from farm country know the existing Conservation \nReserve Program authorized through the farm bill has already taken more \nthan 30 million acres out of production. The CRP is a conservation \nsuccess. I support it. But that program has limits that prevent harm to \nlocal economies such as capping participation at 25 percent in any \ngiven county.\n  Nevertheless, we would be potentially taking even far more land out \nof production, land we need to ensure that our abundant food supply for \npeople at home and export markets is met by farmers. Areas which exceed \nthe level of 25 percent, especially in States to the west, show what \nhappened to small communities. The resulting economic damage drove \nmerchants out of business, people out of the communities. In the past, \nexcessive CRP enrollment has led to a disinvestment in infrastructure \nand rail line abandonment which, in turn, triggered higher \ntransportation costs for remaining farmers.\n  Of course, our Environment and Public Works Committee has not \nconsidered these farm problems. That is no surprise since we on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee don't deal with farmers, and \nsome have even less farm expertise.\n  I share with my colleagues who are concerned about agriculture and \nthe impact this could have on farmers what they need to know about this \nbill that will cut carbon emissions. We need to cut carbon emissions \nwithout cutting family budgets or imposing a devastating impact on \ncertain sectors of our economy. I am one who supports a broad list of \nmeasures to result in lower carbon emissions. An overwhelming majority \nof this body would. We have on the shelf, ready to go, carbon-cutting \ninitiatives such as aggressive but achievable new CAFE vehicle \nstandards to raise the mileage of automobiles and trucks. We have clean \nportfolio strategies to require a certain portion of power from \nrenewable and clean sources such as wind, solar, nuclear, hydro, even \ntidal power. Help for zero carbon emissions nuclear power has been \nadvanced in measures passed by this body. We need to do even more. We \nneed to make sure we have the workers available to install those \nplants.\n  We need more low carbon emission biofuels. That is why I propose \nmaking switchgrass planting on CRP land permissible. We need to do more \non clean energy technologies, such as clean coal, that can capture and \nsequester forever the emissions from our Nation's abundant fuel source. \nWe have 250 years of energy in the coal under our ground. We need to \nmove more quickly to convert that coal to liquid coal, to gas, which \nwill be cleaner burning and will allow us to sequester carbon emissions \ngenerally.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider that we have legitimate carbon-\ncutting strategies. I urge my colleagues in the name of agriculture, as \nwell as vulnerable families and workers, to reject strategies such as \nDraconian carbon caps which have not worked in Europe and which will \nnot work here and will result in great economic displacement and \nhardship.\n  I thank the Chair. I hope we will be able to introduce some of these \nvery good amendments we have on the farm bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment that will \nhelp rural communities across the country develop affordable housing. \nThis amendment will authorize appropriations for the Housing Assistance \nCouncil, HAC, which has been committed to developing affordable housing \nin rural communities for over 35 years.\n  The amendment provides $10 million for HAC in fiscal year 2008 and \nthen $15 million in fiscal year 2009 to 2012. In the past, the council \nhas received appropriations from the Self Help and Assisted \nHomeownership Opportunity Program. The funding has helped HAC provide \nloans to 1,875 organizations across the country, raise and distribute \nover $5 million in capacity building grants, and hold regional training \nworkshops. These critical services help local organizations, rural \ncommunities, and cities develop safe and affordable housing.\n\n[[Page S14139]]\n\n  Throughout the country, approximately one-fifth of the Nation's \npopulation lives in rural communities. About 7.5 million of the rural \npopulation is living in poverty, and 2.5 million of them are children. \nNearly 3.6 million rural households pay more than 30 percent of their \nincome in housing costs. While housing costs are generally lower in \nrural counties, wages are dramatically outpaced by the cost of housing. \nAdditionally, the housing conditions are often substandard, and there \nare many families doubled up due to lack of housing. Rural areas lack \nboth affordable rental units and home ownership opportunities needed to \nserve the population.\n  In Wisconsin, HAC has provided close to $5.2 million in grants and \nloans to 17 nonprofit housing organizations and helped develop 820 \nunits of housing. Specifically, since 1972 the Southeastern Wisconsin \nHousing Corporation has partnered with the Housing Assistance Council \nto develop 268 units of self-help housing. The presence of the council \nin Wisconsin has made a huge impact on rural housing development in \nWisconsin and other rural communities across the country.\n  I hope that my colleagues see the importance of this amendment and \ninclude it in H.R. 2419.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am disappointed that we haven't been able \nto accomplish more on the farm bill. We have asked for amendments \nSenators want to offer. There have been a number filed. I have asked \nthat Republicans come up with a list of amendments they would like to \nhave considered. It appears there is no effort made to work out \narrangements on the farm bill passing. I state for the record that \nevery farm bill we have handled in recent decades has never had \nnonrelevant amendments. They have all been relevant, with one \nexception.\n  In 2002, the last one we did, we had one nonrelevant amendment. It \nwas a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on the estate tax. That is it. So \nI don't know, maybe the Republicans don't want a farm bill. Maybe they \nhave all cowered as a result of the President saying he was going to \nveto it.\n  As you know, the President has developed a new word in his \nvocabulary, and that is ``veto.'' For 7 years he was not able to mouth \nthat word, but in the last few months, the last year of his Presidency, \nhe has decided to do that. Maybe the Republicans don't want a farm \nbill. Maybe they want to join with the President and not have a farm \nbill. That certainly appears to be the case.\n  We have basically wasted the whole week with my friends on the other \nside of the aisle pouting about procedure. The procedure on this bill \nis no different than any other farm bill we have done in recent \ndecades.\n  The State of Nevada would benefit a little bit from the farm bill but \nnot much. I hope those constituencies who want a farm bill will start \ncontacting Senators because the time is fast passing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/08/senate-section/article/S14139-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14139-S14147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the conference report on H.R. 3222, the Defense \nappropriations conference report. I would note that this matter will be \nmanaged by Senators Inouye and Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nreport will be stated by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3222) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate and agree to \n     the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees on the part of both \n     Houses.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of today, November 8, 2007.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Inouye was called away for a meeting \nwith another Senator. Therefore, it is my understanding the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama wishes to speak. Does he have any \nidea how long he is going to talk?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                               Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I just have a comment to add to those of \nSenator Bond about the danger to farmers of making mistakes on energy \npolicy. Energy prices are rising significantly. I saw some numbers \nrecently that indicated for an average family, where one person \ncommuted 29 miles to work every day, $3-a-gallon gasoline could mean \n$60 to $80 a month more than they would pay for gasoline alone. That is \nafter-tax money out of their pockets. That is a real cost.\n  We absolutely need to strengthen the energy portion of this bill. We \nneed to do more to have a domestic supply of energy. But we also need \nto be sure we are not driving up the cost of energy so it falls hard on \npeople such as farmers who utilize a lot of energy and a lot of \ngasoline and diesel fuel. It could be a real problem for them. I agree \nwith Senator Bond that we need to be careful about this because we \nshould not have as our goal driving up the cost of energy.\n  A lot of the policies I am hearing about are going to have little \nimpact on the environment but a lot of impact on our wallets. My \nthoughts about the Ag bill are that I hope we will be able to pass a \nbill we can be proud of. I hope to be able to support it. That is what \nI am looking to do. I will offer an amendment or file it a little \nlater--I know we are not voting on them now--to deal with assisting \nfarmers who suffer losses from disasters in their region. It can be \npainful for them. I would like to share some thoughts on this.\n  Our current crop insurance, as valuable as it is, has not proven to \nprovide a fully adequate financial safety net for our farmers. The \ncurrent system can be too expensive and not flexible enough. Farmers \ncome to me all the time and say: I would like to plow under this crop \nand replant now, but the insurance people think if I let it go to full \nmaturity, I might make enough money off of it that I wouldn't have to \nclaim any insurance. So you have to wait on the insurance people before \nmaking a decision. They come out there. They have to make judgments. \nThis is a burden. It can eliminate quick decisionmaking and can be \ncostly.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the Government-\nsubsidized Crop Insurance Program has expanded significantly over the \nlast 25 years, and that is what we wanted to happen. We wanted more \nfarmers to take out crop insurance. But yet CRS has found that despite \nthis expansion, the ``anticipated goal of crop insurance replacing \ndisaster payments has not been achieved.'' Indeed, CRS reports that \nsince 2000, ``the federal subsidy to the Crop Insurance Program has \naveraged about $3.25 billion per year, up from an annual average of \n$1.1 billion in the 1990s and about $500 million in the 1980s.\n  During this same time, from 1999 to 2006, CRS reports that the \naverage per year ad hoc periodic disaster payment to fund persons who \nneed payments in addition to the crop insurance has totaled $1.3 \nbillion a year. Since 2002, CRS reports that the cost to the Federal \nGovernment of Crop Insurance Programs combined with ad hoc supplemental \ndisaster payments has averaged $4.5 billion per year.\n  According to the Risk Management Agency, a group that supervises crop \ninsurance, the average subsidy rate for this year--that is the average \nsubsidy rate, the amount of money the taxpayers provide to subsidize a \nfarmer's crop insurance--amounted to 58 percent of a producer's total \ncrop insurance premium. The average amount of the Government subsidy is \n$3,359. I am convinced for some farmers--I don't know how many--more \nflexibility could result in more benefits for those farmers. That is, \nof course, what we are about, trying to make sure we get the maximum \npossible disaster risk protection we can for our farmers.\n  Farmers do have a real need for a viable risk management strategy. \nCertainly, farmers need some form of protection when disasters strike. \nBut these numbers do demonstrate the traditional crop insurance \ncoverage on a\n\n[[Page S14140]]\n\ncommodity-by-commodity basis alone often does not provide the kind of \nadequate risk protection every farmer needs.\n  In 1999, a committee formed by the Alabama Farmers Federation, our \nlargest farm group affiliated with the Farm Bureau and tasked with \ndeveloping ways to improve traditional crop insurance, proposed a \nsolution to many of the problems farmers experienced with crop \ninsurance. This is not an idea I came up with; it was an idea the \nfarmers themselves came up with.\n  Ricky Wiggins from South Alabama has farmed all his life and was one \nof the people who really captured this idea and has pushed it. So this \ncommittee recommended that the farmers be given a choice between \ntraditional crop insurance and opening a new account in which they \ncould deposit some of their own money and then receive a modest \ncontribution from the Government. Money that would normally have gone \nto subsidize insurance would go into this farm security account.\n  My amendment would simply direct that the Secretary of Agriculture \nimplement a pilot program creating these accounts. My pilot program \nwould be limited to 1 percent of eligible farmers or approximately \n20,000.\n  These farm savings accounts would allow the farmers to create a \nwhole-farm risk management plan based on the income of the entire farm. \nBecause you have a lot of complications now. If one crop succeeds, and \nanother one fails, or two of them are weak and two of them are the kind \nof crops for which there is no insurance available at all, then things \ndo not work out fairly for the farmer. Farm savings accounts would \nserve as a possible alternative or supplement in these instances to \ntraditional crop insurance.\n  Under this proposal, participating producers would deposit money, \npreviously utilized to buy crop insurance--money they would normally be \npaying to a crop insurance company--into a farm savings account, a tax-\ndeferred, interest-bearing account. The Department of Agriculture would \nthen contribute to the account rather than subsidizing a portion of the \nproducer's crop insurance premium, which is, on average, 58 percent. \nThe producer would put the government contribution into the same \naccount, subsidizing the account in that fashion. Then there would be \nno further liability on the Department of Agriculture after this point. \nThe farmer, the producer would be self-insured and would not be calling \non the Government for additional disaster relief.\n  Under farm savings accounts, a minimum contribution by the producer \nof at least 2 percent of their 3-year average gross income would be \nrequired annually, up to a maximum amount of 150 percent. Interest and \nincome to the account would not be taxed as earned income, but \nwithdrawals would be treated as regular income. Account funds would be \ninvested in low-risk guaranteed securities such as CDs or Government \nsecurities.\n  Withdrawals from farm savings accounts would be allowed if gross \nincome in any given year falls below 80 percent of the farmer's 3-year \naverage gross income. The amount of the withdrawal would be restricted \nto the difference between 80 percent of the 3-year average and the \nactual gross income of that year.\n  For example, if a producer, who typically earns $100,000 a year, \nmakes $70,000, then they would be allowed to withdraw $10,000 from \ntheir farm savings account, their emergency insurance account, to bring \ntheir annual income up to $80,000. However, if the producer made \n$90,000 that year, a withdrawal would not be allowed at all.\n  Catastrophic coverage would still be required to participate in this \npilot program, because if you have a total loss, then an individual \nsavings account would not be enough to cover it.\n  The producer would be eligible to purchase any additional crop \ninsurance, but it would be completely unsubsidized. In addition, farm \nsavings accounts could be used as collateral in obtaining loans \nconnected with the farming operation. These accounts would be closed if \nthe producer ceased farming for nonfarm employment, retirement or \nbankruptcy. The remaining balance would be taxed as regular income.\n  The USDA has reported that farm savings accounts may overcome some of \nthe disadvantages of current crop insurance programs. These accounts \nwould encourage farmers to manage risks unique to their operation by \nsaving money in high-income years and using it during years in which \nincome is low.\n  While coverage would depend on the reserves in individual accounts, \nthese accounts would be applied to a variety of farming situations. In \naddition, the USDA has found these accounts could encourage greater \nparticipation in the agriculture safety net by farmers than is \ncurrently experienced. Some producers are not even offered the \nopportunity to purchase insurance for their crops--because of the \nnature of their crops and the nature of crop insurance, they cannot get \ninsurance--making them more dependent on the ad hoc disaster payments \nwe wrestle with on the floor of the Senate.\n  For example, CRS reports that specialty crop and livestock producers \nare not afforded the same level of protection for their commodities as \nthe major commodities.\n  Recently, my amendment has been mischaracterized as undermining the \nlevel of risk protection provided for farmers. Yet simply taking \nGovernment funding previously used as a subsidy for insurance premiums \nand, instead, using it as an incentive to encourage savings for \ndisasters is not undermining the level of risk protection for the \nfarmers. This is an important distinction. Giving farmers a choice \nbetween traditional crop insurance and a new program based on producers \nsaving their own money in a tax-deferred, interest-bearing account \nactually increases, I submit, the level of risk protection for farmers, \nparticularly since we would require catastrophic coverage to \nparticipate in the Farm Savings Account pilot program.\n  Allowing for more approaches to risk management actually gives \nfarmers the opportunity to choose the plan they consider to be better \nsuited for their particular operation. By providing a choice between \ndifferent risk management strategies, our Government can offer more \nprotection to a greater number of farmers at less of a cost by \ndecreasing the need for these ad hoc disaster payments we so often do.\n  Purchasing crop insurance coverage commodity by commodity, as we do \nnow, may make sense if you grow one or two crops on your farm, but \ntraditional crop insurance may not be the best option if you grow four, \nfive or six commodities in your area of the country.\n  Instead of countless premium payments that are paid by producers each \nyear but not necessarily used, the participating producer can save that \nhard-earned money himself and receive a modest Government contribution \nto assist in providing his own risk protection.\n  Farm savings accounts can also provide producers much needed \nflexibility in managing their operation by overcoming some of the \nconstraints of traditional crop insurance. Under the current system, \nproducers who want to make decisions on how to manage their farm \noperation when a disaster strikes are often forced to jump through \nnumerous bureaucratic hoops before they are allowed to execute their \nown decision on their own farm about how they want to manage the crops \nthat are being damaged by a disaster--a drought or flood or freeze.\n\n  For example, under the current system, producers who want to cut \ntheir corn for silage to feed their cattle in a drought year--because \nthey realize the corn crop is not going to be sufficient to actually \nharvest in the fall--must first get permission from the crop insurance \ncompanies and the Federal Government. So you have to have people come \nout and inspect the farm and argue over whether you should be able to \ncut the corn prematurely or let it stay in the field in the hope that \nthere will be more rain and maybe a worthwhile crop at the end.\n  Why not give that decisionmaking authority to the farmer? It would \nsave a lot of overhead, I submit. And there is, as we know, some \nsizable amount of fraud in the crop insurance program. Farm Savings \nAccounts would greatly eliminate the risk of fraudulent behavior by \nthose participating in the pilot program.\n  Farm Savings Accounts will allow the producers to make their own\n\n[[Page S14141]]\n\nchoices on how to manage their farm operations. If their income drops, \nthey will be able to draw into that account to bring it up to 80 \npercent of their 3-year average income. I think it has great potential.\n  Simply put, this plan would offer an alternative to some producers \nwho might choose it, and it could encourage broader participation in \nrisk management plans than we have today because a lot of farmers do \nnot participate in any insurance or risk management plans. In \ncombination with traditional crop insurance, farm savings accounts, I \nbelieve, will save the taxpayers money by reducing the need for \ncontinual bailouts in the form of ad hoc payments and will give farmers \nmore flexibility. If things go well, the farmer may, indeed, create a \nsavings account that can help take care of them in their retirement \nyears.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider this pilot project amendment. It in \nno way represents a major shift in what we are doing now. It represents \na pilot project for 1 percent of farmers. The regulations would be set \nforth by the Department of Agriculture. At the conclusion of the \nprogram several years from now, perhaps we will see it was not a very \ngood program. But perhaps we will find it has great potential--and the \nfarmers who are using it like it--and perhaps more farmers might like \nto participate. We should consider that in the years to come.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                              Veterans Day\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this Sunday, November 11, will be Veterans \nDay. On this Sunday, our Nation will honor all veterans of all wars. It \nwill be a day, this Sunday, to thank every man and every woman who \nwears or who has ever worn the uniform of one of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  It will be a day to remember and to honor the dedication, the \nprofessionalism, and the courage of every individual who has been \nprepared to defend our people, our Nation, and our Constitution by \ntaking up arms against our enemies.\n  On the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, 89 years ago, in \nthe dark year of war that was 1918, the armistice began. Tired troops \nlaid down their weapons against muddy trench walls, weary gunners \nlowered their sights, the thundering cannons fell silent, and the \nfragile calm of peace was broken only by the crisis of celebration and \nthe prayers of Thanksgiving. The United States had taken part in the \nlargest war that history had ever witnessed, and it was finally over.\n\n  The carnage of World War I was of a scope and scale that shattered \nthe soul. Battles took place across the globe and on the seas. It was \nthe first war to take to the skies, the first war to see chemical \nweapons used on a large scale, the first war to see tanks and other \nheavy armored weapons employed. Pandemics of influenza had swept the \nglobe on the winds of war, extending the suffering to new areas and \ninto civilian arenas, taking my mother to her grave.\n  World War I caused the disintegration of four vast empires: the \nAustro-Hungarian Empire, the German Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the \nRussian Empire. In just over 4 short years, more than 20 million people \nwere killed and more than 20 million people were casualties of that \nwar. It was truly the cataclysmic end of the existing world order. But \nNovember 11, then called Armistice Day, became forever a day to be \ngrateful for peace, thankful for democracy, and thankful for the men \nand the women who had done so much to preserve both.\n  People called World War I the Great War. They called it the War to \nEnd All Wars. Many people believed that no war could have been worse. \nBut, alas, World War I was neither the greatest war in terms of size \nand complexity, nor was it the war to end all wars. Since World War I, \nthe United States has taken part in World War II, the Korean war, the \nVietnam conflict, the first Persian Gulf conflict, and now the second \nPersian Gulf conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan. U.S. troops have also \ncome under fire in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Somalia. Millions more American \nmen and women in uniform have joined with their battle-hardened \nbrethren from World War I to share in the honored title of ``veteran.'' \nIn 1947, the November 11 Armistice Day celebrations were renamed \n``Veterans Day'' to honor all veterans of all wars.\n  This Veterans Day, with the Nation's men and women in uniform again \nin harm's way, the Nation will again mark with a moment of silence the \n11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. In that silence, during \nthat peaceful moment, we shall send our love, our prayers, and our \nthoughts to the men and the women who will know no peace in the dust \nand heat of battle. We will send wishes of strength, of courage, and of \nluck. We will send our love, we will send our prayers, and we will send \nour thoughts to their families as well, and we will wish for them the \nstrength to endure the long separation and the strain of worrying about \ntheir soldier. In that peaceful moment, we shall give thanks to all who \nserve and all who have served.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as a veteran of World War II, I know I \nspeak for other veterans in thanking my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, for his most profound remarks, and I thank him for \nhis words.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the conference \nreport on H.R. 3222, an act making appropriations for the Department of \nDefense for fiscal year 2008. The conference report approves funding of \n$459.3 billion in new discretionary budget authority which is equal to \nthe subcommittee's 302b allocation. This amount is $3.5 billion less \nthan the funding requested by the administration, not including \nsupplemental spending for the cost of war. And, it is the same level as \nrecommended by the House. The conference recommendations represent a \ngood faith compromise between the House and the Senate.\n  I say to my colleagues this is a good bill, one that is critical for \nour Nation's defense. The bill fully funds a 3.5 percent military pay \nraise, a half percent more than requested. It recommends adding $918 \nmillion for the Defense Health Program to ensure that the health of our \nmilitary families is protected. This includes $379 million more than \nrequested to support our military hospitals which suffer from \nsignificant shortfalls and are stressed by our wounded heroes returning \nfrom war.\n  The conference report includes $980 million to purchase equipment for \nour National Guard and Reserves recognizing the serious shortfalls that \nexist in our reserve components. It provides robust funding for the \nArmy's highest priority, the Future Combat System. It supports the \npurchase of 20 F-22s and 12 joint strike fighters as requested.\n  The bill includes $588 million to support a multiyear purchase of the \nVirginia Class submarine, and provides advance procurement for four \nmore ships than requested by the administration.\n  On the subject of earmarks, this measure includes nearly $3.4 billion \nless for earmarks than provided in fiscal year 2006. While many of the \nitems that we call earmarks may not meet the strict definition under \nthe new rules, we have included them in a list in the back of the \nStatement of the Managers along with the names of the Members of the \nCongress who requested them in the interest of providing greater \ntransparency.\n  Today is November 8. Our Defense Department is operating on scaled \nback funding under a short-term continuing resolution. Each day that \nthe Defense Department operates under a CR adds to cost and \ninefficiency. It is critical that we expedite the consideration of this \nmeasure to allow for better financial management, and more importantly, \nto ensure that our men and women in uniform and their families have the \nfunding they need for their pay, their hospitals, their housing, and \ntheir schools. We can best show our support to the military by \ncompleting action on this bill as quickly as possible and sending it to \nthe President. Our men and women in uniform deserve no less.\n\n[[Page S14142]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Hawaii has \nmanaged this bill for many years. He has done an outstanding job. It is \nan honor and a pleasure to work with the Senator from Hawaii. It \ndoesn't hurt once in a while to remind each of us what a great man he \nis. I am sure I will embarrass him, and I do this rarely, but for those \nof us who have the opportunity to serve in the Senate, one of the \nhighlights in all our lives is having the ability to tell our children \nand our families that we served with Dan Inouye. Here is a man who is a \nMedal of Honor winner for gallantry during World War II.\n  This week, the President of France bestowed the highest civilian \nhonor they can bestow on any non-Frenchman--and that is the Legion of \nHonor--to Senator Inouye. So not only is he a great manager of this \npiece of legislation before the Senate now, he is a great American. \nThat is an understatement.\n  I hope we can do this bill as quickly as possible, and 6 o'clock is \ncoming soon. This piece of legislation has attached to it the \ncontinuing resolution, as was done last year when we were not in charge \nbut the Republicans were in charge. That is not saying the Republicans \ndid anything wrong. We have a situation where we have to fund the \nGovernment, and funding runs out next Friday, a week from tomorrow. So \nthis would fund the Government until the middle of next month. Attached \nto the continuing resolution--we want all the transparency we can have \nand should have. A number of items are extremely important. FEMA has \nrun out of money all over the country because all these emergencies \nhave occurred. There is money for wildfires, and it is pretty clear \nwhat that is about. There is $1.9 billion in the bill for veterans. \nThis is what the President requested. It is not as much as we wanted. \nHe requested that. We put his money in the continuing resolution. There \nis $3 billion that was requested by the Senators from Louisiana, which \nis something that is an emergency. The people of Louisiana have \nsuffered a great deal, as have other States in the gulf. This allows \npeople to come back to their homes. If this money is not obtained by \nthe first of the year, then all applications will have to be stopped. \nSo it is important to do this. I hope we can complete this as quickly \nas possible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota wishes to speak \nfor 10 minutes as in morning business. I ask unanimous consent that he \nbe allowed to do that and, when he completes his statement, that I be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Coleman pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n371 are located in today's Record under ``Submissions of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one point I failed to mention in talking \nabout this bill which has been brought to the floor in the form of a \nconference report is the House of Representatives acted on this \nconference earlier today. The vote in the House of Representatives was \n400 to 15--400 to 15--and here we are in the Senate playing around with \nthis bill today, a bill that gives $470 billion to our fighting men and \nwomen around the country for the next year, and it funds our Government \nuntil the middle of December, and we are having some kind of a \nprocedural meltdown in the Senate.\n  Does this mean the House of Representatives, with their overwhelming \nvote of 400 to 15, didn't know what they were doing? The House is \nevenly divided, just as we are, with Democrats and Republicans. The \ndifference is fairly minimal. But Democrats and Republicans, by an \noverwhelming margin, voted for this conference report. Why? Because it \nis the right thing to do.\n  If we don't adopt this conference report today, here are the \nprocedures, everybody. Listen to what we face. We don't have to take it \nup. We can just drop it. We don't have to have a vote on it today. The \nword is out that there are individuals who want to take the CR out of \nthis conference report. So they do that, and we decide to move forward \non the legislation. Then what would happen is we could pass the \nconference report, as amended, take the CR out of it. It will go back \nto the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives could sit \non it for the next 6 months or they could pass it during their session \ntomorrow.\n  Why do we need to do that? We have to fund the Government. We are not \ngoing to shut down the Government. There may only be 51 one of us, but \nwe will always vote to keep the Government open. The Republicans tried \nshutting down the Government 10, 12 years ago, and it didn't work. We \nare not going to do that. We just thought it was appropriate--and I \ndon't know who could object. The Democrats didn't do it in the House of \nRepresentatives; the Democrats and Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives decided FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency \nneeded money. Why do they need money? There have been emergencies all \nover the country, and they don't have the money to take care of what is \nneeded. They are out of money.\n  Have we had wildfires? We have had wildfires. They swept the West. \nMaybe they were on television a lot, as they were when the wildfires \nswept southern California, but they have been burning for months, and \nwe are out of money. The Federal Government has obligations. The \nPresident has declared a number of emergencies because of these fires. \nThat takes taxpayers' money. So we put that in the bill.\n  The House also decided in their wisdom, which I support, to take \nmoney from what the President asked for veterans--$1.9 billion--and put \nit on the CR so he could get that money as early as tomorrow. And we \nput, as I have already indicated, $3 billion in for Katrina, which is \nhumanitarian money. It is absolutely necessary. It is for people's \nhomes.\n  The House passed this outrageous legislation--I guess that is what \npeople think. We have had this bill since about 2:30 this afternoon. It \nis now approaching 6 o'clock, and people are trying to decide what they \nwant to do with it when it passed the House of Representatives 400 to \n15. I am really at a loss as to what the problem is.\n  We have done nothing on the farm bill, not because we don't want to \ndo something on the farm bill but because we have treated the farm bill \nthe way every farm bill has been treated for the last three decades.\n  We say we want to vote on the Dorgan-Grassley amendment. No, you \ncan't do that. We are willing to set that aside and do the amendment we \nknow has to be done; that is, the substitute by Senators Lautenberg and \nLugar. No, you can't do that. We say: Why don't you give us a list of \namendments you might be interested in doing? No, we can't do that.\n  It appears to me the minority doesn't want a farm bill. Maybe they \nwant to wait until the new year and extend the present farm bill. I \npersonally think the farm bill is something we should do. It has a lot \nof very good provisions in it, not as far as some people wanted, not as \nfar as I wanted, but it is a good bill, and we should pass it.\n  I simply was told by my counterparts: We don't like the bill; you are \nwasting your time; forget about it. Now we hear all these words: We \ndon't like the way you are handling the procedure. Why? Because it \nisn't right the way you do it, even though it has been done this way \nfor many years.\n  Mr. President, 400 to 15, and we are spending hours and hours trying \nto decide what to do. In the meantime, there is other work of the \nSenate not being done. I can sit in a quorum just as everyone else and \nwaste everyone's time, but I think we should get about the business of \nthis country. It shouldn't be that hard to decide what they want to do. \nDo they want to override what the House did by a vote of 400 to 15--\n``they'' being the Republicans in the Senate. If they want to raise a \npoint of order to take something out of the bill and sustained by the \nParliamentarian, we can vote on that. We\n\n[[Page S14143]]\n\ncan waive it with 60 votes. I just think we should have a decision made \nby our friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, every day that the Defense appropriations \nconference report is delayed, it delays a $40 billion increase for the \nDepartment of Defense, delays $11.6 billion for mine-resistant vehicles \nfor our troops in Iraq and a $2.9 billion increase for our veterans.\n  The Defense appropriations conference report passed the House of \nRepresentatives 400 to 15. I urge all Senators to support the \nconference report and send the measure to the President of the United \nStates today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues take note of the \nfact that the Defense appropriations legislation which is before us is \ncritically important for our Nation and for close to 200,000 American \nservicemembers fighting wars in two foreign countries.\n  This bill includes salaries for our soldiers, a well-deserved pay \nraise for them. I am sure that is one of the reasons it received such \nan overwhelming vote in the House of Representatives. Mr. President, \n400 Members came forward to vote for this bill. It is an indication of \nbipartisan support for our soldiers, our men and women in uniform.\n  It includes money for training, for aircraft, ships, ammunition, \nhumvees, and, yes, for a new generation of vehicles that will save the \nlives of many of our soldiers. These so-called MRAPs are much more \nheavily armed and safer vehicles. There is no reason to delay. The \nSenator from West Virginia made the point that there is $11 billion in \nthis bill to start sending those vehicles to our troops so they will be \nsafe and come home safe.\n  Our men and women in uniform across the world need this bill to pass. \nThey do their duty without any hesitation. Can we do anything less?\n  There is a fundamental disagreement in this country about the war in \nIraq, whether our troops should continue there, as the President would \nhave, or whether we should start bringing them home. We have had many \ndebates on that issue in this Chamber during the last year; there will \nbe many more. But today this bill should not be a casualty of that \ndisagreement in the Senate. This bill is about providing the vital \nresources our military needs to keep our country strong and safe.\n  Let me tell you, there is a part of this bill I had at least a small \npart in crafting, and I am very proud of it. It is called the Wounded \nWarriors Act. There were so many involved in it. I don't claim that it \nwas my own exclusively, but each of us tried to put a provision in that \nwould help our warriors coming home from battle be treated better and \nrecover from their wounds more quickly.\n  This bill includes $70 million to fund the Wounded Warrior initiative \nthat was included in the Defense authorization bill. That is \nlegislation on which I worked. Having visited veterans hospitals and \ntalked with so many disabled vets, I realized that money was \ndesperately needed to improve treatment for traumatic brain injury and \npost-traumatic stress disorder and actively support our troops in \ntransition between Active Duty and Veterans' Administration care.\n  This bill also has $980 million for equipment for the National Guard. \nIn my hometown of Springfield, IL, is Camp Abraham Lincoln. If you go \nout to Camp Lincoln, there is a big parking lot. It is empty. It used \nto be filled with vehicles until 80 percent of the National Guard units \nin Illinois were deployed. They took that equipment overseas to fight \nthe war. It was destroyed, run down, not worth returning. It has never \nbeen replaced. Our National Guard units in Illinois have about a third \nof the equipment they need. God forbid a crisis in our State or \nsomething that requires mobilization; they will be hard pressed because \nthe equipment is not there.\n  This bill has $980 million for equipment for the National Guard. Most \nof our Guard units are lucky to have half the equipment they once had. \nThis is a burden on them when it comes to training and responding when \nneeded.\n  I have looked at our Guard and talked with our leaders there. They \nhave only half the authorized rifles they need and less than half the \nauthorized vehicles. Our States, every one of them, desperately need \nthis equipment, and this bill provides almost $1 billion to meet that \nneed. Why would we say no? Why would we wait?\n  Also included in this bill is desperately needed funding for \nveterans, the victims of the catastrophic wildfire season, and people \nwho lost their homes because of Katrina.\n  This bill contains a continuing resolution which keeps the business \nof Government continuing as we work our way through this appropriations \ndebate. Maybe there are some on the other side, people I have not met, \nwho believe closing down our Government is a good thing. We certainly \ndon't. The Democrats in the majority believe our Government should \ncontinue to function. Was it 12, 13 years ago when then-Speaker \nGingrich decided he would just close down the Government to see if we \nwould miss it? People such as Rush Limbaugh were crowing on the radio \nthat if the Federal Government went away, nobody would notice. They \nnoticed it in a hurry. There are vital functions that need to continue.\n  This bill contains a continuing resolution that keeps the lights on, \nkeeps people working, keeps valuable services there for people across \nAmerica and around the world. We want to pass this along with this \nDefense appropriations bill. This would fund our Government until \nDecember 14, next month, which gives us time to work on agreements on \nthe rest of the appropriations bills.\n  We are operating under the spectre of a President who has threatened \nto veto 10 of the 12 appropriations bills, even though we put these \nbills together in a very bipartisan way, and they had overwhelming \nmajority votes. Those appropriations bills aren't likely to become law \nin the near future, so the only responsible thing to do is to have this \ncontinuing resolution so Government funding will continue.\n  The President has said he will veto these bills because they are--all \nthe bills, the appropriations bills--roughly $20 billion over his \nbudget. The President has threatened to delay health care, money for No \nChild Left Behind, training for workers, even the National Institutes \nof Health, and even transportation because Congress restored many cuts \nhe has made over the years--$20 billion, $25 billion. Sure, it is a \nsignificant sum of money, but it represents about 2 percent to 2\\1/2\\ \npercent of the total Federal budget.\n  A President who is arguing we can't afford $20 billion or $25 billion \nfor America has asked us for $196 billion for Iraq--$196 billion for \nIraq but we can't afford $20 billion for America? I don't follow it.\n  A strong America begins at home, investing in our people, our \nchildren, our communities, our neighborhoods, our towns, and our \nStates--our economy--so businesses can grow and good jobs can be there. \nWhy this President opposes these measures I can't understand. But we \nshouldn't let the business of Government grind to a halt while we work \nout that obvious difference. That is why the continuing resolution is \nso important.\n  I guess 2007 was a banner year at the White House. After 6 years of \nsearching, after turning loose all of the agencies of the executive \nbranch of Government, after bringing in the best investigators the \nPresident could find, after literally tearing the White House apart \nfrom one end to another, President George W. Bush, in the year 2007, \ndiscovered his veto pen. He had been looking for 6 years. He couldn't \nfind it. He never used it. But then he found it in 2007, and I guess he \ndecided this would be part of his relevancy campaign.\n  You may recall, Mr. President, he gave a speech and said: I have to \ndo some things around here to continue to be relevant. Reuters \nannounced today that 24 percent of the American people approve of the \nPresident's job in office. Someone in the White House, I am not sure \nwho, has said to him: If you just start using this veto pen again, I \nthink your numbers will go up. I think you will be relevant.\n\n[[Page S14144]]\n\n  I think they are wrong because the President has used his veto pen \nfor things that don't help our country. When we tried to change course \nin policy and direction in Iraq, the President used his veto pen and \nstopped us. When we tried to promote stem cell research to find cures \nfor diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease and cancer, \nParkinson's and Alzheimer's, he found that veto pen and used it to stop \nthe research. He has used that pen to stop Children's Health Insurance, \nand he used it to try to stop an investment in America called the Water \nResources Development Act.\n  Today, there was a historic vote on the Senate floor. I believe some \n79 Members, if I am not mistaken, voted to override the President's \nveto--many more than the 67 necessary. It was historic because that is \nonly the 107th time in history this has occurred. The Senate, \nRepublicans and Democrats, rejected the President's veto.\n  So the President continues to take advice and threaten to use that \nveto pen again. It is a newfound power that he ignored for 6 years as \nPresident. Not once did he find a single bill generated by a Republican \nCongress that he would veto, not one time. Now he can't find a bill \ngenerated by a Democratic Congress he wants to sign.\n  Well, the bills we pass in the Senate take bipartisan support. We \ndon't have 60 votes on the Democratic side. We have 51. We need the \nhelp of our Republican friends to pass anything, and we have gotten \nthat help. I hope the President will consider that when he threatens to \nveto appropriations bills with overwhelmingly positive, affirmative \nvotes.\n  The continuing resolution assumes an increase of $2.9 billion for \nVeterans Affairs. This would allow the VA to spend at a greater rate, \nand they need to. If you had asked the Department of Veterans Affairs 7 \nor 8 years ago what they would be doing in the year 2007, I am sure \nthey would have said: Well, we will continue to meet our legal \nobligation for a lot of aging veterans who have come to us with the \nproblems of aging men and women. But that is not their challenge today \nexclusively. They have a new challenge, with thousands of returning \nsoldiers and sailors, marines and airmen, who come back broken in body \nand spirit and need the help of the Veterans' Administration. We give \nthem money for that. That is in this bill.\n  Will Republicans stop this bill? Will they stop the $2.9 billion for \nthe Veterans' Administration? How could they possibly justify that?\n  It also has $500 million emergency funding for the Forest Service and \nBureau of Land Management for wildfires. You don't have to tell our \ncolleagues from California what that is about. It is about the biggest \nmigration in our Nation since the Civil War--people forced out of their \nhomes because of the fires, many of their homes destroyed in the \nprocess.\n  The bill has $3 billion in emergency funding for the HUD Road Home \nProgram for people whose homes were damaged and destroyed by Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita. The Governor of Louisiana, Governor Blanco, came to \nsee me, along with the mayor of New Orleans, Mr. Nagin, and they told \nme about this program, one that the Federal Government agreed to fund. \nIt has been a program that has been widely subscribed and needs \nadditional money to be completed. It is just for the people who have \nlegitimate claims, and it gives them a chance to come home. It is about \ntime the people in New Orleans had a chance to come home.\n  Mr. President, our country faces threats on many fronts. Our duty in \nCongress is to provide the authority and the funding for our military \nto be equipped and trained to meet those threats. I support this \nfunding bill which gives our soldiers the tools they need to safeguard \nour Nation. To my friends on the Republican side of the aisle, as they \nponder whether to support this bill, I hope they will understand \nfunding our military at this moment in our history is critical; \nproviding continuing resources for our Government to stay in business \nis the right thing to do.\n  Saying no to veterans at this moment is a bad decision. Saying no as \nwell to the victims of fires is not defensible. And saying no to those \npeople who have struggled and need a helping hand across America is not \nconsistent with who we are and what we should be.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. NELSON of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to state my support for the \nDepartment of Defense conference agreement that is before the Senate \ntoday. As we have done for so many years, my good friend from Hawaii, \nSenator Inouye, and I have worked in a bipartisan manner with our \ncounterparts in the House to draft an agreement that meets the needs of \nthe military. This bill balances our priorities for funding, pay, and \nbenefits to the military and civilian personnel, maintaining force \nreadiness in the operating accounts, and providing significant \ninvestment for the modernization of weapons systems. I strongly support \nthe defense side of this bill.\n  I remain deeply disturbed by what is not included in the bill. What \nis missing from the conference agreement is what is known as the bridge \nfund or supplemental appropriations to support our troops in the field. \nFor each of the last 3 years, and in the current CR, the bridge funding \nfor the costs of operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world \nhave been included, until a full supplemental bill could be considered \nhas passed the Congress in the Spring.\n  This has been a difficult matter for us to deal with. I was \nunsuccessful in the defense conference in adding $70 billion as a \nbridge fund. As I understand it, the House has indicated they will \nbring forth a stand-alone bridge fund bill to be considered by the \nCongress as early as next week. As a matter of fact, it may be tomorrow \nthat they take it up. I have not seen any action yet to assure that we \nwill get a clean bridge fund bill that can be signed by the President. \nThis bothers me considerably.\n  The continuing resolution attached to this bill does not contain a \nbridge fund. As I said, every defense bill since fiscal year 2005 has \nincluded a bridge fund that funded contingency operations. \nUnfortunately, the absence of this bridge fund leaves the Department \nwill be forced to divert money from their regular accounts to fund \noverseas operations. They will also be forced to reprogram money from \nthe Defense bill itself in order to cover the problems of the men and \nwomen in the field.\n  I have said I would offer a motion to invoke rule XXVIII against this \nbill, but upon reflection and after talking to the people in the \nadministration, the intention is to allow that this Defense bill to be \npassed because there are overwhelming problems in the Defense \nDepartment itself.\n  So contrary to my own deep thoughts about the lack of the bridge \nfund, I think, considering the matter of all of those people who serve \nus, it is essential we get the Defense bill itself passed. It will give \nus the basic funds to continue the ongoing operations for a limited \nperiod of time.\n  It bothers me that without the bridge fund--the Congress has failed \nto recognize the overall process of supporting our deployed forces and \nreplacing worn equipment. These effort are at risk for being delayed, \nwhen this bridge fund is not provided. The current CR, which contains \nfunding for our deployed forces, runs out on the 16th of this month.\n  I say to the Senate, it is a great risk we are taking, a great risk \nnot to fund the people who are serving valiantly overseas. These people \nought to be the first under consideration. Unfortunately, we are \npresented with a dichotomy of protecting the whole of the Department of \nDefense and getting the bill to the President to be signed, as opposed \nto having the additional moneys necessary to continue to support those \noverseas.\n  In the past 3 years, as I said, we have included a bridge fund. \nWithout this funding, the Department of Defense will now have to divert \nmoney, reprogram money from this bill we are going\n\n[[Page S14145]]\n\nto pass, to fund overseas operations. Those operations cost about \napproximately $13 billion a month. That is money that is necessary to \nkeep the people who are in the field now, sustain the rotation of those \nforces, and ensure that they have the equipment that they need. A \nsignificant portion of that money is dedicated to the troops and their \nfamilies as they come home. It costs much more to bring a soldier or \nMarine back and put that person back into their unit and take care of \nall the medical problems associated with returning personnel as it does \nto send someone over.\n  The difficulty is without a bridge fund those people are going to be \nthe first ones harmed. We still have time. This is the point just made \nto me--we still have time before November 16 to pass a clean bridge \nfund, one without bells and whistles, one without political concepts in \nit, one without telling the President to end a war he can't end.\n  I do hope the Senate understands we should not have a political \ndispute bar us from supporting those people who have volunteered. This \nis a total volunteer military. They have depended upon us to support \nthem. We have until November 16 to do what we should do, and that is \npass a bridge bill.\n  I do hope the House will keep its word to us and send us a bridge \nbill. No matter what happens between the White House and the Congress \nand the parties within the Congress, we should not lose sight of the \nfact that those people have volunteered to serve this country, they are \nthere, some of them are coming back, and others are going over to take \ntheir place until this issue is settled. I, for one, hope it is settled \nas soon as possible, but I do not believe we can solve the problem by \ndenying the Department the money it needs to support those in the \nfield.\n  We have men and women in uniform in 146 countries today. It is not \njust Iraq and Afghanistan. These servicemembers are still chasing \nterrorists around the world. I think we send the wrong message to the \ndeployed troops who have volunteered for duty if we neglect them. This \nwill be the first time we have done that.\n\n  By not raising the point of order I am relying upon what I believe is \na commitment of the House to send us a bridge bill, a bridge bill that \ncan be passed and signed by the President by the 16th, by the time the \ncurrent CR expires. I do not believe we can ignore our commitments to \nour forces overseas, and I do hope the Senate will join us in agreeing \nto pass a bridge bill that is not political.\n  I know my friend, and I disagreed on the basic concept of entering \nthis war. But after the troops were there, we have set aside any \npolitical differences and decided our job was to make sure the \nvolunteers who commit themselves, commit their lives and put them at \nstake, are going to get what they need so long as the Commander in \nChief orders them to do what he has the power to do under the \nConstitution, and that is to represent this country in events taking \nplace in Iraq, Afghanistan, and throughout the world.\n  These are very complicated times. We are reading what is going on in \nPakistan, which impacts our operations in Afghanistan. When we were \nthere the last time I was there, the one thing they wanted was support \nfor helicopters and equipment to assist in the war on terrorism.\n  I remind my colleagues there is more than $11 billion in this package \nfor mine resistance, ambush protected, or MRAP vehicles. Senator Inouye \nand I totally support that concept. But force protection for the troops \ngoes far beyond the vehicles in which they ride. It includes everything \nfrom body armor to helmets, to ballistic eye protection, aircraft \nsurvivability equipment, to improved sensors, communications for better \nsituational awareness--all of that should be in the bridge fund that is \nnot here.\n  I am disturbed with myself, as a matter of fact, to a certain extent, \nthat I am not going to raise that point of order. But you have to weigh \nthis, now, as to what is in the best interests of the people in \nuniform.\n  We are not saying today there is not going to be a bridge fund. We \nare saying we will pass this bill now, but we are committing \nourselves--I am committing myself to do everything possible to get a \nbridge fund passed by November 16.\n  We do not want to send the wrong message to our people deployed. The \ninteresting thing about it--I have spent the last few evenings, quite \nlate into the morning, watching this marvelous public television series \ncalled ``The War.'' That was our war, Senator Inouye's war, and my war. \nAs a matter of fact, Senator Inouye has a dramatic presentation in that \nseries, and I applaud him for that. But the difference between that war \nand this war, these conflicts in which we are involved now, is \noverwhelming.\n  I remember leaving Miami and calling my aunt and uncle, with whom I \nlived, then when I came back from China, calling them from Hawaii, \nalmost 2 years later. There was no communication--no phones, no e-\nmails, no messages. Once in a while, about twice a month maybe, a \nletter or a package.\n  This is a different concept. These people overseas can hear us now. \nThey are going to get e-mails today saying the Senate did not pass that \nbridge bill. They are watching us--and they should. They have every \nright to watch us, and their families do too.\n  I think to do anything less than passing this bridge bill before we \ngo home for Thanksgiving--to me, it would be irresponsible. We have to \nkeep our commitment to these people. The $70 billion that is available \nto the Department of Defense under the current CR, it ought to remain \navailable to them until we pass the main supplemental, which the \nCongress will take up sometime in March or April.\n  I do hope the Senate will understand what we are doing. We have a \nbill today, which includes the Continuing Resolution, that has a great \nmany provisions in it that we didn't have much to do with here in the \nSenate. The Senate is on warning that it could well become surplusage \nin the processes of the Congress if we let this happen again. These \nitems were entered into the conference report entirely separate from \nthe defense bill that is before us tonight. Rule XXVIII is supposed to \nbar that. The exigencies of the situation now are such that we must let \nthe Defense bill go to the President in order to achieve our goal of \nsupporting the activities of the Department of Defense.\n  It is with reluctance I urge my colleagues to support this bill, send \nit to the President for his signature--which I am assured will happen. \nIf we don't stand up as a Senate and support our troops, we will be \nneglecting our duty.\n  We have duties here too. We support the Constitution, and the \nConstitution gives the President of the United States power to send \ntroops overseas whether we like it or not. As a matter of fact, we \npassed the resolution to make sure the President had that power and \nthen asked him to do it.\n  So under these circumstances, we should not neglect those people who \nare overseas, who are wearing our uniform and putting their lives at \nrisk on a daily basis. I do hope the Senate will take notice that we \ncannot let this become a common practice, we cannot neglect our job in \nterms of having the Congress consider the things we believe are \nabsolutely necessary for our country.\n  The only reason I do not do it now is this gap between now and a week \nfrom now on November 16. We have the time to pass a bridge bill. We \nhave the time to authorize the money that is needed to support these \npeople during our absence on what we call the Thanksgiving recess. I \nhope and I pray to God we will do it. We must do it. It is on that \nbasis that I do not raise a point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, for the past 30 years, I have been \nprivileged to serve on the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee with my \nillustrious partner, the senior Senator from Alaska. We have always \ndone this in a bipartisan fashion. It has been so bipartisan that, \nnotwithstanding the controversies involved in the bill, as the Senate \nknows very well, we passed the bill in the subcommittee in less than \nhalf an hour and the full committee in less than an hour and a half.\n  We should also keep in mind that 4 days from now, we will be saying \nthank you to the veterans of World War I, II, and the others.\n  This is a must bill. I think we should take the words of the senior \nSenator\n\n[[Page S14146]]\n\nfrom Alaska, his words of wisdom, with seriousness because it deserves \nserious consideration.\nMr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are a country at war and yet it \nis business as usual in the Halls of the Congress. This conference \nreport is chocked full of unrequested and unauthorized funding \nprovisions while actually underfunding the budget requested by the \nPresident for the Department of Defense by $3.5 billion. That is \ncorrect, Mr. President. We are underfunding one of the most critical \nagencies to the safety and security of the American public in order to \nspend extraordinary amounts on unnecessary, wasteful earmarks and run \nof the mill porkbarrel projects. There are over 2,000 earmarks in this \nyear's Defense Appropriations conference report and its accompanying \nStatement of Managers, with 24 earmarks added outside the scope of \nconference.\n  Today, we are engaged in a struggle against Islamic fascism and yet \nit seems that many on both sides of the aisle are placing special \ninterest and pet projects before the urgent funding needs of our troops \nand providing what they need to succeed in their mission. While this \nbill has $3 billion of Katrina relief for Louisiana homeowners, it does \nnot have one dime allotted for bridge funds for the global war on \nterror. I support doing what we can do to aid in the Katrina recovery. \nBut we must be equally committed to our brave men and women in uniform.\n  Allow me to highlight some of the earmarks that are taking real money \naway from our fighting men and women: $25,000,000 for the Hawaii \nFederal Health Care Network; $23,000,000 for the National Drug \nIntelligence Center, NDIC; $20,000,000 for historically Black colleges \nand universities; $5,000,000 for the United States Olympic Committee, \nUSOC Paralympic Military Program; $4,800,000 for the Jamaica Bay Unit \nof Gateway National Recreation Area; $3,000,000 for ``The First Tee,'' \na golf foundation in St. Augustine, FL; $2,400,000 for the Vertical \nLift Center of Excellence-Institute of Maintenance, Science and \nTechnology; $2,000,000 for brown tree snake eradication; $1,600,000 for \nthe New York Structural Biology Center; $1,200,000 for the National \nBureau for Asian Research; $800,000 for extended shelf life produce for \nremotely deployed forces; and $500,000 for the Maine Institute for \nHuman Genetics.\n  I am not questioning the merits of some of these programs and \ninitiatives but they do not belong on a Defense appropriations bill. It \nis our responsibility to be faithful stewards of the taxpayers' hard-\nearned dollars. Whatever position you have on the war in Iraq, the \nglobal war on terror or this administration, as long as our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and marines are in harm's way, it is our responsibility \nto provide them with whatever is necessary for them to succeed in their \nmissions around the world and come home safely. We can do better than \nthis for our troops and for the American taxpayer.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I oppose the 2008 Department of Defense \nappropriations conference report because it provides money to continue \nthe misguided war in Iraq but fails to require the redeployment of U.S. \ntroops. The war in Iraq is the wrong war. It is overstretching our \nmilitary and undermining our national security. It is long past time \nfor this war to end.\n  Some may pretend that this conference report does not include any \nIraq money. That claim is misleading, at best. This bill provides the \nregular DOD funding that keeps the war going. In fact, this bill will \npay for a significant part of our operations in Iraq. Moreover, there \nis nothing in this bill to prevent the Defense Department from shifting \nregular funds to pay for the full costs of the war in Iraq in the event \nthat the Congress does not enact supplemental appropriations for the \nwar.\n  I strongly support our brave men and women in uniform. We do not do \nthem any favors by giving the President money to keep this open-ended \nwar going with no strings attached. For their sake, and for the sake of \nour national security, we should use our power of the purse to force \nthe President to bring this war to a close. This bill represents \nanother missed opportunity, and another example of Congress failing to \nuse its power to bring our troops out of Iraq.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the conference report to accompany the fiscal year 2008 \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill. I would also like to thank \nall of the House and Senate conferees for their hard work and \ndedication to ensure that our troops and their families have all the \nnecessary equipment and support they need.\n  As both a senior member of the Armed Services Committee and chairman \nof the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am particularly pleased to \nsupport $70 million in funding for programs authorized under the \nDignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act, designed to assist members \nof our Armed Forces and their families in the often difficult \ntransition from battlefield to home. I am also glad to support the \ninclusion of $980 million in additional funds to ensure that National \nGuard and Reserve forces have the equipment they need to train for \ndeployments abroad and to respond to natural disasters at home.\n  In addition, I applaud the conferees' decision to retain a provision \nrecognizing the dedication and sacrifices made by members of our Armed \nForces and their civilian counterparts, by providing a 3.5-percent \nincrease in basic pay for all service members and civilian personnel, \n0.5 percent above the President's request. Similarly, I am pleased to \nsupport the inclusion of $2.6 billion to be used for the immediate \nneeds of our military families. These funds which will be used to hire \ncounselors, teachers, and child care providers are critical for our \nmilitary readiness and for sustaining our troops by ensuring the well-\nbeing of their families.\n  Once again, let me urge my colleagues to set aside differences and \nreach the compromises necessary to provide our brave men and women in \nthe armed services with the resources they need.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I certify that the information required by \nSenate rule XLIV, related to congressionally directed spending, has \nbeen identified in the conference report to accompany H.R. 3222, \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill, 2008, House Report 110-434, \nfiled on November 6, 2007, and that the required information has been \navailable on a publicly accessible congressional Web site at least 48 \nhours before a vote on the pending conference report.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the \nconference report to H.R. 3222, the Defense Appropriations Act for \nfiscal year 2008. This Defense bill, which I strongly support, \nunfortunately includes a so-called ``continuing resolution'' which is \nfull of earmarks.\n  I am extremely disappointed that our troops must continue to pay the \nprice for political posturing and the inclusion of funding for pet \nprograms in a must-pass military funding bill. Our troops are being \nused to carry pork projects and this is a text book example of \nirresponsible legislating.\n  Let's be clear about what a continuing resolution is. This continuing \nresolution provides stopgap funding for existing Federal programs at \ncurrent or reduced fiscal year levels because the majority couldn't get \nits appropriations bills completed by the beginning of a new fiscal \nyear.\n  What we should be considering is a straight CR: no earmarks, no plus \nups, no new ``emergency'' spending. This bill has it all. It has a $3 \nmillion earmark for a golf center--an expense clearly not linked to our \nnational defense. There is even $800,000 to study the effects of sound \non marine mammals.\n  This is a dangerous way to operate.\n  This Congress has already shown it has zero fiscal discipline. \nBusiness as usual is bad enough, but if we, the U.S. Senate, concede on \nthe definition of a CR, this kind of unconscionable spending will be \ndone forever. It will be standard operating procedure. That is not what \nthe American people want.\n  I want to make very clear my strong support for the members of our \nArmed Forces and the vital work they are doing around the world every \nday. I have the greatest admiration for all of them for their \ncommitment to preserving our freedoms and maintaining our national \nsecurity. They are all true heroes and they are the ones who are doing \nthe heavy lifting and making\n\n[[Page S14147]]\n\ngreat sacrifices in our country's name so that we might continue to be \nthe land of the free and the home of the brave.\n  We are faced tonight with a vote on a bill that our troops need, but \nthe troops are not the focus of this conference report. This political \ntactic does our troops and all Americans who want good government, a \ndisservice.\n  I want to provide our troops with the funding and the resources they \nneed to be successful in all their objectives. I want the Senate to \nconsider the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Appropriations Act on its merit. \nLegislating isn't a barter system, or at least it shouldn't be. The men \nand women of our armed services deserve better than having the funding \nthey need to do their job being used in a horse-trading scheme so a \nMember of Congress can get funding for his or her own special cause. \nThere is more than $50 million worth of projects being slipped in this \nso-called CR. We are moving quickly toward midnight. I guess that's a \nfitting time to vote on a bill laden with pork slipped in under the \ncover of darkness. The people of the United States deserve better.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, with great reluctance, I will vote \ntoday in opposition to passage of the 2008 Department of Defense \nappropriations conference bill. This legislation contains $459 billion \nin funding to provide the resources needed to run daily military \noperations.\n  I supported this legislation when it first came to the Senate floor \nin October. However, I can not vote in support for the final House-\nSenate conference report because it contained $59 million in earmarks \nthat were added during the closed-door conference negotiations. One of \nthose earmarks was for $3 million to fund a golf center that is in the \nname of the congressman who requested it. What is a golf center doing \non a DOD appropriations bill?\n  This was a difficult decision because I strongly support most of the \nprovisions in this bill, and I have deep respect for Chairman Inouye \nand Ranking Member Stevens and their efforts to craft a good funding \nbill.\n  However, I made a commitment during my campaign and when I took my \noath of office in January to reform the secretive earmarking process. I \nthought we had made real progress with the passage and enactment of \nS.1, the ethics reform bill, that requires far more transparency and \ndisclosure on earmarks than there has ever been. Unfortunately, I have \nsince discovered there are still some gaps in the ethics bill that need \nto be filled.\n  One of which has to do with the difficulty of raising a 60-vote point \nof order on earmarks added during appropriations conference \nnegotiations. S.1 says that we can do that. But in reality, we really \ncan't. Most of these added funding earmarks are contained in the Joint \nExplanatory Statement of Managers, which, technically, isn't part of \nthe conference report bill text. What that means is we can't raise a \npoint of order against those earmarks to strike them out of the bill.\n  Let me give me you some perspective on what we are talking about. The \nDefense appropriations conference text was 133 pages long. The Joint \nExplanation of Managers--470 pages long. The JES as they call it, \ncontains all of the earmarks, all kinds of substantive direction and is \nthree times as long as the official conference report, and it is not \nsubject to a point of order? This is wrong. It's not what I believe \nmost of us thought would escape the oversight rules of S. 1 when we \nvoted for it. At the very least, it seems disingenuous in how we sold \nthis bill to the American public as a way to clean up our taxpayer-\nfunded shop and how we do business around here.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/08/senate-section/article/S14147-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14147-S14182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        NOMINATION OF MICHAEL B.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. 374, \nthe nomination of Michael Mukasey to be Attorney General of the United \nStates; that there be a time limitation of 5 hours of debate equally \ndivided between the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, with the Democratic time divided as follows: Senator Leahy, \n45 minutes; Senator Dorgan, 15 minutes; Senator Durbin, 20 minutes; \nSenator Cardin, 10 minutes; Senator Reed, 15 minutes; Senator Kennedy, \n10 minutes; Senator Harkin, 10 minutes; Senator Boxer, 15 minutes; \nSenator Salazar, 10 minutes; that upon the conclusion or yielding back \nof the time, the leaders be recognized for 10 minutes each, with the \nmajority leader going last; that the Senate then vote on confirmation \nof the nomination; the motion to reconsider be laid on the table; the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then resume legislative session; that the Senate then, without \nintervening action or debate, vote adoption of the conference report on \nH.R. 3222.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to put in the Record that this has \nbeen cleared with the leader on our side also. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of everyone. \nThis has been a difficult day. These are very sensitive issues we are \ndealing with, with the troops and the financing of the country, in \naddition to the nomination of a Cabinet officer. It is a time when you \nneed cooperation from both sides. That is what we have had. It has not \nbeen easy. I extend my appreciation to my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle and the cooperation of my Members. I would finally say \nthat for those of you who have had questions asked by Democrats and \nRepublicans, we are going to finish the farm bill. There is some real \nmovement on that with amendments. I feel comfortable we will be able to \nget that done in the near future. I appreciate everyone's cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Michael B. \nMukasey, of New York, to be Attorney General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate is now taking up the nomination \nof Judge Michael Mukasey to be the next Attorney General of the United \nStates. It is a nomination which has become controversial. Judge \nMukasey has served his country in many different ways. He served as a \nFederal judge before he retired, then went into private practice and \nwas summoned to serve as Attorney General by this President. I had a \nchance to meet with him personally in my office. One cannot help but be \nimpressed by the man's intelligence and erudition. He clearly is a \nperson of strongly held beliefs and it takes little time to appreciate \nthat when you meet him.\n  I left, after meeting him in my office, believing his nomination \nhearings would be interesting, and they were. On the first day, Judge \nMukasey was a great witness, saying things that needed to be said about \nhis plans to change the Department of Justice from the days of Alberto \nGonzales, about his feeling of responsibility to the country not to \nabide by any decisions made by the President that were inconsistent \nwith the law or the Constitution.\n  He went so far as to say he would resign before he would allow that \nto occur. I can recall speaking to my colleagues, including Senator \nSchumer, who sat next to me in the Judiciary Committee, and saying: \nWhat a breath of fresh air, how refreshing that he would be so candid \nand forthright. After all the years of Alberto Gonzales dodging \nquestions, refusing to answer, here was a man who answered the \nquestions. That was the first day.\n  Then came the second day of the hearing. When my turn came to ask \nquestions, I proceeded to ask Judge Mukasey specific questions about \ntorture. His answers to those questions led to a great deal of \ncontroversy and lead us to this moment in the Senate debate.\n\n[[Page S14148]]\n\n  When we write the history of this early 21st century in America, \nthere are going to be countless stories of courage and compassion: \nFirefighters and police officers racing into the burning Twin Towers \nminutes before they collapsed on 9/11.\n\n  The passengers on United Airlines flight 93 overcoming hijackers and \nplunging to certain death instead of allowing the terrorists to reach \nwhat many believe was their intended target, the U.S. Capitol, and \nthose of us working in the building at the time. Those passengers on \nthat flight were true American heroes. Those of us in the Senate and \nthe House and all of us in the Capitol will be forever in their debt.\n  There were hundreds of thousands of brave service men and women, \nevery single one of them volunteers, leaving families and friends to \ndefend our country. Thousands of them have come home to America in \nflag-draped coffins. Stories of courage and stories of compassion.\n  Sadly, during the same period, there have been stories of cowardice \nand cruelty. A short way down Pennsylvania Avenue from this Capitol \nbuilding is the U.S. Department of Justice. In that building, attorneys \nmanipulated the law to justify practices which were unthinkable in \nAmerica. They put our troops at risk and sacrificed principles for \nwhich America has always stood and for which thousands died on 9/11 and \nthe years since. They did tremendous harm to the image of this great \nNation. The late historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., said this about the \nBush administration's torture policy:\n\n       No position taken has done more damage to the American \n     reputation in the world--ever.\n\n  Alberto Gonzales was an architect of the Bush administration's \ntorture policy. As White House counsel, he recommended the President \nset aside the Geneva Conventions. The phrase ``Geneva Conventions'' \nbrings to mind civility, fairness, and justice. How did Alberto \nGonzales characterize the Geneva Conventions? He called them ``quaint'' \nand ``obsolete.'' He requested and approved the infamous Justice \nDepartment torture memo that limited the definition of torture to abuse \nthat causes pain equivalent to organ failure or death.\n  Now we are asked to consider the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey \nto succeed Alberto Gonzales. Judge Mukasey is obviously intelligent, \nwith a distinguished record. But that is not enough. In light of \nAlberto Gonzales's shameful role in justifying torture, Judge Mukasey \nbears a special burden to make clear where he stands on the issue. I am \nsorry to say he has not met that burden.\n  Prior to his confirmation hearing when I met him in private, his \nresponses troubled me. He told me ``there is a whole lot between pretty \nplease and torture'' and that coercive techniques short of torture are \nsometimes effective. When I reminded Judge Mukasey that cruel, inhuman, \nand degrading treatment are illegal under U.S. law, he said he thought \nthese terms were ``subjective'' and suggested the President might have \nauthority as Commander in Chief to ignore the prohibition.\n  In light of these responses, which troubled me greatly, I decided to \nfollow up with the questions I asked at his confirmation hearing. I \nasked him whether the torture technique known as waterboarding is \nillegal. He refused to answer, saying:\n\n       I don't know what's involved in the technique. If \n     waterboarding is torture, torture is not constitutional.\n\n  Frankly, I was surprised that Judge Mukasey was unfamiliar with \nwaterboarding. This is not a new technique. It may be one of the oldest \nrecorded forms of torture in the world.\n  Retired RADM John Hutson, former Navy Judge Advocate General, also \ntestified at Judge Mukasey's hearing. He was asked about Judge \nMukasey's position on waterboarding. This is what he said:\n\n       Other than perhaps the rack and thumbscrews, waterboarding \n     is the most iconic example of torture in history. . . . It \n     has been repudiated for centuries. It's a little \n     disconcerting to hear now that we're not quite sure where \n     waterboarding fits in the scheme of things. I think we have \n     to be very sure where it fits in the scheme of things.\n\n  To give Judge Mukasey a chance to clarify his views, I wrote him a \nletter, which all 10 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee \nsigned, and asked him a very straightforward question. Certainly, \nstraightforward questions need to be fielded by lawyers, by judges, and \nthe Attorney General.\n  The question was this: Is waterboarding illegal?\n  It took Judge Mukasey four pages, in a response to our committee, to \nsay nothing. He refused to say whether waterboarding was illegal \nbecause ``hypotheticals are different from real life.'' He went on to \nsay it would depend on ``the actual facts and circumstances.''\n  Waterboarding is not hypothetical. This old woodcut dates back to the \nSpanish Inquisition, 515 years ago. It shows a prisoner being subjected \nto waterboarding. This is no new idea. It is simulated drowning to \ncreate panic in the mind of the detainee and to force compliance.\n  The Spanish inquisitors referred to waterboarding as ``tormenta de \ntoca,'' after the linen towel they placed over a victim's mouth and \nnose during the procedure. Waterboarding was part of an elaborate \nregime of torture that included the rack and dislocating limbs by means \nof a pulley.\n  Here we are 500 years later, and it is still being used today, sadly, \nin Burma by the military dictatorship. There are no facts and \ncircumstances that need to be considered--it either is or it isn't \ntorture.\n  Judge Mukasey would not say whether waterboarding was torture. Many \nothers have, and they did not need four pages of legal obfuscation. I \nreceived a letter from four retired military officials about Judge \nMukasey's position on waterboarding. This is what they said:\n\n       This is a critically important issue--but it is not, and \n     never has been, a complex issue. . . . Waterboarding \n     detainees amounts to illegal torture in all circumstances. To \n     suggest otherwise--or even to give credence to such a \n     suggestion--represents both an affront to the law and to the \n     core values of our nation.\n\n  In a recent statement on the Mukasey nomination, Republican Senators \nJohn McCain, John Warner, and Lindsey Graham wrote:\n\n       Waterboarding, under any circumstances, represents a clear \n     violation of U.S. law. . . . anyone who engages in this \n     practice, on behalf of any U.S. government agency, puts \n     himself at risk of criminal prosecution.\n\n  The Judge Advocates General, the highest ranking military lawyers in \nAmerica--all four branches--testified unequivocally to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee that waterboarding is illegal and violates Common \nArticle 3 of the Geneva Conventions. If these high-ranking military \nofficials and our fellow colleagues in the Senate can answer this \nquestion so directly, why can't Judge Mukasey?\n  Let's take an example.\n  BG Kevin M. Sandkuhler, Staff Judge Advocate to the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps, stated that ``threatening a detainee with imminent death, \nto include drowning, is torture.'' No equivocation there. Nothing about \n``facts and circumstances.'' He did not need to hear more. Simulated \ndrowning is torture.\n  Malcolm Nance is a former master instructor and chief of training at \nthe U.S. Navy Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape School. He \ntrained Navy SEALS to resist torture, including waterboarding. Listen \nto what Mr. Nance, former master instructor of the SEALS, had to say:\n\n       I know the waterboard personally and intimately. . . . I \n     personally led, witnessed and supervised waterboarding of \n     hundreds of people. . . . Waterboarding is a torture \n     technique. Period. There is no way to gloss over it or \n     sugarcoat it. . . . Waterboarding is slow motion suffocation \n     with enough time to contemplate the inevitability of black \n     out and expiration--usually the person goes into hysterics on \n     the board. . . . When done right it is controlled death.\n\n  Each year, our State Department stands in judgment of the human \nrights record of the world. It is a rather bold thing for us to do, to \nsay that our Nation has the moral authority to judge all the nations in \nthe world when it comes to human rights. This is not the first \nPresident to do it. Many before have. Our own State Department has long \nrecognized that waterboarding is torture and repeatedly criticized \ncountries such as Sri Lanka and Tunisia for the use of the technique--a \ntechnique Judge Mukasey will not even acknowledge as torture.\n  For over 100 years, our Government has treated waterboarding as a \ncrime.\n\n[[Page S14149]]\n\nJudge Evan Wallach, who used to work for majority leader Harry Reid, is \na former military lawyer and expert on waterboarding. He recently wrote \na study that concluded:\n\n       In all cases, whether the water treatment was applied by \n     Americans or to Americans, or simply reviewed by American \n     courts, it has uniformly been rejected as illegal, often with \n     severely punitive results. . . .\n\n  In April of 1902, 105 years ago, during the U.S. occupation of the \nPhilippines, Secretary of War Elihu Root directed that officers alleged \nto have used water torture be tried by court-martial. That year, U.S. \nArmy MAJ Edwin Glenn was convicted of having ordered and directed the \napplication of the so-called water cure. Army Judge Advocate General \nGeorge Davis said of Major Glenn that he was guilty of ``a resort to \ntorture with a view to extort a confession.'' Mr. President, 105 years \nago we convicted an American soldier of engaging in torture, for using \nwaterboarding in the Philippines.\n  What happened after World War II? The United States prosecuted \nJapanese military personnel as war criminals for waterboarding U.S. and \nother prisoners.\n  At the U.S. military commission at Yokohama, we tried three Japanese \ndefendants for torture. The charges included ``fastening [an American \nPrisoner of War] on a stretcher and pouring water up his nostrils.'' \nDuring the trial, Thomas Armitage, one of the American victims, \ndescribed it. This is what he said:\n\n       [T]hey would lash me to a stretcher then prop me up against \n     a table with my head down. They would then pour about two \n     gallons of water from a pitcher into my nose and mouth until \nI lost consciousness.\n\n  What did we say of the Japanese soldiers responsible for that heinous \nconduct? We said they were guilty of war crimes--war crimes against \nAmerican soldiers and prisoners. They were convicted and sentenced to \nbetween 15 and 25 years of confinement at hard labor--for a crime that \nthis man who would be our Attorney General cannot acknowledge as \nobvious, clearly illegal, and inconsistent with America's values.\n  In the trial of a Japanese soldier for the torture and murder of \nPhilippine civilians, one victim testified:\n\n       I was ordered to lay on a bench and [they] tied my feet, \n     hands and neck to that bench lying with my face upward. After \n     I was tied to the bench [they] placed some cloth on my face \n     and then with water from the facet they poured on me until I \n     became unconscious.\n\n  What does it take? What does it take to get this man who wants to be \nthe premier law enforcement official in America to acknowledge the \nobvious? Waterboarding is torture. Waterboarding is illegal. \nWaterboard- ing is unconstitutional and inconsistent with American \nvalues.\n  Some within this administration share the puzzlement that Judge \nMukasey has over torture. Apparently, Vice President Dick Cheney is \none. He was asked whether it would be acceptable to him to give a \ndetainee ``a dunk in the water.'' The Vice President's response was: \n``it's a no-brainer for me.''\n  And the Bush administration now seems to have reined in the State \nDepartment, despite the fact that we have condemned other nations for \nwaterboarding. Earlier this week, John Bellinger, the State \nDepartment's top legal adviser, was asked whether there could be any \ncircumstances in which a foreign government could justify waterboarding \nan American citizen. Listen to this response from the Bush \nadministration as to whether an American citizen could be waterboarded:\n\n       One would have to apply the facts to the law, the law to \n     the facts, to determine whether any technique, whatever it \n     happened to be, would cause severe physical pain or \n     suffering.\n\n  Incredible. We prosecuted Japanese soldiers for doing this to \nAmericans, and now this administration, maintaining this notion that \nsomehow this is a hazy, undefinable concept, will not even clearly \ncondemn the use of waterboarding to torture Americans.\n  Judge Mukasey's position on waterboarding is troubling, but there are \nother serious concerns which I explained during the Judiciary Committee \ndebate. He would not answer direct questions about other torture \ntechniques even though the Judge Advocates General had made it clear \nthey were torture. Sadly, time and again, he said his response would \ndepend on the facts and circumstances.\n  Mr. President, I do not know when--I do not know if I will be here to \nsee it; I may not be alive at the time--but history will be written \nabout this moment. The history will be written about what we have done \nas a nation under the administration of George W. Bush. There will be \ngood things said, I am sure, but there will also be chapters written \nabout, how this administration raised an issue which we thought was a \nsettled matter, how this administration has now brought in play the \nquestion of torture, how this administration has identified this great, \ncaring, and good Nation with that issue.\n  Our only hope is that men and women of courage within this \nadministration and outside will stand up and say clearly, once and for \nall, torture is un-American, torture is ineffective, and torture is \nunacceptable when applied to detainees in our control or to Americans \nin the control of others. Judge Mukasey would not say that. He was \nunwilling to make those statements.\n  I think this issue transcends many other issues. Some will come \nbefore us and say the problem here is Congress just has not done its \njob. If Congress would sit down and really put a good definition of \ntorture together, then maybe we could ask Judge Mukasey about it, ask \nwhether he would enforce it.\n  Really? Mr. President, 105 years ago, the United States knew \nwaterboarding was torture and prosecuted an American soldier for \nengaging in it. Sixty years ago, we knew waterboarding was torture and \nprosecuted Japanese soldiers for war crimes. And now, in this moment in \nhistory, is there really any uncertainty? The real uncertainty is what \nthe administration has done in the name of our country in the treatment \nof prisoners.\n  When the history of this time is written, there will be stories of \ncourage and stories of cowardice. Rest assured, the United States will \nnot be viewed kindly if we confirm as the chief law enforcement officer \nof this country someone who is unwilling or unable to recognize torture \nwhen he sees it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the allocation has been made of 5 hours \nequally divided on the confirmation of Judge Michael Mukasey to be \nAttorney General and also to cover the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  I have been informed that I will be in charge of the allocation of \ntime. So I say to my colleagues who want to speak in favor of former \nJudge Mukasey or who want to speak on the Defense appropriations bill \non the Republican side, come to the floor and let me know how much time \nyou would like. The Democrats who are speaking in favor of Judge \nMukasey will come out of my time as well. We ought to have some idea as \nto how much time will be required. Five hours will put us close to \nmidnight.\n  The ways of the Senate are wondrous. It is hard to figure out--we had \nour last vote at 11:45 and finished shortly after noon and could have \nstarted this debating process early in the afternoon. But, as I say, in \nthe wondrous ways of the Senate, we could not begin it until 7 o'clock, \nuntil we had reached an agreement on procedural details, which might \nwell have been done earlier. But I have been here a while, and I \nlearned a long time ago the Senate is a lot smarter than I am, and we \nfollow--we play the cards we are dealt. But I don't think there is any \nneed for us to be in session until midnight, although things could get \nlively and perhaps some stray television viewers will turn on C-SPAN 2; \nthey certainly wouldn't do it during the daytime when the soaps are on. \nBut, it may well be that the time will be yielded back. And so, I \ninform my colleagues to not necessarily expect to vote as late as \nmidnight, although that may be the case.\n\n  Now, on to former Federal Judge Michael Mukasey. He is a man with an \noutstanding record. If you went to central casting, you couldn't find a \nbetter prospect to be Attorney General of the United States on \nsubstance or on qualifications. He graduated from Columbia University \nin 1963, Yale Law School in 1967, and was on the Board of Editors of \nthe Yale Law Journal. With credentials from Yale, including the Board \nof Editors, and his high academic standing,\n\n[[Page S14150]]\n\nthese are excellent qualifications. He was an associate in a major New \nYork law firm for 5 years after graduating from law school. He was then \nan assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New \nYork from 1972 to 1976 and was chief of the Official Corruption Unit \nfor 2 years. Then, he returned to the practice of law for 11 years and \nbecame a Federal judge in 1988, serving for almost two decades, through \n2006. He was Chief Judge of the Federal Court in the Southern District \nof New York in Manhattan from 2000 to 2006 where he presided over some \nvery important trials involving terrorism. The courthouse for the \nFederal court in New York was just a few blocks from the Trade Towers, \nwhich were victimized on September 11, 2001.\n  Now, a great deal has been said about the issue of waterboarding. The \nSenator from Illinois who just spoke said the morals of our country \nwill be judged by what has gone on with Judge Mukasey's confirmation \nprocess. We have worked through this issue, and I believe we have a \nsatisfactory resolution of it, which accomplishes the substance of what \nthe Senator from Illinois was decrying.\n  I am opposed to waterboarding. I think waterboarding is torture. When \nthe issue was before the U.S. Senate on the Military Commission Act, we \nhad a vote, and this body voted 53 to 46 not to classify waterboarding \nas torture. That is what the Senate did. In another legislative matter, \nthe Detainee Treatment Act, waterboarding was prohibited. But, as of \nthis moment, the Congress of the United States has not spoken on the \nmatter.\n  Now Judge Mukasey has stated that if waterboarding is declared the \nequivalent of torture, as Attorney General he will uphold that \ncongressional determination, even if the President seeks to reject the \nstatute by virtue of the President's Article 2 powers as Commander in \nChief and other inherent authority, which the President possesses under \nArticle 2. Now that is exactly what the President did on the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act enacted \nin 1978 specifies that the exclusive way to wiretap is to go to a \nFederal judge with a statement of probable cause and get a warrant--\njudicial approval--to do the wiretapping. But, President Bush said he \nhad authority to disregard the statute because he had constitutional \nauthority.\n  As a matter of constitutional doctrine, you can't amend the \nConstitution with a statute. To amend the Constitution, you have to \nhave a constitutional amendment. An amendment must pass the Congress by \na two-thirds vote and be ratified by three-fourths of the States.\n  So the President took the position that his constitutional power \nsuperseded the statute, and he rejected it and ignored it. I have grave \ndoubts about the propriety of what the President did. We didn't find \nout about it until it was disclosed in the newspapers in mid-December \nof 2005 when we were in the midst in this Chamber of debating the \nPATRIOT Act. I chaired the Judiciary Committee, and I was at this \npodium managing that bill when the news broke in the morning papers \nthat day, and a number of Senators said they were prepared to vote for \nthe PATRIOT Act until they found out what had been done secretly under \nthe Terrorist Surveillance Program.\n  As the record shows, we didn't pass the bill until early in 2006. But \nthe relevance of that procedure is that there was concern that even if \nCongress said waterboarding was torture and was therefore illegal, the \nPresident might seek to use his Article 2 powers to ignore that law.\n  The first disclosure that former Judge Mukasey would not uphold that \ntype of Presidential action came with a disclosure by Senator Schumer \nabout a meeting he had with former Judge Mukasey last Friday. It \nappeared in the press that Judge Mukasey would say the congressional \nenactment was controlling. I then had a discussion by telephone with \nJudge Mukasey last Monday morning to be explicit and to confirm what I \nhad read in the papers. Not wanting to rely on that, Judge Mukasey told \nme he that it was his legal judgment that Congress had the \nconstitutional authority to legislate, to say waterboarding was torture \nand was, therefore, illegal. And if such legislation was enacted, then \nit was Judge Mukasey's legal judgment that the President could not \nsupersede the statute and could not rely on Article 2 power to ignore \nthat finding. That was confirmed in writing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter dated last Monday, \nNovember 5, be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. I said in the letter, as the record will show, if Judge \nMukasey had any difference with my statement, he should let me know \npromptly. I know it was received by White House personnel, and \nwe communicated, staff to staff, about it, and that is a binding \ncommitment. That commitment, in conjunction with Judge Mukasey's \nresponse to my questioning--I asked him if the President of the United \nStates ignored his advice as Attorney General if and when confirmed on \na matter of serious import, would Judge Mukasey resign as Attorney \nGeneral, just as Attorney General Elliot Richardson had resigned on the \nSaturday Night Massacre when efforts were made to stop the \ninvestigation of President Nixon at that time, and Judge Mukasey said \nhe would resign. So, I think we have a very solid record.\n\n  Now, I do believe there were reasons Judge Mukasey did not express a \njudgment on waterboarding as being torture, although candidly it would \nhave been my preference if he had done so and if he had agreed with my \nvote on the subject. But, Judge Mukasey said in written responses that \nhe believed he could not make that pronouncement without placing people \nat risk to be sued or perhaps even criminally prosecuted. A few weeks \nago, former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld was in Paris at a time when \npeople sought legal process against him. It was unclear whether it was \na criminal procedure or a civil procedure, but we do know that many \nnations are exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction when they may \nconsider conduct to be a violation of the law against humanity.\n  We know, for example, that Israeli Prime Minister Sharon was \nindicted, I believe it was in Belgium. They couldn't serve the warrant, \nbut had he gone to Belgium. He would have been subject to that process. \nWe know the case of Pinochet from Chile where extraterritorial \njurisdiction was sought as to him. So this is a matter of some \nconsiderable import.\n  Professor Goldsmith wrote, speaking from his experience as Assistant \nAttorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel, that members of the \nadministration had expressed concerns that they might be subject to \ncivil liability or even criminal liability if it was later determined \nthat some of their conduct was illegal. So, Judge Mukasey faced a \nsituation where an expression of an opinion by him would put people at \nrisk.\n  Professor Goldsmith, in a book which was recently published, \ndocumented the concern that members of the administration had \nexpressed. Judge Mukasey also sought to explain his unwillingness to \ngive a legal opinion on whether waterboarding was torture because he \nhadn't been read into the program. I thought that was inadequate and \ninsufficient. While it is true he was not read into the program, there \nis no doubt it would have been easy for him to have been read into the \nprogram. The investigation which had been conducted prior to the \nPresident submitting his name to the Senate as a nominee for Attorney \nGeneral was very thorough, and there is no doubt that he would have \nbeen entrusted with whatever classified information was involved in \nbeing informed on the issue of waterboarding. So I thought that was an \nexcuse and not weighty--or not a valid excuse.\n  Parenthetically, I think it is worth noting that there are members of \nthe Judiciary Committee who were called upon to pass on Judge Mukasey's \nqualifications who had not been read into the program on waterboarding; \nthat is, to know specifically what it was, whether it was used, what it \nwas all about, was it entirely hypothetical, or what the facts were. We \nhave some members of the Judiciary Committee--four--who are on the \nIntelligence Committee. The chairman and I as ranking member were read \ninto the program. I tried to get the administration to read\n\n[[Page S14151]]\n\nthe members of the Judiciary Committee into the program, but the \nadministration wouldn't do it. Now, they read the Intelligence \nCommittee into the program, and I think the Intelligence Committee \nshould have been read into the program, but the operative committee to \npass on Judge Mukasey was not the Intelligence Committee. It was the \nJudiciary Committee. We voted on Judge Mukasey with members of the \nJudiciary Committee not knowing the specifics on waterboarding to have \na sufficient basis, in my view, to cast an intelligent vote. But the \nadministration precluded that. This evening, there will be about 80 \nSenators--if they stay up until midnight, or whenever it is that we \nvote--who will be voting on Judge Mukasey and waterboarding is going to \nbe a central issue of the debate tonight--without knowing the details \nof what waterboarding is.\n\n  The brutal fact is that the administration has not given Congress the \ninformation Congress should have received so that we can perform our \noversight function. The Intelligence Act requires that members of the \nIntelligence Committee be notified of matters such as the secret \nterrorist surveillance program, and it may be that a few Members of \nCongress--the Speaker of the House, the senior Republican in the House, \nthe majority leader of the Senate, and the minority leader of the \nSenate--were informed about the terrorist surveillance program. It may \nbe that, finally, the chairman and ranking members on the Intelligence \nCommittee in both Houses were informed. But the full committee, under \nthe statute, was supposed to be informed. The administration didn't \nfollow the statute as they should have. It was only when the \nconfirmation of General Hayden came before the Senate that the \nadministration finally notified the Intelligence Committee.\n  I voted against General Hayden to be Director of the CIA as a protest \nvote. I said he was well qualified for the job, and I voted against him \nas a protest because the administration had not followed the law. They \nshould have informed me, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the \n109th Congress, and Senator Leahy, as ranking member. That is a \nstatement of what might be considered as a collateral matter. It is \nrelevant in this discussion because Judge Mukasey was not read into the \nprogram. I think he should have been. I don't know that he would have \nsaid anything more. But now the ball is squarely in our court--the \ncongressional court. Legislation is pending that would make \nwaterboarding torture and, therefore, illegal.\n  This is the kind of question which I think is a quintessential \nexample of what the Congress of the United States ought to decide. In a \nrepresentative democracy, the Congress ought to make the determination \nof what is the appropriate public policy, and the Congress ought to \nassess the risk of terrorism--what is the risk to the United States?--\nand then consider the conduct of waterboarding. What does it do? How \nfrequently has it been used, if at all? Where is there an intent to use \nit? The Congress ought to make this evaluation and make the decision. \nWe are the proper people to decide that issue. If the Congress enacts \nlegislation that is signed into law, then Judge Mukasey has stated \nunequivocally that he would enforce it.\n  Then there is another issue we all dance around, and that is the \nissue of the so-called ticking-bomb case. That is the situation \ndescribed where a terrorist may come into possession of a powerful \nweapon--perhaps even a nuclear weapon--and, regrettably, that is not \nbeyond the realm of possibility. There might be a situation where \nsomeone would know information that could stop the ticking bomb and \ninjury to an enormous number of people could be prevented. What is to \nbe done in that situation?\n  The generalized statements that have been made by so-called leaders \nin our society are that we ought not to define that situation. They \nsay, if we were to say that torture, waterboarding, or some other \nextreme form of interrogation were legal under even the most limited \ncircumstances, that we would give legitimacy to waterboarding, to \ntorture. And then with an exception, you find people that say--as the \nexpression goes, the hole is so big, you could drive a truck through \nit. But, if this Senate and the House take up our duty to decide \nwhether waterboarding is torture, we ought to make a decision as to \nwhether it could be used in any circumstance. Perhaps we should decide \nit should be used in no circumstance.\n  There has also been discussion about legislation to define the \nextraordinary circumstances when torture would be permitted--with a \nwarrant application to a judge. We ask for judicial approval on \nwiretapping or warrants of arrest or on a variety of issues.\n  Then there are some who the surmise that if the President was faced \nwith a situation of a ticking bomb, it would be up to the President to \nact under those exigent circumstances, and he could be relied upon. But \nthat is not so easy either because it may well be--and I think, in \nfact, is--that agents of the CIA would not undertake, under a \nPresidential order, a violation of U.S. law because no one is above the \nlaw. Even if the President were to authorize it, the President doesn't \ndo the waterboarding or interrogation. Those people would be unwilling \nto undertake something that was a violation of law.\n  There was a famous case, after World War I, where a ship was sunk by \na submarine. The survivors in the lifeboat were at sea, and the \nsubmarine surfaced. The commander ordered the gunner to shoot the \npeople in the lifeboat. The gunner resisted for a while, and then he \nfollowed his orders. He shot and killed the people in the lifeboat. The \ngunner was prosecuted, and he defended that he was following orders. \nThe court said that you cannot follow illegal orders. Anybody should \nknow better than to shoot people in a lifeboat.\n  So we have a major issue to consider as it relates to the \nconfirmation of Judge Mukasey, and I think the ball is now in our \ncourt. He will enforce legislation that equates waterboarding with \ntorture.\n  There are a couple of other points worthy of comment. I was not \nsatisfied with Judge Mukasey's response to my questions on signing \nstatements. We have seen that the President of the United States now \ndoes not follow the constitutional options when legislation is \npresented to him having been passed by both bodies, both Houses, where \nthe Constitution says the President has the choice of signing it or \nvetoing it. We now find that he signs it and issues the signing \nstatement, cherry-picking, deciding which of the provisions he will \nenforce and which he will not enforce.\n\n  One of the measures passed by Congress by a 90-to-9 vote of the \nSenate was prohibiting interrogation that met certain standards. The \nPresident had a famed rapprochement with Senator McCain on the point. \nThey came to terms. We passed the McCain language. Then the President \nissued a signing statement which, in effect, said he retained his \nArticle II powers not to follow it.\n  The PATRIOT Act, which came out of the committee during my tenure as \nchairman, gave the FBI substantial additional powers. In consideration \nof that, we reserved additional oversight. And then, notwithstanding \nthat negotiation approved by the President's agents at the Department \nof Justice, the President issued a signing statement cherry-picking and \nleaving him free to disregard the oversight provision.\n  I think Judge Mukasey should have been unequivocal in condemning that \npractice and should have said he would advise the President to either \nsign legislation or veto it but not to cherry-pick. He had a very \nartful answer where he says he will try to avoid this kind of tension \nand conflict between the executive branch and the Congress. While I \ndon't like that, I don't think it is a sufficient reason to vote \nagainst him.\n  Judge Mukasey was forthright on his views as to habeas corpus. He \nacknowledged that habeas corpus is a constitutional right, unlike his \npredecessor, who really rejected the plain English of the Constitution, \nwhich states that habeas corpus is a constitutional right.\n  Considering all of these factors, it is my judgment, after meeting \ninformally with former Federal Judge Mukasey and participating in the \nextensive hearings and reviewing answers to many written questions, \nthat Judge Mukasey is well qualified to be Attorney General. I think it \nunfortunate that there will be many negative votes\n\n[[Page S14152]]\n\nagainst him. I think those negative votes will be in the context of \nthis waterboarding issue, where there are very substantial emotional \nand political considerations involved, and Senators exercise rights to \nvote as they choose. But I do believe that even those who vote against \nJudge Mukasey will acknowledge his qualifications. He is well qualified \nby way of academic and professional background, and he has a very \nsterling record as a judge; that he is honest, forthright, and \ntalented. He is a lawyer's lawyer or a judge's judge. When you talk to \nhim or question him at a hearing, you get back very sophisticated, \nerudite answers, analytically displaying a vast knowledge of the \nConstitution and the cases which have been interpreted. What weighs \nheavily in my mind on Judge Mukasey is the urgent need of the \nDepartment for new leadership.\n  I thank the chairman for having a special markup on Tuesday. It was \nextra work for the committee, but Senator Leahy called the Judiciary \nCommittee together for an extra markup. He has exercised the leadership \nto bring this matter to a vote tonight.\n  I thank the distinguished majority leader also for scheduling the \nvote, because the Department of Justice needs Judge Mukasey at work \ntomorrow morning. They need to have him sworn in sometime between the \nvote of confirmation tonight and 8 a.m. tomorrow, when people ought to \nreport to work at the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice \nhas been categorized as dysfunctional, in disarray. It is in urgent \nneed of an Attorney General. When that is done, I think we will see \nsome nominations for Deputy, which is vacant. An Associate Attorney \nGeneral is only an acting deputy, and a number of assistants are only \nacting.\n  All things considered, I think it is in the national interest that we \nconfirm former Federal Judge Mukasey. I predict he will do a sterling \njob as Attorney General.\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 2 hours remaining \nunder his control.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 2007.\n     Hon. Michael B. Mukasey,\n     Avenue of the Americas,\n     New York, NY.\n       Dear Judge Mukasey: I think it is important to have our \n     telephone conversation of this morning on the record so I'm \n     writing to confirm the following:\n       (1) In your opinion, Congress has the constitutional \n     authority to legislate that waterboarding is torture and is \n     therefore illegal; and\n       (2) If such legislation is enacted, it is your opinion that \n     the President would not have the authority under Article II \n     of the Constitution to overrule that legislation.\n       If I have inaccurately stated our conversation, I would \n     appreciate your prompt advice.\n       As we discussed, the New York Times on Saturday quoted \n     Senator Schumer on your commitment to the same effect. If I \n     do not hear from you to the contrary, I intend to release \n     this letter to the news media because this information would \n     be important on the Senate's consideration of your \n     confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time has been reserved for the \nSenator from Vermont?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 45 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is reserved overall for those in opposition \nto this nomination?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. An hour and 45 minutes. Twenty has \nbeen used, so 1 hour 25 minutes remains.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this debate is as much a discussion of principles that \nare vital to American ideals and to the American soul as it is a debate \nabout who is going to act as the Attorney General for the next 14 \nmonths.\n  During the Judiciary Committee's consideration of this nomination \nearlier this week, Senators Kennedy, Kohl, Feingold, Durbin, Cardin, \nWhitehouse, and I made clear the fallacy that would disregard settled \nlaw and discredit America's role in the struggle for liberty and human \ndignity, something we should all support.\n  On the way to rationalizing support for a particular nominee, just as \nwith rationalizing support for a particular piece of legislation, it \nmay be tempting this once--just this once, we might tell ourselves--\ntacitly to abet the arguments of those who want to define torture down \nto make it something less. Whatever the temptation--whatever the \ntemptation, this once--we cannot rationalize away our core American \nideals, the rule of law, and the principle that in America, not even \nthe President is above the law.\n  The President and Vice President should not be allowed to violate our \nobligations under the Convention Against Torture and the Geneva \nConventions, should not be allowed to disregard U.S. statutes, such as \nour Detainee Treatment Act and War Crimes Act. They should not be \nallowed to overturn more than 200 years of our Nation's reverence for \nhuman rights and moral leadership around the world.\n  The administration has compounded its lawlessness by cloaking its \npolicies and miscalculations under a veil of secrecy. They left the \nCongress, they left the courts, and, most importantly, they left the \nAmerican people in the dark about what they were doing. The President \nsays we do not torture, but then he had his lawyers redefine \n``torture,'' and he had them do that in secret memos, in fundamental \nconflict with American values and law.\n  Again, yesterday, I wrote to the White House counsel reiterating my \nearlier request for this administration's secret, purported \njustifications for having Americans engage in waterboarding and other \ntreatment that would violate our Nation's obligations and values.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of my \nmost recent letter to Counsel Fielding on this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 7, 2007.\n     Mr. Fred Fielding, Esq.,\n     Office of the Counsel to the President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Fielding: I have not received a reply to the \n     letter I sent to you almost two weeks ago seeking a fuller \n     accounting of this Administration's legal justifications and \n     policies with regard to torture and interrogation. Another \n     copy of my unanswered October 25, 2007, letter is enclosed.\n       Over the past few days I have read in the press that there \n     may, in fact, be three legal memoranda from the Justice \n     Department's Office of Legal Counsel in 2005, not just two, \n     that have been withheld from us. Apparently, the \n     Administration has conceded the existence of three such \n     memoranda in court filings this week. Without even an \n     accounting from you and the Administration, it is impossible \n     for me to know.\n       As I have previously noted, the Committee does not yet have \n     a complete picture of the Administration's historic position \n     on the legal basis and standards for detention, transfer, and \n     interrogation in connection with counter-terrorism efforts. \n     It is important that you share with the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee all legal opinions on these issues from the Office \n     of Legal Counsel and elsewhere in the Department of Justice \n     and the Administration. I noted in my previous letter that \n     you have not, despite our repeated requests, provided us with \n     the 2005 memoranda that apparently authorize the use of \n     combinations of cruel and extreme practices. We are fast \n     approaching the one-year anniversary of my November 15, 2006, \n     request for ``any and all Department of Justice directives, \n     memoranda, and/or guidance . . . regarding CIA detention and/\n     or interrogation methods.''\n       I regret that you did not take the opportunity created with \n     the announced resignation of Alberto Gonzales to work with us \n     to put these matters to rest. The first step would have been \n     disclosure of the legal memoranda still being kept secret \n     from the Senate Judiciary Committee. That has yet to occur. \n     As you have recently witnessed, without these materials and a \n     shared understanding of what the Administration has been \n     doing, is doing, its justifications, its legal analysis, and \n     its purported basis for overriding our laws and treaty \n     obligations, many Members of the Committee remain very \n     concerned.\n       Much of the controversy and discussion surrounding the \n     Committee's consideration of the President's nomination of \n     Michael Mukasey to serve as Attorney General arose from these \n     matters. The Administration's lack of cooperation greatly \n     contributed to the controversy and ultimately to the \n     opposition to that nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree with the generals, the admirals, \nand the judge advocates general that waterboarding is torture and is \nillegal. The generals, the admirals, the judge\n\n[[Page S14153]]\n\nadvocates general say waterboarding is torture and illegal.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of a \nletter I received from MG John Fugh, RADM Don Guter, RADM John Hutson, \nand BG David Brahms, dated November 2.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 November 2, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: In the course of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee's consideration of President Bush's nominee for the \n     post of Attorney General, there has been much discussion, but \n     little clarity, about the legality of ``waterboarding'' under \n     United States and international law. We write because this \n     issue above all demands clarity: Waterboarding is inhumane, \n     it is torture, and it is illegal.\n       In 2006 the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on the \n     authority to prosecute terrorists under the war crimes \n     provisions of Title 18 of the U.S. Code. In connection with \n     those hearings the sitting Judge Advocates General of the \n     military services were asked to submit written responses to a \n     series of questions regarding ``the use of a wet towel and \n     dripping water to induce the misperception of drowning (i.e., \n     waterboarding). . . ,'' Major General Scott Black, U.S. Army \n     Judge Advocate General, Major General Jack Rives, U.S. Air \n     Force Judge Advocate General, Rear Admiral Bruce MacDonald, \n     U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General, and Brigadier Gen. Kevin \n     Sandkuhler, Staff Judge Advocate to the Commandant of the \n     U.S. Marine Corps, unanimously and unambiguously agreed that \n     such conduct is inhumane and illegal and would constitute a \n     violation of international law, to include Common Article 3 \n     of the 1949 Geneva Conventions.\n       We agree with our active duty colleagues. This is a \n     critically important issue--but it is not, and never has \n     been, a complex issue, and even to suggest otherwise does a \n     terrible disservice to this Nation. All U.S. Government \n     agencies and personnel, and not just America's military \n     forces, must abide by both the spirit and letter of the \n     controlling provisions of international law. Cruelty and \n     torture--no less than wanton killing--is neither justified \n     nor legal in any circumstance. It is essential to be clear, \n     specific and unambiguous about this fact--as in fact we have \n     been throughout America's history, at least until the last \n     few years. Abu Ghraib and other notorious examples of \n     detainee abuse have been the product, at least in part, of a \n     self-serving and destructive disregard for the well-\n     established legal principles applicable to this issue. This \n     must end.\n       The Rule of Law is fundamental to our existence as a \n     civilized nation. The Rule of Law is not a goal which we \n     merely aspire to achieve; it is the floor below which we must \n     not sink. For the Rule of Law to function effectively, \n     however, it must provide actual rules that can be followed.\n       In this instance, the relevant rule--the law--has long been \n     clear: Waterboarding detainees amounts to illegal torture in \n     all circumstances. To suggest otherwise--or even to give \n     credence to such a suggestion--represents both an affront to \n     the law and to the core values of our Nation.\n       We respectfully urge you to consider these principles in \n     connection with the nomination of Judge Mukasey.\n           Sincerely,\n         Rear Admiral Donald J. Guter, United States Navy (Ret.), \n           Judge Advocate General of the Navy, 2000-02; Rear \n           Admiral John D. Hutson, United States Navy (Ret.), \n           Judge Advocate General of the Navy, 1997-2000; Major \n           General John L. Fugh, United States Army (Ret.), Judge \n           Advocate General of the Army, 1991-93; Brigadier \n           General David M. Brahms, United States Marine Corps \n           (Ret.), Staff Judge Advocate to the Commandant, 1985-\n           88.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, these distinguished military officers, flag \nofficers, people who are charged with knowing what is our law, what is \nour Constitution, what are our treaty commitments, and what are the \nrules our military must follow, write with absolute clarity, and I \nquote the significant sentence from their letter:\n\n       Waterboarding is inhumane, it is torture, and it is \n     illegal.\n\n  They also quote the sitting judge advocates general of the military \nservices from our committee's hearing last year in which they \nunanimously and unambiguously agreed that waterboarding is inhumane, it \nis illegal, it is a violation of law.\n  Think for a moment, if another nation picked up an American and \nwaterboarded that American and we heard about it; no Senator, no \nAmerican would have to know the circumstances and the purported \njustifications for it. We would condemn it. All 100 of us would be on \nthe floor condemning it, and 435 members of the other body would be \ncondemning it. Whoever was President of the United States would condemn \nit. But you know what, that was before this debate began, and now, \ntragically, this administration has so twisted America's role and our \nlaws and values that apparently our own State Department is now ordered \nthey cannot say that waterboarding of an American is illegal.\n  Mr. President, that is how far we have sunk. I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record a copy of a letter I sent to Secretary \nRice protesting this order.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 2007.\n     Hon. Condoleezza Rice,\n     Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Rice: There are reports that one of your \n     principal aides and legal advisers, a Mr. John Bellinger, is \n     taking the legal position that he cannot say whether it is \n     permissible to waterboard Americans and that it depends on \n     the facts and circumstances. I could not disagree more \n     strongly. There are no conceivable facts or circumstances \n     that would justify waterboarding an American anywhere in the \n     world for any reason. Our treaty obligations and domestic law \n     make waterboarding illegal. Please respond without delay and \n     set this matter straight.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, senior State Department legal officers are \ntold that waterboarding, which has been recognized as torture, not for \nthe last 10 years or 50 years or 100 years, but has been recognized as \ntorture for the last 500 years, is a ``technique'' they cannot rule out \nas something a foreign intelligence service might be justified in using \nagainst Americans. This is ``Alice in Wonderland.''\n  Never mind that President Teddy Roosevelt, no shrinking violet he, \nprosecuted American soldiers for this more than 100 years ago. Never \nmind that we prosecuted Japanese soldiers for waterboarding Americans \nduring World War II. Never mind what repressive regimes are doing to \nthis day around the world. It is appalling.\n  When it comes to our core values--the things that make our country \ngreat, that define America's place in the world--it does not depend on \nthe circumstances; it depends on our core values. America, the great \nand good nation that has been a beacon to the rest of the world on \nhuman rights, does not torture, it should not stand for torture, and it \nshould stand against torture.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of a \nletter I received from the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, \ndated November 1.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       National Religious Campaign\n\n\n                                              Against Torture,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 1, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, 433 \n         Russell Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Religious Campaign Against \n     Torture (NRCAT), a campaign of over 130 religious \n     organizations working together to abolish U.S.-sponsored \n     torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of anyone, \n     without exception, is deeply concerned about the responses \n     Judge Michael Mukasey gave both at his nomination hearing and \n     in his most recent written response on the subject of \n     torture. We believe his answers leave open the door to the \n     use of techniques by the U.S. government that would be cruel, \n     inhuman and degrading and that could amount to torture. This \n     is true not only for waterboarding, which is clearly illegal \n     and a form of torture, but also for a number of other \n     techniques we understand the CIA has used and may continue to \n     use.\n       Our country already knows what happens when we have an \n     Attorney General who countenances torture and cruel, inhuman \n     or degrading treatment. We lose our moral compass; decent \n     Americans are called upon on our behalf to commit acts that \n     damage their souls; our soldiers who may be captured are \n     placed in greater jeopardy; we are shamed in the eyes of the \n     world.\n       It is time to turn a new page; the confirmation of a new \n     Attorney General is such an opportunity. It would be tragic \n     to allow an individual who has not clearly rejected the \n     illegal and immoral practices of torture and cruel, inhuman \n     degrading treatment to become the leading law enforcement \n     officer of our nation.\n       NRCAT members, who include representatives from the \n     Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, \n     Orthodox Christian, Unitarian Universalist, Jewish, Quaker,\n\n[[Page S14154]]\n\n     Muslim, and Sikh communities, believe that torture violates \n     the basic dignity of the human person that all religions, in \n     their highest ideals, hold dear. It degrades everyone \n     involved--policy-makers, perpetrators and victims--and it \n     contradicts our nation's most cherished values. We believe \n     that any policies that permit torture and inhuman treatment \n     are shocking and morally intolerable.\n       We urge you to approve a nominee as Attorney General who is \n     unequivocal in his or her stance against the use of torture \n     and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Linda Gustitus,\n       President.\n     Rev. Richard Killmer,\n       Executive Director.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what do we set as an example? We lose our \nway on this question of torture. When America arranged to have a \nCanadian citizen, changing a plane in the United States on the way to \nCanada, sent to Syria to be tortured, what did we tell the rest of the \nworld? I will tell you what we told the rest of the world: Here we have \nthe outrageous conduct of President Musharraf's Government in Pakistan. \nHe is closing down the courts, he is closing down the opposition, he is \nclosing down the press. We have to meekly say: Please don't do that; we \ndo send you billions of dollars in aid; please don't destroy democracy.\n  A Cabinet Minister in his Government was interviewed yesterday on a \nCanadian show. When he was asked if he was ashamed of the images the \nworld was seeing of Pakistanis being clubbed by police in the streets, \npart of his reply was this: Are other countries--referring to the \nUnited States--ashamed of taking persons from another country to a \nthird country and torturing them? Are they ashamed?\n  I would like to think as Americans we hold the high moral ground, but \nwe can be lectured because we have not, by the likes of a member of the \nCabinet of a despotic regime in Pakistan, and there is no answer to it. \nThere is no answer to it because what he objects to us doing is sending \na citizen of another country who was on our land to Syria to be \ntortured, and we have no answer to that because this administration and \nthis Government did it.\n  I am proud to be an American. I am so happy my maternal grandparents \nimmigrated to this country from Italy and gave me a chance to be an \nAmerican, as did my great-grandparents from Ireland. I am proud of it. \nI am proud to see my children growing up as Americans, now my \ngrandchildren, as I know the distinguished Presiding Officer whose \nfamily has been in this country much longer than mine is proud of his \nAmerican heritage. But torture should not be what America stands for. \nIndeed, the better example is set by the Army Field Manual, which \ninstructs our forces to consider how we would react if what a soldier \nis about to do to someone was done to an American soldier. How would \nour soldiers react if they found somebody waterboarding an American \nsoldier? They would do everything to rescue them because it would be \nwrong and it would be illegal. It is not just illegal and wrong if \nsomebody else does it, it is illegal and it is wrong if we do it.\n  Sadly, when I cited this very standard in a written question to Judge \nMukasey and asked if it would be an abuse if another country \nwaterboarded an American, he sidestepped the question, and he failed to \ncondemn even waterboarding of Americans. When we found our State \nDepartment to begin to do the same, I saw a pattern.\n  In their recent letter to the nominee, Senators Warner, McCain, and \nGraham do not take that approach. They recognize, as I do and I hope \nall Senators do, that waterboarding, under any circumstances, \nrepresents a clear violation of U.S. law. That is what Senators Warner, \nMcCain, and Graham said. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nI agree with them.\n  When the administration and others state that we cannot state whether \nAmerica waterboards people because it would tip off our enemies, they \nhave it precisely wrong. That is about as effective as Saddam Hussein \nhinting that he had weapons of mass destruction, even though he did \nnot, as he tried to impress his enemies.\n  In refusing to say we do not waterboard prisoners, what do we do? We \nend up giving license to others. When the United States cannot state \nunequivocally that waterboarding is torture and illegal and will not be \ntolerated, what does that mean for other Governments? What comfort does \nthat provide the world's most repressive regimes? How does it allow the \nUnited States, that hitherto has been a beacon for human rights, to \ncriticize or lecture these repressive regimes that torture that way?\n  Some have sought to find comfort in Judge Mukasey's personal \nassurance that he would enforce a future, some kind of new law against \nwaterboarding if Congress were to pass one. Even some in the press have \nused that talking point from the White House. Any such prohibition \nwould have to be enacted over the veto of this President, a President \nwho has not ruled out the use of waterboarding.\n  But the real damage in this argument is not its futility. The real \nharm is that it presupposes we don't already have laws and treaty \nobligations against waterboarding. As we know, when we enter a treaty, \nit becomes the law of the land. We have laws already against it. We \ndon't need a new law. No Senator should, with any kind of clear \nconscience, abet this administration's legalistic obfuscations by \nthose, such as Alberto Gonzales, who take these positions, or John Yoo \nand David Addington, by agreeing somehow that the laws we already have \non the books do not already make waterboarding illegal. We have been \nproperly prosecuting water torture for more than 100 years.\n  Vote for the nominee or vote against the nominee, but don't hide \nbehind some kind of a cloak and say maybe we should have a law in the \nfuture. We have that law. This is as if, when somebody murders somebody \nwith a baseball bat, they were to say: We had a law against murder, but \nwe never mentioned baseball bats. Murder is murder; torture is torture. \nOur laws make both illegal, and our laws--but especially our values--do \nnot permit this to be an open question or even one that depends on who \nis doing the waterboarding. We cannot say it is wrong when other \ncountries do it but, of course, it is right when we do it because our \nheart is pure. That is a prescription for disaster. That is what \nheightens the risk to American citizens and soldiers around the world, \nand it gives repressive regimes comfort, and that is something I will \nnot do.\n  I will not accept this fallacious argument. I will not accept this \npretense that it is OK because we have not yet passed a law, when that \nhas always been the law in the United States. It was in Theodore \nRoosevelt's day, it was when we prosecuted Japanese soldiers after \nWorld War II for waterboarding, and it is today.\n  It would be like saying we haven't a specific law for some of the \nthings done in Abu Ghraib. Of course, we had not. We knew such actions \nviolated every principle of our law. Are we going to say, however, it \nwas all right because we didn't have spelled out in the law every \nsingle thought that could be raised about torture so we could \nspecifically cite to that?\n  Mr. President, hasn't there been enough harm done to the United \nStates by the images of Abu Ghraib? Hasn't there been enough harm done \nto the United States by this Government intentionally taking a Canadian \ncitizen and sending that citizen to Syria to be tortured? Hasn't there \nbeen enough harm done to this country that we don't need to have \nSenators stand on the floor of the Senate and say: Well, maybe sometime \nin the future we should have a law against waterboarding, when our top \nmilitary and everybody else all agree this is already against the law.\n  Now, I wish I could support Judge Mukasey's nomination because I like \nhim. I like his legal abilities. I like his background as a prosecutor. \nHe is a tough, no-nonsense prosecutor. But we are dealing with an \nadministration that has been acting outside the law, an administration \nthat has now created a confirmation contortion. Mr. President, I am not \na moral contortionist, and I am not going to aid and abet the \nconfirmation contortions of this administration. When many of us voted \nto confirm General Petraeus, the administration turned around and, for \npolitical advantage, tried to claim when we voted to confirm the \ngeneral, we also voted for the President's war policies. Well, I did \nnot vote for a war in Iraq. I voted against it. And I do not vote to \nallow torture. And just as I do not support this President's Iraq \npolicy, I do not support his torture policy\n\n[[Page S14155]]\n\nor his views of unaccountability or unlimited Executive power.\n  No one is more eager to restore strong leadership and independence to \nthe Department of Justice than I. For almost 3 years, it has been \nleaderless. For almost 3 years, it has engaged in every single effort \nnot to follow the law, but to find ways around the law. That has \ncreated a terrible problem of morale among the very wonderful men and \nwomen, the talented men and women who work there.\n  We all know what we need most right now is an Attorney General who \nbelieves and understands there must be limitations on Executive power. \nWhether the Executive is a Republican or a Democratic President, there \nhave to be limitations. America needs to be certain of the bedrock \nprinciples of our laws and our values and that no President, no \nAmerican, can be authorized to violate them. In America, no one is \nabove the law. The President of the United States is not above the law. \nHe is not allowed to place anybody else above the law. That is what has \nmaintained this democracy for over 200 years.\n  When we began considering this nomination, I observed that the \nDepartment of Justice has experienced an unprecedented crisis of \nleadership. It is a crisis that has come more and more into view as \nSenator Specter and I have led a bipartisan group of concerned Senators \nserving on our Judiciary Committee to consider a U.S. attorney firing \nscandal, a confrontation over the legality of the administration's \nwarrantless wiretapping program, and the politicization of hiring at \nthe Department of Justice. What we have seen is not just poor \nleadership, but the complete breakdown of the principles that have \nalways embodied the Department of Justice and the position of Attorney \nGeneral.\n  For me, the issue has never been personal to Alberto Gonzales. The \nJudiciary Committee's investigations into the Department's many \nscandals were not designed to force the resignation of Alberto \nGonzales, but rather to restore the integrity and the mission of the \nDepartment of Justice. My goal was not to force his resignation but to \nrestore the Department of Justice. That the administration had him \nremain more than 6 months after the U.S. attorney firing scandal was \nknown continued the harm and forestalled the restoration of order.\n  It was not just the fact that he lost my confidence that forced him \nto leave. It was not the Senate passing a resolution of no confidence. \nRather it was our bipartisan efforts in which Republicans and Democrats \nwho care about Federal law enforcement and the Department of Justice \njoined together to press for accountability.\n  The issue during the Senate confirmation of Alberto Gonzales remains \ntoday. The Department of Justice has always set out to enforce the law \nand to ensure that no one, not even the President, is above the law. As \nwe consider the nomination of Michael Mukasey, we must determine what \nkind of Attorney General he would be and whether he will stand for the \nrule of law against the demands of this White House.\n  I began my consideration of this nomination as I did with the last \nAttorney General nomination, hoping to be able to support the nominee. \nAfter the hearing for the last nominee in 2005, I decided that I could \nnot vote for the confirmation of Alberto Gonzales. I did so noting, as \nJustice James Iredell had in 1792, that the person who serves as \nAttorney General ``is not called Attorney General of the President, but \nAttorney General of the United States.'' This is a different kind of \nCabinet position, distinct from all the others, and it requires greater \nindependence. The departing Attorney General never understood this. \nInstead, he saw his role as a facilitator for this White House's \noverreaching policies and partisan politics.\n  The crisis of leadership that led to the resignation of the entire \nsenior leadership of the Department and their staffs, as well as Karl \nRove and his two top aides at the White House, has taken a heavy toll \non the tradition of independence that had long guided the Department of \nJustice and protected it from political influence. As a former \nprosecutor I know that the dismay runs deep, from the career attorneys \nat Justice and in our U.S. attorney offices, straight down to the cops \non the beat.\n  The Senate should only confirm a nominee who will bring a commitment \nto the rule of law and American liberties and values back to the \nJustice Department. As I have reviewed Judge Mukasey's nomination, I \nhave found much to like. He has impressive credentials, vast experience \nas a lawyer and a judge, and a refreshingly straightforward manner. I \nliked him when I met him, and I am convinced that he is a man of \nintegrity and would not be governed merely by personal or political \nloyalty.\n  At his hearing, he answered firmly that he would not tolerate \npolitical meddling in investigations or litigation and would end hiring \nbased on politics, and he was clear in asserting that he would resign \nif the President insisted on going forward with a course of action he \nhad found to be illegal. These were encouraging signs.\n  But I am concerned that he shares with this administration a view of \nvirtually unbridled executive power and authority. In these uncertain \ntimes, it may be tempting simply to defer the Commander in Chief, but I \nbelieve that in difficult times, it is more important than ever to \ninsist on the rule of law and the principles that have made our country \nunique in the world for more than 200 years. Even Judge Mukasey's \nstrong promise to resign if the President insists on an illegal course \nof action loses its power if he believes the President to be largely \nunconstrained by law. If nothing the President can do would be illegal, \nthere would never be an occasion for him to make such a principled \nstand.\n  That is why I was so disappointed by Judge Mukasey's answers \nsuggesting that he sees little occasion to check the President's power. \nI was disturbed by his insistence that, with regard to warrantless \nwiretapping and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the \nPresident has inherent authority outside of the statute and could \nauthorize and immunize conduct contrary to the law. I fail to see a \nvalid distinction justifying his assertion that the President could \nhave the power of an executive override in the surveillance context, \nbut not in the torture context, and I worry about where his reasoning \ncould lead us.\n  I was disappointed in his abandoning his initial answer to parrot the \nWhite House's conclusion that a U.S. attorney could not bring a \ncongressional contempt citation to a grand jury. That is the mechanism \nin the law that allows an independent court the opportunity to referee \nany claim of executive privilege that the executive and legislative \nbranches could not resolve amongst themselves. He, instead, insisted \nthat the solution in such a situation was an ``accommodation'' of the \nkind that this administration has been consistently unwilling to make. \nOnce again, his position leads me to worry that he would allow this \nPresident's unprecedented assertions of power to go completely \nunchecked.\n  I was saddened to hear Judge Mukasey say that he apparently would not \nsupport habeas corpus rights for detainees, rejecting a core legal \nright and a basic American value which Senator Specter and I have \nfought so hard to restore. I was disappointed to see him echo in \nresponse to my questions the same administration policy on \nextraordinary rendition that has led to several disgraceful episodes \nfor this Nation and fail to commit even to review the case of Maher \nArar, a prominent and disturbing episode of rendition.\n  Which brings me back to the issue that came to dominate the \nconsideration of this nomination, the issue of torture. The United \nStates does not torture. The United States does not inflict cruel, \ninhuman, and degrading treatment. This is part of the moral fiber of \nour country and our historical place as a world leader on human rights, \nand it has long been fixed in our laws, our Constitution, and our \nvalues.\n  That is why I was so saddened when Judge Mukasey, given repeated \nopportunities, refused to say that the ancient and extreme technique of \nwaterboarding, a brutal practice in which a person is subjected to \nsimulated drowning, is illegal. There may be interrogation techniques \nthat require close examination and extensive briefings. Waterboarding \nis not among them. Judge Mukasey does not need a\n\n[[Page S14156]]\n\nclassified briefing to learn about waterboarding. He could go to the \nlibrary to read about waterboarding that was done as far back as the \nSpanish Inquisition, or about American prosecutions of Japanese war \ncriminals for waterboarding after World War II. Evan Wallach, a judge \nat the U.S. Court of International Trade, a professor who teaches the \nlaw of war, and a former JAG officer, wrote an insightful column in \nlast Sunday's Washington Post that I ask unanimous consent be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Waterboarding Used To Be a Crime\n\n                           (By Evan Wallach)\n\n       As a JAG in the Nevada National Guard, I used to lecture \n     the soldiers of the 72nd Military Police Company every year \n     about their legal obligations when they guarded prisoners. \n     I'd always conclude by saying, ``I know you won't remember \n     everything I told you today, but just remember what your mom \n     told you: Do unto others as you would have others do unto \n     you.'' That's a pretty good standard for life and for the \n     law, and even though I left the unit in 1995, I like to think \n     that some of my teaching had carried over when the 72nd \n     refused to participate in misconduct at Iraq's Abu Ghraib \n     prison.\n       Sometimes, though, the questions we face about detainees \n     and interrogation get more specific. One such set of \n     questions relates to ``waterboarding.''\n       That term is used to describe several interrogation \n     techniques. The victim may be immersed in water, have water \n     forced into the nose and mouth, or have water poured onto \n     material placed over the face so that the liquid is inhaled \n     or swallowed. The media usually characterize the practice as \n     ``simulated drowning.'' That's incorrect. To be effective, \n     waterboarding is usually real drowning that simulates death. \n     That is, the victim experiences the sensations of drowning: \n     struggle, panic, breath-holding, swallowing, vomiting, taking \n     water into the lungs and, eventually, the same feeling of not \n     being able to breathe that one experiences after being \n     punched in the gut. The main difference is that the drowning \n     process is halted. According to those who have studied \n     waterboarding's effects, it can cause severe psychological \n     trauma, such as panic attacks, for years.\n       The United States knows quite a bit about waterboarding. \n     The U.S. government--whether acting alone before domestic \n     courts, commissions and courts-martial or as part of the \n     world community--has not only condemned the use of water \n     torture but has severely punished those who applied it.\n       After World War II, we convicted several Japanese soldiers \n     for waterboarding American and Allied prisoners of war. At \n     the trial of his captors, then-Lt. Chase J. Nielsen, one of \n     the 1942 Army Air Forces officers who flew in the Doolittle \n     Raid and was captured by the Japanese, testified: ``I was \n     given several types of torture. . . . I was given what they \n     call the water cure.'' He was asked what he felt when the \n     Japanese soldiers poured the water. ``Well, I felt more or \n     less like I was drowning,'' he replied, ``just gasping \n     between life and death.''\n       Nielsen's experience was not unique. Nor was the \n     prosecution of his captors. After Japan surrendered, the \n     United States organized and participated in the International \n     Military Tribunal for the Far East, generally called the \n     Tokyo War Crimes Trials. Leading members of Japan's military \n     and government elite were charged, among their many other \n     crimes, with torturing Allied military personnel and \n     civilians. The principal proof upon which their torture \n     convictions were based was conduct that we would now call \n     waterboarding.\n       In this case from the tribunal's records, the victim was a \n     prisoner in the Japanese- occupied Dutch East Indies:\n       A towel was fixed under the chin and down over the face. \n     Then many buckets of water were poured into the towel so that \n     the water gradually reached the mouth and rising further \n     eventually also the nostrils, which resulted in his becoming \n     unconscious and collapsing like a person drowned. This \n     procedure was sometimes repeated 5-6 times in succession.\n       The United States (like Britain, Australia and other \n     Allies) pursued lower-ranking Japanese war criminals in \n     trials before their own tribunals. As a general rule, the \n     testimony was similar to Nielsen's. Consider this account \n     from a Filipino waterboarding victim:\n       Q: Was it painful?\n       A: Not so painful, but one becomes unconscious. Like \n     drowning in the water.\n       Q: Like you were drowning?\n       A: Drowning --you could hardly breathe.\n       Here's the testimony of two Americans imprisoned by the \n     Japanese: They would lash me to a stretcher then prop me up \n     against a table with my head down. They would then pour about \n     two gallons of water from a pitcher into my nose and mouth \n     until I lost consciousness. And from the second prisoner: \n     They laid me out on a stretcher and strapped me on. The \n     stretcher was then stood on end with my head almost touching \n     the floor and my feet in the air. . . . They then began \n     pouring water over my face and at times it was almost \n     impossible for me to breathe without sucking in water.\n       As a result of such accounts, a number of Japanese prison-\n     camp officers and guards were convicted of torture that \n     clearly violated the laws of war. They were not the only \n     defendants convicted in such cases. As far back as the U.S. \n     occupation of the Philippines after the 1898 Spanish-American \n     War, U.S. soldiers were court-martialed for using the ``water \n     cure'' to question Filipino guerrillas.\n       More recently, waterboarding cases have appeared in U.S. \n     district courts. One was a civil action brought by several \n     Filipinos seeking damages against the estate of former \n     Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos. The plaintiffs claimed \n     they had been subjected to torture, including water torture. \n     The court awarded $766 million in damages, noting in its \n     findings that ``the plaintiffs experienced human rights \n     violations including, but not limited to . . . the water \n     cure, where a cloth was placed over the detainee's mouth and \n     nose, and water producing a drowning sensation.''\n       In 1983, federal prosecutors charged a Texas sheriff and \n     three of his deputies with violating prisoners' civil rights \n     by forcing confessions. The complaint alleged that the \n     officers conspired to ``subject prisoners to a suffocating \n     water torture ordeal in order to coerce confessions. This \n     generally included the placement of a towel over the nose and \n     mouth of the prisoner and the pouring of water in the towel \n     until the prisoner began to move, jerk, or otherwise indicate \n     that he was suffocating and/or drowning.''\n       The four defendants were convicted, and the sheriff was \n     sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n       We know that U.S. military tribunals and U.S. judges have \n     examined certain types of water-based interrogation and found \n     that they constituted torture. That's a lesson worth \n     learning. The study of law is, after all, largely the study \n     of history. The law of war is no different. This history \n     should be of value to those who seek to understand what the \n     law is--as well as what it ought to be.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. More than 100 years ago, in 1901 and 1902, U.S. military \ncommissions charged American officers with waterboarding detainees in \nthe Philippines, and President Theodore Roosevelt wrote:\n\n       Great as the provocation has been in dealing with foes who \n     habitually resort to treachery, murder and torture against \n     our men, nothing can justify the use of torture or inhuman \n     conduct of any kind on the part of the American Army.\n\n  This country's abhorrence for cruel treatment of detainees goes back \nfurther still to General George Washington who wrote of captured troops \nduring the Revolutionary War:\n\n       Treat them with humanity, and let them have no reason to \n     complain of our copying the brutal example of the British \n     Army in their treatment of our unfortunate brethren.\n\n  Those are American standards and American values that should not be \ncompromised.\n  As RADM John Hutson, former Judge Advocate General of the Navy, \ntestified to the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       Other than perhaps the rack and thumbscrews, water-boarding \n     is the most iconic example of torture in history. It has been \n     repudiated for centuries. It's a little disconcerting to hear \n     now that we're not quite sure where water-boarding fits in \n     the scheme of things. I think we have to be very sure where \n     it fits in the scheme of things.\n\n  Judge Mukasey acknowledged that, in evaluating interrogation \ntechniques, we look to standards such as whether the conduct ``shocks \nthe conscience,'' whether it is ``outrageous,'' or whether it is ``for \nthe purpose of humiliating and degrading the detainee.'' He was \nunwilling, though, to say that waterboarding meets these standards. To \nme, it is not a hard call that waterboarding shocks the conscience, \nthat it is outrageous, that it humiliates and degrades detainees. I do \nnot believe that the question whether waterboarding is illegal is \nsubject to a balancing test. It is. Indeed, it is that kind of \n``balancing test'' that has allowed this President to claim the \ndiscretion to commit so many abuses that have brought such disgrace on \nthis great country.\n  Senator McCain, who knows too much about the issue of torture, said \nrecently:\n\n       Anyone who knows what waterboarding is could not be unsure. \n     It is a horrible torture technique used by Pol Pot and being \n     used on Buddhist monks as we speak. People who have worn the \n     uniform and had the experience know that this is a terrible \n     and odious practice and should never be condoned in the U.S. \n     We are a better nation than that.\n\n  I agree.\n  Nothing is more fundamental to our constitutional democracy than our \nbasic notion that no one is above the law. This administration has \nundercut that precept time after time. They are now trying to do it \nagain, with an issue as fundamental as whether the United States of \nAmerica will join the ranks\n\n[[Page S14157]]\n\nof those governments that approve of torture. That is why I will vote \nno on the President's nomination.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before yielding 20 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from California, I praise Senator Feinstein for \nher work on the confirmation of Judge Mukasey. As is customary for \nSenator Feinstein, she is present at all the hearings, at all the \nJudiciary Committee business, and comes to the meetings extraordinarily \nwell prepared. I think she has a natural advantage, however, because \nshe is not a lawyer.\n  It is a very difficult matter in this body to state the facts and to \ncross party lines, and to do so requires a number of factors. It \nrequires a lot of confidence and judgment, and it requires a lot of \ncourage to stand up as one of very few.\n  Her vote and Senator Schumer's vote were indispensable to move the \nnomination to the Senate floor. So she has 20 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Mr. President, shortly the Senate will vote on whether to confirm \nMichael Mukasey as the next Attorney General or whether to leave the \nDepartment of Justice without a real leader for the next 14 months.\n  I believe that is the issue. I will vote to confirm Judge Mukasey.\n  For me, the Department of Justice has always been the beacon of law \nenforcement and justice around the world. I have always truly believed \nwe had a state-of-the-art system of justice that functioned \nindependently of whoever happened to hold the White House or whoever \nwas in the Congress. This beacon has been dimmed in the last 7 years, \nand I am one who finds the Department in disarray today.\n  I think the real issue before us today is: Can this nominee be a \nstrong and independent leader of the Justice Department in the \nremaining time of this administration? Can he depoliticize the \nDepartment? Can he restore its morale? Will he be independent from the \nWhite House?\n\n  If your answer is yes, then I believe we should vote for him. If it \nis no, then you don't mind an Acting Attorney General for the next 14 \nmonths.\n  Ten of the most important positions in the Department today have no \npermanent person serving but are either acting or interim. Mr. \nPresident, 21 out of 93 U.S. Attorney positions are vacant, and only \ntwo nominees are pending before the Senate for confirmation.\n  Cases have been brought based on partisan considerations instead of \nthe facts and the law. U.S. Attorneys who did not initiate partisan \nprosecutions were summarily fired. The Civil Rights Division has been \nweakened and politicized.\n  Judge Mukasey has shown he will be a strong and independent Attorney \nGeneral.\n  He couldn't be any more different from Alberto Gonzales. Alberto \nGonzales owed his political career, and his legal career to a great \nextent, to President Bush. Judge Mukasey does not. He has followed an \nindependent path. And he has been, for 18 years, a Federal district \ncourt judge--yes, following the rule of law, not the rule of man. He \nhas stood on his own, he has litigated on his own, he has judged on his \nown.\n  Judge Mukasey, in my view, is going to be a very different Attorney \nGeneral. And it is hard for me to understand why everyone in this body \ndoesn't come to the same conclusion just by judging his background \nagainst the background of the prior Attorney General. That is very hard \nfor me to understand. Their backgrounds--their legal backgrounds, their \nservice backgrounds--are so entirely different.\n  If you read the 178 pages of answers to questions that were submitted \nby Senators, some as many as 30, 35 questions, you see the independence \nof Judge Mukasey. In response to question 20 by Senator Kennedy, Judge \nMukasey said this:\n\n       There can be no political litmus test for the hiring of \n     career civil service employees. This is, and must be, a \n     bedrock principle.\n\n  He added that he would have ``zero tolerance'' in this area.\n  Isn't that what we want?\n  On the issue of politically motivated prosecutions, which, as I have \nsaid, I believe there have been by this department, he said, in the \ntranscript, dated 10/17/07, page 19:\n\n       Partisan politics plays no part in either the bringing of \n     charges or the timing of charges.\n\n  And in response to question 20(a) by Senator Durbin he also said he \nwould recommend the firing of any U.S. Attorney who brought or planned \nto bring a case for partisan gain.\n  Isn't that what we want?\n  With regard to election crime prosecutions, he wrote this:\n\n       The closer to an election, the higher the standard that \n     must be met for charges to be brought.\n\n  That was in response to question no. 18 from Senator Kennedy.\n  In addition, Judge Mukasey made it clear he will work to fix the many \nproblems that have arisen in the Department's Civil Rights Division. He \nwrote this to us:\n\n       The Civil Rights Division occupies a crucial place in the \n     Department precisely because it continues to carry out the \n     work of the civil rights movement by enforcing the Nation's \n     civil rights laws. I strongly support the mission of the \n     Civil Rights Division and will ensure that it has the tools \n     and resources it needs to fulfill its mandate.\n\n  This was in answer to a question submitted by Senator Leahy.\n  I think these answers alone show it is not going to be business as \nusual in the Department of Justice.\n  Isn't that what we want?\n  Now, the President has said publicly he will not send another nominee \nto the Senate. So what does that mean? It means if we don't confirm \nthis nominee, we will effectively have an Acting Attorney General for \nthe remaining 14 months of this President's tenure.\n  And what does that mean? It could likely mean that Peter Keisler, who \nhas been an architect of Bush administration policies at DOJ for more \nthan 5 years, will remain as Acting Attorney General for the rest of \nthis administration.\n  Is that what we want?\n  It means most likely there will be recess appointments this winter \nfor the 10 major leadership positions in the Department.\n  And what does that mean? Simply stated: The administration could put \nin place the most egregious and political leadership, and we--the \nSenate--could do nothing about it. We would have reduced transparency \nand reduced congressional oversight.\n  Now this is the realpolitik. This is the likelihood, should Judge \nMukasey fail confirmation.\n  I believe it is the fundamental and driving factor for confirmation \nof this nominee. Not to confirm him will leave this vital department \nopen to a continuation of egregious past actions, and we have railed \nagainst those past actions for years now. We have a chance to make a \nchange.\n  We don't select the nominee, the President selects the nominee.\n  Does he have failed character? No. Does he lack in experience? No. \nDoes he have the temperament to be Attorney General? He has proven it \nwith 18 years as a Federal judge.\n  Does he know one of the most important areas of the law--national \nsecurity law? He has tried some of the major terrorist cases that have \nbeen tried in Article III courts in the United States of America, and \ndefendants have gone to prison.\n  Now, I have seen people pound their breasts here on torture. And none \nof us want torture.\n  There is a difference between U.S. law and treaty law. We have passed \ncertain U.S. laws. We have passed a Military Commissions Act. That is a \nlaw of the United States of America. We have passed the Detainee \nTreatment Act. That is a law of the United States of America. The \nDetainee Treatment Act prohibits waterboarding for any military \npersonnel anywhere in the world.\n  So, to the opponents of this nomination: We have passed a law. They \nsay it is not necessary to pass a law, but in fact we have passed a law \nprohibiting waterboarding. And Judge Mukasey has said the Detainee \nTreatment Act is binding on the President and binding on this country.\n  The one exception is, there is no U.S. law that deals with the CIA. \nThat is the exception. There are prestigious human rights groups that \nsay it\n\n[[Page S14158]]\n\ndoesn't matter; the Geneva Conventions and the Conventions Against \nTorture prevail. The President is saying I have Article II authority, \nand AUMF authority, and my view of Presidential power.\n  So what will solve it? A constitutional confrontation? The Supreme \nCourt? What solves it?\n  My belief is, it is so easy: Instead of pounding our chests, simply \ndo what we did in the Detainee Treatment Act, but do it for the CIA and \nprohibit waterboarding. End of debate.\n  Some people want to keep the issue alive rather than solve the \nproblem. I am not one of those people. I believe we should end the \nambiguity, and simply prohibit waterboarding across the board.\n  I do not believe Judge Mukasey should be denied confirmation for \nfailing to provide an absolute answer on this one subject.\n  Nobody should think anything else is happening tonight. He would be \ndenied confirmation because he said, I would like an opportunity to \nlook at these laws, to look at these treaties, to read the legal \nopinions that have been written, and then have time to make up my mind.\n  Maybe we will want people to snap to and issue immediate judgments. \nThis man has been a judge for 18 years. Maybe he likes to consider the \nfacts before he makes a decision. I don't think that should be \ndisqualifying.\n  We can bring him before the Judiciary Committee in late January and \nsimply say: Judge Mukasey, now-Attorney General Mukasey, you have had \nan opportunity to look at the law. What is your opinion?\n  At the same time, I can say to you quite honestly, I believe \nwaterboarding is illegal. I don't think it should be countenanced by \nthe United States of America. I am not a lawyer, and I have not been \nfor 18 years--or even 1 year--a Federal judge.\n  I believe waterboarding is prohibited under the Convention Against \nTorture and the Geneva Conventions. But it is not prohibited by name. \nIt is prohibited in terms of its effects. There is a certain grayness \nfor some--for some.\n  The opponents of this nomination have not given us any reason to \nthink an acting or interim Attorney General would give us a better \nanswer about waterboarding.\n  As a matter of fact, I would hazard a guess they would not. I would \nhazard a guess that if this nominee goes down, the exact same policies \nthat have characterized the last 7 years will continue for the next 14 \nmonths. Am I being too abrupt to suggest we are missing something, that \nwe should not get overwhelmed by the pounding of the chest against \ntorture--that this is our chance for change?\n  If Judge Mukasey were not a respected judge, if he didn't have the \nlegal background, if he didn't have the streak of independence--and \nread 178 pages of questions and answers and you will see that streak of \nindependence--I would tend to agree with some of what has been said \nhere. But I do not, because I seriously believe this is the only chance \nthis Senate is going to be offered to put new leadership in the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  If, in fact, you believe it is in disarray, then there is only one \naction to take. If you believe it has been politicized, there is only \none action to take.\n  The former Attorney General has not been independent, and he said he \nwore two hats--one serving the White House and one serving the people. \nIf you believe there is only one hat an Attorney General can wear, and \nthat is serving the people, then you have no choice other than Judge \nMukasey. That is because otherwise, there will be an Acting Attorney \nGeneral, not subject to confirmation, not subject to questioning, not \nsubject to any kind of oversight--but, again, an arm of the White \nHouse.\n  Most of the major newspapers in my State have editorialized in favor \nof Judge Mukasey. This is what the San Diego Union-Tribune had to say \nabout him:\n\n       Torture is antithetical to American values. President Bush \n     ought to issue an Executive order explicitly outlawing \n     waterboarding. That said, Mukasey is not to blame for the \n     Bush administration's interrogation policies. In his \n     confirmation hearings, he has demonstrated a firm commitment \n     to defend the Constitution. He merits confirmation by the \n     Senate.\n\n  They got it.\n  The Detroit Free Press had this to say:\n\n       As Attorney General, Mukasey can be expected to fight hard \n     for what's legal rather than what's expedient.\n\n  Don't we want that?\n\n       At least that's a step toward restoring the rule of law in \n     the last 14 months of the Bush administration. The full \n     Senate should confirm Mukasey, lest the president's next pick \n     be someone with a more malleable sense of right and wrong.\n\n  Then, a paper from my State, The Sacramento Bee, got it right:\n\n       As a replacement for Alberto Gonzales, Michael Mukasey, the \n     nominee for U.S. attorney general, would bring a restorative \n     independence of mind to the job. . . . Mukasey appears likely \n     to operate in the open and with a higher respect for the \n     system of the U.S. Government than for personal ties.\n\n  A critical question.\n\n       We would expect him to urge the president to work with \n     Congress. The Senate should confirm Mukasey to begin the \n     cleanup at Justice.\n\n  This is the only chance we have. It is not as if we can turn him down \nand the administration is going to send us another nominee. They have \nalready said they will not.\n  I do not believe that voting down this nominee will do even a bit of \ngood in preventing torture. No one has explained why more of the same \nat the Justice Department would be better than putting Judge Mukasey in \ncharge.\n  I do believe he will be a truly nonpolitical, nonpartisan Attorney \nGeneral; that he will make his views very clear; and that, once he has \nthe opportunity to do the evaluation he believes he needs on \nwaterboarding, he will be willing to come before the Judiciary \nCommittee and express his views comprehensively and definitively.\n  In conclusion, this nominee had no part in the administration's \npolicies or legal opinions with respect to torture. We should not blame \nhim for them. How can this man be the standard-bearer for torture? He \nis not. Why is he being treated as such?\n  We should give this nominee an opportunity to look at these treaties, \nlook at the laws, read the opinions, and we should do what we are here \nto do--legislate and prohibit waterboarding across the board.\n  I thank the ranking member.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I control the \ntime allocated to Senator Reed of Rhode Island, who has indicated he \nwill not be using that time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \nnext Democratic speakers be the following: Senators Cardin, Boxer, \nKennedy, Salazar and Sanders but not necessarily in that order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, would the sequence permit alternating \nbetween those four against Judge Mukasey?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. It would.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The order would so provide.\n  Mr. SPECTER. So provided, for alternation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. For alternation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair, thank the Senator from New Jersey, \nand pardon the interruption.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be the next Attorney General \nfor the United States. This has not been an easy decision for me to \nmake.\n  I met Judge Mukasey before the judiciary hearings and liked him \nimmensely on a personal level. We discussed the unprecedented and \nextremely harmful politicization that that has occurred within the \nJustice Department since the beginning of the\n\n[[Page S14159]]\n\nBush administration. I was encouraged by the steps he said he would \ntake to reverse it. We talked about the problems of leaking secret \ngrand jury information, and I was impressed by his commitment to \ninvestigate any allegations of grand jury leaks and to terminate any \nresponsible prosecutors.\n  In fact, after my meeting, I thought that I could comfortably vote to \nconfirm Judge Mukasey as our next Attorney General. But, then came the \njudiciary hearings.\n  On the second day of the hearings, Judge Mukasey was specifically \nasked whether waterboarding was illegal. Now, before I get to Judge \nMukasey's answer, let me describe what waterboarding is. And, let me \nmake clear that my description contains no classified information--\nnothing that Judge Mukasey would need special security clearance to \nknow.\n  The term waterboarding can be used to describe several different \ninterrogation techniques. In one, the victim is immersed in water. In \nanother, water is forced into the victim's nose and mouth. In the \nthird, water is poured onto material--like cellophane--that is placed \nover the victim's face so that the victim inhales and swallows the \nwater.\n  Regardless of which technique is used, the victim experiences the \nsensations of drowning: they struggle, they panic, they hold their \nbreath. They inhale water into their lungs--they vomit and sometimes \nblack out. This is not simulated drowning. It is simulated death. The \ndrowning is real.\n  Despite this public knowledge of what constitutes waterboarding, \nJudge Mukasey refused to say whether waterboarding was illegal. \nAccording to the judge ``hypotheticals are different from real life.'' \nTherefore whether waterboarding was illegal would depend on ``the \nactual facts and circumstances''--things he did not know I have a hard \ntime understanding what facts and circumstances could make the \nprocedures I just described legal. I have a hard time understanding \nwhat facts and circumstances could make them somehow not cruel and \ninhumane. The only thing I don't have a hard time understanding is why \nJudge Mukasey's evasive and non-committal comments sound so familiar.\n  We have heard them before and all too often. Time and time again, \nother members of the Bush administration have played word games to \njustify their use of illegal or inappropriate interrogation techniques.\n  Judge Mukasey tried to backpedal by saying that he found \nwaterboarding personally repugnant. Well, as many of us know, whether \nsomeone finds a law personally repugnant often has no impact on whether \nthat person will enforce the law. Whether they find an action \npersonally repugnant often has no impact on whether they will prosecute \nthat action.\n\n  Judge Mukasey also said he would uphold any law that Congress passes \nin the future outlawing waterboarding. I am not sure how reassuring \nthis statement is, since waterboarding is already illegal in the United \nStates. Why should Congress have to pass a law prohibiting something \nthat is already illegal?\n  Judge Mukasey should be well aware that waterboarding is illegal. On \nOctober 31, Senators McCain, Graham, and Warner--all experts in the \narea of interrogation and military justice--wrote a letter to Judge \nMukasey stating, without a shadow of a doubt that ``waterboarding, \nunder any circumstances, represents a clear violation of U.S. law.'' \nAnd my colleagues should know this. They authored the 2005 prohibition \non cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment that the President signed \ninto law. During the debate, they made it very clear that the so-called \n``McCain amendment'' prohibits waterboarding or other extreme \ntechniques that ``shock the conscience.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter concerning waterboarding from \nSenators McCain, Warner and Graham and letters of opposition and \nconcern from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and the \nAmerican Psychological Association be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Knowing what we know about waterboarding, there is no \nway anyone can argue that it does not shock the conscience.\n  The McCain amendment is not the only provision of U.S. law \nprohibiting waterboarding. The 2006 Military Commissions Act clearly \nprohibits the practice. It enumerates the grave breaches of common \narticle III of the Geneva Conventions that constitute offenses under \nthe War Crimes Act. And, it explicitly prohibits acts that inflict \n``serious and nontransitory mental harm.'' As my colleagues stated so \nclearly in their letter ``Staging a mock execution by inducing the \nmisperception of drowning is a clear violation of this standard.''\n\n  In fact, the U.S. has successfully prosecuted individuals who have \nengaged in waterboarding. After World War II, U.S. Military Commissions \naccused and successfully convicted Japanese soldiers for torturing \nAmerican prisoners through the use of waterboarding. How can we stand \nhere over 60 years later and confirm an individual to be our country's \nhighest ranking law enforcement official if he will not enforce laws we \nhave already prosecuted?\n\n  There is no reason to believe that waterboarding is anything but \nillegal. There is no compelling argument that it could ever be \nconsistent with U.S. law. There is no ambiguity here. No shades of \ngray. It is clear to me that water boarding is illegal. It is clear to \nmy colleagues Senators McCain, Graham, and Warner that waterboarding \nviolates U.S. law. The only person that it is not clear to is Judge \nMukasey.\n  I have spent some time trying to understand why Judge Mukasey refused \nto confirm something that is so clear under our laws. The only thing I \ncan come up with is that his statement is consistent with the current \nBush administration policy. It protects administration officials who \nhave admitted waterboarding occurred on their watch, and it tacitly \npermits President Bush to continue utilizing waterboarding as an \ninterrogation technique.\n  It strikes me as more than a little coincidental that on his first \nday of testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Mukasey was not \nafraid to depart with administration policy and assert his \nindependence. Yet on the second day of testimony, he all of a sudden \nbegan to play the role of loyal footsoldier.\n  One has to wonder whether this change of heart occurred under \npressure from the administration. If nothing else, it certainly makes \nme wonder whether Judge Mukasey will be as independent of a thinker and \nan actor as he led us all to believe he would be.\n  I hope that I am wrong about Judge Mukasey. This is a critical point \nin history for the Justice Department. Since the beginning of the Bush \nadministration, we have seen the influence of political appointees \nexpand exponentially. We have seen good, qualified, dedicated \nprosecutors fired and replaced by Bush loyalists. We have seen the \nnumber of civil rights prosecutions drop, and we have seen clearly \ndiscriminatory voter I.D. laws approved by partisan political \nappointees over the objections of experienced career employees.\n  The Justice Department clearly needs new leadership. It needs to be \ncleaned up. It needs someone who will not only stop the continuing \npoliticalization but reverse the effects of what has already happened.\n  If confirmed, I hope that Judge Mukasey will be that kind of leader. \nI hope that he will exhibit the independence and honesty that he said \nhe would when I met with him. I hope he is as committed to upholding \nthe laws of the United States as Attorney General as he appeared to be \nas a United States Judge. I hope that his statements on waterboarding \nare an exception to, not an indication of, the role he will play as \nAttorney General.\n  But, I cannot vote on hope alone. I have to vote on facts. And, given \nthe facts available, I simply cannot support Judge Mukasey's \nnomination.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 2007.\n     Hon. Michael B. Mukasey,\n     Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler LLP,\n     New York, NY.\n       Dear Judge Mukasey: We welcome your acknowledgement in \n     yesterday's letter that the interrogation technique known as \n     waterboarding is ``over the line'' and ``repugnant,'' and we \n     appreciate your recognition\n\n[[Page S14160]]\n\n     that Congress possesses the authority to ban interrogation \n     techniques. These are important statements, and we expect \n     that they will inform your views as Attorney General. We also \n     expect that, in that role, you will not permit the use of \n     such a practice by any agency of the United States \n     Government.\n       You have declined to comment specifically on the legality \n     of waterboarding, deeming it a hypothetical scenario about \n     which it would be imprudent to opine. Should you be \n     confirmed, however, you will soon be required to make \n     determinations regarding the legality of interrogation \n     techniques that are anything but hypothetical. Should this \n     technique come before you for review, we urge that you take \n     that opportunity to declare waterboarding illegal.\n       Waterboarding, under any circumstances, represents a clear \n     violation of U.S. law. In 2005, the President signed into law \n     a prohibition on cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment as \n     those terms are understood under the standards of the U.S. \n     Constitution. There was at that time a debate over the way in \n     which the Administration was likely to interpret these \n     prohibitions. We stated then our strong belief that a fair \n     reading of the ``McCain Amendment'' outlaws waterboarding and \n     other extreme techniques. It is, or should be, beyond dispute \n     that waterboarding ``shocks the conscience.''\n       It is also incontestable that waterboarding is outlawed by \n     the 2006 Military Commissions Act (MCA), and it was the clear \n     intent of Congress to prohibit the practice. As the authors \n     of the statute, we would note that the MCA enumerates grave \n     breaches of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions that \n     constitute offenses under the War Crimes Act. Among these is \n     an explicit prohibition on acts that inflict ``serious and \n     nontransitory mental harm,'' which the MCA states (but your \n     letter omits) ``need not be prolonged.'' Staging a mock \n     execution by inducing the misperception of drowning is a \n     clear violation of this standard. Indeed, during the \n     negotiations, we were personally assured by Administration \n     officials that this language, which applies to all \n     agencies of the U.S. Government, prohibited waterboarding.\n       We share your revulsion at the use of waterboarding and \n     welcome your commitment to review existing legal memoranda \n     covering interrogations and their consistency with current \n     law. It is vital that you do so, as anyone who engages in \n     this practice, on behalf of any U.S. government agency, puts \n     himself at risk of criminal prosecution, including under the \n     War Crimes Act, and opens himself to civil liability as well.\n       We must wage and win the war on terror, but doing so is \n     fully compatible with fidelity to our laws and deepest \n     values. Once you are confirmed and fully briefed on the \n     relevant programs and legal analyses, we urge you to publicly \n     make clear that waterboarding can never be employed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John McCain,\n                                            United States Senator.\n                                                   Lindsey Graham,\n                                            United States Senator.\n                                                      John Warner,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     American-Arab\n\n\n                                Anti-Discrimination Committee,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 1, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: On November 5, as the Senate Committee \n     on the Judiciary convenes a nomination hearing for Attorney \n     General Nominee Judge Michael Mukasey, the American-Arab \n     Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), the nations premier \n     organization dedicated ensuring the civil rights of Arab \n     Americans, would like to express its opposition to Judge \n     Mukasey's confirmation.\n       Judge Mukasey has disappointed our national expectations \n     and failed our patriotic legacy as champions of democracy, \n     human rights, and due process. He refused to name the \n     practice of waterboarding as torture, has cast doubts as to \n     whether non-citizens in U.S. custody should enjoy the \n     protection of the U.S. Constitution, and has advocated for \n     the creation of separate national security courts, casting \n     doubt on our time-proven judiciary system.\n       It should be noted that all four currently serving Judge \n     Advocates General for our armed forces are on record in \n     qualifying waterboarding as torture and constituting a war \n     crime. The Attorney General is the nation's chief law \n     enforcement officer and is tasked with the application of the \n     rule of law. The Attorney General must be able to maintain \n     the delicate balance between national security and individual \n     liberties and rights. Judge Mukasey's hesitancy on these \n     vital matters, his doubts as to whether the U.S. \n     Constitution, our supreme law of the land, applies to non-\n     citizens, foreshadow a possible unwillingness on his part to \n     enforce the role of law, including that of our Constitution \n     and international legal standards; standards that our nation \n     has championed for decades.\n       It is time for President Bush to nominate an attorney \n     general who stands up for the values that have defined our \n     nation; Judge Mukasey is not such a nominee. As our nation's \n     largest non-profit organization dedicated since 1980 to \n     defending the civil rights of Americans of Arab descent, we \n     ask that you stand up as a patriot and a leader in defense of \n     our national values and oppose Judge Mukasey's confirmation \n     as the next attorney general.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this matter. Should you \n     or your staff have any questions concerning this matter or \n     ADC's work with the U.S. Department of Justice please do not \n     hesitate to contact ADC Legislative Director Christine \n     Gleichert at Christine@adc.org or (202) 244-2990.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                         Kareem W. Shora, JD, LLM,\n     National Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            American Psychological\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 1, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: We are \n     writing on behalf of the American Psychological Association \n     (APA), the world's largest scientific and professional \n     organization of psychologists, to commend and support your \n     ongoing efforts related to the confirmation hearing and \n     follow-up correspondence to Attorney General nominee Michael \n     B. Mukasey. We highly value your commitment to ensure that \n     the next U.S. Attomey General is dedicated to safeguarding \n     the physical and psychological welfare and human rights of \n     individuals incarcerated by the U.S. government in foreign \n     detention centers. We are all too aware of reports of a 2002 \n     memorandum by then Assistant U.S. Attorney General Jay Bybee \n     that granted power to the President to issue orders in \n     violation of the Geneva Conventions and international laws \n     that prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading \n     treatment. (Fortunately, this memorandum has since been \n     disavowed by President Bush and overridden by his Executive \n     Order in July of this year.)\n       In a separate letter to President Bush, we urged him to \n     regard the ongoing Senate confirmation process involving his \n     Attorney General nominee as a timely opportunity to expand \n     his recent Executive Order to clarify that ``enhanced'' \n     interrogation techniques, such as forced nudity, \n     waterboarding, and mock executions, which are defined as \n     torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment by the \n     Geneva Conventions and the United Nations Convention Against \n     Torture, shall not be used or condoned by the U.S. \n     government. We also urged the government to disallow any \n     testimony resulting from the use of these techniques.\n       APA unequivocally condemns the use of torture and cruel \n     inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment under any and \n     all conditions, including the detention and interrogation of \n     both lawful and unlawful ``enemy combatants,'' as defined by \n     the U.S. Military Commissions Act of 2006 (see attached \n     August 2007 resolution). Accordingly, we also urge the \n     Congress and the Bush administration to establish policies \n     and procedures to ensure the judicial review of these \n     detentions, which in some instances have gone on for years \n     without any determination of their legality.\n       Psychologists consulting to the military and intelligence \n     communities, like their colleagues in domestic forensic \n     settings, use their expertise to promote the use of ethical, \n     effective, and rapport-building interrogations, while \n     safeguarding the welfare of interrogators and detainees. \n     It is always unethical for a psychologist to plan, design, \n     or assist, either directly or indirectly, in interrogation \n     techniques delineated in APA's 2007 resolution and any \n     other techniques defined as torture or cruel, inhuman, or \n     degrading treatment or punihment under the Geneva \n     Conventions, the United Nations Convention Against \n     Torture, and APA's 2006 Resolution Against Torture.\n       There are no exceptional circumstances whatsoever to these \n     prohibitions, whether induced by a state of war, threat of \n     war, or any other public emergency, or in the face of laws, \n     regulations, or orders. APA will support psychologists who \n     refuse to work in settings in which the human rights of \n     detainees are not protected. Moreover, psychologists with \n     knowledge of the use of any prohibited interrogation \n     technique have an ethical responsibility to inform their \n     superiors and the relevant office of inspectors general, as \n     appropriate, and to cooperate fully with all government \n     oversight activities to ensure that no individual is \n     subjected to this type of treatment.\n       We look forward to working with the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee to develop policies on interrogation that provide \n     for ethical and effective means to elicit information to \n     prevent acts of violence. Our own work in this area is \n     ongoing, and we plan to make available a casebook and \n     commentary (upon completion) to provide guidance on the \n     interpretation of our resolution.

It does not include pain or \n     suffering arising only from, inherent in, or incidental to \n     lawful sanctions [in accordance with both domestic and \n     international law];\n\n       Whereas in 2006, the American Psychological Association \n     defined the term ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \n     punishment'' to mean treatment or punishment by a \n     psychologist that, in accordance with the McCain Amendment, \n     is of a kind that would be ``prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth, \n     and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United \n     States, as defined in the United States Reservations, \n     Declarations and Understandings to the United Nations \n     Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, \n     Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment done at New \n     York, December 10, 1984.''

as \n     well as the following used for the purposes of eliciting \n     information in an interrogation process: hooding, forced \n     nakedness, stress positions, the use of dogs to threaten or \n     intimidate, physical assault including slapping or shaking, \n     exposure to extreme heat or cold, threats of harm or death; \n     and isolation, sensory deprivation and over-stimulation and/\n     or sleep deprivation used in a manner that represents \n     significant pain or suffering or in a manner that a \n     reasonable person would judge to cause lasting harm; or the \n     threatened use of any of the above techniques to the \n     individual or to menbers of the individual's family;\n       Be it resolved that the American Psychological Association \n     calls on the United States government--including Congress, \n     the Department of Defense, and the Central Intelligence \n     Agency--to prohibit the use of these methods in all \n     interrogations and that the American Psychological \n     Association shall inform relevant parties with the United \n     States government that psychologists are prohibited from \n     participating in such methods;\n       Be it resolved that the American Psychological Association, \n     in recognizing that torture and other cruel, inhuman or \n     degrading treatment and punishment can result not only from \n     the behavior of individuals, but also from the conditions of \n     confinement, expresses grave concern over settings in which \n     detainees are deprived of adequate protection of their human \n     rights, affirms the prerogative of psychologists to refuse to \n     work in such settings, and will explore ways to support \n     psychologists who refuse to work in such settings or who \n     refuse to obey orders that constitute torture;\n       Be it resolved that the American Psychological Association \n     asserts that any APA member with knowledge that a \n     psychologist, whether an APA member or non-member, has \n     engaged in torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment \n     or punishment, including the specific behaviors listed above, \n     has an ethical responsibility to abide by Ethical Standard \n     1.05, Reporting Ethical Violations, in the Ethical Principles \n     of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (2002) and directs the \n     Ethics Committee to take appropriate action based upon such \n     information, and encourages psychologists who are not APA \n     members also to adhere to Ethical Standard 1.05;\n       Be it resolved that the American Psychological Association \n     commends those psychologists who have taken clear and \n     unequivocal stands against torture and cruel, inhuman or \n     degrading treatment or punishment, especially in the line of \n     duty, and including stands against the specific behaviors (in \n     lines 81 through 100) or conditions listed above; and that \n     the American Psychological Association affirms the \n     prerogative of psychologists under the Ethical Principles of \n     Psychologists and Code of Conduct (2002) to disobey law, \n     regulations or orders when they conflict with ethics;\n       Be it resolved that the American Psychological Association \n     asserts that all psychologists with information relevant to \n     the use of any method of interrogation constituting torture \n     or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment have \n     an ethical responsibility to inform their superiors of such \n     knowledge, to inform the relevant office of inspectors \n     general when appropriate, and to cooperate fully with all \n     oversight activities, including hearings by the United States \n     Congress and all branches of the United States government, to \n     examine the perpetration of torture and cruel, inhuman, or \n     degrading treatment or punishment against individuals in \n     United States custody, for the purpose of ensuring that no \n     individual in the custody of the United States is subjected \n     to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \n     punishment;\n       Be it resolved that the APA Ethics Committee shall proceed \n     forthwith in writing a casebook and commentary that shall set \n     forth guidelines for psychologists that are consistent with \n     international human rights instruments, as well as guidelines \n     developed for health professionals, including but not limited \n     to: Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions;

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believed we were moving toward a very \nharmonious vote on Judge Mukasey's confirmation. I have been \ndisappointed that has not occurred.\n  Opponents have latched on to complaints about torture and a specific \nclassified procedure that Judge Mukasey has never seen or studied in \ndetail. Since he refused to express a legal opinion on that one \nspecific technique, they have asserted that he supports torture, and \nmany have decided to vote against him. I think that is unfair to the \njudge.\n  I will recall that Judge Mukasey was called to the attention of the \nPresident through Senator Schumer who has spoken highly of him and who \nvoted for him in the committee, as did Senator Feinstein, two \nDemocratic colleagues. Senator Schumer apparently has known him and his \nreputation in New York for some time. The President attempted to reach \nout and to pick a nominee who appeared to be above politics, apart from \npolitics, a person who had a history of competence and integrity.\n  Being a Federal judge is about as removed from the normal give and \ntake of politics and compromise and wheeling and dealing as you can \nget. And he served in that position for many years but also had \nexperience as an assistant U.S. attorney involved in leading a public \ncorruption section in New York which was pretty sizable and important \nand dealt with a lot of important cases.\n  He was on the Law Review at Yale and has all of the kind of academics \ncredentials and practical experience you would look for and is the kind \nof U.S. Attorney General I, and I think people of both parties can feel \ncomfortable with. I really do believe that.\n  I was hopeful we would see a nominee such as Larry Thompson, a \nlongtime friend of mine. He served as former Deputy Attorney General of \nthe United States, a former U.S. attorney; Ted Olson, who served as \nSolicitor General; or former Attorney General Bill Barr. These are a \nfew individuals who would be considered normal Republican appointees \nfor this position and whose views are well known to be in accord with \nthose of the President on most issues. But, instead, the President \nreached out and appointed someone who appeared to have strong \nbipartisan support.\n  I am sorry we have had some of these complaints because I think they \ndistort the record and what the judge actually said in his testimony \nand are inaccurate in a number of different ways.\n  The issue of torture has been discussed in great detail. But in many \nways it has not been handled with accuracy, and the issues have not \nbeen squarely addressed. They have been sort of sloughed over, and he \nhas been accused of things, and others, including the President and \nformer Attorney Generals and the military and other people have been \naccused of things in an inaccurate fashion.\n  I think I would like to make a few comments about how I see the legal \nsituation that we find ourselves in and how things have developed. \nPrior to the Supreme Court's ruling in 2006 in Hamdan, a legitimate \nposition, clearly, for the United States was that our personnel, when \nthey were dealing with unlawful combatants, were bound by the torture \nstatute, title 18, U.S. Code, Section 2340. That is the controlling \nstatutory authority. It defined torture. It was passed overwhelmingly \nby Congress in 1994.\n  It was passed by a vote of 92 to 8. Every current member of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee who was here in the Senate in 1994 voted for \nit. Senator Biden, Senator Feingold, Senator Feinstein, Senator \nGrassley, Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, Senator Kohl, Senator Leahy, \nand Senator Specter all voted for this act.\n  I asked Mr. Jack Goldsmith, former head of the Office of Legal \nCounsel in the Department of Justice under President Bush who resigned \nbecause he was not happy with some of the things that were being done, \nabout the legal landscape regarding torture prior to the Hamdan \ndecision--and he wrote a book about it.\n  I asked Mr. Goldsmith about the landscape prior to Hamdan--which \nfound that the Common Article III of the Geneva Convention applied to \nenemy unlawful combatants detained at Guantanamo Bay. But that decision \ndid not occur until the summer of 2006, so prior to that, pretty \nclearly, the authority that controlled the U.S. military in dealing \nwith unlawful combatants, which we, I think, had every right to \nconclude were not covered by the Geneva Conventions, was the torture \nstatute Congress passed in 1994. That is the statute that our military \nwas compelled to comply with.\n  And so the statute on torture is pretty clear. The people who drafted \nit wanted to make sure that whether in the United States or out of the \nUnited States that persons in our custody ought not to be tortured.\n  That certainly is an honorable and appropriate goal, and they did \nthat. They passed this statute in which they defined torture:\n\n       As used in this chapter (1) ``torture'' means an act \n     committed by a person acting under the color of law \n     specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental \n     pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to \n     lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or \n     physical control;\n       (2) ``severe mental pain or suffering'' means the prolonged \n     mental harm caused by or resulting from--\n       (A) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of \n     severe physical pain or suffering.\n\n  And it goes on.\n  Playing music or segregating a prisoner or giving one prisoner less \nfood or less quality food than you give another one, placing them in \nstressful conditions clearly does not qualify under this torture \nstatute as inflicting severe physical or mental pain.\n  Our military had lawyers. As Mr. Goldsmith, who was a critic, really, \nof this administration's behavior, said in his testimony and in his \nbook, they were awash with lawyers. They had lawyers all over the \nplace. Everything was read by lawyers. He said the CIA had 100 lawyers. \nI don't know how many in the Department of Defense and others he made \nreference to were there trying to figure out how to conduct \ninterrogations at a time when our\n\n[[Page S14163]]\n\ncountry had been attacked, 3,000 people had been killed, and we were \ntrying to figure out if there were other cells in our country and other \ngroups prepared to kill more Americans.\n  I remember when Senator John Ashcroft was nominated for Attorney \nGeneral, and they were jumping on him about all of this and what should \nbe done and what they had heard that somebody might have done. An \nexasperated then-Senator, Attorney General nominee Ashcroft responded \nto one question in frustration by saying: Well, the problem I have with \nyou, Senator, is, it is not my definition of torture that counts, it is \nthe one you enacted into law.\n  So that is what we enacted into law. If people are not happy with \nit--I think it is a legitimate statute, but if they are not happy with \nit, so be it. That is the one we passed into law. Our lawyers were \ntelling our intelligence people and others who were apprehending \nterrorists who were committed to destroying America that they had to \ncomply with this statute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator from Pennsylvania \nyield an additional minute to the Senator from Alabama?\n  Mr. SPECTER. What is the request pending?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. One additional minute.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Granted.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. There is another matter of some importance. A number of \nSenators have demanded that Judge Mukasey make express statements of \nlaw regarding the separation of powers, and they have asked him these \nquestions as a condition of his confirmation. Several Senators alluded \nto private conversations in which they say Judge Mukasey stated that a \nPresident cannot act outside the parameters set by the legislative \nbranch, I guess on most any matter. Particularly, I guess it dealt with \nFISA. I believe this contradicts the fundamental separation of powers \nset forth in the Constitution by our Founding Fathers. The oath the \nPresident takes is to faithfully execute the Office of the President \nand to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates. That is written in the Constitution.\n  While the original FISA statute was being debated in 1978, then \nCarter administration Attorney General Judge Griffin Bell testified:\n\n       The current bill recognizes no inherent power of the \n     President to conduct electronic surveillance, and I want to \n     interpolate here to say that this does not take away the \n     power of the President under the Constitution.\n\n  I associate myself with the remarks of Griffin Bell and recognize \nthat nothing we can do in this Congress can impede on the powers vested \nin the Executive by the Constitution. Congress cannot curtail the \nconstitutional powers of the Executive by statutory law.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much more time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. One additional minute.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Granted.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The purported conversations that Senators indicate they \nhave had apparently took place in private settings and not in a \nconfirmation hearing held by the Judiciary Committee where these \nstatements could be made a part of the record or cross-examined or \nwhere the words could be recorded with any accuracy. These types of \npromises, though touted as justification for a vote, perhaps, are not \nlegislative history and have not been made a part of the record of this \nnomination. They cannot be a part of a legislative history of any kind.\n  Furthermore, I would suggest that if Judge Mukasey did, in fact, say \nthat in a categorical manner, which I really doubt, he would be in \nerror. Any President has certain constitutional powers that cannot be \ntaken away by statute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 1 \nhour 26 minutes; the Senator from Vermont has 1 hour 36 minutes.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have the opportunity to serve on the \nJudiciary Committee, so I participated in the confirmation hearings on \nJudge Mukasey. I had a chance to personally meet with him. I had the \nchance to propound written questions and received written answers from \nhim. Throughout this process, all of us have been looking for a person \nto be the next Attorney General who would be an Attorney General for \nthe American people and not just the President of the United States.\n  I cannot accept Judge Mukasey's answer on waterboarding. As my \ncolleagues have said, waterboarding is an interrogation technique that \nsimulates death by drowning. The original question that was asked Judge \nMukasey on the second day of the confirmation hearings asked \nspecifically about waterboarding. He didn't really answer the question. \nI must tell you, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on that question. \nHe indicated that he may not have been familiar with what waterboarding \nis. I found that difficult to believe, but okay. He would have a chance \nto reflect upon it, be able to look at the historical information on \nwaterboarding, and we asked him a written question followup as to \nwhether he would comment on the interrogation technique of \nwaterboarding.\n  The question was asked. As waterboarding is generally known, it has \nbeen used for centuries. Judge Mukasey would not give us a direct \nanswer as to whether waterboarding was torture and prohibited under \nU.S. law. Then we find out that Judge Mukasey says: Look, if Congress \npasses a statute that specifically outlaws waterboarding, I would \nenforce that statute. That is not necessary because waterboarding is \nalready illegal. But that causes me some additional problems.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the various issues because to me it is \nmore than just waterboarding. We are talking about torture and the U.S. \nposition on torture and the U.S. leadership in advancing human rights \nas the leader of the free world. I believe that reputation has been \ndamaged.\n  The United States historically has provided clarity and leadership on \nadvancing human rights issues. There should be no doubt that \nwaterboarding is torture and waterboarding is illegal. My colleagues \nhave cited the torture statutes that have been passed by the Congress \nthat make it clear that this kind of conduct would fall under the \ngeneral definition of torture and is illegal in the United States.\n  It is internationally condemned under the Geneva Conventions article \n3. Our Constitution prohibits torture, and waterboarding would fall \nunder that. We prosecuted Japanese officials after World War II as war \ncriminals because they waterboarded American soldiers.\n  We recently passed the McCain amendment that said that cruel, \ninhumane, and degrading treatment or punishment of persons under the \ndetention, custody, or control of the United States would not be \npermitted. So there should be no doubt that waterboarding is torture \nand illegal.\n  Admiral Hutson, who testified before the committee on a panel of \noutside witnesses, told us a little bit more about the historical \naspects of waterboarding. He is a former Judge Advocate General, former \nsenior uniformed legal advisor to the Secretary of the Navy and the \nChief of Naval Operations. He stated that waterboarding ``is the most \niconic example of torture.'' It was devised during the Spanish \nInquisition, and its use has been repudiated for centuries. This is not \na new technique. It is well known. I don't believe we need to pass \nanother statute. It is clear already.\n  I have heard my colleagues say: All we have to do is pass a statute. \nDoes that mean we are going to have to pass a statute that outlaws all \ntypes of specific uses of torture such as mock execution or forced \nnudity or attack dogs or the use of rack or thumb screws? Are we going \nto have to outlaw those specific techniques because it is not clear \nunder our statute of torture that is illegal today? I hope not. I hope \nit is clear that these techniques are torture, as is waterboarding, and \nit is illegal.\n  Admiral Hutson put it best when he said the Attorney General, as our \nchief\n\n[[Page S14164]]\n\nlaw enforcement officer, has to be absolutely unequivocal as to what is \ntorture and what is not. On torture, I want the President of the United \nStates and the Attorney General to be very clear to the international \ncommunity that the United States will not tolerate torture being used \nby the United States, waterboarding being used by the United States or \nused against any American. We have to be clear about that.\n  I want our Government to use all resources at its disposal if a \nforeign agent attempts to torture an American, including waterboarding \nof an American. It has been said, but can you imagine the resolution \nthat would be brought before this body if an American soldier was \nwaterboarded by a foreign enemy, what we would be doing here, each one \nof us?\n  I have my concern because I want our country to be clear on this \nissue. I have the President of the United States, in a signing \nstatement on the McCain amendment, saying: Well, maybe torture doesn't \napply to me. Now I have an Attorney General nominee who tells us that \nhe can't tell us with precision that waterboarding is illegal?\n  We do have international responsibilities. We are the leader of the \nfree world. I am proud to represent this body in the Helsinki \nCommission as the chair, to speak up internationally on human rights \nissues. I find myself defending America. I am having a hard time on \nthis issue as to where we stand on the issue of torture.\n  Judge Mukasey is not responsible--let me make it clear because some \nof my colleagues have intimated this--for the Bush administration's \npolicies on torture or on techniques to interrogate. He is not \nresponsible. He had nothing to do with it. But I do believe we need to \nmake sure he will stand up to the Bush administration to challenge \nthese tactics if they, in fact, are illegal. Judge Mukasey is a good \nperson. He is an honorable man. But on the critical issue of whether he \nwill stand up to the President and give independent advice as to what \nis torture and what is not, I have my doubts.\n  I will be voting against his confirmation.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have about 3 hours remaining of time, \nand I note Senators on the floor speaking in opposition to Judge \nMukasey. So I would ask my colleagues who want to speak in favor to \ncome to the floor so we can make some evaluation as to how much time we \nneed, and perhaps some can be yielded back. We are not required to vote \non Friday morning necessarily.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the nomination of \nJudge Michael Mukasey to be our next Attorney General. I thank Chairman \nLeahy and his committee, including Senator Specter and members I see \nhere, Senator Kennedy, for working hard to examine the nominee's record \nand, frankly, for asking the tough questions, which I think gave us a \nreal look into the mind and the heart of this man.\n  I have respect for Judge Mukasey's background, his dedication to \npublic service, his reputation as a distinguished jurist, and as a good \nman. But when evaluating our Nation's chief law enforcement official, \nwe must weigh far more than background and likability. Particularly \nnow--particularly now--when we are following the disastrous tenure of \nAlberto Gonzales, particularly now, when we have lost so much more \nleadership in the world because of what is happening in Iraq, and, \nunfortunately, what has happened in Abu Ghraib, we need to look past \nlikability and qualifications.\n  We must firmly believe our next Attorney General must always put his \nloyalty to the Constitution above his loyalty to the President. We have \na President and a Vice President who have dangerously abused their \nExecutive power and who have undermined the public trust. This is not a \npartisan opinion.\n  Listen to what John Dean, White House Counsel to President Richard \nNixon, wrote:\n\n       Not since Nixon left the White House have we had such greed \n     over presidential power, and never before have we had such \n     political paranoia. . . . History never exactly repeats \n     itself, but it does some rather good imitations.\n\n  When an administration spies on its own citizens without a warrant, \nstrips habeas corpus rights from those held by America, and fires its \nown U.S. attorneys for political reasons, that is a shocking abuse of \nExecutive power.\n  When an administration thinks it can just ignore an entire coequal \nbranch of Government, even using signing statements to reinterpret or \ndisregard more than 750 laws that Congress has passed, that is a \nshocking abuse of Executive power.\n  When an administration silences its own officials, rewriting \ntestimony, redacting testimony, shelving reports, refusing to let \nexperts publicly speak the truth, that is a shocking abuse of Executive \npower.\n  I have seen this so many times with this administration. The latest \ntime was with global warming experts whose truths the White House find \n``inconvenient.'' And what did they do? They redacted testimony of the \nCDC Director, the Center for Disease Control Director, when we asked \nher to come before the Environment Committee of the Senate and tell us \nwhat would the health effects of unfettered global warming be. What \nwould happen? The White House muzzled her by slashing her testimony. \nThey gave all kinds of excuses as to why it was done. None of them were \nreal.\n  Then, when I wrote to the President, and I said: Mr. President, we \nneed to hear what Dr. Gerberding has to say about the impacts of global \nwarming on the health of our people; Mr. Fielding, White House Counsel, \nwrote back: Oh, gee, we are not going to send you her original \ntestimony you have asked for. Oh, no, that would be an abuse of \nexecutive privilege. Let me restate that: That would be an abuse of the \nseparation of powers. And he asserted executive privilege. Imagine \nasserting executive privilege for something like the health effects of \nglobal warming. It is unbelievable.\n  So now we need an Attorney General who is going to be the people's \nlawyer, not the President's lawyer, not the one who is going to tell \nus: Oh, yeah, we just cannot do anything about it, Congress.\n  We need an Attorney General who is going to check this unprecedented \nabuse of power, not rubberstamp it.\n  Unfortunately, because of the deep and thorough questioning of the \nJudiciary Committee, and my reading of that, I cannot support Judge \nMukasey.\n  Judge Mukasey ruled that President Bush had the authority to detain \nAmerican citizens as enemy combatants without criminal charges or \nhabeas corpus rights; likewise, during his confirmation hearing, Judge \nMukasey failed to demonstrate that he would independently evaluate this \nPresident's broad assertion of executive privilege.\n  When asked if he would permit the U.S. attorney to execute \ncongressional contempt citations when the White House refuses to \nprovide documents to Congress, Judge Mukasey did not say yes. He should \nhave said yes.\n  The statute is clear. The statute is clear that when Congress issues \na contempt citation, the U.S. attorney is required to bring the matter \nto a grand jury.\n  What Judge Mukasey said was, he would have to look at it. He would \nhave to see if it really was reasonable. The fact is, that is not what \nthe statute says. There is no ``reasonable'' test. When the Congress \nissues a contempt citation, the U.S. attorney is required to bring the \nmatter to a grand jury. If the President says ``executive privilege,'' \nit does not matter. But the judge said he would look at it and see if \nthe President was being reasonable.\n\n  So we have to send a clear and unequivocal message to the Justice \nDepartment staff. We have to send a clear message to the American \npeople and to the world that the United States honors and respects and \nwill never turn away from our Constitution.\n  It is so amazing to me. We have a crisis in Pakistan where a \ndictator--unfortunately, is what I am saying General Musharraf is \nbehaving like--has suspended the Constitution--and everyone here, all \nof us, feel terrible about this, including the President of the United \nStates, who, as I understand it,\n\n[[Page S14165]]\n\ntalked to him on the phone and told him to restore the Constitution--\nand here we cannot get papers from this White House.\n  I am not comparing that in any way, shape, or form to the kind of \nsuspension of the Constitution we see abroad. But I am saying in this \ncountry--in this country--everyone assumes the Constitution will be \nfollowed. That is why we need an Attorney General now, in 2007, who is \ngoing to be so strong on the point.\n  Yes, he should have said if Congress issues a contempt citation, of \ncourse, we will do what we have to do under the law. So it is not \nenough to hope the nominee will exercise independent judgment and stand \nup to this President and Vice President. We must know from the record \nbefore us that this nominee will uphold the Constitution and our laws \nand do it clearly and unequivocally.\n  Now, that is a high standard. I admit that. But that is what the \npeople of this great Nation deserve, nothing less. Unfortunately, Judge \nMukasey's response to questions about torture do not meet the standard.\n  During his confirmation hearing, the nominee was asked whether \nwaterboarding is illegal. Now, I know a lot of people have discussed \nthis, and perhaps we are all being repetitious. But I think we need to \nsay how we feel.\n  This is a moment for this Senate. This has been a long day for all of \nus. I know for me it has been a big day. I helped to lead, along with \nSenator Inhofe, an override of a very important bill. I had a hearing \non global warming. I had a briefing on global warming. I have been at \nit, just as we all have.\n  But I came out to the floor because I think this is an important \nmoment where Members have to be heard. We must know from the record \nbefore us that the nominee will uphold the Constitution and our laws. \nAnd, yes, it is a high standard that the people deserve.\n  So when the nominee was asked whether waterboarding is illegal, he \nresponded if waterboarding is torture, then, in fact, it is \nunconstitutional. So I have to ask this rhetorical question: If \nwaterboarding is torture? If? We are talking about a brutal \ninterrogation technique that simulates drowning.\n  Not surprisingly, members of the Judiciary Committee were not \nsatisfied with this answer. And I praise them. They probed, they \nquestioned, they asked again: Is waterboarding illegal?\n  This time, the judge responded with a four-page letter that, once \nagain, failed to answer. He called the question ``hypothetical.'' He \nsaid his legal opinion would depend on ``the actual facts and \ncircumstances.'' Depend on ``the actual facts and circumstances'' if \nwaterboarding is torture? Is this the message we want to send to the \nworld, that our evaluation of a brutal tactic depends on ``facts and \ncircumstances''?\n  In fact, Judge Mukasey's answer was a bit too similar to a statement \nby Alberto Gonzales that the legality of torture techniques ``would \ndepend on circumstances.''\n  This is not a clear answer. This is not unequivocal. And it is not \nwhat we need in an Attorney General now, in 2007, when the world is \nturning away from America as a moral leader.\n  Teddy Roosevelt did not have to consider the ``facts and \ncircumstances'' in 1902 when he court-martialed and removed an American \ngeneral in the Philippines for allowing his troops to engage in \nwaterboarding. That was 1902, the last century, the turn of the last \ncentury, and we have someone equivocating on this point? President \nRoosevelt said then nothing can justify the use of torture or inhuman \nconduct by our military.\n  Senators McCain, Warner, and Graham did not have to consider ``the \nfacts and circumstances'' when they wrote to Judge Mukasey:\n\n       Waterboarding, under any circumstances, represents a clear \n     violation of U.S. law.\n\n  Waterboarding today is not a hypothetical. It is used in Burma \nagainst supporters of democracy. Waterboarding is an unconstitutional \nform of cruel and inhumane treatment. It is illegal under U.S. laws--\nfrom the Torture Act, which prohibits acts ``specifically intended to \ninflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering,'' to the Detainee \nTreatment Act, which prohibits ``cruel, inhuman or degrading \ntreatment.''\n  It is illegal under international laws, such as the Geneva \nConventions, which are not quaint. Those conventions prohibit cruel, \nhumiliating, and degrading treatment.\n\n  Following World War II, the United States convicted several Japanese \nsoldiers for waterboarding American and allied POWs. Let me repeat: \nFollowing World War II, the United States convicted several Japanese \nsoldiers for waterboarding American and allied POWs. What kind of \nstatement are we hearing from Judge Mukasey? Our law and our history \nare crystal clear, so why can't Judge Mukasey state in unequivocal \nterms that waterboarding is torture and that is illegal?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute and I \nwill sum up.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, our country is at a critical point in our \nhistory. This President and Vice President have shown reckless \ndisregard for the rule of law and the institutions sworn to uphold it.\n  Now, more than ever before, we need an Attorney General who can \nexercise independent judgment and who will exercise independent \njudgment. We need an Attorney General who shows every day, by word and \nby deed, that the United States is still the world's standard bearer \nfor the rule of law. We need an Attorney General who will truly turn \nthe page and write a new chapter for the Justice Department and for our \ncountry.\n  It is very rare that I vote no on these kinds of nominations. I do it \nnow and then. But I have to say, regretfully, tonight I have concluded \nJudge Mukasey does not meet the critical standard and at this time I \nfeel very strongly that he should not be confirmed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Department of Justice is in a state \nof crisis. Under Attorney General Gonzales, it too often served as a \nrubberstamp for the White House and as a pawn for political gain, \nrather than as the Nation's guardian of the rule of law. It ignored the \nlaw and authorized torture and warrantless surveillance. It let \npolitics drive decisions about who should be prosecuted. It fired U.S. \nattorneys who would not go along. It hired and punished career \nattorneys on the basis of their personal politics, and it abandoned \nenforcement of our civil rights laws.\n  After such an unacceptable period of tarnished leadership of the \nDepartment, we need a clear, decisive, and straightforward Attorney \nGeneral who is not afraid to stand up for the Constitution and the rule \nof law--especially when that means disagreeing with the President of \nthe United States.\n  I had hoped Judge Mukasey would be that person. He is, clearly, an \nable lawyer, and his commitment to public service as an assistant U.S. \nattorney and Federal judge is admirable. As a Federal judge for almost \n19 years, he was, by all accounts, fair and conscientious in the \ncourtroom. But after listening to Judge Mukasey's testimony and \nconsidering his responses to written questions from the members of the \nJudiciary Committee, I have concluded he is not the right person to \nlead the Justice Department at this crucial period of our history.\n  The next Attorney General must restore confidence in the rule of law. \nHe must show the American people and the world America has returned to \nits fundamental belief in the rule of law as the bedrock protector of \nour national values. Only an Attorney General who is not afraid to \nspeak truth to power can be such a leader. Regrettably, Michael Mukasey \nhas shown he is not that leader.\n  Similar to many of my colleagues and many American citizens, I am \ndeeply troubled by Judge Mukasey's evasive answers about torture. He \nhas repeatedly refused to acknowledge that waterboarding--the \ncontrolled drowning of a prisoner--is torture. Instead, he has said \nonly that torture is unconstitutional without being willing to say \nwhether waterboarding is torture.\n  As the record makes clear, courts and tribunals have consistently \nfound waterboarding to be an unacceptable act of torture. As Malcolm \nNance, a former master instructor and chief of training at the U.S. \nNavy Survival,\n\n[[Page S14166]]\n\nEvasion, Resistance and Escape School, said of waterboarding:\n\n       For the uninitiated, it is horrifying to watch and if it \n     goes wrong, it can lead straight to terminal hypoxia. When \n     done right it is controlled death.\n\n  During the questions for Judge Mukasey in the Judiciary Committee, he \nwas asked these questions:\n\n       Is the use of a wet towel and dripping water to induce the \n     misperception of drowning (i.e, waterboarding) legal?\n\n  Listen to what the Judge Advocates said:\n  ``No,'' said RADM Bruce McDonald, U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General.\n  ``No,'' said BG Kevin Sandkuhler, U.S. Marines, Judge Advocate \nGeneral.\n  ``No. An interrogation technique that is specifically intended to \ncause severe mental suffering involving a threat of imminent death by \nasphyxiation is torture,'' said MG Jack Rives, U.S. Air Force Judge \nAdvocate General.\n\n  ``Inducing the misperception of drowning as an interrogation \ntechnique is not legal,'' said MG Scott Black, U.S. Army Judge Advocate \nGeneral.\n  Waterboarding is an ancient and barbaric technique. In the fifteenth \nand sixteenth centuries, interrogators of the Spanish inquisition used \nit. It was used against slaves in this country. In World War II, it was \nused against our soldiers by Japan. In the 1970s, it was used against \npolitical opponents of the Khmer Rouge and the military dictatorships \nof Chile and Argentina. As I speak, it is being used against \nprodemocracy activists by the military dictators of Burma. This is the \ncompany the Bush administration embraces when it refuses to renounce \nwaterboarding.\n  But Judge Mukasey is unwilling to say waterboarding violates the law. \nHe calls it repugnant, and it obviously is. But he refuses to condemn \nit as unlawful. Why? The answer seems painfully obvious. Former \nintelligence officers and supervisors have admitted--and the Vice \nPresident has confirmed--that the CIA has waterboarded detainees. Had \nJudge Mukasey renounced waterboarding as unlawful, he would have had to \nassert his independence and speak the truth about this administration's \nlawlessness. He was unwilling to do so.\n  We were told Judge Mukasey had agreed to enforce a new law \nprohibiting waterboarding if Congress passed it. There are two problems \nwith this statement. First, enforcing laws passed by Congress that are \nconstitutional is the job of the Attorney General. It is a prerequisite \nto occupying the office, not a concession to be offered to win \nconfirmation.\n  But, second, waterboarding is already illegal. It is illegal under \nthe Geneva Conventions, which prohibit ``outrages upon personal \ndignity,'' including cruel, humiliating, and degrading treatment. It is \nillegal under the Torture Act, which prohibits acts ``specifically \nintended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.'' It \nis illegal under the Detainee Treatment Act, which prohibits ``cruel, \ninhumane, or degrading treatment,'' and it violates the Constitution. \nThe Nation's top military lawyers and legal experts across the \npolitical spectrum have condemned waterboarding as illegal. After World \nWar II, the United States prosecuted Japanese officers for using \nwaterboarding. What more does this nominee need to enforce existing \nlaws?\n  The Attorney General must have the legal and moral judgment to know \nwhen an activity rises to the level of a violation of our Constitution, \ntreaties or statutes. But this nominee wants to pass the buck to \nCongress. He has failed to demonstrate that he will be the clear, \ndecisive, and straightforward leader the Department of Justice so \ndesperately needs.\n  This administration has recklessly brushed aside the rule of law for \n7 years. We need an Attorney General who will stand up to this \ndestructive conduct and say: No more. We cannot afford to take our \nchances on the judgment of an Attorney General who either does not know \ntorture when he sees it or is willing to look the other way to suit the \nPresident.\n  I urge the Senate to vote no on this nomination.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before yielding 15 minutes to the Senator \nfrom New York, I would like to note to my colleagues we have Senator \nGraham listed with a request for a short period of time, and the only \nrequest pending for those in support of Judge Mukasey, so unless other \nSenators come to the floor, at least on our side, we may be nearing the \nend of debate. I think it is appropriate to put all Senators on notice \nthat we could be voting perhaps shortly after 10 or the 10:30 range.\n  I yield 15 minutes, as I said, to Senator Schumer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I wish to thank \nSenator Specter for yielding time and I wish to thank all my colleagues \nfor this debate.\n  I intend to vote to confirm Michael B. Mukasey to be the 81st \nAttorney General of the United States. I do so for one overarching \nreason: the Department of Justice, one of the crown jewels among our \nGovernment institutions--once the crown jewel--is now adrift and \nrudderless. It desperately needs a strong and independent leader at the \nhelm to set it back on course. A number of people's lives who are \naffected day to day in quiet but material ways by what this Justice \nDepartment does are at risk. We don't hear from them. Their issues, \nwhether it is the ability to vote or the right to be safe or the \nability to be protected from economic crime, we don't hear about that. \nBut it matters.\n  Under previous leadership--or lack thereof--the Justice Department \nhas become adrift. The Justice Department has become rudderless. The \nJustice Department has become politicized. The Justice Department has \nbecome an agency where morale is as low as it has ever been. So we \ndesperately need a strong and independent leader at its helm to set it \nback on course, and that is not a trivial statement or a statement to \nbe forgotten or passed over. I believe Judge Mukasey is that person.\n  As almost everyone in America knows, the Justice Department has been \nrun into the ground by the Bush administration, especially under \nAlberto Gonzales. As I said when I introduced Judge Mukasey, he will be \ninheriting an agency experiencing its greatest crisis since Watergate \nand, if confirmed, his tasks will be no less momentous and no less \ndifficult than that facing Edward Levi when he took the reins of John \nMitchell's Justice Department after Watergate. A department in such \ncrisis should not be left to an unconfirmed and unaccountable \ncaretaker.\n  We need to look no further than our own investigation in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to see that we need a real leader at the top of the \nJustice Department. What we learned in that investigation over the last \n9 months leads inexorably to the conclusion we cannot afford a \ncaretaker Attorney General for the next 14 months.\n  Let me review--because they seem almost forgotten in this Chamber \ntonight--some of the most disturbing revelations. We learned that \noutstanding U.S. attorneys were dismissed without cause or, worse, \nbecause they may have been too tough on Republicans or too soft on \nDemocrats. We learned that career Civil Rights Division lawyers have \nbeen driven out in droves; that when these lawyers said that civil \nrights were being violated or the Voting Rights Act was being violated, \nthey were overruled by political decisions made from the top.\n  In my judgment, there was no way that any fair Justice Department \nwould have allowed the voter ID process that is now in place in Georgia \nand take back the ability to vote that was fought for so long and hard.\n  We learned that individuals appear to have been prosecuted for \npolitical reasons. In the other House, the Judiciary Committee did an \nextensive investigation, and in the process of doing one, it appears \nmore and more likely that a Democratic Governor in Alabama is sitting \nin jail because of a political prosecution. How can we have that in \nAmerica? How can we allow that? How can we countenance it?\n  We learned that White House liaison Monica Goodling unlawfully \nrejected young lawyers for career jobs because they were not \nconservative ideologues.\n  We learned that there were improper political litmus tests in hiring \ndecisions in the Civil Rights Division, in the prestigious Honors \nProgram, and even in the Summer Law Intern Program. So politics \npermeated the Justice Department--the Department,\n\n[[Page S14167]]\n\nabove all, that should be immune from politics and had been until this \nadministration.\n  We learned that Bradley Schlozman, in violation of the Department's \nown policy, brought indictments on the eve of an election in Missouri, \nseemingly to influence the result. We learned that politics seems to \nhave trumped professionalism in decisionmaking about voting rights \ncases, tobacco litigation, and other matters. The list goes on and on.\n  Justice is sacred in this country. It is the Justice Department that \nmust produce justice.\n  In sum, we learned that politics has been allowed to infect all \nmanner of decisionmaking at the Department of Justice.\n  Now we are on the brink of a reversal. There is virtually universal \nagreement, even from those who oppose Judge Mukasey, that he would do a \ngood job in turning the Department around in these areas.\n  One of my colleagues who is voting against the nominee nonetheless \nlauded Judge Mukasey as ``a brilliant lawyer, a distinguished jurist \nand, by all accounts, a good man.''\n  Another colleague on the Judiciary Committee, who is also voting nay, \nhad this to say:\n\n       Over the remaining 15 months of the Bush Presidency, the \n     Department must recover its credibility and its reputation. . \n     . . Judge Mukasey appears to have the intelligence, the \n     experience, and the stature to undertake this very important \n     task.\n\n  Such comments of confidence echo the comments of those who have \nappeared before the judge in court. As a jurist, Judge Mukasey has a \nwell-deserved reputation for efficiency, fairness, and integrity. \nIndeed, even those who didn't always receive the benefit of a favorable \nruling from the judge have been quick to describe the judge's basic \nfairness and decency.\n  Upon his retirement from the bench, one of Jose Padilla's lawyers \nsaid, ``I admire him greatly'' and described herself as ``another \nweeping fan.'' That is a lawyer for Mr. Padilla.\n  Another Padilla lawyer has said, ``I don't always agree with where he \ncomes out, but I am happy, always happy to draw him as a judge. You are \ngoing to get your day in court.'' He went on to say that ``his sense of \nfairness and due process--it's more than intellectual. It's really down \nto the genetic level. It's in his DNA.''\n  There are many such testimonials for Judge Mukasey. Because he is so \ndead wrong on torture, which I think he is, does not take away all of \nthese other things. And if we are to reject him, make no mistake about \nit, we will not have somebody in his place who can live up to that \nstandard. Should we reject Judge Mukasey, President Bush has already \nsaid he would install an acting caretaker Attorney General who could \nserve for the rest of his term without the advice and consent of the \nSenate. It would be another Alberto Gonzales or maybe even worse. It \nwould be the Cheney-Addington wing running the Justice Department on \nthe issues of security. Judge Mukasey is hardly perfect. He would not \nbe the person I would have nominated, but he is clearly head and \nshoulders better than what we would get. That is not something to be \ndismissed. That is not something to be forgotten. It is hardly \nmentioned on this floor.\n  The main function of the Justice Department would be taken back and \nrailroaded far from where it should be, and it would be gone for \nanother long 14 months. It would mean accepting and exacerbating the \ndeclining morale at the highest levels of the Department. It would mean \ndelaying vital reforms relating to depoliticizing prosecutions. It \nwould mean tolerating continued vacancies in many of the top positions \nat the Justice Department. Perhaps most important, it would mean \nsurrendering the Department to the extreme ideology of Vice President \nCheney and his Chief of Staff, David Addington. All the work we have \ndone--the hearings, the letters, the requests to get the Attorney \nGeneral to resign--would be undone in a quick moment. That is serious, \ncolleagues.\n  I have complete respect for people who disagree. It is a values \nchoice. But let's not forget that a caretaker Attorney General will not \nbe close to Judge Mukasey on the issues that brought the downfall of \nAttorney General Gonzales. Let us also not forget that Judge Mukasey \nhas had a long and distinguished career. Because his views on torture \nare different from so many of ours, including my own, does not \nevaporate all of these other important considerations.\n  Let me be clear on the torture question, which understandably \nmotivates so many of my colleagues. I deeply oppose this \nadministration's opaque, mysterious, and inexplicable policy on the use \nof torture. This is not a policy that was constructed by Judge Mukasey.\n  In particular, I believe that the cruel and inhumane technique of \nwaterboarding is not only repugnant but also illegal under current laws \nand conventions, period. I also support Congress's efforts to pass \nadditional measures that would explicitly ban this and other forms of \ntorture. I voted for Senator Kennedy's antitorture amendment in 2006, \nand I am a cosponsor of a similar bill in this Congress. If it was \nimportant to do it in 2006, it is also important to do it in 2007.\n  When Judge Mukasey came before the Senate Judiciary Committee last \nmonth, he refused to state that waterboarding was illegal. That was \nunsatisfactory, that was wrong, and that will be a blemish on his \ndistinguished career for as long as he lives. But he has personally \nmade it clear that if Congress passed further legislation in this area, \nthe President would have no legal authority to ignore it--not even \nunder some theory of inherent authority granted by article II of the \nConstitution. That is a very important point.\n\n  My colleagues say we will never pass an amendment on torture and \nwaterboarding. That may be; it may not. But the fact that Judge Mukasey \nhas rejected the overreaching theory of the unitary executive certainly \nin this area, and in others, says something about what kind of Attorney \nGeneral he will be on torture, on wiretapping, and on all of the other \nissues where basically this Department and this administration thought \nCongress should have no say at all.\n  Furthermore, maybe it will be the courts that will rule torture is \nillegal. Judge Mukasey will abide by those court decisions that make \nwaterboarding illegal. Judge Mukasey will allow those court decisions \nto stand. I don't think we doubt that.\n  The expansive article II argument, of course, is one that this \nadministration--in the form of President Cheney and David Addington--\nhas explicitly endorsed. In an infamous torture memo, the following \npassage was reportedly insisted upon by David Addington:\n\n       Prohibitions on torture must be construed as inapplicable \n     to interrogations undertaken pursuant to his commander-in-\n     chief authority. . . . Congress may no more regulate the \n     President's ability to detain and interrogate enemy \n     combatants than it may regulate his ability to direct troop \n     movements on the battlefield.\n\n  That is a horrible statement. Unlike either of his predecessors, \nJudge Mukasey specifically rejects this view.\n  I asked him:\n\n       If Congress were to legislate against certain forms of \n     coercive interrogation, such as waterboarding, in all \n     circumstances, not just relating to those in the Department \n     of Defense custody, would it be acting within its \n     constitutional authority?\n\n  He answered ``yes.'' No qualifier. And contrary to the views of the \nVice President and his Chief of Staff, he specifically stated that the \nPresident would not have legal authority to ignore it, even under his \ninherent authority under article II. For a Bush nominee, this is no \nsmall commitment. It is a dramatic difference from both Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft and Attorney General Gonzales. It is a quantum leap \nover the views of Alberto Gonzales and signals that we may yet get an \nindependent review--and perhaps reversal--of some of the worst of the \nadministration's legal policies.\n  I also believe this because I asked him what he thought of a book \nwritten by Jack Goldsmith called ``The Terror Presidency.'' Mr. \nGoldsmith, as many will recall, was the former head of the Office of \nLegal Policy, the principal person who sounded the alarm over badly \nreasoned and overreaching legal opinions within the Government. He was \nthe courageous official who started the process that led to the \ninfamous showdown in the hospital room of John Ashcroft over the \nPresident's warrantless wiretapping program.\n  In his book, Mr. Goldsmith is a relentless critic of the unilateral \nmy-\n\n[[Page S14168]]\n\nway-or-the-highway approach of Vice President Cheney and David \nAddington. When I asked Judge Mukasey what he thought of the book, he \nsaid he thought it was superb, and he endorsed many of its arguments. \nHe also told me privately that the administration's unilateral approach \nto legal policy was likely responsible for its low approval ratings in \nthe polls. So we have a nominee who is head and shoulders above his \npredecessors in a number of ways, including in his commitment to work \nwith Congress.\n  One more thing on the issue of torture, my colleagues. Let's assume \nCongress cannot pass a law, and let's assume even that the courts do \nnot rule the way we think they should. Still, Judge Mukasey will be \nhead and shoulders different, very possibly, than a caretaker. Mukasey \nwould be more likely than a caretaker to find on his own that \nwaterboarding and other coercive techniques are illegal. He didn't say \nthey are illegal. A caretaker would. He said he would have to study \nthem. He should not have to. There is still a chance that somebody \nregarded as thoughtful and independent, and a lawyer above all, may--\nand I cannot say he will, and I wish I could--find on his own that \nwaterboarding and other coercive techniques are illegal. Certainly, \nthere is more of a chance with Judge Mukasey than with a caretaker. So \neven if you are voting on the issue of torture alone--which I am not--\nto vote down Judge Mukasey and install an independent caretaker will \nnot solve the problem of torture and, in all likelihood, will leave us \nworse off, not better.\n  Judge Mukasey's answers to our questions demonstrated more openness \nto ending the practices we abhor than either of those who were the \nprevious Attorney General nominees.\n  In many respects, Judge Mukasey reminds me of Jim Comey, a former \nDeputy Attorney General in the Bush administration who has been widely \npraised for his independence. Would we turn down Jim Comey knowing his \ncourage? No. Today, would we turn down Goldsmith? No. Both of them have \nvery conservative views.\n\n  Might I have an additional 5 minutes to finish my remarks, I ask my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, again, if the issue is torture alone, we \nclearly will be as bad off as we are today with a caretaker. We may--\nnot will, maybe not even likely--have a chance, a decent chance of \nbeing better with Mukasey than with the alternative. And as with Comey \nand Goldsmith, no, Mukasey will not have our views particularly on \nissues of security. No one this President nominates will. That is why \nwe are working so hard to get a new President with different views. But \non issues of the rule of law and independence and integrity, Judge \nMukasey will clearly be much better than others.\n  I wish to say this to my colleagues, a vast majority of my colleagues \nwho oppose this nomination: I respect their views. I understand the \nanger and the anguish about what this administration has done to that \nbeautiful lady who stands in the harbor of the city in which I live. I \nshare that anguish. I share it. Unfortunately, we are in a world where \nthis administration will continue for another 14 months.\n  Let me ask my colleagues to think about this: Let's say we reject \nJudge Mukasey tonight and the caretaker is installed, and 6 months from \nnow the exact same policies we abhor continue. Will this have been a \ngreat victory?\n  I understand the importance of standing up to the President. Few \nwould accuse me of not doing that. And I understand the importance of \nsymbolic victory. But this is a tough choice because there is a lot at \nstake on the other side. There is at stake the integrity of a \ndepartment which is in shambles, which is politicized, and which has \nroutinely rejected the rule of law which is the fundamental wellspring \nof this Nation and this democracy. And we have a chance, at least a \ngood part of the way, to restore it. The Department of Justice is the \nfront-line agency safeguarding our civil rights, fighting public \ncorruption, curbing violent crime, enforcing environmental laws, and \nmuch more.\n  I deplore the administration's opaque policy on torture, as I \nmentioned before, but I also care about attempts to affect elections \nthrough suspiciously timed criminal prosecutions. I care about criminal \ncases brought for political reasons. I care about allegations that our \nleading law enforcement agency is stocked with inexperienced cronies \nrather than experienced professionals. I care about a downward spiral \nin civil rights cases brought in recent years. I care about a loss of \nmorale among a 100,000-person strong institution and every week, at one \nairport or another in this country, how insistent U.S. attorneys came \nto me and said: Do something. Judge Mukasey, in all likelihood, will do \nsomething. A caretaker will not. I don't want to turn those pleas \naside, even though I have strong disagreement with Mr. Mukasey on many \nsubstantive issues, torture among them. I care about a continuing \nuptick in violent crime due to a department's failure to keep its eye \non the ball and not have the most qualified people in important \npositions. I care about the Department, and I care about justice. And \nit is not a small matter to take someone who is measurably better than \nwhat his replacement would be and reject it.\n  Again, this is value choice. There are good arguments on each side. \nPeople's values will have them come down on different sides. But anyone \nwho thinks this is an easy choice, anyone who thinks that should Judge \nMukasey be rejected things will improve from the desperate, deplorable \nstate in which they are now is wrong.\n  No one questions that Judge Mukasey would do much to turn around the \nJustice Department and move to remove the stench of politics from this \nvital institution. I believe we should give him that chance. There is \ntoo much at stake not to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nnomination of Michael Mukasey to be the next United States Attorney \nGeneral.\n  First, let me say that by all accounts Judge Mukasey is a good man \nwith a long distinguished record. In his testimony before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, he made clear that he understands the need to \nrestore the public's trust and confidence in the Department of Justice. \nI also believe he demonstrated a willingness to take the necessary \nsteps to de-politicize the Department, and to provide the leadership \nrequired to repair its credibility.\n  However, I am also deeply troubled by the positions Judge Mukasey has \ntaken regarding several important issues. Much has been said about \nJudge Mukasey's unwillingness to clearly state that certain \ninterrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, are unlawful and \namount to torture. I share this concern, but I would also like to \nhighlight another area that I find particularly disturbing; that is the \nidea that the President doesn't have to comply with a constitutional \nlaw passed by Congress.\n  Over the last 6 years, the Bush administration has put forth a view \nof Executive power that is incredibly expansive, and in my opinion, an \nunjustified and dangerous threat to our fundamental rights and our \ncommitment to the rule of law.\n  The President has asserted the right to unilaterally imprison \nwhomever he wants without judicial review, whether or not they are a \nUnited States citizen, if he determines that they are a so-called \n``enemy combatant.'' The administration has taken the position that the \nPresident can authorize the use of techniques that amount to torture, \nand then immunize any person acting pursuant to his orders from \ncriminal liability. The President also authorized warrantless \nsurveillance in direct contravention to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act.\n  In all of these instances, the President justified his actions on the \nbasis that he was acting within his authority as commander-in-chief to \ndefend the country, and that neither Congress nor the courts can \ninfringe on this power. While many of these assertions have ultimately \nbeen rejected by Federal courts, Congress, or overturned internally \nwhen they became public, the President continues to assert that there \nare few restraints on his power when it comes to national security \nmatters.\n  During his confirmation hearing, Judge Mukasey stated that he would \nstep down if he determined that the\n\n[[Page S14169]]\n\nPresident's actions were unlawful and the President refused to heed his \nadvice to change course. Although this does signal a welcomed degree of \nindependence, I remain concerned about what Judge Mukasey will find to \nbe ``lawful.''\n  Let me read an exchange that took place during a hearing in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee which illustrates this point.\n\n       Senator Leahy: . . . where Congress has clearly legislated \n     in an area, as we've done in the area of surveillance with \n     the FISA law, something we've amended repeatedly at the \n     request of various administrations . . . if it's been \n     legislated and stated very clearly what must be done, if you \n     operate outside of that, whether it's with a presidential \n     authorization or anything else, wouldn't that be illegal?\n       Judge Mukasey: That would have to depend on whether what \n     goes outside the statute nonetheless lies within the \n     authority of the president to defend the country.\n       Senator Leahy: Can the President put someone above the law \n     by authorizing illegal conduct?\n       Judge Mukasey: If by illegal you mean contrary to a statute \n     but within the authority of the President to defend the \n     country, the President is not putting somebody above the law, \n     the President is putting somebody within the law.\n\n  While this view may be consistent with the current administration's \nposition regarding Executive authority, this stance is not consistent \nwith how the powers of the president have traditionally been \ninterpreted. The notion that the President may disregard a valid law by \nciting his inherent power to defend the country is disconcerting.\n  And frankly, it is all too reminiscent of President Nixon's assertion \nthat actions taken in the name of national security, whether or not \nthey are in accordance with relevant statues, are by definition legal \nif they are carried out on behalf of the President. This assertion was \nwidely rejected, as it should have been.\n  As our Nation's highest law enforcement officer, it is essential that \nthe Attorney General faithfully execute laws passed by Congress. It is \none thing for the Attorney General to state that he or she will not \nenforce a certain measure because it is unconstitutional; however, it \nis a very different matter if the Executive Branch asserts that it is \nnot bound by a law that is clearly constitutional.\n  It is for this reason that I cannot support the nomination of Judge \nMukasey to be the next Attorney General.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of President \nBush's nomination of Judge Michael B. Mukasey to serve as Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. I am pleased that leadership is bringing \nJudge Mukasey's nomination to the Senate floor. It has been more than \n45 days since his nomination, making him the longest pending nominee \nfor Attorney General in more than 20 years.\n  Judge Mukasey expressed to me earlier today his desire to fill the \nleadership void at the Justice Department and assured me that he is \nprepared to address the challenges we face as a nation. I greatly \nappreciate his attention to the important issues pertaining to Colorado \nand his strong commitment to the rule of law.\n  Judge Mukasey demonstrated a fine record of management as the \npresiding judge over one of the busiest judicial districts in the \nNation and I am confident that he is qualified to be our next Attorney \nGeneral and aware of the challenges we face at the Justice Department.\n  I am truly impressed with this Nominee's background. I would point \nout that Judge Mukasey is not a Washington insider. Judge Mukasey \nrecently worked as a partner at the New York law firm of Patterson, \nBelknap, Webb and Taylor. Judge Mukasey has spent his career in New \nYork since President Ronald Reagan nominated Mukasey to serve on the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in 1987. He \nspent almost 19 years as a Federal judge, including serving as chief \njudge until his retirement from the bench in 2006.\n  Judge Mukasey has shown a strong commitment to the rule of law and \nhas a demonstrated record of managing one of the busiest judicial \ndistricts in the Nation. Both attributes qualify him to lead the \nDepartment of Justice in fulfilling its mission of enforcing all of the \nNation's laws fairly and vigorously.\n  Judge Mukasey's record as a Federal district judge shows a strong and \nindependent commitment to the rule of law. As chief judge of the \nSouthern District of New York, he managed one of the busiest dockets in \nthe Nation. His work following the attacks of September 11 ensured that \nindividuals could access the courthouse even in the immediate aftermath \nof a national emergency.\n  Attorney General Mukasey would not hesitate to say no to anyone, \nincluding the President. No man is above the law, and Judge Mukasey has \nstated that he would resign rather than participate in a violation of \nthe law.\n  I would also point out that Judge Michael Mukasey has a very strong \nbackground on national security issues, most notably as a federal \ndistrict court judge. He has ruled in national security cases involving \nat least 15 different defendants. Moreover, he has issued at least two \ndozen national security related opinions.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to cast a vote in favor of Judge \nMichael B. Mukasey's confirmation as the 81st Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, tonight the Senate will vote on the \nnomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be Attorney General. His \nnomination comes at a critical time. At this moment in history, America \nis faced with serious challenges both at home and abroad. We are at war \nin Iraq and Afghanistan and are engaged in a long-term struggle against \nal-Qaida and other extremists. Military might alone will not be enough \nfor us to win these fights. Strengthening America's security requires \nus to harness the power of our ideals and values and lead a global \neffort to confront these threats. When we project moral hypocrisy or \nsuggest that our commitment to our fundamental values depends on the \ncircumstances, we lose the support of the world in our common efforts \nagainst common enemies, thereby compromising our own security.\n  The pictures of American soldiers mistreating prisoners at Abu Ghraib \nand the stories of detainee abuse at Guantanamo Bay compromised our \nmoral authority and our ability to lead the global struggle against al-\nQaida. America must demonstrate an unambiguous commitment to basic \nhuman rights. And this is not some intellectual musing. It is hard \nheaded pragmatism.\n  Earlier this year, I visited some of our veterans at a Michigan VA \nhospital. I asked one Korean war veteran who was lying in his bed: What \ncan we do to help you? And do you know what he said? ``Win back the \nrespect of people around the world for America.'' That veteran \nunderstands that the erosion of support for America makes us less \nsecure and weakens us in a way that military force cannot remedy.\n  I have devoted significant time looking into the issue of detainee \nabuse and considering what is appropriate when it comes to the \ntreatment of detainees in U.S. custody. Building back the respect for \nAmerica that the Michigan veteran and all of us seek requires a \ndefinitive commitment to treating all people--even our enemies--in a \nmanner consistent with both our laws and basic human rights.\n  Last month I asked Judge Michael Mukasey, President's Bush's nominee \nto be Attorney General of the United States, what I thought was a \nstraightforward question for the record:\n\n       Would you consider it inhumane to secure a detainee onto a \n     flat surface and slowly pour water directly onto the \n     detainee's face or onto a towel covering the detainee's face \n     in a manner that induced a perception by the detainee that he \n     was drowning?\n\n  That question to Judge Mukasey should have prompted a simple answer \nof ``yes.'' But the Judge said that, while the tactic is ``repugnant'' \nto him, he could not say it was inhumane without evaluating the ``facts \nand circumstances.'' Judge Mukasey's ambiguous response is more than \ndeeply troubling, it sends a message--from the man nominated to head \nthe Department of Justice--that abuses of detainees in U.S. custody may \nnot have been categorically wrong, but that such acts might have been \njustified by the circumstances.\n  In 2002, the Department of Defense requested authority to use a \nnumber of aggressive interrogation techniques--including mock \ndrowning--on detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. FBI agents vigorously \nobjected to the aggressive techniques. One stated in a\n\n[[Page S14170]]\n\nlegal analysis that aggressive techniques, including mock drowning, \nwere ``not permitted by the U.S. Constitution.''\n  Another FBI agent also expressed alarm to his Justice Department \ncolleagues over a DOD interrogation plan for a detainee held at \nGuantanamo Bay, saying ``You won't believe it!'' An e-mail described \nabuses that a FBI agent had witnessed, including detainees being \nchained in fetal positions on the floor for 18 to 24 hours at a time, \nhaving urinated and defecated on themselves and being subjected to \nextreme cold.\n  If Judge Mukasey were to be confirmed to lead the Department of \nJustice, he would take charge of the FBI. How would Judge Mukasey \nrespond to those FBI agents? Would he have said that the validity of \nthose objections depended on the ``circumstances''?\n  Over the past 5 years, the Department of Justice has repeatedly \nissued aggressive legal opinions that seek to exploit any possible \nlegal ambiguity to justify the administration's policies. In 2002, for \nexample, the Department of Justice issued a now disavowed memo finding \nthat physical pain had to be ``equivalent in intensity to the pain \naccompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment \nof bodily function, or even death'' to constitute torture. The \nExecutive order that the President issued in July of this year \ninterprets Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions to bar only those \noutrageous acts that are done ``for the purpose of humiliating or \ndegrading the individual.'' The Geneva Conventions make no such \ndistinction. These results-driven interpretations of law have \ncontributed to the negative image of the United States in the world, \nleaving many to question why we attempt to impose standards on other \ncountries that we do not require of ourselves. These interpretations \nendanger our troops when captured because their captors will cite these \ninterpretations to justify abuses of our troops.\n  It does a disservice to our Nation for a person who has been \nnominated to lead the Department of Justice to hide behind purposeful \nambiguities, particularly at a time when our Nation's prestige has been \nso tarnished by abuses against detainees in our custody. The legality \nof mock drowning--waterboarding--does not depend on the circumstances. \nIt is illegal.\n  Waterboarding clearly runs afoul of three Federal statutes--the 1994 \nantitorture statute, the Military Commissions Act, and the Detainee \nTreatment Act--and it is inconsistent with our obligations under Common \nArticle 3 of the Geneva Conventions.\n  In his answers to questions from the Judiciary Committee, Judge \nMukasey refused to state whether waterboarding constitutes torture \nunder U.S. law. Under the Federal antitorture statute adopted in 1994, \n18 U.S.C. Sec.  2340, an act is torture if it is specifically intended \nto cause ``severe physical or mental pain or suffering.'' The statute \ndefines ``severe mental pain and suffering'' as mental harm caused by, \namong other things, ``threat of imminent death.'' Pouring water over a \ndetainee's face to create the sensation of drowning is intended to \nthreaten imminent death.\n  In questions for the record of an August 2006 Senate Judiciary \nCommittee hearing, Senator Durbin asked each of the Judge Advocates \nGeneral, JAGs, of the Marine Corps, Air Force, Army, and Navy whether, \nin their personal view: ``the use of a wet towel and dripping water to \ninduce the misperception of a drowning (i.e., waterboarding) (was) \nlegal?'' The answer from each of the JAGs was an unequivocal ``No.'' \nThe Marine Corps JAG responded to Senator Durbin ``Threatening a \ndetainee with imminent death, to include drowning, is torture under 18 \nU.S.C. Sec.  2340''--the anti-torture statute. Similarly, the Air Force \nJAG stated: ``An interrogation technique that is specifically intended \nto cause severe mental suffering involving a threat of imminent death \nby asphyxiation is torture under 18 U.S.C Sec.  2340.'' And the Army \nJAG responded: ``inducing the misperception of drowning as an \ninterrogation technique is not legal.''\n\n  Whether the practice of mock drowning is legal is a question that our \nNation's top military lawyers had no problem answering. But the nominee \nfor Attorney General says that it depends on ``circumstances,'' it \ncould be ``yes,'' it could be ``no.''\n  The U.S. Navy's Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape--SERE--\nSchool trains our troops, whose dangerous assignments leave them \nsusceptible to being captured, to resist and survive abusive tactics \nthat might be used by the enemy. Waterboarding is one of the tactics \nthat troops are exposed to at Navy SERE school. Listen to how a former \nmaster instructor and chief of training at the Navy's SERE school \ndescribed waterboarding in an October 31, 2007, article in the New York \nDaily News:\n\n       Waterboarding is slow-motion suffocation with enough time \n     to contemplate the inevitability of blackout and expiration. \n     Usually the person goes into hysterics on the board. For the \n     uninitiated, it is horrifying to watch. If it goes wrong, it \n     can lead straight to terminal hypoxia--meaning, the loss of \n     all oxygen to the cells.''\n\n  As he put it, ``waterboarding is a torture technique--without a \ndoubt. There is no way to sugarcoat it.''\n  A U.S. Federal court has concluded that mock drowning constitutes \ntorture. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals examined an interrogation \ntechnique used by the Philippine military under Ferdinand Marcos \nwhereby ``all of [the victim's] limbs were shackled to a cot and a \ntowel was placed over his nose and mouth; his interrogators then poured \nwater down his nostrils so that he felt as though he was drowning.'' \nThe court referred to this practice as ``water torture'' and found \nagainst those responsible for this and other illegal acts.\n  By contrast, Judge Mukasey not only refuses to state that \nwaterboarding is torture, he also refuses to say whether it constitutes \n``cruel or inhuman treatment,'' which is illegal under the Military \nCommissions Act of 2006.\n  Congress enacted the Military Commissions Act in the wake of Abu \nGhraib scandal. The statute bans interrogations tactics that constitute \n``cruel or inhuman treatment,'' which it defines as any act generally \nintended to cause ``serious mental or physical pain and suffering.''\n  Medical experts who have treated and observed the survivors of water \ntorture have described the physical and psychological severity of the \npractice and its long-term effect. Dr. Allan Keller, associate \nprofessor of medicine at New York University, NYU, School of Medicine \nand director of the Bellevue/NYU Program for Survivors of Torture, \nrecently testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that a \nperson subjected to the waterboard, ``gags and chokes, [and] the terror \nof imminent death is pervasive, with all of the physiologic and \npsychological responses expected, including an intense stress response, \nmanifested by tachycardia, rapid heart beat and gasping for breath. \nThere is a real risk of death from actually drowning or suffering a \nheart attack or damage to the lungs from inhalation of water.'' Dr. \nKeller put it plainly, the ``clinical experience and data from the \nmedical literature are clear and unequivocal. These techniques can \ncause significant and long lasting psychological and often physical \npain and harm.''\n  It is clear that waterboarding involves ``serious'' physical or \nmental pain or suffering and therefore constitutes illegal ``cruel or \ninhuman treatment'' under the Military Commissions Act. Yet in response \nto questions from Senator Kennedy and Senator Biden, Judge Mukasey \nwould not say whether waterboarding is ``cruel or inhuman'' under this \nlegal standard.\n  When asked whether the practice of mock drowning on detainees was \n``cruel, inhuman, or degrading,'' which is a violation Detainee \nTreatment Act, Judge Mukasey would not respond to the question, simply \ngiving his stock answer that his analysis depends on the \n``circumstances.''\n  Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act in 2005 to make clear that \ninhumane treatment is illegal. The Detainee Treatment Act prohibits \nsubjecting any detainee in U.S. Government custody or control, wherever \nheld, to ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.'' \nThose terms were defined to restrict any conduct that would constitute \ncruel, unusual, and inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by the \nU.S. Constitution, which includes conduct that ``shocks the \nconscience.''\n  There can be no question that mock drowning ``shocks the conscience'' \nand\n\n[[Page S14171]]\n\nrises to the level of ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \npunishment'' under the Detainee Treatment Act.\n  I asked Judge Mukasey whether the practice of mock drowning on \ndetainees was ``inhumane,'' which would be a violation of Common \nArticle 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Judge Mukasey would not respond to \nthat question, again giving his stock answer that his analysis depends \non the ``circumstances.'' Regardless of what the President's recent \nExecutive order would suggest, the humane standard of Common Article 3 \nhas never varied depending on the type of information in someone's \npossession or the purpose behind the acts.\n  The Army Field Manual on Intelligence, which sets standards for \nmilitary interrogations consistent with the Geneva Conventions and with \nU.S. law that prohibits ``torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading \ntreatment or punishment'' explicitly bans certain coercive techniques \nincluding ``waterboarding.''\n  Throughout history America has condemned waterboarding by seeking \nprosecution of enemies who have used the technique on American \nservicemembers. Following the Second World War, U.S. military \ncommissions and international tribunals prosecuted individuals who had \nused waterboarding, or similar forms of water torture on civilians and \nAllied forces. The U.S. military commissions in the Pacific theater \nexplicitly held that the ``water cure'' was torture in prosecuting \ncases related to the mistreatment of captured U.S. bomber crews. The \nU.S. Military Commission at Yokohama, Japan also tried four Japanese \ndefendants for torture, including water torture, of American and Allied \nforces. Each of the defendants was convicted and sentenced to 20 years \nhard labor.\n\n  Would Judge Mukasey find it acceptable if U.S. soldiers were \nsubjected to mock drowning by our enemies? Would he say that its \nacceptability depends on the ``circumstances''? Would Judge Mukasey say \nthat he needed to know the motives of our enemies before saying that \nour soldiers who endured waterboarding had been tortured or subject to \ninhumane treatment? Would he distinguish between someone who \nwaterboarded our troops to elicit information as contrasted to someone \nwho used the technique on our troops for sadistic purposes?\n  Judge Mukasey needs to be clear that waterboarding is illegal for the \nsake of protecting our men and women in uniform from abuse should they \never be captured. Judge Mukasey has not been clear and if he is \nconfirmed to head our Justice Department, it will be America signaling \nmoral ambiguity about what is unambiguously torture and inhumane.\n  In fact, the United States has prosecuted its own servicemembers who \nhave used waterboarding and similar water tortures during \ninterrogations. During the American intervention in the Philippines, in \n1902, a military court rejected MAJ Edwin Glenn's defense of ``military \nnecessity'' and convicted him for using water torture on a captured \ninsurgent. During the Vietnam war, a soldier participated in water \ntorture which was captured in photos and published in the Washington \nPost on January 21, 1968. According to the Washington Post, the soldier \nwas court martialed for his involvement in the practice.\n  U.S. veterans who served as interrogators in the Second World War \nrecently discussed how proud they were that they were able to obtain \nvital information by using skill, not torture, and by treating a \ndangerous enemy with ``respect and justice.'' In an article in the \nWashington Post last month, one veteran proudly exclaimed:\n\n       During the many interrogations, I never laid hands on \n     anyone. We extracted information in a battle of the wits. I'm \n     proud to say I never compromised my humanity.\n\n  I had hoped Judge Mukasey would stand with that veteran and stand up \nfor American values. But despite the clear law and history, Judge \nMukasey engaged in legalisms and obfuscation, playing into the negative \nimage that others project about the U.S.--that we apply double \nstandards.\n  This kind of obfuscation tarnishes America's image, which has a \nnegative impact on our ability to organize and maintain alliances to \nachieve national goals. As Steven Kull, the director of the Program on \nInternational Policy Attitudes, stated:\n\n       The thing that comes up repeatedly is not just anger about \n     Iraq. The common theme is hypocrisy. The reaction tends to \n     be--You were a champion of a certain set of rules. Now you \n     are breaking your own rules.\n\n  Purposeful ambiguity about the legality of waterboarding and the \nother coercive interrogation techniques he was asked about is at the \ncenter of Judge Mukasey's confirmation, just as it is at the center of \nhow we are viewed in the world. That ambiguity is untenable and \nunacceptable in the person who, if confirmed, will symbolize America's \nconcept of justice before the world. For these reasons, I oppose Judge \nMukasey's nomination to be Attorney General.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote against the nomination of \nJudge Mukasey to be the next Attorney General. This was a difficult \ndecision, as Judge Mukasey has many fine qualities. I was particularly \nimpressed by his determination to depoliticize the Department of \nJustice. After the debacle of the last Attorney General, this is \nobviously a very high priority. If nothing else, over the remaining 15 \nmonths of the Bush Presidency, the Department must recover its \ncredibility and its reputation. Never again should it be led by someone \nwho is willing to wield its awesome power for political purposes or \nfill its most important positions with individuals chosen for their \npolitics rather than their legal skills. Judge Mukasey appears to have \nthe intelligence, the experience, and the stature to undertake this \nvery important task.\n  There are other areas where I was favorably impressed by Judge \nMukasey. His straightforward promise to stop the disparate treatment of \ngay employees at the Department of Justice was welcome and refreshing. \nHe indicated his intention to be a much more hands-on manager of the \nprocess for seeking the federal death penalty, and when I asked him in \nwriting if a request by a U.S. attorney to discuss a death penalty \ndecision with Attorney General personally was a valid reason to fire \nthat U.S. attorney, he answered simply, ``No.'' If Judge Mukasey is \nconfirmed, I look forward to working with him to try to ensure that \nFederal death penalty is fairly administered.\n  I was also impressed that on several occasions Judge Mukasey was \nwilling to admit in his written answers that some thing he had said or \nwritten in the past were incorrect. This administration needs more \npeople who will admit they were wrong when that is the case. That kind \nof humility and honesty is often the first step toward correcting \nmistakes and reaching consensus.\n  In many respects then, Judge Mukasey is a big improvement on the \nprevious Attorney General. At this point in our history, however, the \ncountry needs more. Simply put, after all that has taken place over the \nlast seven years, we need an Attorney General who will tell the \nPresident that he cannot ignore the laws passed by Congress. And on \nthat fundamental qualification for this office, Judge Mukasey falls \nshort.\n  The President's warrantless wiretapping program, instituted after 9/\n11 and carried out in secret until it was revealed in a New York Times \narticle in December 2005, presented the Department of Justice with a \nhistoric test of its integrity and its commitment to the rule of law. \nUnder the previous leadership, the Department failed that test. We need \nan Attorney General who, when faced with a similar crisis, will look \nthe President in the eye and tell him ``No.''\n  When I first met with Judge Mukasey, I questioned him about the two \njustifications for authorizing warrantless wiretaps that the Department \nhas put forward publicly. With respect to the argument that the \nauthorization for use of military force, or AUMF, somehow authorized \nwarrantless wiretaps, he said, ``I don't see that argument.'' With \nrespect to the argument that the program was legal under the \nPresident's article II powers, he said he was ``agnostic.''\n  I and a number of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee returned \nto this question in the hearings and in written questions for the \nrecord. Unfortunately, this time the results were not reassuring. He \nresponded to my question for the record about the largely discredited \nAUMF justification by\n\n[[Page S14172]]\n\nsaying that ``I still have not come to a conclusion. . . . I believe \nthere are good arguments on both sides of that issue.'' That is a \nstatement that ought to give pause to anyone in this body.\n  His answers to questions concerning the article II justification \nindicate that he is no longer agnostic on that question, but instead he \nhas become a believer that executive power trumps the laws written by \nCongress.\n  Both at the hearing and in writing, Judge Mukasey stated several \ntimes that the President must obey all valid and constitutional \nstatutes, even if he is acting to defend or protect the country. He \nalso said that ``FISA is a constitutional law'' and that ``[a]s a \ngeneral matter, therefore, the President is not free to disregard or \nviolate FISA.''\n  But he also stated that ``difficult separation of powers questions'' \nwould arise, and would have to be resolved through the three-part test \narticulated in the Supreme Court Youngstown case, if a statute--and \nFISA in particular--were to constrain the President's constitutional \nauthority. If FISA is constitutional--and Judge Mukasey says it is--\nthen why are these separation of powers questions so ``difficult''? \nClearly, Judge Mukasey believes that a law can be constitutional on its \nface, but can become unconstitutional if its application constrains the \nconstitutional authority of the President. There is no difference \nbetween this view of executive power and the theory that executive \npower trumps congressional power. There is no other way to interpret \nJudge Mukasey's statement to Senator Leahy: ``If by illegal you mean \ncontrary to a statute, but within the authority of the president to \ndefend the country, the president is not putting somebody above the \nlaw; the president is putting somebody within the law.''\n  This view is simply contrary to Justice Jackson's three-part test in \nYoungstown. Youngstown makes clear that where the President's \nconstitutional authority and a statute passed by Congress come into \nconflict, the President's powers are reduced by whatever powers \nCongress holds over the subject--not vice versa. Jackson states that \nwhen the President acts against the will of Congress, ``he can rely \nonly upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers \nof Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive presidential \ncontrol in such a case only by disabling Congress from acting upon the \nsubject.'' Congress is thus free to constrain the President's \nconstitutional powers to any degree it likes, as long as Congress is \nacting within its own powers in doing so; likewise, the President's \nactions may be upheld only if they are ``within his domain and beyond \ncontrol of Congress.''\n  The argument that constitutional statutes can become unconstitutional \nignores this second part of the inquiry--whether the limitation on the \nPresident's authority is in an area where Congress cannot legislate. It \nis clear that wiretapping is not within the exclusive domain of the \nPresident, as Judge Mukasey admits that FISA is a constitutional law. \nMoreover, the executive authority that Judge Mukasey invoked most \noften--the authority to protect and defend the country--is not \nexclusive to the President. It is an authority that Congress shares, \nwhich Judge Mukasey admitted in answers to written questions.\n  I have discussed this issue in some detail because extreme theories \nof executive power have become one of the primary, and most \nunfortunate, legacies of the Bush administration. Congress needs to be \nvery clear in rejecting them, and in making respect for the rule of law \na nonnegotiable qualification for the office of Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  Let me say a word about the issue of torture, which has dominated the \ndebate on the nomination of Judge Mukasey in the past week. Last week, \nthe White House press secretary again implied that Members of Congress \nwho have been briefed on the CIA's interrogation program have approved \nit or consented to it. That is not the case. I have vigorously opposed \nthe program, and continue to do so. The program is of highly \nquestionable legality, it is inconsistent with our values as a nation, \nand it does not make our Nation any safer. In fact, I believe that it \nmay have the effect of exposing Americans--including military and other \nU.S. personnel--to greater risk.\n  I have detailed the reasons for my strong objections to the CIA's \nprogram in classified correspondence, sent shortly after I was first \nbriefed on it. More recently, I have stated my opposition publicly, \nalthough I am prohibited by classification rules from providing further \ndetails about my concerns in a public setting.\n  In any event, neither detailed legal and factual analysis, nor \nknowledge of the operational details of the CIA's program, is necessary \nto reach a judgment on whether waterboarding is torture. Waterboarding \nhas been used by some of the most evil regimes in history. It has been \nconsidered torture in this country for over a century. If Judge Mukasey \nwon't say the simple truth--that this barbaric practice is torture--how \ncan we count on him to stand up to the White House on other issues?\n  America needs an Attorney General who stands squarely on the side of \nthe rule of law. This is not an arid, theoretical debate. The rule of \nlaw is the very foundation of freedom and a crucial bulwark against \ntyranny. Congress cannot stand silent in the face of this challenge by \nthe executive to the crucial underpinnings of our system of government.\n  The Nation's top law enforcement officer must be able to stand up to \na chief executive who thinks he is above the law. The rule of law is \ntoo important to our country's history and to its future to compromise \non that bedrock principle.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of \nJudge Michael Mukasey to be Attorney General of the United States. \nJudge Mukasey is eminently qualified for this position. For almost 20 \nyears he served as U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of New \nYork, presiding over prominent terror trials and gaining familiarity \nwith complex national security issues that continue to challenge our \nNation.\n  Specifically, Judge Mukasey presided over the trial of the ``Blind \nSheik,'' who was involved in planning the 1993 World Trade Center \nbombing. Upon conviction, Judge Mukasey sentenced the terrorist to life \nin prison. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals, in affirming the \nverdict, praised Mukasey by saying: ``The trial judge, the Honorable \nMichael B. Mukasey, presided with extraordinary skill and patience, \nassuring fairness to the prosecution and to each defendant and \nhelpfulness to the jury. His was an outstanding achievement in the face \nof challenges far beyond those normally endured by a trial judge.'' \nIndeed, Judge Mukasey's ruling in the Blind Sheik case presented \nextraordinary challenges--his ruling drew death threats that required \nhim to receive years of 24-hour armed protection.\n  Yet Judge Mukasey maintained his objectivity as a judge, ruling years \nlater that while Jose Padilla--a U.S. citizen later convicted of \nFederal terrorism support charges--could be held by the government as \nan enemy combatant, he was also entitled to legal counsel. One of \nPadilla's defense lawyers who said he had ``more cases before Mukasey \nthan I can count,'' praised the judge saying, ``I don't always agree \nwith where he comes out . . . [but] I am always happy to draw him as a \njudge. You are going to get your day in court.'' Another of Padilla's \nlawyers said about Judge Mukasey, ``I admire him greatly,'' describing \nherself as ``another weeping fan.''\n  Since his nomination, many of Michael Mukasey's colleagues and \nlawyers who appeared before him have offered statements of praise and \nsupport. While it would be impossible to reiterate them all, perhaps \nformer U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White's statement best encapsulates the \ngeneral sentiment. She said that Judge Mukasey ``is a man of great \nintellect and integrity with an unswerving commitment to the rule of \nlaw. He is independent, fair-minded and has a wealth of relevant \nexperience from his years of service on the bench, in the private \nsector and as an assistant United States attorney in the Southern \nDistrict of New York.'' I agree that Judge Mukasey's intellect, \nintegrity, and experience make him uniquely qualified to serve as \nAttorney General.\n  It is, however, imperative that our Attorney General put his oath to \nprotect and uphold the Constitution before\n\n[[Page S14173]]\n\nall other loyalties. As such, I looked to Judge Mukasey for assurances \nthat he would put the Constitution first. Judge Mukasey gave the first \nof such assurances on October 5, 2007, the day that he was nominated, \nwhen he said, ``The department faces challenges vastly different from \nthose it faced when I was an assistant U.S. attorney 35 years ago. But \nthe principles that guide the department remain the same--to pursue \njustice by enforcing the law with unswerving fidelity to the \nConstitution.'' After studying his record and participating in the \nconfirmation process, I am confident that Judge Mukasey's great respect \nfor the Constitution and the rule of law is sincere.\n  The Justice Department has undergone difficult times of late, but I \nknow Judge Mukasey has the integrity and intellect to carry out the \nnecessary work to restore the American public's trust in the \ndepartment. America has been well-served by Judge Mukasey's past public \nservice and is fortunate that such an accomplished individual--who \nentered retirement just one year ago--is willing to answer the call to \npublic service once again. I thank Judge Mukasey for his continued \nsacrifice.\n  I am pleased to vote in favor of Judge Michael Mukasey's nomination \nto be Attorney General of the United States and look forward to working \nwith him in the future.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the full Senate today \nis considering the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey as Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. I strongly support his confirmation.\n  As many of you know, the President nominated Judge Mukasey on \nSeptember 17; however, the Senate Judiciary Committee did not vote on \nhis nomination until Tuesday. This ranks as one of the longest spans \nbetween a nomination and a confirmation vote for an Attorney General \nnominee. This is particularly unfair to the American people who deserve \nto have in place a chief enforcer of our Nation's laws.\n  I believe Judge Mukasey is the right nominee to enforce our laws, \nparticularly during this time of war. As a Federal judge, he presided \nover one of the country's busiest trial courts and one that has \noverseen several terrorism-related cases. These included the trial of \nthe terrorist known as ``the Blind Sheikh,'' a man who was convicted of \nconspiracy to destroy the World Trade Center.\n  In comprehensive responses to questions posed by members of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, Judge Mukasey exhibited mainstream legal \nviews on constitutional checks and balances. He stated that the \nPresident cannot waive congressionally mandated restrictions on \ninterrogation techniques, including those included in the ``McCain \namendment'' and the Military Commissions Act. This is a particularly \nimportant conclusion given that, under these laws, anyone who engages \nin waterboarding, on behalf of any U.S. Government agency, puts himself \nat risk of civil liability and criminal prosecution.\n  Judge Mukasey also, in a separate letter, acknowledged that the \ninterrogation technique known as waterboarding is ``over the line'' and \n``repugnant.'' These are important statements, and I expect that they \nwill inform his views as Attorney General. I strongly urge that, in \nthat role, Judge Mukasey will publicly make clear that waterboarding is \nillegal and can never be employed.\n  Waterboarding, under any circumstances, represents a clear violation \nof U.S. law. In 2005, the President signed into law a prohibition on \ncruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment as those terms are understood \nunder the standards of the U.S. Constitution. There was at that time a \ndebate over the way in which the administration was likely to interpret \nthese prohibitions. Along with Senators Warner and Graham, I stated \nthen my strong belief that a fair reading of the ``McCain amendment'' \noutlaws waterboarding and other extreme techniques. It is, or should \nbe, beyond dispute that waterboarding ``shocks the conscience.''\n  It is also incontestable that waterboarding is outlawed by the 2006 \nMilitary Commissions Act, MCA, and it was the clear intent of Congress \nto prohibit the practice. As one of the authors of that statute, I \nwould note that the MCA specifically prohibits acts that inflict \n``serious and nontransitory mental harm'' that ``need not be \nprolonged.'' Staging a mock execution by inducing the misperception of \ndrowning is a clear violation of this standard. For this reason, during \nthe negotiations that led to the MCA, my colleagues and I were \npersonally assured by administration officials that this language, \nwhich applies to all agencies of the U.S. Government, prohibits \nwaterboarding. Many of us share Judge Mukasey's revulsion at the use of \nwaterboarding, and I welcome his commitment to further review its \nlegality once confirmed. I expect that he will reach the same \nconclusion.\n  I sincerely hope that the recent public debate over the use and \nlegality of waterboarding is America's last. In discussing this \npractice, we are speaking of an interrogation technique that dates from \nthe Spanish Inquisition, one that has been a prosecutable offense for \nover a century, one that was employed by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia \nand which is reportedly being used by the thugs in Burma today against \nthe innocent monks protesting their repression. Waterboarding simply \nhas no place in the America I know. Let us take it off the table, once \nand for all, and move beyond this debate.\n  There is evil in the world today, and it takes form in those who \ncommit themselves to the destruction of America and the ideals we hold \ndear. Let us fight them, let us defend America, but let us in so doing \nnever forget that we are, first and foremost, Americans. Make no \nmistake--we will prevail--but we must wage this war with fidelity to \nour laws and deepest values. These laws and values are the source of \nstrength, not weakness, for though we are stronger than our enemies in \nmen and arms, we are stronger still in ideals. We will win the war on \nterror not in spite of devotion to our cherished values, but because we \nhave held fast to them.\n  Based on the statements and responses that this nominee has provided \nover the past week, I believe that Judge Mukasey shares this view. He \nis a consensus nominee, one with a reputation as a rigorous, \nindependent, and honest thinker. I am pleased to offer him our support \nand I hope that my colleagues will join us in voting for \nconfirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, without losing my right to the floor, I \nyield to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania on his time to ask \na question of the Chair.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time is left on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 1 hour. The \nmajority has a total time of 1 hour 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I know of only one additional Senator who \nwishes to speak in favor of Judge Mukasey, and that request has been \nlimited to 5 minutes. So I ask him to come to the floor or anyone else \nwho wishes to speak on behalf of Judge Mukasey to come to the floor.\n  If I may consult with my colleague, the distinguished chairman, \nperhaps we can take an inventory now as to how much time the other \nspeakers will want so we can give our colleagues an idea as to when we \nwill be voting.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senators are waiting to be recognized. I \nask unanimous consent--the time allotted to me is 20-some-odd minutes--\nthat when he is recognized, the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders, be \nrecognized for 12 of my 24 minutes. Perhaps while the next Senator is \nspeaking, I will make an attempt to find out how much more time we have \nso I can report to the Senator from Pennsylvania. I ask unanimous \nconsent that when he is recognized, the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nSanders, be recognized for 12 minutes of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nnomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be the next U.S. Attorney \nGeneral. I come to the floor tonight with a heavy heart\n\n[[Page S14174]]\n\nbecause I had hoped I would have been able to come to the floor and \nmake a statement in support of Judge Mukasey.\n  I reviewed the answers he gave to the Judiciary Committee and the \nwritten responses he gave to important questions, including the \nquestion of torture. After reviewing that information, I also met with \nJudge Mukasey in my office in the Senate office buildings. He was very \ngenerous with his time, and I very much appreciate the time he gave me \nto review some of the fundamental questions.\n  There is no doubt that Judge Mukasey is a brilliant man, a talented \nand successful judge who has given a great deal to this country. So it \nis with a heavy heart that I have reached the conclusion that I cannot \nand will not support his nomination. I will not support his nomination \nbecause there is no room for equivocation on the American position on \nthe fundamental issue of torture. There is no room for equivocation on \nthat issue.\n  Before coming to the Senate, I had the great privilege of serving as \nthe attorney general of the State of Colorado. For me, it was an \nenormous responsibility and one which carried many duties. There were \nduties of making sure that over 10,000 people were put into prison, \nsome of them serving a lifetime in prison. It was an enormous duty in \nterms of rendering tens of thousands of legal opinions to a vast State \nagency, and I understood the responsibilities of being an attorney \ngeneral. Those responsibilities, first and foremost, were to make sure \nI was upholding the oath of office I had taken to the Constitution of \nthe State of Colorado, to uphold the constitutional laws in my State, \nand to enforce those laws and to make sure no one was above the law.\n  I also served as legal counsel to the Governor and to the head of \nState agencies, where I provided them legal counsel that a lawyer would \nprovide to their client. As attorney general, it was not often that my \noath to enforce Colorado's constitutional laws came into conflict with \nmy responsibilities to advise and to serve the Governor. But when it \ndid, it was my duty--it was my solemn duty--to defend the rule of law, \nnot the Governor or the executive agency or the agency heads. On some \noccasions, driven by that solemn duty to enforce that law, I had to \ntake my own clients to court to enforce the rule of law, and I did \nthat.\n  The Attorney General of the United States must likewise enforce our \nlaws because very simply we are a nation of laws, and that is what \nmakes us a special place on this globe.\n  This role today is more important than at any other time in the \nhistory of the Justice Department. Trust in the Department is at an \nalltime low given the high-profile memos that now have become public \nwhich enabled torture to occur by the agents of the United States, \nwhich allowed for the firing of nine U.S. attorneys and other reports \nof politicization within the Department of Justice, which should never \nbe politicized because it enforces our laws. Therefore, the next U.S. \nAttorney General must restore the confidence of the American people \nthat the Justice Department will enforce the law regardless of the \nAttorney General's personal beliefs or who happens to sit in the Oval \nOffice as President of these United States.\n  I am troubled that Judge Mukasey is unwilling to clearly and \nunambiguously state that he will uphold U.S. law barring the use of \nwaterboarding. I explicitly asked Judge Mukasey in my office what he \nwould do as Attorney General if he were asked whether an agent of the \nUnited States could use waterboarding in interrogation settings. Judge \nMukasey's response to me was disappointing. He said he did not know \nbecause it depended on whether there was intent to cause pain. That \nanswer, in my view, is simply unacceptable given the legal history of \nthis issue in this country.\n  Under Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, the following \nacts are prohibited at any time and at any place: First, ``violence to \nlife and person, in particular . . . cruel treatment and torture, and, \ntwo, outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and \ndegrading treatment.''\n  The War Crimes Act, as amended by the Military Commissions Act in \n2006 by this Congress, prohibits breaches of Common Article 3 of the \nGeneva Conventions which is defined in that legislation to include \n``torture and cruel and inhumane treatment.'' Torture is further \ndefined as:\n\n       The act of a person who commits, or conspires or attempts \n     to commit an act specifically intended to inflict severe \n     physical or mental pain or suffering upon another person.\n\n  On October 5, 2005, we in this Chamber passed, by a vote of 90 to 9--\nonly nine Senators in this Chamber voting against the legislation--the \nDetainee Treatment Act, otherwise known by many of us as the McCain \namendment. The amendment states:\n\n       No individual in the custody or under the physical control \n     of the United States Government, regardless of nationality or \n     physical location, shall be subject to cruel, inhumane, or \n     degrading treatment or punishment.\n\n  By our most basic human sensibilities, waterboarding, whereby water \nis forced into the nose, mouth, or lungs of a person to create the \nsensation that they are drowning and dying, is torture, and it is \nillegal. The feeling--from those who have spoken about this at length--\nis one that causes struggle, panic, ingestion of water, vomiting, and \npsychological trauma.\n  This truth, Mr. President, that this is torture, has been affirmed by \nthe top lawyers in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, both \ncurrent and retired. It has been affirmed by my colleagues, by some of \nmy most respected colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, for \nwhom I have tremendous respect.\n  Through our history, we have prosecuted those who have used the \ntechnique against our own people as criminals of war. When Japanese \nsoldiers waterboarded American prisoners of war in World War II, we \nconvicted them for their crimes. We convicted them for their crimes. \nWhen our own soldiers, over 100 years ago, used waterboarding in the \n1898 Spanish-American War in the interrogation of Filipino insurgents, \nthey were court-martialed. In Vietnam, U.S. generals declared \nwaterboarding to be illegal and strictly enforced the ban on its use.\n  Mr. President, I very much recognize the importance of the advice and \nconsent clause of our Constitution, in our working with the President \nin the consent function that we play with respect to his Cabinet \nappointments. I have worked very hard for 3 years on many of those \nconfirmations in an effort to develop the kind of cooperation and \ncollaboration that is required. However, Mr. President, there are some \nfundamental core principles for which we must stand. These principles \nare tested, no doubt, in the face of violence and war, but it is in \nthese moments when these principles are all the more important. The \nfact that we do not torture, the fact that we in this Nation do not \ntorture is fundamental to who we are as a people, whether it is in \nconflict, such as the conflict we are in today, or conflicts that have \nhappened in the past in this Nation.\n  For me, Mr. President, this is not a complex issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. For me, Mr. President, this is not at all a complex \nissue. It is not open to interpretation or to equivocation. I will say \nit again: In my view, waterboarding is torture, it is illegal, and it \nis inhumane. And Judge Mukasey has refused to acknowledge that fact. \nMr. President, I cannot, in good conscience, overlook Judge Mukasey's \nequivocation on torture.\n  Our laws are clear. We need an Attorney General who will enforce \nthose laws, including the laws against torture, no matter what. Mr. \nPresident, I will be voting against Judge Mukasey, and I would urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would ask for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And I thank the Senator from Vermont. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, I will be voting for Judge Mukasey because I think he \nis the solution, not the problem. My good friend from Colorado made a \nvery eloquent statement, and I respect him\n\n[[Page S14175]]\n\ngreatly. This has been a good debate, and it has been long overdue.\n  Where do we go, and how do we get there? What do we want to do to \nfight this war? What is in bounds, what is out of bounds? It is very \ntough, America. We are fighting a vicious enemy, one not in uniform, \nand one that will do anything to wreak havoc on this world; an enemy \nthat would kill a child in a heartbeat and not think about it, in the \nname of God. So we have a real task ahead of ourselves, very difficult, \nand we have a great military.\n  My question for my colleagues is, the fact that our military would do \nthe things that Senator Salazar said, consciously take waterboarding \noff the table, does that make us weaker? I don't think so. I go to bed \nat night feeling pretty good about America when our military lawyers \ncome before the Congress and say: We don't do that. We don't do that.\n  Now, what does our enemy do when they capture one of our soldiers? We \nall know. They are brutal. They are horrible. The fact we don't cut \ntheir heads off, is that a sign of weakness? The fact that we will give \nthem a lawyer when they won't give us one; that we will base our \njudgments on evidence, not revenge and hatred, does that make us \nweaker? No.\n\n  The ticking time bomb is not the scenario of a terrorist who may \npossess some special knowledge. The ticking time bomb is a world that \nis losing its way. There is no shortage of people who will cut your \nhead off in this world. There is a shortage of people who will stand up \nfor a better way. We know what bad people will do to good people. The \nquestion is, what do good people do to bad people?\n  We are good people, and we are struggling. And I think Judge Mukasey \nis part of the solution. He has lived a good life in the law, and he \nhas been asked a question about solving a problem not of his making.\n  If I thought, I say to Senator Salazar, he really believed that \nwaterboarding, at the end of the day, was the legal way to do business, \nI wouldn't vote for him. He is in a bind. He can't answer that \nquestion. But he will one day because I have asked him. And he doesn't \nhave this theory of the law that there is only one branch of Government \nin a time of war that has been pushed by this administration to the \npoint of being absurd.\n  He is a mainstream legal thinker. He answered my question that there \nis no power given to the President, inherent or otherwise, to avoid the \nGeneva Conventions obligations of this country or to set aside the \nMcCain amendment. That was music to my ears. He is bound.\n  The question for us, as we have been a part of the conventions for a \nlong time, and we have led the world for a long time by being different \nfrom our enemy, do we reserve to our Executive in those special \ncircumstances the right to set the conventions aside? You see, we are \nthreatened by someone out there who has no boundaries, a group that has \nno boundaries. So do we reserve to ourselves the ability to treat them \nany way we want to because the means justifies the end?\n  Well, let me tell you what will happen if we go down that road, and \nwhere we will wind up. What will we say to the Chinese Communist \ndictator who waterboards the Christians because they are threatened by \nthe Bible? What do we say to people in China who will torture the \nBuddhist monk because they are threatened by a humble, decent religion? \nWhat do we say in Venezuela? What do we say anywhere in the world when \npeople who feel threatened use horrible tactics simply because they are \nthreatened?\n  This is a good man of the law, Judge Mukasey. Over time, Senators \nSchumer and Feinstein will be shown to have done the country some \ngood--a lot of good. And to those who cannot vote for Judge Mukasey \nbecause he didn't answer this question as directly as you would like, I \nunderstand. But we are about to fix a problem in the Justice Department \nthat needs to be fixed, and we are going to have an honest, good debate \nabout how to win this war.\n  I can tell you right now, the only way we will win this war is not \njust by killing because this is not about how many of them we can kill. \nThat is an endless number. This is not about a capital to conquer, an \nair force to shoot down, or a navy to sink. This is about ideas. Our \nway of living is better than theirs, only if we will have the courage \nand the common sense to embrace it and not be afraid to be good in a \ntime where there is evil.\n  God bless you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 12 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me thank my colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, \nfor yielding, and applaud him for the role he is playing on the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, several weeks ago, I informed the citizens of Vermont \nthat I would be voting against the confirmation of Judge Mukasey to be \nAttorney General, and tonight I am going to, in fact, be casting a \n``no'' vote.\n  Mr. President, there are several reasons I will vote no on Judge \nMukasey. First, like many of my colleagues, I was deeply disturbed by \nhis response to the question of waterboarding. He apparently does not \nknow whether waterboarding is torture. Well, millions of Americans know \nwaterboarding is torture. People all over the world know waterboarding \nis torture. The Geneva Conventions are quite clear about waterboarding \nbeing torture. And, frankly, I don't think it is too much to ask for us \nto have an Attorney General who knows waterboarding is torture. That is \none reason I am voting against Judge Mukasey, but there is a second \nreason, and perhaps maybe an even more important reason.\n  For the last 6 years, it is clear that we have had a President who \ndoes not understand what the Constitution of the United States is \nabout. What this President believes, essentially, is that he can do \nanything he wants, at any time, against anybody in the name of fighting \nterrorism. And he happens to believe the war on terrorism is unending. \nIt is going to go on indefinitely. I think it is very important that we \nhave an Attorney General who can explain the Constitution to a \nPresident who clearly does not understand it. Unfortunately, Mr. \nMukasey is not that person.\n  In the last 6 years under President Bush, we have seen the National \nSecurity Agency start a program which allows wiretapping without first \nobtaining a court order, to my mind, in violation of the Constitution. \nWe have seen personal records that have been extensively mined for \ndata. How many millions? Who knows? Nobody in the Senate really knows. \nWe don't have access to that information. It is massive amounts of data \nmining, in clear violation of the privacy rights and the laws of \nAmerica under this President.\n  We have seen the phenomenon of extraordinary rendition, which has \nshifted detainees to prisons in countries abroad which allow torture. \nWe have seen the firing and the politicization of the Office of the \nU.S. Attorney. We have seen detainees of the United States being denied \nthe oldest right in the Western legal system--the right to habeas \ncorpus. We are running a prison camp in Guantanamo where prisoners have \nminimal legal rights, which is an international embarrassment for us as \nwe struggle against international terrorism. And we have seen many \nother assaults by this President on our constitutional rights and on \nthe laws of this country.\n  We have a President who clearly does not understand the separation of \npowers; that the Congress of the United States is an equal branch of \nour Government; that the Judiciary is an equal branch of our \nGovernment; that the executive branch does not have all of the power.\n  A little while ago I was on a statewide TV program in Vermont. \nSomebody called in and they said: When is Congress going to begin to \nstand up to this President?\n  That is a good question, and I didn't have a good answer. But what I \ncan tell you, the time is long overdue for us to begin to stand up to \nthis President, who thinks he can veto virtually every piece of \nlegislation we send him, who ignores the Constitution of this country--\nI think it is time we begin to stand up.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues say, if we reject Mr. Mukasey, the \nPresident is not going to send us another nominee. That is the right of \nthe President of the United States. But we have our rights as well. We \nhave the right to demand an Attorney General\n\n[[Page S14176]]\n\nwho supports, strongly, the Constitution and is prepared to tell the \nPresident when he is acting against our Constitution. That is our \nright. It is about time we began to defend our right.\n  I can't blame the President for taking over the rights of Congress, \nif Congress is not prepared to stand up and fight back. I think that \ntime is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, if you do not want to send us another nominee, that is \nyour right. We have our rights as well. I will be voting against Mr. \nMukasey. I hope my colleagues do as well.\n  In conclusion, I ask unanimous consent that letters of opposition and \nconcern from the American Civil Liberties Union, the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, and Common Cause be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 2007.\n     Re Nomination of Michael Mukasey for Attorney General\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Specter: The American Civil \n     Liberties Union strongly urges you to oppose moving the \n     nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey for Attorney General out \n     of the Judiciary Committee unless he states that \n     waterboarding and other extreme interrogation tactics are \n     torture, within the meaning of federal law, and commits to \n     the full enforcement of federal laws against torture and \n     abuse. This commitment is important for two reasons: (1) to \n     ensure that the federal government stops, and does not \n     resume, the use of torture and abuse in interrogations; and \n     (2) to have the next attorney general committed to \n     investigating and, if appropriate, prosecuting persons who \n     authorized or committed torture or abuse.\n       Mukasey's unwillingness to answer questions on whether \n     waterboarding and similar practices are torture undermines \n     the rule of law and threatens the security of Americans. In \n     response to questions from members of the Judiciary \n     Committee, Mukasey not only refused to state whether \n     waterboarding is torture when authorized by or committed by \n     the federal government, but he also refused to say whether it \n     is illegal for foreign countries to commit acts such as \n     waterboarding, electric shocks, beatings, head slaps, and \n     induced hypothermia on Americans.\n       Federal law is clear that waterboarding and all other forms \n     of torture and abuse are illegal. The Anti-Torture Act \n     criminalizes the use of torture; the War Crimes Act \n     criminalizes the use of torture and abuse against detainees \n     protected by the Geneva Conventions (which includes alleged \n     Taliban and al-Qaeda detainees); the McCain Amendment of the \n     Detainee Treatment Act reaffirms the prohibition in the U.S.-\n     ratified Convention Against Torture against the use of \n     torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment; the \n     U.S.-ratified Convention Against Torture prohibits all \n     torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment, and \n     general criminal laws such as federal statutes criminalize \n     conduct such as assaults by or against Americans in federal \n     facilities. These laws reflect American values, all in \n     statutes or treaties enacted or ratified under presidents \n     ranging from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush.\n       However, Mukasey refuses to answer the straightforward \n     question of whether waterboarding is torture, and thereby \n     illegal. In a four-page response to ten members of the \n     Committee, Mukasey describes how he would decide the question \n     of whether waterboarding is torture, but he states the \n     question is ``hypothetical'' and that ``the actual facts and \n     circumstances are critical.'' The actual facts and \n     circumstances of waterboarding are brutal, but fairly simple. \n     Several senators described to Mukasey all of the elements of \n     waterboarding, as practiced over the centuries by \n     dictatorships, rogue nations, and war criminals--and as \n     prosecuted by the United States against war criminals. \n     Mukasey has the law, including the Anti-Torture Act and the \n     War Crimes Act, and all of the facts before him. After \n     decades as a Federal prosecutor and Federal judge, Mukasey \n     certainly has the capacity to answer the question of whether \n     waterboarding is torture.\n       In addition to undermining American values, Mukasey's \n     unwillingness to answer the question on whether waterboarding \n     is torture could threaten the security of Americans overseas. \n     In a little-noticed question-and-answer, Senator Kennedy \n     asked Mukasey, ``Do you think it would be lawful for another \n     country to subject an American to waterboarding, induced \n     hypothermia or heat stress, standing naked, the use of dogs, \n     beatings, including head slaps, or electric shocks?'' Mukasey \n     responded with his stock response that he cannot answer \n     hypotheticals, and that ``the actual facts and circumstances \n     are critical.'' This response was to a question on whether it \n     was illegal for a foreign country to shock, beat, and \n     waterboard an American citizen. The response provides no \n     assurance to American servicemen and servicewomen and \n     American intelligence personnel that the United States will \n     demand protection for them against foreign torturers.\n       This line of questioning is not hypothetical. The use of \n     waterboarding and other forms of torture was reportedly \n     discussed and approved based on discussions that occurred at \n     the highest levels of government, including participation by \n     aides to the President and Vice President. The result was \n     authorization of specific forms of torture and abuse, and a \n     permissive climate that fostered even more torture and abuse. \n     Federal Government documents obtained by the ACLU through our \n     Freedom of Information Act litigation and reports of the \n     International Committee of the Red Cross documented torture \n     or abuse against U.S.-held detainees, including acts such as \n     soaking a prisoner's hand in alcohol and setting it on fire, \n     administering electric shocks, subjecting prisoners to \n     repeated sexual abuse and assault, including sodomy with a \n     bottle, raping a juvenile prisoner, kicking and beating \n     prisoners in the head and groin, putting lit cigarettes \n     inside a prisoner's ear, force-feeding a baseball to a \n     prisoner, chaining a prisoner hands-to-feet in a fetal \n     position for 24 hours without food or water or access to a \n     toilet, and breaking a prisoner's shoulders.\n       Mukasey's equivocal responses to these questions on \n     waterboarding and other forms of torture and abuse reveal a \n     more fundamental and troubling problem with his views on the \n     scope of executive power--not only on torture--but on \n     government spying as well. Under the theory of executive \n     power Mukasey espoused, any restrictions on government spying \n     that Congress passes may be meaningless, since Mukasey \n     believes the president has power to engage in domestic \n     wiretapping without a warrant and outside the law. If an \n     Attorney General, whose mission is to enforce the law, \n     believes the President has the power to disregard the law, \n     our constitutional balance of powers is in peril.\n       A forthright answer to a question about torture is so \n     fundamental to restoring the rule of law that the Judiciary \n     Committee should not move Mukasey's nomination out of \n     committee unless he states that waterboarding and other \n     extreme interrogation tactics are torture. American values \n     and American security both depend on his answer.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter, and please do \n     not hesitate to call us if you have any questions regarding \n     this issue.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Caroline Fredrickson,\n                                                         Director.\n     Christopher E. Ander,\n     Legislative Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                 November 5, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: On behalf \n     of the undersigned organizations, we write to express our \n     opposition to the confirmation of Judge Michael B. Mukasey to \n     the office of Attorney General. At his hearing and in his \n     responses to written questions, Judge Mukasey refused to \n     condemn waterboarding as torture, endorsed broad assertions \n     of executive authority, and failed to make firm commitments \n     to the enforcement of civil rights. For these reasons, we are \n     compelled to oppose his nomination.\n       What is urgently needed in our next Attorney General is an \n     unequivocal commitment to thoughtfully and independently \n     uphold the rule of law. However, on human and civil rights \n     issues, it is difficult to distinguish Judge Mukasey's views \n     from the controversial views of this Administration. It seems \n     certain that, after his careful avoidance of making \n     commitments that might be antithetical to the \n     Administration's interests, Judge Mukasey is either unwilling \n     to exercise the independence we need in our next Attorney \n     General on critical issues, or his views align perfectly with \n     those of the President.\n       On the issue of interrogation techniques, Judge Mukasey \n     acknowledged that the law holds that torture is unlawful, but \n     declined to state whether waterboarding is torture. \n     Waterboarding, a technique defined as the use of a wet towel \n     to induce the misperception of drowning, has been declared \n     unlawful by all four current Judge Advocate Generals of our \n     armed services. Judge Mukasey's condemnation of this \n     technique as ``repugnant,'' while true, is inconsequential; \n     what counts is his legal opinion of whether the practice is \n     torture. In spite of the fact that waterboarding is widely \n     classified by military officials and human rights experts as \n     unlawful torture, Judge Mukasey refused to answer this \n     question directly.\n       Judge Mukasey further endorsed a view of executive \n     authority that greatly expands the power of the President at \n     the expense of the other branches of government. Judge \n     Mukasey suggested he would allow the President to engage in \n     warrantless surveillance of persons in the United States in \n     violation of congressional laws. Indeed, he outlined a view \n     of the Constitution that privileged the view of the executive \n     branch over that of Congress on matters of constitutional \n     interpretation, making it possible for the President to \n     disregard the laws of Congress based on the President's \n     constitutional judgment.\n\n[[Page S14177]]\n\n     In fact, under this view, the President's failure to enforce \n     a congressionally-enacted law would prevent the courts from \n     ever having an opportunity to weigh in, making the \n     President the final arbiter of constitutionality of our \n     laws.\n       Finally, with respect to questions regarding how he would \n     improve civil rights enforcement, Judge Mukasey offered \n     platitudes, but no firm commitments. Civil and voting rights \n     enforcement have been low priorities within the Department of \n     Justice, making it especially important that the next \n     Attorney General have a thorough understanding of our civil \n     rights laws and be committed to the vigorous and unbiased \n     enforcement of those laws. Judge Mukasey failed to offer \n     solutions to the extremely low number of cases brought by the \n     Civil Rights Division on behalf of women and minorities in \n     employment discrimination cases. On an issue as central to \n     the civil rights community as voting rights, Judge Mukasey \n     would not commit to the straightforward proposition that a \n     voter identification requirement that disproportionately \n     impacts minorities could violate Section 2 of the Voting \n     Rights Act. His responses to questions concerning civil and \n     voting rights enforcement evidenced little understanding of \n     the problems that currently plague the Civil Rights Division.\n       Nowhere is the Senate's constitutional role in reviewing a \n     presidential cabinet nominee more important than in the case \n     of a prospective Attorney General. Judge Mukasey has failed \n     to deliver on the expectation that he would be willing to \n     challenge this Administration's widely condemned human and \n     civil rights policies. As a result, there is serious doubt \n     about his suitability for the position of Attorney General \n     and about the impact his tenure would have on civil and human \n     rights in this country and elsewhere. Thus, we must urge you \n     to not confirm Judge Mukasey.\n       Thank you for your consideration. If you have any \n     questions, please feel free to contact LCCR Vice President \n     and Director of Public Policy Nancy Zirkin or LCCR Counsel \n     and Policy Analyst Paul Edenfield.\n           Sincerely,\n       Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.\n       AFL-CIO.\n       AFSCME.\n       American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC).\n       Asian American Justice Center.\n       Global Rights: Partners for Justice.\n       Human Rights First.\n       International Union, United Auto Workers.\n       National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n     (NAACP).\n       National Fair Housing Alliance.\n       National Urban League.\n       Open Society Policy Center.\n       People For the American Way.\n       Service Employees International Union (SEIU).\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Common Cause,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 2007.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chair, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Common Cause believes that it would be \n     a serious mistake for the Senate Judiciary Committee to \n     confirm Judge Michael Mukasey's nomination as attorney \n     general to replace Alberto Gonzales.\n       In his nomination hearings before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, Judge Mukasey provided evasive answers to critical \n     questions about whether ``waterboarding'' is torture, \n     feigning ignorance of the well-known procedure and dodging \n     the question when it was defined for him.\n       An attorney general's first job is to protect the rule of \n     law, not to protect a President. We have just seen the damage \n     caused when an attorney general places partisan loyalty above \n     law. The country cannot withstand more of such disregard for \n     the rule of law.\n       As the Committee knows--and now the American public knows \n     too well--waterboarding has been an infamous form of torture \n     dating back as far as the Spanish Inquisition. The United \n     States has both prosecuted waterboarding as a war crime when \n     used against our soldiers and court marshaled a U.S. military \n     officer who used it against our enemies, George Washington \n     University Professor Jonathan Turley wrote last week.\n       Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) stated that in conversations \n     with Judge Mukasey as late as Friday, Judge Mukasey assured \n     him that Congress could pass a law banning waterboarding and \n     other forms of torture and the President would have \n     absolutely no authority to ignore such a law. But, under the \n     Geneva Convention, adopted by the United States as law, it is \n     already against the law to use waterboarding.\n       Judge Mukasey's disingenuous responses about torture shows \n     a contempt for Congress and a disturbing willingness to turn \n     his back on the law when the alternative--acknowledging \n     illegal torture--could have troubling implications for the \n     President who nominated him.\n       This is unacceptable from a nominee to America's top law \n     enforcement position. And it is equally unacceptable for the \n     United States Congress to turn its back on its constitutional \n     duty.\n       Judge Mukasey's non-answers on torture do not stand alone. \n     We are equally concerned about his equivocations on the \n     President's power to conduct a secret program of warrantless \n     wiretapping, despite laws duly enacted by Congress and \n     protections afforded to all Americans by the Constitution.\n       It is the hope of the nation that a new attorney general \n     will be a fresh start for the Justice Department that \n     Gonzales tarnished through his partisanship and left in \n     tatters. That hope cannot be served by a nominee who begins \n     by dissembling over what the law is in order to protect the \n     Administration and the Justice Department from possible \n     unpleasant ramifications even before he has been confirmed. \n     It is difficult to see how such a nominee could repair the \n     integrity and reputation of the Justice Department, heighten \n     sagging morale or stem the exodus of career professionals \n     fleeing that agency.\n       Common Cause believes this is one of the most urgent issues \n     of our day: a President who usurps greater and greater powers \n     without regard for the law or Constitution, and a Congress \n     that stands idly by and lets it happen. Common Cause took a \n     stand when the actions of President Nixon threatened to \n     unravel America's democracy, and we take the same stand now.\n       The American people are watching what you do this week. The \n     whole world is watching. We need you to demand respect for \n     the rule of law, the Constitution, and the role of the United \n     States as a reliable world partner dedicated to international \n     justice. It is up to you to restore voters' confidence in the \n     vitality of America's democracy. And it is up to you to \n     safeguard our troops abroad, who become more vulnerable to \n     torture when we condone it.\n       Common Cause urges you to stand firm and vote against the \n     confirmation of Judge Mukasey as our next attorney general. \n     We urge you to turn the tide on abuse of executive power and \n     show America that they can depend on you to defend the \n     Constitution and the rule of law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Bob Edgar,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, despite the many positive attributes of \nJudge Mukasey, I cannot support his nomination for Attorney General. \nThe next Attorney General must be more than a capable steward of the \nDepartment of Justice. I have heard a lot about that, that he can run \nit well.\n  Given this administration's disdain for the rule of law, it is \nimperative the next Attorney General be a strong and independent voice \nfor a return to the very basic principle that we are a government of \nlaws and not of the King--the President. Regrettably, I do not believe \nJudge Mukasey will be that voice.\n  Over the last 6 years, this administration, supported by faulty legal \nopinions from the Justice Department, has claimed it can ignore acts of \nCongress. The President has argued that, despite the fact that since \n1978 the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has been the law of the \nland, he, the President--he has the authority, he says, despite the \nlaw, to eavesdrop on American citizens without a warrant or judicial \nreview. He, the President, believes--the President, the King--he can \nseize American citizens on American soil, indefinitely detain them \nwithout charges, without providing the accused access to counsel, \nwithout judicial review. He--the President, the King--believes he can \nutilize interrogation techniques long considered immoral, ineffective, \nand illegal, regardless of the laws and treaties Congress has approved.\n  As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote, however, ``[a] state of war is \nnot a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the \nnation's citizens.''\n  At a time when we sorely need an Attorney General who will stand up \nfor the rule of law, Judge Mukasey has expressed a troubling view of \nunchecked Executive power. For example, Judge Mukasey asserted that the \nPresident can violate congressional statutes where the President claims \nbroad authority to ``defend the Nation.'' That is a loophole big enough \nto drive anything through. Judge Mukasey refused to answer whether he \nbelieves American citizens, detained by the President, have the right \nto habeas corpus, a right that goes back to 1215; the Magna Carta, \narticles 38 and 39 of the Magna Carta. You go read it. It says the King \ncan't pick you up and throw you in jail and hold you there unless it is \nsupported by evidence and testimony from your peers. That is the right \nof habeas corpus, enshrined, article I, section 9 of our Constitution. \nMukasey refused to answer whether he believes American citizens have \nthe right to habeas corpus when they are detained by the President.\n  Similar to many of my colleagues--the Senator from Vermont and the\n\n[[Page S14178]]\n\nSenator from Colorado talked about this--I am deeply troubled by the \njudge's failure to assert that waterboarding is illegal, a process that \nsimulates death by real drowning. Everybody is focused on \nwaterboarding. Sadly, he also refused to answer that other terrible \npractices which this administration has used are illegal. These include \nelectrical shocks, beatings, the use of dogs, forcing prisoners to \nstand naked, induced hypothermia. Judge Mukasey doesn't know--he \ndoesn't know whether these are illegal. Imagine that.\n  Let there be no misunderstanding. Whether waterboarding is illegal is \nnot a difficult question. This Senate has repeatedly stated it, going \nback at least to the ratification of the Geneva Convention in 1955, \nthat torture is a violation of our highest values and simply not \npermitted. In 2005, we adopted the McCain amendment, 90 to 9, 90 votes \nto 9. The amendment stated that cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment \nof detainees was prohibited.\n  Last year, the Military Commission Act expressly made clear that the \nPresident is bound by the prohibitions against cruel, inhuman, and \ndegrading treatment of prisoners. Yet Judge Mukasey says he doesn't \nknow. He can't determine whether waterboarding is illegal because he \nhas not seen the evidence. He has not seen the classified material.\n  You don't need classified material. You don't need any classified \nmaterial on this.\n  RADM John Hutson, former Judge Advocate General of the Navy, \ntestified that, ``other than, perhaps the rack and thumbscrews, \nwaterboarding is the most iconic example of torture in history.'' He \nadded, ``[I]t has been repudiated for centuries.'' Going back to the \nSpanish Inquisition and including World War II, the U.S. military has \nbrought charges against those who practice this technique. In adopting \nthe Military Commission Act, many Senators made clear that \ninterrogation techniques such as waterboarding are illegal and \nconstitute ``grave breaches'' of the Geneva Conventions.\n  Given this law, given the history, it is disappointing that an \nesteemed judge, with the highest reputation in our legal community, \nwould not unequivocally state that, of course, waterboarding is both \ntorture and it is illegal. It wasn't a difficult question. It is a \nquestion any serious candidate for Attorney General should answer. \nBecause he could not answer it, he is not qualified to be Attorney \nGeneral.\n  Are we going to have another Attorney General who is going to kowtow \nto the King--the President--I am sorry, I get those terms kind of \nconfused when I am talking about Bush. I don't know whether he is King \nor President. According to the last Attorney General, he was King. \nMaybe this one believes the same thing. He can do whatever he wants to. \nBut even in 1215, the King of England was held to the standard of \nhabeas corpus. I guess we want to turn the clock back to before the \nMagna Carta.\n  I am also troubled by Judge Mukasey's refusal to commit to recommend \nto the President that the detention center at Guantanamo Bay be closed. \nHe said, ``There are substantial problems with Guantanamo, both \nproblems of reality and problems of perceptions.'' If he believes that, \nwhy wouldn't he join with Secretary of Defense Gates and former \nSecretary of State Colin Powell in recommending that it be closed?\n  I have a petition, signed by more than 1,000 people from around the \nUnited States, urging that our next Attorney General be committed to \nclosing down the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                            Text of Petition\n\n       Revelations of human rights abuses at the prison at \n     Guantanamo Bay have damaged America's reputation and impeded \n     our efforts to fight terrorism.\n       By continuing to isolate detainees on Guantanamo Bay \n     without bringing charges against them, we have forfeited our \n     moral leadership and hindered our ability to rally support in \n     our fight against terrorism. Closing this facility is our \n     single best opportunity to rally our allies in a more \n     effective fight against terrorism and reduce the risk to \n     Americans traveling abroad.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, issues such as torture and Guantanamo Bay, \nI have to admit, are somewhat personal to me. It was 20-some years \nago--I am sorry, 37 years ago, now that I think about it, 1970--when I \nwas a congressional staffer on the House side, for a committee that \nwent to Vietnam to investigate our involvement in the war in Vietnam. \nDuring that trip over, through a series of circumstances and because of \nthe bravery of a couple of young people, I was able, with two \nCongressmen--Congressman ``Gus'' Hawkins from California and \nCongressman Bill Anderson from Tennessee--to uncover the infamous tiger \ncages on Con Son Island off the coast of Vietnam.\n  What did we find there? Inhuman, degrading, terrible conditions, \nwhere the Vietnamese had imprisoned civilians--students, human rights \nactivists, along with North Vietnamese POWs--being tortured almost on a \ndaily basis. It would take me more time than I have this evening to be \nable to describe to you the horrors we saw when we broke into this \nprison. It was all done with the full knowledge and consent and \nsupervision of the U.S. Government. That is proven. That is on the \nrecord. It is on the record.\n  I saw the damage that it did, what that did to us. We were always \nsaying to the North Vietnamese: Treat our prisoners according to the \nGeneva Conventions, when our colleague John McCain was there, and \nothers. Yet we were doing the same thing in Vietnam. If you want to go \ninto the court of world opinion, you better go in with clean hands; the \ncourt of equity. What we are doing now in Guantanamo covers all that \nup. It does damage to our reputation. It makes us like them.\n  The one thing we proved in the 1950s when Joseph McCarthy stood on \nthe floor of this Senate--one thing we proved then is we did not have \nto be like the Communists to beat them. We don't have to be like the \nterrorists to beat them. The more we are like them the more likely we \nare to lose. We need an Attorney General of the United States who has \nthe guts to stand before the committee and say he is going to tell the \nKing that the King is wrong, and this Attorney General nominee will not \ndo that.\n  Oh, he may run a good department. Oh, he may do all the right things. \nBut we need an Attorney General to tell this King he is wrong and that \nthe rule of law will apply and the rule of law says we will not \ntorture. We will not treat people with inhumane treatment. We will \nabide by the Geneva Conventions. We will not be like our enemies.\n  That will send a stronger signal to the world than anything else we \ncould do. For those reasons I, in good conscience, cannot in any way \nsupport this nominee for Attorney General.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Connecticut how \nmuch time he would like.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Lieberman, then Senator \nMcConnell, the Republican leader, will speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania. I \nhave spoken before on the Senate floor about the nomination of Judge \nMichael Mukasey to be our next Attorney General. I can be brief.\n  I have listened to my colleagues. I respect what they have said. I \nhave listened to those who have spoken against Judge Mukasey's \nnomination. I am compelled to rise and speak because, with all respect, \nbased on knowing this man for 43 years, I believe people are not \ntreating him fairly who are contemplating voting against him.\n  I respect the opinions that have been stated. But based on this long \nknowledge of this good man, I think he deserves to be confirmed by the \nSenate by a very strong vote. I met Michael\n\n[[Page S14179]]\n\nMukasey when we first arrived together at law school--the same law \nschool, Yale Law School.\n  As I have said on the Senate floor before, the young man I met then--\nsmart, sensible, honorable, good sense of humor--is very much the same \nman who has been nominated by President Bush to be our next Attorney \nGeneral, except, of course, that he is older and wiser and has had \nextraordinary experiences as an attorney in private practice, as a very \nsuccessful assistant U.S. attorney, as a Federal judge respected by all \nwho came before him, and now, in really a twist of fate, having retired \nfrom the bench, gone back to private practice, he comes to the \nattention of President Bush and is nominated as Attorney General.\n  He carries with him all the attributes one would expect and want of \nan Attorney General. I would add this: He is exactly the right person \nto be Attorney General at this moment in our Nation's history, after \nthe travails the Department has been through, the accusations of \nexcessive political interference there, the questions about the \njudgment of the previous Attorney General. I cannot think of a nominee \nfor Attorney General who will be more independent of the President \nnominating him than Michael Mukasey in a long time.\n  Think about it. President Kennedy nominated his brother. President \nCarter nominated Griffin Bell, his attorney and close friend from \nAtlanta. President Reagan nominated his own lawyer, William French \nSmith, to be Attorney General, and so on. President Bush and Michael \nMukasey, as far as I know, did not know each other before his \nconsideration for this position. But he impressed the President based \non his experience, his knowledge, his record; particularly his record \nin dealing with difficult cases regarding terrorism.\n  He has the integrity, the sound legal judgment, and the tremendous \nwork ethic to raise this Department up to where we need it to be, to \nraise the morale of the employees of the Department.\n  If you look at the whole record of his experience, it seems to me, as \nI have listened to my colleagues who are opposing him, they are in \nlarge part expressing their opposition to the administration, to the \njudgments made by the previous Attorney General, and not being fair to \nthis nominee.\n  Judge Michael Mukasey is a man of the law. He is not a man of \npolitics. If he was a man of politics, he would have said waterboarding \nis illegal because he knew that is what many Members of the Senate \nwanted him to say. But he did not believe, as a matter of law, as a man \nof law, that he was justified in saying that.\n  I hope all my colleagues have read Judge Mukasey's response to the \nletter that was sent to him by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nand other members on this question of waterboarding because it tells \nyou who Judge Mukasey is and what kind of Attorney General he will be. \nIt is a reasoned opinion. It is a straightforward opinion. It is an \nopinion based on law.\n  He says waterboarding to him personally is repugnant. He says, he \nopines, as a matter of law, that waterboarding done by employees of the \nDepartment of Defense is illegal. I have not heard that enough in this \ndebate. He says that explicitly in this letter. Why? Because the law \nsays it is illegal.\n  The Detainee Treatment Act refers to the field manual of the \nDepartment of Defense, and that field manual said waterboarding is \nillegal; therefore, Judge Mukasey says waterboarding is illegal.\n  But then he says: I cannot say that for other employees of the \nFederal Government, particularly employees of the intelligence \ncommunity, because there is no law that says that. And I would have to \nhave the evidence of what it is, the previous legal opinions to do so. \nSo he answered as a man of law, not a man of politics.\n  He is extremely well suited to be the Attorney General America needs \nnow. I say this based on long knowledge of this man and his record. He \nought to be confirmed overwhelmingly.\n  I regret that appears not to be what will happen. But I take some \ncomfort from the fact that he will be confirmed. I am confident those \nwho are his detractors today will become his admirers over the next \nyear and a half as he conducts himself as the Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased that today, 7 weeks after \nhe was nominated, the Senate will finally vote on the confirmation of \nJudge Michael Mukasey to be our Nation's 81st Attorney General.\n  Judge Mukasey's nomination is the culmination of a process in which \nthe President was extremely solicitous of the views of the Democratic \nmajority. In fact, it's hard to imagine how he could have been any more \nbipiartisan with respect to this nominee. Just to recap:\n  Our Democratic friends did not want the former Attorney General to \ncontinue in office. Well, he has resigned.\n  Our Democratic colleagues wanted to be consulted on whom the next \nAttorney General should be. Well, the administration consulted \nextensively with them.\n  Our Democratic colleagues said that if the ``President were to \nnominate a'' conservative ``like a Mike Mukasey,'' he ``would get \nthrough the Senate very, very quickly.'' Well, the President did not \nnominate someone ``like'' Mike Mukasey; he nominated Mike Mukasey \nhimself. And the President received widespread acclaim for choosing a \n``consensus'' nominee.\n  So it is apparent that the President acted in a very bipartisan \nfashion. Did our Democratic friends reciprocate? Let's review the \nrecord:\n  First, they held up the nomination for weeks before even scheduling a \nhearing, a failure to act which the Washington Post termed \n``irresponsible.''\n  Then, despite the fact that Judge Mukasey testified for 2 days and \nanswered over 250 questions, our Democratic colleagues asked him an \nadditional 500 written questions. By contrast, Attorney General Reno \ndid not receive any written questions until after she was confirmed.\n  Then it took our Democratic colleagues over 2 weeks to schedule a \nmarkup. Again, by contrast, the Judiciary Committee marked-up Attorney \nGeneral Reno's nomination on the very same day it finished her \nhearings.\n  By the time the Mukasey nomination was marked-up, this ``consensus'' \nnominee had somehow become ``controversial.'' How did this happen? The \nanswer is that Judge Mukasey fell victim to the politicization of the \nconfirmation process, just like another recent nominee who suddenly \nbecame ``controversial.''\n  Both Leslie Southwick and Michael Mukasey were nominated because they \nwere consensus candidates:\n  Judge Southwick previously had been unanimously approved by Democrats \non the Judiciary Committee.\n  And Judge Mukasey had been repeatedly recommended by a Democratic \nmember of that committee, not just for a 15-month stint as Attorney \nGeneral but even for a lifetime position on the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Southwick was suddenly deemed controversial because of two \nopinions out of 7,000. He didn't write either of them and at any rate, \nboth opinions existed when the Judiciary Committee earlier approved him \nto another lifetime Federal judgeship.\n  And Judge Mukasey suddenly became controversial because of one \nquestion out of the 750 oral and written questions he was asked. That \none question was whether waterboarding terrorist killers legally \nconstitutes torture in all applications, regardless of circumstances \nand regardless of how many American lives might hang in the balance.\n  Well-known members of the vast Right Wing Conspiracy, like Professor \nAlan Dershowitz of Harvard Law School and Stuart Taylor of National \nJournal, say the answer to that question is no. But Judge Mukasey \ndidn't say anything even close to that. He was far more reserved.\n  Rather, Judge Mukasey promised to bring his trademark thoughtfulness \nto bear in answering this question, and swore that he would rather \nresign than countenance any illegality. In doing so, Judge Mukasey \nanswered the question the way his Chief Recommender, our friend, the \nsenior Senator of New York, said it ought to be answered, namely, \n``carefully.''\n  Specifically, in 2004, Senator Schumer implored us to be \n``reasonable'' and not get into ``high dudgeon'' about the issue of \ntorture. He noted:\n\n\n[[Page S14180]]\n\n\n       There are probably very few people in this room or in \n     America who would say that torture should never, ever be \n     used, particularly if thousands of lives are at stake.\n\n  Our friend from New York noted that it is easy to ``sit back in the \narmchair'', as he put it, and demagogue the issue. But ``when you're in \nthe foxhole,'' as he described it, ``it's a very different deal.''\n  Senator Schumer said he respected ``the fact that the President is in \nthe foxhole every day. So he can hardly be blamed for asking'' his \nAttorney General or his White House counsel or the Defense Department \n``to figure out when it comes to torture, what the law allows and when \nthe law allows it and what there is permission to do.'' But, our friend \nfrom New York correctly cautioned, the legal analysis has ``to be done \ncarefully.''\n  Judge Mukasey applied just such a careful analysis to this legal \nquestion. And an important part of carefulness, of course, is not to \nprejudge the legality of an intelligence program that one is not read \ninto, and that concerns interrogation techniques that, even if used, \nare classified.\n  But despite the fact that Judge Mukasey answered the question in the \nsame thoughtful manner that our friend from New York noted it demands, \nand despite the fact that Judge Mukasey was much more reserved in his \npronouncements than Professor Dershowitz, this once-consensus candidate \nis now controversial. If my Democrat colleagues vote against Judge \nMukasey because of his comments on waterboarding, it must mean they \nalso would vote against Professor Dershowitz and Senator Schumer if \nthey were nominated for Attorney General.\n  I have a hard time believing that my Democratic colleagues would vote \nagainst Professor Dershowitz's nomination to be Attorney General. And I \nhave an even harder time believing that our colleagues would vote \nagainst Senator Schumer if he were nominated to this position.\n  In conclusion it should not have taken nearly this long to process \nJudge Mukasey's nomination. I am glad that tonight, almost 2 months \nafter he was nominated, the waiting will finally end, and that Judge \nMukasey will soon get to work at the Justice Department, the thing our \nDemocratic colleagues said they wanted all along.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield back the time of the majority except \nfor the statement I am going to give.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is there still time \nreserved to the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, there is.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I don't want to interfere with the majority leader, but I \nam not about to yield back that time, if I might mention for a moment, \nand then I will yield it back so he may speak, I hate to see records \nmade on this floor that bear absolutely no relationship to the facts. \nThe suggestion was made that there was one question on waterboarding \nout of hundreds of questions and that created the problem. Unlike \nSenators who may have spoken that way, I was there. I was there through \nthe whole hearing on the first day. I was there through the whole \nhearing on the second day. I am probably the only Senator, other than \npossibly Senator Specter, who was there for every bit of it. There were \nseveral questions on this issue. In fact, the reason that as chairman I \nhad a second day of hearings is because of some of the questions that \nwere raised on the first day of hearings. I took the transcript and \nread it during that night because of it. There were questions on \nexecutive privilege, but there were questions on waterboarding.\n  Contrary to suggestions which seem to be more for political cover by \nsome who may want to vote one way or the other, we do not need a new \nlaw on waterboarding. President Teddy Roosevelt did not need a law on \nthat to find people had violated our laws 100 years ago. We did not \nneed a new law on the question of waterboarding to prosecute Japanese \nwar criminals for waterboarding Americans. We have not needed it at \nall. It is against the law. We do not need it. None of the military who \nwrite our Uniform Code of Military Justice need a new law to find it \nwrong. None of the Judge Advocate Generals need a new law to find it \nwrong. They have declared it wrong.\n  Our treaties, our other obligations find it wrong. Up until the last \nweek or so of this administration, we would have objected to any other \ncountry using such techniques on Americans as wrong.\n  I understand the White House determines what their nominees want to \nsay. That is fine. I have not lobbied any Senator one way or the other \non this issue. But let us not pretend there was one question out of \nhundreds on waterboarding. There were many questions. Several Senators \nasked questions on this, more on the philosophy of: Is a President \nabove the law? Can the President arbitrarily set people in this country \nabove the laws of America or do the laws that we pass and their \nassignment to law by Presidents, is that a law that applies to every \nsingle American, including the President of the United States? Most of \nus feel the same way we learned in civics 101, that no one in America \nis above the law. That is the issue we raised in the Judiciary \nCommittee. Those who are voting no on this is because they felt a great \ndeal of concern about the answers.\n  Nobody questions Judge Mukasey's legal abilities. I find him a very \nattractive candidate for Attorney General. I do not find the ability to \ncontinue to vote for a myth that somehow the President is above the law \nanymore than those of us who voted to confirm General Petraeus were, as \nthe White House then wanted to say, saying that we believed in \neverything the President was doing in Iraq. Many of us voted against \nthe war in Iraq who then voted for General Petraeus because of his \nability as a four star general. They are entirely different things. The \nsuggestion otherwise, I find beneath the quality of discourse in this \ngreat body. I resent it. I reject it. Let people make up their mind how \nto vote one way or the other, but don't vote on red herrings. Don't \nvote on made-up ideas that we need to pass some law in the future and \nthen, of course, we can be tough. In the future, we will do something \nand then we can be tough. That is sort of like saying: Gosh, if we had \nknown we weren't being told the truth, we might have voted differently \non Iraq. If we knew that waterboarding was bad, we might have voted \ndifferently.\n  Vote one way or the other. I will not question the motives of any \nSenator, no matter how they vote, either for or against this nominee. \nBut let's not do it on a hypocritical pretext that the President is \nabove the law when he is not or that the President can put any American \nabove the law because he cannot. Let us not pretend that torture is not \ntorture because it is, and it is beneath the great ideals of the most \nwonderful Nation on Earth.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada and yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the hearing in this matter on Judge Mukasey \nwas good. The Judiciary Committee, with Senators Leahy and Specter, did \na good job, a full airing of this man's qualifications and ideas were \npresent before the American people and the Senate. The debate that has \ntranspired today dealing with Michael Mukasey has been extremely good. \nIt has been good for the process. It is good for the American people to \nunderstand that the chief law enforcement officer of this country has \nhad a fair hearing and a good debate in the Senate.\n  I will vote against the nomination of Michael Mukasey for Attorney \nGeneral. My historical analysis is different than that of my good \nfriend, the senior Senator from Kentucky, much different. It is \nregrettable that I must vote no. When the President first nominated \nMichael Mukasey, I was fully prepared to support him. That is the \nhistory I remember.\n  Judge Mukasey has a stellar reputation for integrity and judicial \nexcellence throughout his decades of Government service. He has an \nexcellent academic background. I was pleased to see that after the \nGonzales debacle and with the Justice Department in shambles, the \nPresident finally relented to pressure from Senate Democrats to look \nbeyond his inner circle at this most important appointment.\n\n[[Page S14181]]\n\n  I considered it significant that an administration that has shown \nsuch contempt for the other two branches of Government, particularly \njudges, would turn to a candidate who served in the judicial branch for \nso many years. So like many Democrats, I was predisposed to support \nthis nomination. In fact, I was prepared to embrace this nomination. I, \ntoo, met with Judge Mukasey and told him I was impressed with his \ncredentials and his background and I hoped the hearing went well.\n\n  Well, the hearing didn't go well, from my perspective. During this \nconfirmation process, Judge Mukasey expressed views about Executive \npower that I and many other Senators found deeply disturbing. I was \noutraged by his evasive hair-splitting approach to questions about the \nlegality of waterboarding. After his initial comments, Judge Mukasey \nwas given every opportunity to address these concerns. But he was \nunable to state clearly that waterboarding is torture and, therefore, \nillegal under U.S. law. This is not a difficult or complex legal \nquestion. It does not require high-level security briefings.\n  I agree with former Navy General Counsel Alberto Mora and former \nAssistant Secretary of State John Shattuck who wrote in an op-ed this \nweek:\n\n       The question of whether waterboarding constitutes torture \n     is a no-brainer.\n\n  Why is it a no-brainer? My friend, former Nevadan and now a long-time \nFederal Judge Evan Wallach, a former decorated Vietnam combat veteran \nwho came back from military service in the first Gulf War and is now a \nleading expert on the law of war, wrote in a recent Washington Post \narticle--in fact, it was last Sunday on the front page of the opinion \nsection--\n\n       The media usually characterize the practice as ``simulated \n     drowning'' [but] that's incorrect. To be effective, \n     waterboarding is usually real drowning that simulates death.\n\n  The only difference between actual drowning and waterboarding is that \nthe waterboarding process is halted before death. Victims inhale water, \nsuffocate, and often pass out. Who could reasonably argue this is \nanything other than torture?\n  Judge Wallach further points out, in a related law review article in \nthe Columbia Law Review, that even under the extreme and now disavowed \nlegal theories of former Justice Department officials such as John Yoo, \nwaterboarding still constitutes torture.\n  ``Can there be any question,'' Judge Wallach asks, ``that water \ntorture, the repetitive artificial drowning and revival of another \nhuman being, falls within their memo's parameters?'' No. There can be \nno question at all.\n  Notwithstanding the novel legal theories of the Bush administration, \nwhose approval rating as we speak is 23 percent--and we wonder why--it \nhas long been settled law in this Nation and around the world that \nwaterboarding is torture and it is illegal. Civil and military courts \nin the United States have rejected waterboarding, as Senator Leahy has \nsaid more than once today, for more than 100 years, whether directed at \nor committed by Americans.\n  U.S. soldiers were court-martialed for using water torture to \nquestion Filipino guerrillas during U.S. occupation of the Philippines \nafter the 1898 Spanish-American war. After World War II, the United \nStates prosecuted and convicted Japanese soldiers for waterboarding \nAmerican allied prisoners of war. During the 1980s, a Texas sheriff was \nsentenced to 10 years in prison for using waterboarding to force \nconfessions of prisoners. So this is not a new debate, nor an unsettled \nquestion.\n  Judge Mukasey doesn't need a classified briefing from the Bush White \nHouse to answer the question, is waterboarding torture. He has more \nthan 100 years of established American law on which to base his \nposition. His position was evasive without any question, misleading. \nThat is why it is so disturbing that for all his impressive years on \nthe bench, Judge Mukasey could not give a simple straightforward answer \nto the question posed by members of the Judiciary Committee, Democrats \nand Republicans. His lengthy nonresponsive answer was wrong. This was a \nquestion that demanded brevity and certainty, not lawyerly semantics.\n  My Republican colleagues, John McCain, Lindsey Graham and John \nWarner, who served as leaders in the Senate on this issue, recently \nissued a detailed legal analysis that concluded waterboarding \n``represents a clear violation of the U.S. law.''\n  For purposes of this debate, let's give a little added credence to a \nman who served 7 years in a Vietnamese prison camp and was tortured \nmore than half the time he was there--the rest of the time was in \nsolitary confinement--John McCain. Let's give that a little more \nfoundation.\n  Former and sitting Judge Advocate Generals agree. On Friday in a \nletter to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, several prominent \nformer Judge Advocate Generals declared unequivocally:\n\n       Waterboarding is inhumane, it is torture, and it is illegal \n     . . . Waterboarding detainees amounts to illegal torture in \n     all circumstances.\n\n  I could continue at length quoting military and civilian experts who \nall agree the answer to this question is settled. And it is settled. \nBut why is this issue of waterboarding so critical for the chief law \nenforcement officer of our country, the U.S. Attorney General? \nTremendous damage has been done to the moral credibility of our great \ncountry, both in the eyes of our allies and of our enemies abroad, by \nthe widespread belief that our country, the United States, has used \nwaterboarding and other abusive interrogation techniques. The United \nStates of America has done that? All over the world now they know it.\n\n  As a result, our allies have at times refused to cooperate with us in \nthe fight against terrorism, under constraints from their own laws and \npublic opinion at home.\n  Even if the Bush administration is no longer utilizing \nwaterboarding--which I do not know now--the President's refusal to \npublicly disavow it gives license to our enemies abroad to use it. This \nputs our troops and any citizen who may fall into our enemies' hands at \nrisk and serves as an ongoing recruiting tool for militant extremists.\n  How do these evil people, who are trying to do damage to this \ncountry--how are they using the fact that America tortures people they \nwant to get information from? How is this a recruiting tool for these \nbad people? A pretty good one, I would think.\n  President Bush claims we must not disclose our techniques to the \nenemy. But I contend we should shout from the hills and the rooftops \nfor all to hear, that no matter how hateful the actions of our enemies, \nwe will never relinquish our most treasured commitment to human rights.\n  That is America, Mr. President--not water torture, not thumb screws, \nnot the rack.\n  We should make it clear to all the world that no matter what our \nenemies do, our core American values cannot be shaken. We are a \nconstitutional form of government. We deserve an Attorney General who \nwill uphold this message to the world.\n  Judge Mukasey's answer to the waterboarding question was important in \nitself, but it also raised for me serious doubts about whether he is \nprepared to be the truly independent voice that the Justice Department, \nwhich is now in shambles, so desperately needs. If he cannot stand up \nto the President on such a question of profound importance and \nsimplicity with a clear legal answer, how can we be sure he would be \nmore than just another mouthpiece for an administration that treasures \nsecrecy and loyalty above all?\n  I respect Judge Mukasey's long career in public service. I have said \nthat before. We have met in person. I have said that before. And there \nis no question he is an intelligent man. In the past, he has been very \ncapable.\n  If he is confirmed, the eyes of every American will be on him as he \nfaces the unenviable task of depoliticizing the Department of Justice \nand restoring the integrity that was so lacking under his predecessor, \nAlberto Gonzales. He will have my earnest support in that challenge.\n  But in light of his responses during and following his confirmation \nhearings, I cannot stand by him today with my words or my vote.\n  One day, Mr. President, historians will expend countless reams of \npaper and barrels of ink writing the story of the Bush-Cheney \nadministration's extremism in support of its never-ending\n\n[[Page S14182]]\n\nquest to expand the reach of their Executive power. There is no \nquestion that this time will be remembered as a dark chapter in \nAmerica's otherwise steady march toward justice.\n  But for now, all we can do is honor the trust and authority given to \nus as individual Senators by the American people and do what we, as \nSenators, can to turn the page to a brighter day because it needs to be \nturned.\n  What we can do today is reject this nomination. The next Attorney \nGeneral must be able to stand up to the President and stand up for the \nrule of law.\n  If confirmed, I hope Judge Mukasey is up to that challenge. But \nbecause he has not given me confidence of his independence, I will vote \nagainst confirmation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the nomination of Mike \nMukasey to be Attorney General of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I wish to discuss my opposition to two \nbills reported by the Veterans' Affairs Committee, but I continue to \nhope we can resolve the concerns I will address today.\n  Unanimous consent has been sought to pass two controversial bills: S. \n1233,\n\n[[Page S14183]]\n\nthe Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury and Health Programs Improvement \nAct, and S. 1315, the Veterans Benefits Enhancement Act. Although both \nbills are well-intended, they contain unacceptable provisions that I \nbelieve would be detrimental to the care our returning wounded warriors \ndeserve and currently receive at VA facilities. At the very least, \nthese provisions are controversial enough to merit considerable floor \ndebate, and therefore I have no alternative but to oppose the unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  In the past, the Veterans' Affairs Committee has worked in a \nbipartisan fashion to settle differences at the committee level and \navoid taking up Senate floor time to debate and amend significant \nveterans legislation. Unfortunately, that is not the case with S. 1233 \nand S. 1315. Even so, I do not want to close the door on these bills \nbecause each has numerous provisions that I support or have sponsored \nin the past. Both bills contain provisions to enhance the care our \nveterans receive, and I believe that if we can return to the \nnegotiating table, we can find an acceptable solution to both my \nconcerns and the concerns of my colleagues.\n  I would like to address these two bills separately because they \nclearly raise different issues. S. 1315, the Veterans Benefits \nEnhancement Act, contains a number of important provisions that will \nenhance benefits and services for America's combat veterans returning \nfrom the war in Iraq and the global war on terror and for all veterans \nwith service-connected disabilities.\n  Among those provisions that I believe are important and responsible \nfor us to provide our veterans are retroactive payments under the \ntraumatic injury protection program of Servicemembers' Group Life \nInsurance for those injured outside of Operation Iraqi Freedom or \nOperation Enduring Freedom theaters of operation between October 7, \n2001, and December 1, 2005. This will ensure that soldiers injured on \ntheir way to fight in OIF or OEF, but not in the theater of combat, are \neligible for these benefits.\n  Other provisions in this bill will expand the housing grant \nassistance program available to those with severe burn injuries--\ninjuries that are a sad and terrible reality of our current conflict. \nWe must continue to adapt and modify the benefits our veterans receive \nbased on the changing environment in which our soldiers fight; these \nprovisions are a great example of our ability to do so.\n  However, there is a section within this bill that I vigorously \noppose. In fact, this provision is the sole reason for my unwillingness \nto support the bill, and I would like to explain it here today. \nIncluded in S. 1315 is a section that would expand benefits to certain \nFilipino veterans residing both in the United States and abroad. I have \nsupported, and continue to support, improving benefits for Filipino \nveterans who fought under U.S. command during World War II. However, I \nbelieve that the approach taken in this section with respect to special \npension benefits for non-U.S. citizens and non-U.S. resident Filipino \nveterans and surviving spouses goes beyond the intent of veterans \nbenefits. Further, I do not believe such a provision would have the \nsupport of the American people.\n\n  Let me explain.\n  Pension benefits for veterans in the United States are paid at a \nmaximum annual rate of $10,929 for those with no dependents, $14,313 \nfor those with dependents, and $7,329 for a surviving spouse. The \nmaximum VA pension represents somewhere between 16 percent and 31 \npercent of the annual U.S. household income of $46,000. Contrast that \nwith the average Philippines household income of $2,800. The special \npension for Filipino veterans in S. 1315 would amount to an astounding \n86 percent to 161 percent of the Philippines household income.\n  This legislation did not take into account the vast discrepancy \nbetween the standard of living in the United States and the \nPhilippines. By refusing to look at the purchasing power of the \nbenefits being provided here, this legislation would pay veterans in \nthe Philippines far more in benefits and pension than we pay our own \nveterans. It is especially ironic that a bill intending to treat \nFilipino veterans equitably would create such a dramatic inequity for \nour U.S. veterans.\n  Furthermore, the offset that S. 1315 uses to ensure that the bill is \nin compliance with congressional budget rules would have the effect of \nreducing pension amounts to elderly, poor, and disabled veterans \npredominantly residing in the United States. I acknowledge there is \nconsiderable agreement that these extra payments for certain categories \nof veterans were never contemplated by Congress and, therefore, are not \njustified. However, if presented with the choice of using the savings \nfrom eliminating these payments to provide extra pension assistance to \nlow-income veterans in the United States or to underwrite the kind of \nspecial benefit I described earlier, I believe the American people \nwould choose to take care of our own veterans' pensions first--and when \nproviding benefits to the Filipino veterans, they would insist that \nthose benefits are adjusted to reflect the real differences in costs of \nliving between our two countries.\n  The other bill I would like to address today is S. 1233, the Veterans \nTraumatic Brain Injury and Health Programs Improvement Act. I was \noriginally a cosponsor of this legislation and would very much like to \nsee it move forward and be signed into law. However, there are a few \nprovisions that are premature, considering the current capacity of our \nVA medical facilities, and I hope my colleagues will agree these \nprovisions should be deferred to a later date.\n  The provisions I must regrettably oppose at this time are the \nproposed admittance of Priority 8 and Priority 4 veterans into the VA \nhealth system. To ensure VA can meet our Nation's obligation to \nveterans with combat or military-related disabilities, lower income \nveterans, and those needing specialized care like veterans who are \nblind or have spinal cord injuries--to ensure appropriate care for \nthese veterans, former VA Secretary Anthony Principi suspended \nadditional enrollments for veterans with the lowest statutory priority. \nThis category includes veterans who are not being compensated for a \nmilitary-related disability and who have higher incomes.\n  It has become very clear, especially over the last few years, that \nservicemembers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are enduring lengthy \nwaiting times for care. In the face of such assessments, I do not \nunderstand why we should be in a rush to open up the health care system \nto hundreds of thousands--if not millions--of new patients who by \ndefinition are not in need of immediate assistance or can afford \nprivate health care.\n  Moreover, it appears that the provision in this bill would open VA to \nnew enrollees on the day the legislation is signed into law. Yet no \nplan is required to ensure that the enrollment process would be orderly \nand executed so as to minimize impacts on current patients, nor is \nthere any requirement that the necessary funding be available prior to \nits implementation. Instead, VA would simply open the doors and wait to \nsee who arrives. I believe that is irresponsible and unfair to the \ncurrent enrollees who are in most need of care.\n  We should forgo opening up the VA health care system until such a \ntime as the Secretary of the VA can certify that troops returning from \nIraq and Afghanistan are being provided timely, high-quality health \ncare and neither timeliness nor quality would suffer because of newer \nenrollees, such as Priority 8 veterans. VA's health care system was \ncreated primarily to care for ``he who shall have borne the battle.'' \nCongress should ensure that this unique group of veterans is not unduly \nburdened by any new influx of higher income veterans with no military-\nrelated disabilities.\n  Some Senators may contend that money can overcome any obstacle to \nproviding all veterans with health care through VA. However, since any \nmoney provided for new patients would be used to acquire new staff, new \nequipment, and new space, it is important to know if those resources \nare even available.\n  Let's first consider where VA will find the new staff needed to care \nfor the huge influx of patients this legislation proposes. It is widely \nknown that our Nation has a shortage of primary care physicians and \nnurses to provide basic health care services in non-VA facilities. This \nissue was made clear in a July 2007 report from the Health Research \nInstitute of Pricewater-\n\n[[Page S14184]]\n\nhouseCoopers which showed that the United States will be short nearly 1 \nmillion nurses and 24,000 physicians by 2020. In this environment, \nsimply finding new staff to hire will be a challenge for any health \ncare system, including VA.\n  Further, assuming the requisite staff can be found, I am skeptical \nthat VA has the necessary clinical space in which to provide more \nprimary and specialty care services. I am also skeptical that many VA \nfacilities could open the additional operating rooms, postsurgical \nrecovery units, and intensive care units that would be required with a \nlarge increase in patients.\n  Last, the Congressional Budget Office has scored this legislation at \n$1.3 billion for the first year of inclusion of just Priority 8s into \nthe system, or $8.8 billion from 2008 to 2012. However, it must be \nnoted that CBO assumed Priority 8s would only be allowed to enroll in \nthe system for 1 year, after which enrollment would be closed. Based on \npast experience, it is highly unlikely that Congress will maintain such \na 1-year limit and virtually certain the costs would continue to rise \nabove and beyond what CBO projected for implementation of this \nlegislation.\n  When the VA health care system can support a substantial increase in \npatients, I will be more than happy to address this issue with my \ncolleagues. However, at this point, when even our returning wounded \nwarriors are forced to sit in long waiting lines to receive care, it \nwould be grossly irresponsible for us to move forward with this \nlegislation, and I must therefore continue to object to its passage.\n  The underlying legislation also contains a provision waiving required \ninpatient care copayments for Priority 4 veterans with higher incomes. \nI have concerns with this provision as well.\n  The passage of this provision would change VA's policy of charging a \ncopayment for the care of a nonservice-connected condition, to allow an \nexception for circumstances that have nothing to do with a veteran's \nability to pay. A grateful Nation has seen fit to provide cost-free \ncare for service-connected conditions and has generously extended the \nsame benefit to those with limited financial resources. However, with \nthis provision, it would no longer be relevant whether veterans could \nafford to contribute even modestly to the cost of their care. Rather, \ncost-free care would be provided to a population of patients based \nsolely on a particular health condition. That is a bad precedent.\n  If this legislation passes, I believe that in the not too distant \nfuture, it will be strongly argued by higher income, service-connected \nveterans that their benefit--cost-free care for service-connected \nconditions--has been diluted. And the dilution is not fair because now \nthey would be charged for nonservice-connected care, while those with \nsimilar economic means in Priority 4 would not be forced to make \ncopayments for the same type of care. With this provision as precedent, \na future Congress will be forced to concede to the dilution and its \nunfairness. Then they will probably be forced to accede to the change.\n  All that being said, I would like to make sure that my colleagues \nunderstand that while I am objecting to passage of these bills in their \ncurrent form, I sincerely hope and believe that accommodations can be \nmade so that we can pass these bills and get much needed improvements \nmade to the VA health care and benefits systems. Both bills have very \nmeaningful and well-intentioned provisions that I support; \nunfortunately, there are a few provisions that I believe are \ndetrimental or simply unfair to our Nation's veterans, and for that \nreason I am here on the floor of the Senate explaining my reasons for \nobjecting to passage of these bills.\n  I look forward to discussing with my colleagues ways that we can move \nthese bills and reach a compromise that benefits our brave veterans.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, 89 years ago this Sunday, the guns fell \nsilent in Europe. It was the end of a global conflict so savage that \nmany people doubted anyone would ever want to start a war again. New \ntechnologies had clashed with old ways of fighting to create new \nhorrors and apocalyptic battles like the Somme, which tested not only \nthe limits of armies but our powers of comprehension.\n  America had no role in starting the war, but we played a decisive one \nin ending it. Our Doughboys earned the gratitude of entire nations. \nThey gave their countrymen a new sense of purpose. And America would \nalways remember Armistice Day, as President Wilson said, with ``solemn \npride in the heroism of those who died in the country's service and \nwith gratitude for the victory. . . . .''\n  As we all know, the War to End All Wars did not live up to its name. \nJust 11 years after it ended, a former corporal from the German Army \nwho had fought on the Western Front was already building a regime that \nwould bring new horrors. At the end of World War I, museums were \ndedicated to the memory of war. But soon enough even ``Big Willie,'' \nthe first tank, was being rolled out of one of those museums and \nconverted into shells and shrapnel for another terrible war.\n  And again, the world would turn to America for help. More than 16 \nmillion U.S. servicemen would be called upon to defend the cause of \nfreedom against tyranny and terror in World War II--young men like 2LT \nDan Inouye Honolulu and a 19-year-old surfer from Manhattan Beach, CA, \nnamed Ted Stevens.\n  It has been noted that when American servicemen came home from World \nWar II, no one said, ``We Won!'' They said ``It's over!'' Because, as \nPresident Roosevelt once observed, ``The primary purpose of the United \nStates of America is to avoid being drawn into war.'' When called, our \nyoung men and women have served. But when the fight is over, they just \nwant to go home.\n  And World War II was like that. Everybody just picked up where they \nleft off, stepped right back into the assembly line, or the office, or \nthe baseball diamond, or the boxing ring. These are the humble heroes \nof our country, the only aristocrats in a democracy--men and women who \nrisk their lives so we can live in freedom and peace. And who ask \nnothing in return but to return to their hometowns and to carry on as \nthey please.\n  And so it is up to us to speak well of them, to honor them in special \nceremonies and songs and in this annual day of remembrance that for the \nlast 53 years we have referred to simply as Veterans Day. Since 1954, \nAmericans have paused on November 11 not just to remember the men who \nfought in the Great War those who fought in all our wars: from Valley \nForge to Antietam, from the beaches of France to the jungles of \nVietnam--paused to remember and to thank them for what they have done \nfor us and for the ``millions not yet born'' whose freedom will rest on \ntheir sacrifice.\n  We also remember this Veterans Day those who will soon be called \nveterans, the men and women in Afghanistan and Iraq who are have \nvolunteered to protect us in this new era from new horrors and the many \nmen and women who have died in this struggle for freedom--people like \nSGT William Bowling, of Beattyville, KY, a shy but proud husband and \nfather who was killed earlier this year by a roadside bomb while \npatrolling the streets of Baghdad.\n  Like so many before him, Sergeant Bowling threw himself into his \nmission. ``This is the job he wanted to do,'' his wife Jennifer said \nshortly after his death. ``He wanted to serve his country.''\n  By his courage and devotion to duty and the cause of freedom, \nSergeant Bowling showed the best that Kentucky and this country have to \noffer.\n\n[[Page S14185]]\n\nAnd he reminds all of us what makes this country great: young men and \nwomen who believe that serving others is greater than serving self, and \nwho have proved it in every generation since Yorktown by making the \nsacrifices freedom too often demands.\n  There is no greater service to our great Nation than the one Sergeant \nBowling gave on a dusty road in Baghdad. And there is no greater hope \nfor humanity than men and women like him. They come from places like \nHonolulu and Manhattan Beach. They come from places like Beattyville.\n  And we pray to God that they continue to come.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President. I would like to take a moment to \ncommemorate Veterans Day and honor all those who have served, fought, \nand sacrificed for our country and the freedom all Americans enjoy.\n  We as a nation should never forget the debt we owe to the generations \nof Americans who have served as soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. \nFrom the First and Second World Wars, to Korea, Vietnam, and the \nPersian Gulf war, millions of Americans have answered the call of duty \nto preserve the freedom we all hold so dear. This is also true for our \nservice men and women who are right now doing an amazing job in Iraq \nand the war on terror and throughout the world.\n  Sadly, many Americans have paid the ultimate price and have given \ntheir lives for our country. No praise can be too great for the \ncourage, valor, and patriotism of these men and women, and their \nsacrifice will never be forgotten.\n  I think it is also important to remember the service of veterans to \nour country has never ended with their departure from the Armed Forces. \nThey have enriched every community in which they reside with their \nstrength of character, hard work, and devotion to family. For this we \nmust also be grateful.\n  On this Veterans Day, I hope New Mexicans will honor all the veterans \nof our great Nation, but I would like them to think particularly about \nour service men and women who are right this moment in harm's way. \nThey, like all veterans, have left behind the comfort of home, family, \nand friends to defend our country and its countless blessings. For \nthis, many have paid an immense price, emotionally and physically. I \nknow our thoughts and prayers are with these outstanding individuals.\n  Again, I would like to thank all those who have served past and \npresent to preserve and protect our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/08/senate-section/article/S14185-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14185-S14186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the Judiciary Committee reported \nFederal reporters' shield legislation to the floor on October 23, I \ncalled on the full Senate to promptly consider and pass this important \nlegislation. The Senate version of the Free Flow of Information Act, S. \n2035, is bipartisan legislation that was favorably reported by the \nJudiciary Committee on a strong bipartisan vote. The House has already \npassed legislation on this same subject, H.R. 2102, with a strong, \nbipartisan and veto-proof majority of 398 to 21.\n  Both of these bipartisan bills are available and waiting for Senate \naction, and I believe that there are well over 60 votes in favor of \npassing a shield bill in the Senate. I strongly support the enactment \nof a Federal shield law for journalists, and I urge the Senate to \npromptly consider and pass Federal shield legislation.\n  All of us have an interest in enacting a balanced and meaningful \nfirst amendment privilege. According to a newly released study by \nPrivacy International--a privacy, civil liberties and human rights \nwatchdog organization, the United States is one of just a few \nestablished democracies around the world that does not have a law to \nprotect journalists from being forced to reveal confidential sources. \nIn fact, according to that study, approximately 100 countries have \nadopted laws that allow journalists to honor their promise of \nconfidentiality.\n  Sadly, the press has become the first stop, rather than the last \nresort, for our government and private litigants when it comes to \nseeking information. This is a dangerous trend that can have a chilling \neffect on the press and the public's right to know.\n  Enacting Federal shield legislation would help to reverse this \ntroubling trend. In fact, proceeding promptly to consideration of this \nlegislation is something I strongly support. Should the Senate take up \nthe bipartisan shield bill that overwhelmingly passed in the House, \nfederal shield legislation could go immediately to the President's desk \nand be signed into law without delay this year.\n  The Senate bill has the support of a bipartisan coalition of \nSenators, including Senators Specter, Schumer, Lugar, Dodd, Graham, and \nmyself, who have all united to cosponsor this legislation. In addition, \nmore than 50 news media and journalism organizations support this \nlegislation and the call for Senate action on this historic bill \nextends to editorial pages across the country, including The New York \nTimes, Arizona Republic, L. A. Times, Salt Lake Tribune, and San \nFrancisco Chronicle, among others.\n  The Senate and House bills protect law enforcement interests and \nsafeguard national security. Moreover, both of these bills follow the \nlead of 33 States and the District of Columbia which have shield laws, \nand many other States, including Vermont, which recognize a common law \nreporters' privilege. Tellingly, the Bush administration has not \nidentified a single circumstance where a reporters' privilege has \ncaused harm to national security or to law enforcement, despite the \nfact that many courts have recognized such a privilege for years.\n  Given the overwhelming need and support for a federal shield law to \nprotect the public's right to know, I urge the Senate to promptly \nconsider and pass a Federal shield bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a support letter from the \nMedia Coalition Supporting the Free Flow of Information Act, which is \nsigned by 67 different news organizations, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Media Coalition Supporting the\n\n\n                                 Free Flow of Information Act,\n\n                                                 November 6, 2007.\n     Re S. 2035 and H.R. 2102, the Free Flow of Information Act\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the men and women across the \n     nation who work to bring the American people vital news and \n     information, we, the undersigned media companies and \n     organizations, urge you to support expeditious Senate passage \n     of the Free Flow of Information Act, legislation that is \n     vitally important to the national interest. Protecting \n     confidential sources through federal legislation has broad \n     support on both sides of the aisle, in both houses of \n     Congress, and from state attorneys general across the nation. \n     Your support is essential to ensure that the American people \n     have access to information about their government and the \n     institutions that affect their daily lives.\n       Democrats and Republicans have united to provide \n     overwhelming support for this legislation. The Senate \n     Judiciary Committee reported S. 2035 by a 15-4 vote on \n     October 4, and the House passed H.R. 2102 by a 398-21 vote on \n     October 16. Both versions of the Free Flow of Information Act \n     are available for immediate floor action on the Senate \n     Business Calendar. As the strength of these votes suggests, \n     Senators and House Members from opposite ends of the \n     political spectrum have joined together to support the \n     public's right to have essential information and to protect \n     whistleblowers who are sometimes the only way the public can \n     get this information.\n       While the Free Flow of Information Act will protect \n     confidential sources by establishing a uniform standard for \n     obtaining information from reporters in federal court \n     proceedings, it is important to note that both versions of \n     the legislation have been amended to ensure that national \n     security is also protected. While many state laws provide for \n     a more absolute privilege, both versions of this legislation \n     are limited to a qualified privilege with exceptions for acts \n     of terrorism or other significant harm to national security.\n       With 49 states and the District of Columbia having either \n     common law or codified protection for confidential sources, \n     there is a growing (bipartisan) acknowledgement that \n     enactment of a federal law is imperative. In a recent brief \n     filed with the United States Supreme Court, a group of 34 \n     state attorneys general pointed out that lack of a clear \n     standard of federal protection undermines state law. These \n     state laws have worked successfully for many years, defining \n     those covered by the law and the limits of that coverage. At \n     the same time, they have protected the public's right to \n     information while still allowing these states to investigate \n     crimes and protect public safety.\n       News organizations prefer to have their sources on the \n     record whenever possible. However, history is replete with \n     examples of news articles critical to the national interest \n     that would have never been written had it not been for the \n     protection of confidential sources. As many of your \n     colleagues have\n\n[[Page S14186]]\n\n     stressed and state legislatures have recognized, the time is \n     now for the protection of confidential sources, and the \n     safeguarding of the public's right to know. This issue is too \n     important to remain unresolved as the year and the \n     congressional session draw to a close. We urge you to press \n     for immediate and favorable Senate floor consideration of the \n     Free Flow of Information Act.

Mr. President, if Congress does not act soon, Medicare \npayments to physicians and health care professionals will be cut by 10 \npercent on January 1, 2008 as a result of the fatally flawed \nsustainable growth rate formula.\n  This does not make any sense. While costs continue to increase, \nphysicians will actually be paid less than they are paid today.\n  While a 10 percent cut in 2008 is completely indefensible, it does \nnot end there. When combined with the additional cuts required under \ncurrent law through 2016, physician payment rates will be reduced by \napproximately 40 percent.\n  What will be the result? Doctors will decrease the number of Medicare \npatients they accept, defer purchase of health information technology, \nand rural outreach services will be discontinued. The Medicare Program, \nwhich for more than 40 years has lifted countless seniors out of \npoverty, and has ensured access to necessary, affordable, quality \nmedical care for our most vulnerable citizens, would be destabilized. \nThe health of the nearly 42 million Americans who rely on Medicare \nwould be threatened.\n  Physicians are the foundation of the Medicare Program and our \nNation's health care system and patients of all ages depend upon them \nfor health care services. Every aspect of our health care system, from \nhospitals to rural health clinics, relies upon the skills and services \nof physicians. Yet, on average, physician payments in 2007 are below \nwhat they were in 2001.\n  It defies common sense to think that payment rates that are lower \ntoday than they were 6 years ago will be enough to maintain the access \nto care our seniors need. Very simply put, the projected 2008--and \nbeyond--payment cuts will place beneficiary's access to health care at \nrisk.\n  I am proud of the work that over 20,000 M.D.s and D.O.s in Michigan \ndo, providing more than 1.4 million seniors and people with \ndisabilities in Michigan with high-quality medical services under the \nMedicare Program.\n  I want them to be able to continue to do that, but there is simply no \nway that can be expected unless we do something now about the payment \nsystem used to reimburse physicians for Medicare services.\n  Physicians in Michigan will lose $670 million for the care of elderly \nand disabled patients over the next 2 years due to the 10 percent cut \nin Medicare payments for 2008 and the additional 5 percent cut in 2009. \nMy physicians are looking at cuts of more than $10 billion by 2016 as a \nresult of the SGR formula and 9 years of cuts.\n  We certainly cannot expect that physicians can continue to provide \nthe same level of care while their payments are cut $670 million over \nthe next 2 years alone.\n  Several studies and surveys have shown that payment cuts will result \nin physicians modifying their participation in the Medicare Program and \nlimiting the number of new Medicare patients they treat.\n  We also know from the studies that the lack of a predictable and \nequitable Medicare payment system encourages older physicians to \nretire, discourages younger physicians from entering specialties that \npredominately treat Medicare patients, and hinders investment in health \ninformation technology.\n  In addition to the studies that have been conducted, and our own \ncommon sense, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent \nFederal body established by Congress in 1997 to advise us on issues \naffecting the Medicare program, has been telling us since 2001 that the \nMedicare sustainable growth rate formula is a flawed, inequitable \nmechanism for controlling the volume of services and that it should be \nrepealed.\n  It is absolutely critical that ultimately Congress needs to enact a \nlong-term solution to this issue. In the short term, we need to end the \npractice of dealing with the cuts on a yearly basis in a manner that \nresults in deeper automatic physician payment reductions in future \nyears.\n  At a minimum, I believe we must pass legislation this year that \nprovides physicians with 2 years of positive Medicare payment updates \nand do so in a way that does not add to the cost of eliminating the \nSGR.\n  By providing 2 years of positive Medicare payment updates for \nphysicians, we would avoid having to come back next year facing the \nsame issue and would instead create the ability for Congress to develop \na new, sustainable Medicare physician payment system.\n  I thank Senator Baucus, the Senate Finance chairman, for his work on \nbehalf of Medicare beneficiaries and physicians and I fully support his \ngoal of\n\n[[Page S14187]]\n\nproviding a 2-year ``fix'' for physician payments in the package he \ndevelops in the coming month.\n  I share his belief that ultimately we need to repeal the SGR and \nestablish a Medicare physician payment system that will provide stable, \npositive payment updates to preserve Medicare beneficiaries' access to \nhigh-quality care for the long term. I hope we will be able to begin \nthat process under his leadership next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/08/senate-section/article/S14187-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14187-S14188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              WAR IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senate has spent little time in \nrecent weeks discussing Iraq, but we cannot ignore the latest grim news \nfrom this misguided war. The Associated Press reported this week that \n2007 is now the deadliest year in Iraq for U.S. troops--even though we \nstill have almost 2 months of this year remaining. I will ask that the \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  According to a recent Associated Press count at least 3,858 Americans \nhave been killed and 28,385 Americans have been wounded in Iraq. We are \nfast approaching two very grim milestones--4,000 killed and 30,000 \ncasualties. We should stop and consider the implications of these \nnumbers. I grieve for those who are lost and wounded, and I am all the \nmore determined that no more of our brave men and women should be \nkilled in a war that has no end in sight and is not making our country \nsafer.\n  Instead of acknowledging that these sad milestones are indications of \na failed policy, the administration is once again digging it in heels. \nLately, it has been talking about the recent decline in U.S. deaths as \na justification for continuing its open-ended military policies in \nIraq.\n  The American people are not fooled by these claims of success. They \nknow all too well that the President's policies are simply buying time, \nand they continue to reject them. A recent ABC News/Washington Post \npoll illustrates that a majority of Americans are still calling for a \nchange of course in Iraq. 59 percent of Americans think we're not \nmaking significant progress in Iraq and 6 out of 10 that's 60 percent \nof Americans want the level of U.S. forces reduced. And yet, the \nPresident ignores the wishes of the public, offering a small, token \ndrawdown of forces in the near future but no timeline as to when \nsignificant numbers of troops will come home.\n  If the goal of the surge was to provide a window for political \nreconciliation, as the President outlined last January, victory remains \nelusive. Meanwhile, Al-Qaida has reconstituted and strengthened itself \nalong the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region at the same time while we \nhave been focused on fighting a war in Iraq. The President likes to say \nthat Iraq is the central front in the war on terror instead of fixing \nall his attention on Iraq, he needs to address what is happening \nhundreds of miles to the east.\n  Again and again, the American people have once again voiced their \nopinion that this war makes no sense and that they expect us uphold our \ncongressional responsibilities and use our power to end it. It is bad \nenough to have the President disregard the American people by \nescalating our involvement in Iraq. Despite the efforts of Democratic \nleaders, Congress is also ignoring the will of the American people.\n  And so I urge my colleagues not to allow Iraq to remain on the \ncongressional backburner. We cannot say we've done everything possible \nto end the war--we cannot say we are acting on our constituents' top \nconcern--when we are not discussing, not debating, and certainly not \nvoting on Iraq.\n  We cannot afford to sideline this critical issue at a time when we \nare close to reaching 4,000 American men and women killed and 30,000 \nwounded in a misguided, never-ending war. It is a war that will \ncontinue through the waning days of this administration unless we \nsummon our congressional power to end it. It is a war that we cannot \nsit back and doing nothing about. It is a war that has cost over half \ntrillion dollars, stretched our military to the breaking point, and \nmade us less safe. It is an unacceptable war.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from the \nAssociated press to which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nAP: Deadliest Year for U.S. in Iraq--Military Announces Deaths of Five \n               U.S. Soldiers, Raising Year's Total to 852\n\n       Baghdad.--Five more U.S. troops were killed in Iraq, the \n     military said Tuesday--making 2007 the deadliest year for \n     American forces in Iraq, according to an Associated Press \n     count.\n       At least 852 U.S. military personnel have died in Iraq so \n     far this year--the highest annual toll since the war began in \n     March 2003, according to AP figures. Some 850 troops died in \n     2004.\n       The grim milestone passed despite a sharp drop in U.S. and \n     Iraqi deaths here in recent months, after a 30,000-strong \n     U.S. force buildup.\n\n\n                              Deadly IEDs\n\n       The five U.S. soldiers died Monday in two separate attacks, \n     Rear Adm. Gregory Smith, director of the Multi-National \n     Force-Iraq's communications division, told reporters Tuesday. \n     ``We lost five soldiers yesterday in two unfortunate \n     incidents, both involving IEDs,'' he said, using the \n     military's shorthand for improvised explosive devices--\n     roadside bombs.\n       Their deaths brought to at least 3,855 the number of U.S. \n     troops who have died since the beginning of the Iraq war, \n     according to an AP count. The figure includes eight civilians \n     working for the military.\n       At least 852 American military members died in Iraq in \n     2007, compared with 850 troops in 2004. That year saw mostly \n     larger, more conventional battles like the campaign to \n     cleanse Fallujah of Sunni militants in November, and U.S. \n     clashes with Shiite militiamen in the sect's holy city of \n     Najaf in August.\n\n\n                    Widening reach of U.S. military\n\n       But the American military in Iraq reached its highest troop \n     levels in Iraq this year--165,000. Moreover, the military's \n     decision to send soldiers out of large bases and into Iraqi \n     communities means more troops have seen more ``contact with \n     enemy forces'' than ever before, said Maj. Winfield \n     Danielson, a U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad.\n       ``It's due to the troop surge, which allowed us to go into \n     areas that were previously safe havens for insurgents,'' \n     Danielson told the AP on Sunday. ``Having more soldiers, and \n     having them out in the communities, certainly contributes to \n     our casualties.''\n       Last spring, U.S. platoons took up positions--often in \n     abandoned houses or in muddy, half-collapsed police \n     stations--at the heart of neighborhoods across Baghdad and \n     nearby communities.\n       The move was part of President Bush's new strategy to drive \n     al-Qaida from the capital.\n       It was the first time many residents had seen U.S. troops \n     up close, rather than whizzing by in armored convoys en route \n     to huge bases that house thousands of troops. And it was the \n     first time many U.S. troops went to bed each night outside \n     those fortresses, to the sounds of Iraqi life: gunfire, the \n     roar of helicopters overhead and an occasional explosion.\n       The move has worked, U.S. officials say. Increasingly, the \n     sounds of Baghdad include children playing on the streets.\n       ``It's allowed Iraqi civilians to get more comfortable with \n     U.S. forces--increasing the number of tips we get from Iraqi \n     citizens,'' Danielson said. ``That leads us to insurgent \n     leaders and cells, and cleaning those up has led to a decline \n     in violence over the past couple months.''\n       Death tolls for Americans and Iraqis have fallen \n     dramatically in recent months, as have the number of \n     bombings, shootings and other violence.\n       At least 1,023 Iraqi civilians died in September; in \n     October, that figure was just 875. The number of U.S. troop \n     deaths dropped from 65 to 36 in the same period, according to \n     statistics kept by the AP. That's the lowest monthly toll of \n     American deaths this year.\n       On average, 56 Iraqis--civilians and security forces have \n     died each day so far in 2007, according to the AP count.\n\n\n                           Mass grave located\n\n       Meantime, Iraqi troops discovered 22 bodies in a mass grave \n     in the Lake Tharthar area northwest of Baghdad, the U.S. \n     military also said Tuesday. The bodies were found during a \n     joint operation Saturday.\n       It was the second mass grave found in the area in less than \n     a month.\n       Meanwhile, the United States said it planned to release \n     nine Iranian prisoners in the coming days, including two \n     captured when U.S. troops stormed an Iranian government \n     office in Irbil last January. The office was shut after the \n     raid, but it reopened as an Iranian consulate on Tuesday, \n     Iraqi and Iranian officials said.\n\n\n                    Gates says Iran fulfills pledge\n\n       A military spokesman said Iran appears to have kept its \n     promise to stop the flow into Iraq of bomb-making materials \n     and other weaponry that Washington says has inflamed \n     insurgent violence and caused many American troop casualties.\n       U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said last week that \n     Iran had made such assurances to the Iraqi government.\n       ``It's our best judgment that these particular EFPs . . . \n     in recent large cache finds do not appear to have arrived \n     here in Iraq after those pledges were made,'' Smith said.\n\n[[Page S14188]]\n\n       Among the weapons Washington has accused Iran of supplying \n     to Iraqi insurgents are EFPs, or explosively formed \n     projectiles. They fire a slug of molten metal capable of \n     penetrating even the most heavily armored military vehicles, \n     and thus are more deadly than other roadside bombs.\n       The No. 2 U.S. commander in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno, \n     said last week that there had been a sharp decline in the \n     number of EFPs found in Iraq in the last three months. At the \n     time, he and Gates both said it was too early to tell whether \n     the trend would hold, and whether it could be attributed to \n     action by Iranian authorities. Iran publicly denies that it \n     has sent weapons to Shiite militias in Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/08/senate-section/article/S14188-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAN\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the President of the United States is \npursuing a strategy towards Iran that is badly flawed, dangerous, and \nlikely doomed to failure. I am deeply concerned about Iran's nuclear \nprogram and its support for terrorism, and by indications that it is \naiding groups in Iraq that are killing American troops, but the \nadministration has so far failed to come up with an effective way to \naddress these very serious matters.\n  For instance, less than 2 weeks ago the administration designated the \nQuds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a material \nsupporter of terrorism, and the IRGC for proliferation activities. I \nsupport sanctions that target proliferators and have introduced \nlegislation that would strengthen our sanctions regime, but the \ndesignation of Iranian government entities raises new policy questions \nthat do not seem to have been fully explored, and it may very well be \ncounterproductive.\n  Moreover, this poorly timed action undermines efforts to win support \nfor multilateral initiatives. Instead of acting alone, we should \nmaintain and strengthen the international community's collective \nability to counter Iranian ambitions, including with regard to its \nnuclear program.\n  Iran's actions pose serious threats to our national security. But \naggressive saber-rattling is not an appropriate or effective response. \nThe administration has shown repeatedly that it is too quick to turn to \nmilitary power, and its threat, to address problems overseas. It has \nalso shown time and again an inability to see the big picture. And it \nstill seems to prefer unilateral over multilateral approaches. All of \nthese are mistakes we cannot afford to have repeated.\n  We can't focus on Iran in isolation, the way the administration has \nfocused for so long on Iraq without considering a broader context or \ntaking a more comprehensive approach.\n  Instead of repeating the myopia of Iraq, the administration should \napproach the problem of Iran through a more strategic lens one that \nincorporates a broader and more integrated vision, that takes into \naccount regional concerns, and that is consistent with our top national \nsecurity priority, which is the fight against al-Qaida and its \naffiliates. We need a national security strategy that addresses al-\nQaida, Iran, Iraq, and the many other problems we face. Instead, the \nadministration prefers to focus on Iraq, and now Iran, as if we had the \nluxury of addressing these challenges in isolation.\n  We must vigorously oppose any efforts by Iran to acquire nuclear \nweapons and its support to terrorist organizations that goes almost \nwithout saying. But we must curb these actions by seeing the whole \nboard and by using more of the tools at our disposal. And that is not \nhappening. Instead, the administration is taking an unnecessarily \nbelligerent approach that runs the risk of increasing our \nvulnerability, both at home and abroad.\n  The United States should be working in unison with the international \ncommunity, which shares our concern over Iran's nuclear program. At the \nsame time as the new sanctions were announced, the European Union's \nforeign policy chief, Javier Solana, was meeting in Rome with Iran's \nnegotiators to discuss Tehran's nuclear program and discussions among \nthe EU+ 3 comprised of France, Germany and the UK plus China, Russia \nand U.S.--are likely to continue at the end of November following the \ncompletion of another IAEA report.\n  In the past, Secretary Rice and others at State have publicly \nsupported these talks and expressed confidence in the negotiations. But \nthe administration's hard line position is unlikely to win over Russia \nand China, without whom there can be little progress.\n  The administration should be trying to persuade our friends and \nallies to increase their economic pressure on Iran, ideally through the \nU.N. Rather than imposing unilateral sanctions, we should be pressing \nthe EU to announce multilateral sanctions, which would have a much \ngreater impact given that we have not traded or invested in Iran for \nnearly 30 years. Instead, our bellicose rhetoric and hard-line approach \ncould be undermining our ability to gain support from--Russia, China \nand even from some EU countries--to implement multilateral sanctions \nthat Iran cannot ignore.\n  Trying to unilaterally isolate Iran further is unlikely to curb its \nnuclear program. And it won't make sure that Iran does not aid the \nproliferation of and access to weapons in Iraq. Veiled, and not-so-\nveiled, threats of military action aren't likely to work either. They \nare, however, likely to embolden Iran's hardliners as they seek to \nthwart moderates in that country who might otherwise encourage dialogue \nor political reform.\n  Instead of using the Iraq focused bilateral talks that have occurred \nin Baghdad as a platform from which to build, we are launching \nourselves on to a collision course that may further endanger U.S. \ntroops in Iraq in the near term. And that might only be the beginning. \nOur massive presence in Iraq undermines our ability to deal with Iran. \nIt is draining our resources, exhausting our troops, exposing them to \npotential Iranian attacks, and undermining our credibility.\n  We should redeploy our troops from Iraq so that we can deal with Iran \nfrom a position of greater strength. Instead, the President is leading \nus deeper into the quagmire that his misguided policies in Iraq \ncreated.\n  It is essential that those of us here in Congress condemn the violent \nand defiant statements coming out of Iran. But we also have a \nresponsibility as a co-equal branch of government to respond to this \nadministration's aggressive words, ill-considered decisions and ad hoc \npolicies, particularly when they may undermine our own national \nsecurity. Dealing with Iran is a daunting task. But we are only making \nit more difficult with our counterproductive policies of isolation and \nwar-mongering. We cannot again succumb to the shortsightedness that \nkeeps us fixated on Iraq and drains the attention and resources needed \nto combat threats to our national security around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/08/senate-section/article/S14188-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14188-S14189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CORPORATE AVERAGE FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as Congress continues to work on \ncomprehensive energy legislation, I want to discuss the importance to \nmy constituents of enacting strong yet achievable corporate average \nfuel economy standards.\n  The final energy package needs to increase vehicle fuel economy \nrequirements, but it should do so without undercutting hardworking \nfamilies in Wisconsin and across the country. Between manufacturing, \ndealerships, and the automotive parts industry, there are upwards of \n50,000 auto jobs in Wisconsin. Having grown up in Janesville--home to a \nGeneral Motors plant--I understand how important the auto industry is \nto the State's economy and its communities. For far too long, under \ndifferent administrations and different Congresses, the U.S. has \npursued trade and other policies that have undermined our country's \nmanufacturing base. Now, it is time to pay attention to the concerns of \nAmerica's workers.\n  We can have strong and achievable CAFE standards. However, this will \nrequire several reasonable revisions to the Energy bill that the Senate \npassed. For starters, separate standards for cars and trucks need to be \nmaintained. I recently organized a coalition of senators to write the \nSenate's Democratic leadership and urge it to maintain the distinction \nin current law between standards for cars and trucks. Passenger cars \nand light-duty trucks are inherently different. They should have\n\n[[Page S14189]]\n\nseparate fuel economy standards. Unfortunately the Senate's CAFE \nlanguage is unclear in this regard, providing little certainty on how \nthe Department of Transportation will interpret this provision. \nCongress must provide the necessary certainty.\n  In order to ensure the Energy bill takes the right approach on CAFE \nstandards, I have also joined colleagues in calling for a formal House-\nSenate conference to meet to draft the final bill. We should not \nabandon the normal legislative process on such an important issue and \nresort to informal, backroom dealmaking. I understand that there are \nstill objections to convening a conference and I hope that those will \nbe resolved soon.\n  Since the Senate considered the Energy bill, I have worked to ensure \nthat the final version includes a CAFE standard that supports working \nfamilies in Janesville and elsewhere. When the Senate considered the \nbill earlier this year, I supported the reasonable Pryor-Bond-Levin \namendment to increase CAFE standards, and I was disappointed that it \nwas never brought to a vote. I continue to work with them and other \ncolleagues to make sure that Congress strikes the right balance on this \nimportant issue.\n  As the Congress works to finalize its comprehensive energy \nlegislation, I urge my colleagues to help set strong yet achievable \nvehicle fuel economy requirements. We can increase CAFE standards while \nalso ensuring that my hometown of Janesville--and hometowns like it \nacross the country--still has the family-supporting jobs that are vital \nto the strength of the community.\n\n\n            National Radiation Protection Professionals Week\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to honor the members of the \nradiation protection profession and to recognize that the Conference of \nRadiation Control Program Directors and the Health Physics Society have \nresolved that November 4-10, 2007, should be named National Radiation \nProtection Professionals Week.\n  Since Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen's discovery of x-rays on November 8, \n1895, the use of radiation has become vital in the Nation's health \ncare, defense, security, energy, and industrial programs. However, if \nmisused, this vital technology can harm and injure those using it or \nbenefiting from it. Members of the radiation protection profession make \nit their life's work to allow government, medicine, academia, and \nindustry to safely use radiation. By providing the necessary \nleadership, these professionals protect people from radiation hazards \nthus enabling society to reap benefits of this remarkable technology. I \nencourage all citizens to recognize the valuable resource represented \nby their professional scientific organizations, such as the Conference \nof Radiation Control Program Directors, the Health Physics, the \nNational Registry of Radiation Protection Technologies, and the \nAmerican Association of Physicists in Medicine. I deeply appreciate the \ncommitment of these professionals and professional organization, and \ntheir contribution to our Nation and the world.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Jack and Lola \nBradley who will celebrate the 70th anniversary of their wedding during \nThanksgiving week.\n  On November 20, 1937, Jack Bradley and Lola Davis made a commitment \nto one another to become lifelong partners. True to their word, they \nhave remained as husband and wife for 70 years.\n  Jack met Lola in Cheyenne, WY, while they were students at Cheyenne \nHigh School. The story goes that it was love at first sight. The couple \nmaintained their relationship while Jack went to the University of \nWyoming and Lola finished up her high school education.\n  They started their lives together by moving to Newcastle, WY, to run \nthe family business, Manewal Bradley Refinery--and they remain active \nin the operation today. They raised three children: Linda, Jack and \nLolly. Jack and Lola are respected members of the community. They've \nsupported local charities, they donated land for a city park, and even \nallowed the use of their property for a community baseball diamond.\n  Every candidate for public office in Wyoming knows Jack and Lola. \nThey are the go-to people in Weston County. During campaign season, \nJack and Lola continue to provide advice, support, and time to \ncandidates at all levels of government.\n  Through the challenges of running a business, raising a family, and \nserving their community, it was the undying love for each other that \nmade such a strong relationship that it would last well into the 21st \ncentury.

A bill to amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. \nApp.) to enhance the Offices of the Inspectors General, to create a \nCouncil of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my \ncolleagues Senators Collins, Lieberman and Coburn in introducing the \nInspector General Reform Act of 2007. This bill represents a strong \nbipartisan effort to strengthen the independence and integrity of our \nnation's Inspectors General, who represent one of our strongest tools \nin combating waste, fraud and abuse throughout our government.\n  When I first came to the Senate this January, I made it one of my top \npriorities to become actively involved in oversight and accountability \nin Congress and in the Federal Government. I was thrilled to have been \ngiven an appointment to the Homeland Security and Government Affairs \nCommittee, which is ably run by Chairman Lieberman. I was proud to have \nbeen able to cosponsor S. 680, the bill authored by Senator Collins \nwhich included not only extensive reforms of Government contracting \npractices, but also included many provisions geared towards improving \nthe Inspector General system. I must thank Senator Collins especially \nfor working with me on\n\n[[Page S14194]]\n\nthe Inspector General legislation, which incorporates not only many of \nher reform ideas, but also those introduced in the House by \nRepresentatives Jim Cooper of Tennessee in H.R. 928, which has passed \nthat chamber by an overwhelming vote of 404 to 11.\n  My 8 years as State Auditor in Missouri has given me tremendous \nrespect for auditors and investigators working to make sure Government \nis spending our taxpayer dollars wisely. While many people are aware of \nthe great work done by the legislative branch's Government \nAccountability Office, very few people realize that there are \nInspectors General in many of our most important agencies. These IGs \nreport both to the Executive and Legislative branch, and work in the \ntrenches in the agency, constantly ferreting out cases of fraud, waste, \nabuse, and other mismanagement. Their unique role, resting inside the \nvery agency they are charged with auditing and investigating, often \ncreates unavoidable tensions.\n  The goal of the first Inspector General Act, passed 30 years ago next \nyear, was to create a system that would allow the IG to rest \nharmoniously in the agency but allow them to provide oversight of an \nagency's actions and duties free from interference.\n  For the most part, this system has worked. But we can do better to \nassure that Inspectors General are free of intimidation or \ninappropriate influence by the agencies they oversee. Recent news \nreports have noted that the CIA Inspector General, John Helgerson, is \nbeing investigated by his own agency, even though there is no apparent \nlegal authority for such an investigation to take place. The \nAdministrator for the General Services Administration has been openly \ncritical of the GSA IG, and has tried to cut the responsibilities and \nthe budget of that office. The State Department IG has answered charges \nthat he has failed to investigate allegations of contracting fraud in \nIraq and Afghanistan with the claim that he has not been provided \nenough money by his agency to do such an investigation.\n  Obviously, some changes are needed and our IG reform bill attempts to \nmake them. For example, IGs currently request their budgets through \ntheir agencies and then the agency heads determine if that request is \nappropriate before sending their budgets to the White House and then on \nto Congress. No one in Congress has the ability to see how much an IG \noffice truly needs to adequately fulfill its oversight duties. Our bill \nrequires that IGs can attach comments to the agency's official budget \nrequest if he or she believes the funding the agency requested for its \nIG is not enough to do the job.\n  As more Executive agencies move to a pay for performance compensation \nsystem, bonuses given by the agency have become a bigger part of the \ntotal compensation for employees. Having the agency that you audit \ndecide how much of a bonus you will receive is an obvious, unacceptable \nconflict of interest for Inspectors General. Many IGs refuse to take a \nbonus, and those who do accept them have myriad reasons for doing so. \nHowever, this practice will be forbidden under the new law. Given the \nnegative impact on the compensation for Inspector General and the need \nto attract and retain the best and the brightest, the pay of \npresidentially appointed Inspectors General will be raised one level. \nFor the other Executive IGs, their agencies will be directed to pay \nthem the same or more than the total compensation received by other \nsenior level employees. This system will end the possibility of an \nagency head trying to entice an IG to go easy on them, or to punish an \nIG who refuses to do so.\n  This bill also gives the IGs more security from the fear of losing \none's job for the simple reason they are too good. Before any IG can be \nremoved, the congressional committees of jurisdiction must be notified, \nin writing, of the intent to remove the IG, and the reasons for doing \nso. This notice must be received at least 30 days before the scheduled \nremoval. Bringing transparency to this process should guarantee that no \nIG will be removed for the wrong reason.\n  I want to make sure that the good work of the IGs is readily \naccessible to the people who pay for it, the taxpayer. I was shocked to \nrealize that many IGs did not post their reports on the web. At least \none IG shop didn't even have a website. In this day and age the public, \nand Congress, should have timely and easy access to all the public \nreports produced by Inspectors General. This bill requires all reports \nwhich are open to the public to be posted on the web within three \nworking days of their release. It also requires all IG shops to \nprovide, on their websites, a method for anonymously reporting waste, \nfraud or abuse.\n  Finally, this bill codifies a council for the IGs to have as a \nresource. This council, which exists now only pursuant to Executive \norder, would provide a structure for IGs to pool their resources when \nit would effectively help them perform their mission, such as providing \nGovernment-wide training for investigators and auditors. It will also \ninclude an Integrity Committee that will investigate allegations made \nagainst Inspectors General and certain staff members. Congress would \nreceive periodic reports from this committee on the number of \ninvestigations they have undertaken, the results of those \ninvestigations, and any action by the agency taken in response to the \nfindings of the committee.\n  I want to make clear that I am one of the biggest fans of the current \ncadre of Inspectors General, with very few exceptions. I want to make \nsure these dedicated public servants are able to perform their duties \nfree from interference. I am very proud to be part of the effort to \nmake sure this happens, and again thank my colleagues Senators Collins, \nLieberman and Coburn for their hard work and dedication to this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President. I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators McCaskill, Lieberman, and Coburn, in introducing the Inspector \nGeneral Reform Act of 2007, a bipartisan measure that will help detect \nand prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in government operations.\n  This legislation is an important companion to S. 680, the \nAccountability in Government Contracting Act of 2007, which the Senate \npassed last night by unanimous consent. Indeed, many of the reforms in \nthis bill were included in S. 680 in February, when I first introduced \nthat legislation along with Senators Lieberman, Coleman, Carper, and \nMcCaskill. At our Committee's markup of S. 680, I recommended that the \nprovisions governing Inspectors General be removed from that bill so \nthat we could work together to improve the effectiveness of our \nNation's Inspectors General in a separate legislative vehicle. The \nlegislation we introduce today reflects that collaboration and \ncontinues our Committee's strong, bipartisan efforts to improve the \neffectiveness of Government.\n  Inspectors General are vital partners in Congress's effort to \nidentify inefficient, ineffective, and improper Government programs. By \nleveraging the expertise and independence of Inspectors General and \ntheir staffs, Congress has been able to identify, and take action to \nstop, wasteful spending.\n  Examples of the IGs' invaluable work could be cited in depressingly \nlarge numbers, but let me note two efforts that I found particularly \nstriking. In a 6-month period following the Hurricane Katrina disaster, \nthe Department of Homeland Security's IG produced 29 reports that \nincluded alarming discoveries, including that 63 percent of the DHS \npurchase-card transactions made during the response had no \ndocumentation of goods or services actually being received. The DHS IG \ninvestigations helped produce 243 convictions for fraud or related \noffenses and aided in recovery of millions of taxpayer dollars.\n  As you will recall, the impressive work of the Special Inspector \nGeneral for Iraq Reconstruction led to Congress's extending SIGIR's \nwork in that country. The SIGIR reported, among other things, that more \nthan $9 billion in Iraqi oil revenues disbursed in 2004 could not be \naccounted for, that hundreds of contracts had problems, and that many \nprojects to restore Iraq's water and electric services would not be \ncompleted. The SIGIR's work is estimated to yield taxpayers $25 of \nbenefit for every dollar of cost.\n\n  The investigations and reports of IGs throughout the government help \nCongress shape legislation and oversight activities--improving \nGovernment performance, providing important transparency into programs, \nand giving Americans better value for their tax dollar.\n  Unfortunately, the past year has produced troubling instances in \nwhich the independence of Inspectors General has been challenged within \ntheir respective departments. We have also heard allegations of \nmisconduct by some Inspectors General. These alarming examples of \npressure and impropriety cannot be tolerated, and the legislation we \nintroduce today is an important first step in clarifying congressional \nexpectations concerning the independence, funding, training, and \naccountability of the Federal Government's Inspectors General.\n  The Inspector General Reform Act of 2007 would improve the \nindependence and effectiveness of Inspectors General and contribute to \nbetter relations among the IGs, the agencies they serve, and the \nCongress. These improvements will also help to insulate and protect \nInspectors General from inappropriate efforts to hinder their \ninvestigations.\n  First and foremost, the legislation provides a clear manifestation of \nhow Congress believes IGs should be chosen. It amends the Inspector \nGeneral Act of 1978 to explicitly require appointments on the basis of \nability and integrity, not political affiliation.\n  Additional enhancements included in the bill are a mandatory \nrequirement to notify Congress 30 days before the removal of an IG, \nhelping to prevent politically motivated attempts to terminate \neffective IGs.\n  A separate budget line for Inspectors General that includes their \noverall budget and training needs, helping to ensure that these offices \nare properly funded to perform their important mission.\n  A pay increase for IGs and a prohibition on cash bonuses or awards. \nMost IGs already refuse to accept bonuses to avoid an appearance of \nconflict, with the result that many deputies earn more than the IGs. \nThis provision will improve an IG's influence and independence within \nan agency while avoiding the appearance of improper influence that \nbonuses can create.\n  Authorization for the Government-wide IG Council on Integrity and \nEfficiency that will ensure appropriate investigations of misconduct or \nmalfeasance by IGs. And finally,\n  Clarification that the IGs' subpoena authority extends to electronic \ndocuments.\n  The oversight experience of the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee and many reviews by the Government Accountability \nOffice have confirmed the vital importance of the Inspector General \nfunction\n\n[[Page S14199]]\n\nin our system of Government. By addressing identified shortcomings and \nfurther insulating IGs from inappropriate influence, the legislation we \nintroduce today will make a critical function of Government even more \neffective. I urge my colleagues to support its prompt consideration and \npassage.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues \nSenators McCaskill, Collins, and Coburn today in introducing the \nInspector General Reform Act of 2007. This bipartisan bill reflects the \nbroad Congressional support for the outstanding work of our Inspectors \nGeneral and our desire to ensure that these important and unique \ngovernment officials are given the tools and the accountability to \nperform at their very best.\n  It has been almost 30 years since Congress, as part of its post-\nWatergate reforms, passed the Inspectors General Act of 1978 that \ncreated an office of Inspector General in 12 major departments and \nagencies to hold those agencies accountable to the public interest and \nreport back both to the agency heads and Congress on their findings. \nThe law was amended in 1988 to add an Inspector General to almost all \nExecutive agencies and departments.\n  The experiment has been a great success, hailed as a sort of consumer \nprotector for the taxpayer deep within each agency. According to the \nPresident's Council on Integrity and Efficiency, last year alone IG \naudits resulted in $9.9 billion in potential savings and another $6.8 \nbillion in savings when the results of civil and criminal \ninvestigations are added in.\n  Some of the IGs' work lands on the front page--exposing major \nshortcomings in government practices and official conduct. Most of it \nunfolds more quietly, but is just as critical in helping Federal \nagencies establish effective and efficient programs that make the most \nof the taxpayers' hard earned dollars.\n  Over the years, we have become aware of several instances where the \nindependence of Inspectors General appears to be threatened. It is \nvital that Congress reiterate its strong support for the internal \noversight IGs can provide and ensure they have the independence they \nneed to carry out this vital, but often unpopular work.\n  Unfortunately, we are also aware of instances in which the watchdog \nneeds watching--that is, situations where the Inspector General has \nbehaved improperly or failed to provide vigorous oversight.\n  This legislation attempts to address both problems.\n  It includes an array of measures designed to strengthen the \nindependence of the Inspectors General, such as requiring the \nadministration to notify Congress 30 days before attempting to remove \nor transfer an IG. This would give us time to consider whether the \nadministration was improperly seeking to displace an Inspector General \nfor political reasons because the IG was, in effect, doing his or her \njob too well. It requires that all IGs be chosen on the basis of \nqualifications, without regard to political affiliation.\n  The legislation would codify and strengthen the existing IG councils, \ncreating a unitary council that can provide greater support for IGs \nthroughout the Government.\n  The bill would provide greater transparency of IG budget needs, \nincluding funds for training and council activities, to help ensure the \nIG offices have the resources they need for their investigations.\n  Most IGs would also receive a pay raise, to reflect the importance of \nthe work they do and their proper stature within an agency. Currently, \nsome IGs earn less than other senior officials in their agency and \nsometimes even less than some of their subordinates. However, we also \nprohibit bonuses for IGs, to remove a potential avenue for improper \ninfluence by the agency head.\n  Our bill also enhances IG accountability by strengthening the \nIntegrity Committee that handles allegations against Inspectors General \nand their senior staff, and facilitating greater oversight of Integrity \nCommittee by Congress.\n  The bill also ensures that the Inspector General of the Justice \nDepartment will have the authority, shared by other IGs, to investigate \nmisconduct of any Departmental employee.\n  The House has already voted overwhelmingly in support of legislation \naddressing many of these same issues. It is time for the Senate to \nfollow suit. I urge my colleagues to support this worthy and common \nsense piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Webb):\n  S. 2331. A bill to exclude from gross income payments from the Hokie \nSpirit Memorial Fund to the victims of the tragic event, loss of life \nand limb, at Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will, I \nhope, help provide some measure of assistance to those family members \nwho lost loved ones and to those who suffered wounds as a consequence \nof the horrific shootings that took place on April 16, 2007, on the \ncampus of Virginia Tech. I am pleased to have my colleague from \nVirginia, Senator Webb, as a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  In the aftermath of that tragic day, where 32 lives of promise were \nforever cut short, over 20,000 individuals and groups across the \ncountry demonstrated their support for the victims and their families \nwith generous financial donations that totaled approximately $7.5 \nmillion. Virginia Tech established the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund \nwithin the Virginia Tech Foundation to accept these charitable \ncontributions. The Hokie Spirit Fund distribution plan offers families \nof the 32 individuals who lost their lives a choice of receiving \nproceeds from the Fund or dividing those proceeds between a cash \npayment and a scholarship in the victim's name. Injured victims are \nalso eligible for Fund proceeds. On October 30, 2007, the University \nofficially distributed these funds to the 79 families and individuals \nin accordance with the protocols established. While no amount of money \ncan truly compensate for the loss of life or limb, these payments \nprovide both the families of the deceased and the injured survivors \nwith some financial resources to help, in some modest way.\n  Unfortunately, Federal law is not clear as to whether these payments \nare subject to Federal taxation. In my view, not only does precedent \nindicate that these types of payments should be free of Federal income \ntax, common sense concurs. Accordingly, the legislation that Senator \nWebb and I introduce today makes it clear that any payments by Virginia \nTech from the Hokie Spirit Fund in conjunction with the April 16, 2007, \nshooting at Virginia Tech should not be taxable for Federal purposes.\n  It is my hope that the Congress will expeditiously pass this \nimportant legislation. I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2331\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXCLUSION FROM INCOME FOR PAYMENTS FROM THE HOKIE \n                   SPIRIT MEMORIAL FUND.\n\n       For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, gross \n     income shall not include any amount received from the \n     Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University, out of \n     amounts transferred from the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund \n     established by the Virginia Tech Foundation, an organization \n     organized and operated as described in section 501(c)(3) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as a payment in connection \n     with the tragic event, loss of life and limb, on April 16, \n     2007, at such university.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Obama, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Biden, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2332. A bill to promote transparency in the adoption of new media \nownership rules by the Federal Communications Commission, and to \nestablish an independent panel to make recommendations on how to \nincrease the representation of women and minorities in broadcast media \nownership; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Media Ownership \nAct of 2007, along with Senators Lott, Obama, Snowe, Kerry, Nelson of \nFlorida, Cantwell, and Feinstein. We seek with this bill to halt the \nFederal Communications Commission's, FCC, fast\n\n[[Page S14200]]\n\nmarch toward easing media ownership rules.\n  The FCC has taken a series of destructive actions in the past two \ndecades that, I believe, have undermined the public interest. Now they \nappear prepared to do it again. The FCC is working to have a rewrite of \nmedia ownership rules completed just next month. Now this seems like a \nmassive rush to me and a big mistake. How will the public interest be \nserved by attempting to rush through a plan to relax ownership rules?\n  We don't need more concentration of ownership in radio and television \nstations and a green light for cross ownership between newspapers, \nradio and television stations. Further consolidation of media ownership \nat all is an affront to common sense. But even if we disagree with the \nrules the FCC issues, and even if we think the FCC should break up the \nbig media companies rather than allow them to consolidate, the FCC must \ngo through an honest and thorough process. They must study the \nquestions that affect a decision of whether to adjust ownership limits. \nThey have not done this. They have not put the final rules out for \ncomment for a meaningful amount of time, they have not given the \nnecessary consideration to the issue of localism, and they do not know \nenough about the impact of consolidation on localism or female and \nminority ownership.\n  The Media Ownership Act of 2007 ensures that the FCC allow enough \ntime for comment on the actual rule changes. It requires that the FCC \nput out the final rules proposed by the Commission for 90 days of \ncomment.\n  The bill also requires that the FCC complete a separate proceeding on \nthe promotion of local programming and content by broadcasters and \nnewspapers. In 2003, Chairman Powell set up a task force to promote \nlocalism in broadcasting and they began some hearings and took in \ncomments. Chairman Martin has wrapped those comments into this \nownership proceeding and is finishing the last localism hearing as part \nof this rushed schedule. The bill requires that they must publish a \nfinal rule in a separate proceeding and allow 90 days of comment. This \nmust be completed prior to the vote on ownership.\n  The bill requires that the FCC establish an Independent Panel on \nOwnership by Women and Minorities. The FCC must collect and provide \nthis panel with data on the specific gender and ethnic makeup of media \nowners. The panel shall issue recommendations and the FCC must act on \nthese recommendations prior to a vote on media ownership.\n  The last time the FCC tried to do rush to consolidate media \nownership, the United States Senate voted to block it. On September 16, \n2003, the Senate voted 55-40 to support a ``resolution of disapproval'' \nof the FCC's previous decision to allow further concentration. If we \nhave to do this again we will. A number of us have sent numerous \nletters to the FCC stating what needs to be done prior to a vote on \nmedia ownership limits and yet the Chairman is on track to move this \nproceeding to a vote. The FCC is clearly not listening and legislation \nis now necessary.\n  This is again a bipartisan effort to stop the FCC from destroying the \nlocal interests that we have always felt must be a part of \nbroadcasting.\n  It is time to ensure that we first protect localism and diversity, \nwhich the FCC appears to have long forgotten. Only then can we really \nreview the rules of media ownership in a thorough process to see if it \nis actually in the public interest to reverse any of those rules, or if \ngreater public interest protections are necessary.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nplaced in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2332\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Media Ownership Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 371\n\n       Whereas some States issue State driver's licenses to aliens \n     who are unlawfully present in the United States;\n       Whereas by providing official government-issued \n     identification to individuals who are in the United States \n     illegally, States and\n\n[[Page S14201]]\n\n     other government entities reward those who show disrespect \n     and disregard for Federal immigration laws;\n       Whereas the very act of entering the United States \n     illegally shows disrespect for the laws of the United States \n     and should not be rewarded in any way; and\n       Whereas issuing driver's licenses to undocumented \n     individuals presents a national security risk and enables \n     election fraud: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that States \n     should not issue driver's licenses or other photo \n     identification to aliens who are unlawfully present in the \n     United States.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. A few months \nago, I stood on the floor of the Senate to decry the practice of \nsanctuary cities. Municipalities across this country had identified a \nloophole in the law and banned the practice of police officers \ninquiring about a suspect's immigration status, allowing cities \nthroughout this country to become sanctuaries for illegal immigrants.\n  I said that following the attacks of \n9/11, we made a promise to the American people to make this country \nsafer; that we identified, on all levels, cracks in our system; and \nthat we found when the left arm doesn't know what the right arm is \ndoing, the consequences can be disastrous.\n  I stand here today again to condemn another policy that flies in the \nface of post-9/11 thinking. The State of New York will join eight other \nStates in issuing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. New Mexico \nis setting up a program where they will doublecheck the illegal \nimmigrant's identity with the Government of Mexico.\n  Polish language newspapers have advertised the ease by which licenses \nfrom the State of Maine can be acquired. Tennessee recently stopped the \npractice of issuing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants in the wake \nof evidence that illegal immigrants from other States were coming to \nTennessee to get licenses.\n  To some, issuing licenses to illegal immigrants may seem harmless, if \nnot commonsensical. If they are going to be driving on the streets, why \nnot ensure that they know the rules of the road? The answer is licenses \nare much more than a permit to drive. The driver's license is a gateway \ndocument to a myriad of other services. Providing illegal immigrants \nwith a driver's license affords them access to bank accounts, airline \nflights, and other resources that the 9/11 hijackers used to attack \nthis Nation. Beyond national security, driver's licenses allow a person \nto enter a Federal building, vote in elections, and apply for \nGovernment benefits. There is also a considerable question of fraud--\nwhen we cannot verify the materials brought to the Department of Motor \nVehicles to establish a person's identity, which is certainly the case \nwhen we are dealing with noncitizens in an illegal status, you open the \ndoors to corruption, multiple identities, and criminality.\n  In the Senate, we have been grappling for several years with the \nissue of what to do with the 12 million or so undocumented people \nalready in the United States. This Senator would like to find a \nsolution that brings these folks out of the shadows. But the message we \nhave received loudly and clearly from the American public is we cannot \nget the comprehensive immigration reform until we secure the borders \nand get serious about enforcing the rule of law when it comes to \nimmigration.\n  Similar to sanctuary cities, the issuance of driver's licenses to \nillegal immigrants is a setback for those who want to see comprehensive \nimmigration reform because it shows we are not serious about enforcing \nthe law. It flies in the face of what the American people expect their \nGovernment to do, which is to control our borders, know who is in the \ncountry, and appropriately penalize those who have broken our laws.\n  I was at a coffee this morning with a columnist, Tom Friedman, a \nnative Minnesotan, who addressed a group today. Immigration came up, \nand he said in passing that to deal with the illegal immigration, he is \nfor a wall but one with a big gate. We need to remain a country that is \nopen to foreign talent. We benefit from having those with Ph.D's and \nadvanced degrees and what they bring in terms of job creation. We need \nto look at the issue of immigration and at changes in our laws to \nencourage the best and brightest to come and contribute to our economy. \nUntil we reestablish the rule of law in immigration policy, we will not \nbe able to get the political consensus that is needed to make any \nreforms, let alone deal with the 12 million illegals here already.\n  Sooner rather than later, America is going to have to ask itself: Do \nwe want to take immigration and the State of our Nation's security \nseriously? To the States that issue licenses to illegal immigrants and \nthe cities that have sanctuary city policies on the books, we must ask \nthe question: Why are you undermining immigration laws at the expense \nof the safety and security of this country?\n  Today I am joined by several of my colleagues in introducing a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution to make the official position of the Senate \nthat States that issue government identification to illegal immigrants, \nissue driver's licenses, are disrespecting and disregarding Federal \nimmigration laws. The measure also finds these actions present a \nnational security risk and enables election fraud.\n  Our colleague, Iowa Congressman Tom Latham, has introduced identical \nlegislation in the other body.\n  I am a former mayor. I am, frankly, deeply concerned, that if there \nis another attack on U.S. soil and we find that the terrorist was here \nillegally, if the terrorist was able to obtain a license, if the \nterrorist was able to move freely about the country, was able to open a \nbank account, all without the slightest bit of resistance, we are going \nto have to take a long look in the mirror and ask how we could let it \nhappen. We shouldn't let it happen. It belies common sense to have a \npolicy of States to issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. It \nmakes it difficult to maintain the commitment we have to the American \npeople, that we are committed to enforcing the rule of law. It makes it \ndifficult for us who want to move forward on comprehensive immigration \nreform if we get to that point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/08/senate-section/article/S14201-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14201-S14202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 372--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE \n            DECLARATION OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN PAKISTAN\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Obama, Mr. Casey, and Mr. \nDurbin) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Bush spoke \n     with President Musharraf and conveyed the message that ``we \n     believe strongly in elections, and that you ought to have \n     elections soon, and you need to take off your uniform''; and\n       Whereas on November 8, 2007, the Government of Pakistan \n     announced that parliamentary elections in Pakistan would be \n     held by February 15, 2008, and that President Musharraf would \n     relinquish his position as Chief of Army Staff of Pakistan \n     prior to being sworn in as President of Pakistan: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to condemn the decision by President Pervez Musharraf \n     of Pakistan to declare a state of emergency in Pakistan, \n     suspend the Constitution of Pakistan, dismiss the Supreme \n     Court Justices refusing to take a loyalty oath, and initiate \n     a nation-wide crackdown on political opposition, the media, \n     and the courts in Pakistan;\n       (2) to call on President Musharraf to revoke the state of \n     emergency, respect the rule of law and immediately release \n     political detainees, restore the Constitution of Pakistan, \n     restore freedom of the press and judicial independence in \n     Pakistan, and reinstate all dismissed members of the Supreme \n     Court of Pakistan;\n       (3) to call upon President Musharraf to honor his \n     commitment to relinquish his position as Chief of Army Staff \n     of Pakistan, allow free and fair parliamentary elections in \n     Pakistan in accordance with the schedule mandated by the \n     Constitution of Pakistan, establish an independent commission \n     to guarantee that such elections are free and fair, and \n     permit full and unfettered independent monitoring of such \n     elections;\n       (4) that the Government of the United States should provide \n     whatever assistance is necessary to facilitate such free and \n     fair elections, including by supporting independent election \n     monitoring organizations and efforts;\n       (5) to call upon the Government of Pakistan to conduct a \n     full investigation into the attempted assassination of former \n     Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto and provide her and \n     other political leaders with all necessary security to ensure \n     their personal safety; and\n       (6) that United States military assistance to Pakistan \n     should be subjected to careful review, and that assistance \n     for the purchase of certain weapons systems not directly \n     related to the fight against Al Qaeda and the Taliban should \n     be suspended if President Musharraf does not revoke the state \n     of emergency and restore the Constitution of Pakistan, \n     relinquish his position as Chief of Army Staff of Pakistan, \n     and allow for free and fair elections to be held in Pakistan \n     in accordance with the announced timeframe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/08/senate-section/article/S14202-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 373--ENCOURAGING ALL EMPLOYERS TO TARGET VETERANS FOR \n RECRUITMENT AND TO PROVIDE PREFERENCE IN HIRING TO QUALIFIED VETERANS\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 373, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 373) encouraging all employers to \n     target veterans for recruitment and to provide preference in \n     hiring qualified veterans.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n\n[[Page S14233]]\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Smith, in honoring our Nation's veterans through \npassage of S. Res. 365. We are days away from honoring veterans for \ntheir sacrifices with a national day of recognition on November 11. Our \nresolution would urge the President to order a proclamation calling \nupon employers to make special efforts to recruit and hire veterans \nthis Veterans Day.\n  As chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am well \nacquainted with the employment issues facing veterans, members of the \nGuard and Reserves, and their families as they seek to move from the \nmilitary to the civilian workforce. Making these transitions is never \neasy, but for younger veterans it can be particularly difficult. For \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserves, the return to a job they \npreviously held may be challenging for a variety of reasons. For family \nmembers, the uncertainty of multiple and extended deployments poses \ndifferent obstacles. Finally, the obstacles facing those who are \ndisabled during their service can sometimes seem overwhelming. The \nneeds of these individuals deserve our utmost attention and resources.\n  Despite these problems and challenges, veterans make good employees. \nThey know how to work, and they bring with them a wealth of expertise \nand experience. I believe the employment data supports my belief since \nrates of unemployment for veterans generally are lower than their non-\nveteran counterparts. However, the rate of unemployment for younger \nveterans and those recently separated from active duty tends to be \nhigher than their non-veteran peers.\n  This resolution would highlight the actions that employers can take \nto honor the sacrifices of our Nation's veterans and allow them to use \nthe skills learned while in service to their country. Veterans have \nmade sacrifices serving our Nation. When they come back from that \nservice, it is our responsibility as legislators to aid them in \nreturning to the civilian world. Having a job can be one of the \ngreatest steps a returning servicemember can make in successfully \nreintegrating into civilian society.\n  I am honored to stand with my colleague in honoring the veterans of \nthe Nation, and I urge my colleagues to join us. It would be my hope \nthat employers around the country take up this proclamation as a best \npractice and continue to look at veterans as their first choice when \nmaking hiring decisions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nthereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 373) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 373\n\n       Whereas the people of the United States have sincere \n     appreciation and respect for the individuals who serve in the \n     Armed Forces;\n       Whereas in order to recognize their sacrifices, including \n     time out from their civilian careers while serving in the \n     Armed Forces, Congress enacted the Veterans' Preference Act \n     of 1944 to restore veterans to a more favorable competitive \n     position for Federal Government employment;\n       Whereas, although veterans acquire skills and qualities \n     during their military service that make them ideal candidates \n     for employment, some veterans need assistance in readjusting \n     to civilian life, including some young veterans who \n     experience high unemployment rates;\n       Whereas it is acknowledged that the dignity, pride, and \n     satisfaction of a civilian job are essential to the smooth \n     and full reintegration into civilian life of those who have \n     answered our Nation's call to arms; and\n       Whereas all citizens and all employers benefit from the \n     service of members of the Armed Forces and thus bear some \n     responsibility to assist in the reintegration of former \n     servicemembers into civilian life: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges all employers, private sector as well as State, \n     county, and local government, to target veterans for \n     recruitment and to afford qualified veterans hiring \n     preference similar to the benefits provided by chapter 33 of \n     title 5, United States Code, to preference eligibles, as \n     defined in section 2108 of such title; and\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/08/senate-section/article/S14233-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SUPPORTING DESIGNATION OF A NATIONAL VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT WEEK\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
