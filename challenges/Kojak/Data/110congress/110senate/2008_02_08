Mr. President, if people wish to come to speak today, they \nshould alert the staff. We are not going to have the staff wait around \nall day for somebody who might not come. We have had a busy week. \nStaffs work very long hours. Senators--if they are going to come and \ntalk--had better alert the staff or we are going to go out of session.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are back on the floor beginning the third \nweek of debate on the very important Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct, also known as FISA. We have had a great deal of good debate. We \nhave had a few votes.\n  Thanks to our leadership--Senator Reid and Senator McConnell--we now \nhave a plan to conclude debate and go to the critically important votes \non Tuesday. I thank all Members for participating. I know there are \nsome who have comments they wish to make today and Monday. Chairman \nRockefeller and I have spent 2\\1/2\\ weeks so far on the floor, and we \nunderstand the importance of moving quickly to get this measure \nadopted--gain approval from the House on a measure we can send to the \nPresident for his signature. I truly hope we can make that.\n  I express my thanks to Chairman Rockefeller, his assistant Melvin \nDubee, all members of the committee, Louis Tucker of my staff, and \nothers for bringing us to this position.\n  It is important to realize the magnitude of the danger we continue to \nface from radical Islamic terrorists. Probably no place was it better \noutlined than in testimony in open hearing by the leaders of the \nintelligence community. Director McConnell, head of the intelligence \ncommunity, outlined the major areas of concern, backed up by CIA \nDirector Michael Hayden; Defense Intelligence Agency Director General \nMaples; FBI Director Mueller, and Under Secretary of State Randy Fort \nfor the INR.\n  A couple things that came out may have been missed by Members who \nwere not fortunate enough to hear the testimony of Admiral McConnell \nand the intelligence community. I thought I would repeat a few of them \nfor you. First, Admiral McConnell made it clear that even though our \nintelligence analysts had the availability of collection, which \nindicated there had been a halt in 2003 to the weaponization program \nfor nuclear weapons in Iran, the threat that Iran poses remains great. \nAdmiral McConnell pointed out that there is no question Iran continues \nto try to enrich uranium, which can be used for nuclear weapon \nproduction. He also indicated they have the skills and the facilities \nto turn out biological and chemical weapons, and they are working on a \nmissile program. The halt in 2003 came, not surprisingly, after the \nUnited States went in and opposed the dangerous dictator, Saddam \nHussein.\n  It was the capture of Saddam Hussein that led Muammar Qadhafi, leader \nof Libya, to decide he didn't want to be pulled out of a spider hole by \nAmerican forces. He gave up his nuclear weaponization program. \nPersonally, I think it is no accident that the same activity in Iraq \nconvinced Iran that, for the time being, it was better to shut down \ntheir weaponization program. The top French Defense Minister indicated \nhe was not sure they had not restarted their weaponization program. In \nany event, we need to continue to be concerned about Iran and its \npotential threat not just to our allies in the Middle East, \nparticularly Israel, which Iran's elected leader, Ahmadi Nejad, vowed \nto annihilate.\n  Specifically, regarding threats to the United States, General Hayden \noutlined for us in open hearing--and more specifically in classified \ninformation--the number of threats that have been avoided, the plots \nthat have been deterred by our resolute action. And what helped us \ndeter the threats was, first, the active, aggressive move by the U.S. \nmilitary to disrupt the Taliban and take Afghanistan out from under the \ncontrol of the Taliban.\n  Afghanistan was a great threat and much planning was going on by al-\nQaida there. There are some on the news who continue to say Iraq had \nnothing to do with the war on terror. For those others who have looked \nat the information, that is an unbelievably naive point of view. David \nKay, who went into Iraq to conduct a survey of our inadequate \nintelligence information, said that Iraq was a far more dangerous place \neven than we knew. Terrorists were running wild there, Abu Mus'ab al-\nZarqawi, head of Ansar al Islam was active there, and later became the \nAQI, leader of al-Qaida there. Al-Zarqawi became famous when he \nbeheaded victims who didn't agree with him; he cut their heads off on \ntelevision. Iraq has been designated time and time again by leaders of \nal-Qaida, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, as the target for \ntheir headquarters. They want to establish the land between the \nrivers--the Tigris and Euphrates--as their caliphate. They stated that \nis their objective.\n  Were we to leave Iraq precipitously, not only would it lead to chaos, \ngenocide, and possible Mideast sectarian wars, but also it would ensure \nthat al-Qaida would have the opportunity to reestablish their \nheadquarters with recruitment, training, and command and control that \nwould significantly increase the threats to the United States.\n  This is why it is essential to continue our military support in the \nwar against terror and also provide the intelligence tools to the \nintelligence community needed to keep our country safe.\n  I thought it might be helpful to repeat a few comments that were made \nat that hearing. Director McConnell, along with FBI Director Mueller, \noutlined terrorist threats here at home--most recently, in New Jersey, \nIllinois, and abroad in Spain, Denmark, France, Germany, and the United \nKingdom. Admiral McConnell also said:\n\n       Al-Qaida remains the preeminent terror threat against the \n     United States, both at home and abroad. Despite our successes \n     over the years, the group has retained or regenerated key \n     elements of its capability, including its top leadership, \n     operation lieutenants, and de facto safe haven . . . in the \n     Pakistani border area with Afghanistan known as the Federally \n     Administered Tribal Areas or FATA.\n\n  To expand on that further, I will explain that people who think we \nare not doing enough to capture Osama bin Laden and al-Zawihiri, I \ncannot tell you how it is happening, but it is happening in \ncollaboration with our allies. But we have regularly captured or killed \nthe operational head of al-Qaida, the No. 3 man. Most recently, Abu \nLaith al-Libby, the operational head, was killed in some kind of bomb \nor missile strike. At the time, of course, he had a U.S. citizen with \nhim, apparently, Adam Gadahn, who had been cooperating actively with \nthe al-Qaida leadership. Now, it is a fact that Gadahn was a top \nterrorist target. But do you know something. Without having a FISA \nCourt order, we were able to go in and kill him--inadvertently, of \ncourse, but we would not have been, without the FISA law--particularly \nas we have updated it--able to listen in on his conversations. That is \nthe one great shortcoming we learned in Iraq when we met with the head \nof our Joint Special Operations Command, GEN Stan McCrystal. He said \nthe greatest threat to our troops on the battlefield was not being able \nto listen in on their electronic communications and see what directions \nthey were giving to the terrorist groups threatening our troops in \nIraq. That is why the outmoded, old FISA law we changed with the \nProtect America Act had to be revised.\n\n  In addition to the terrorist threat, there is no question that rogue \nnations around the world continue to seek dangerous weapons that \nthreaten America's security. Admiral McConnell also said:\n\n       The ongoing efforts of nation-states and terrorists to \n     develop and acquire dangerous weapons, and the ability to \n     deliver those weapons, constitute the second major threat to \n     our safety. After conducting missile tests and its first \n     nuclear detonation in 2006, North Korea returned to the \n     negotiating table last year.\n\n  We see that North Korea has signed on to the six-party agreement, \nsupposedly getting themselves out of the nuclear business, but some of \nus have grave doubts whether he will follow through. We need good \ninformation on\n\n[[Page S807]]\n\nnot only the intentions of terrorist groups, such as al-Qaida, but \npotentially on nations with nuclear weapons that have developed \nmissiles and the ability and the potential of delivering by missiles \nthe nuclear weapons against U.S. targets.\n  I close on the discussion of the threats by quoting from General \nHayden, the Director of CIA, who said:\n\n       We face an enemy that is clearly ruthless, but it's also \n     one that's very adaptive, one who shuns traditional \n     hierarchical structures, who learns from mistakes and \n     therefore demands that we be no less resilient and creative.\n\n  Suffice it to say that all of the members of the Intelligence \nCommittee said we must have the FISA bill Senator Rockefeller and I \nnegotiated and passed out of the Senate Intelligence Committee 13 to 2 \non a strong bipartisan vote. That is what we are here to pass, I hope, \nthis coming week and send to the President by the end of the week.\n  Admiral McConnell said:\n\n       The authorities granted by the amendments to FISA, the \n     Protect America Act, which temporarily closed some gaps in \n     our ability to conduct foreign intelligence, are critical to \n     our intelligence efforts to protect the nation from current \n     threats. Briefly, some of those important benefits in the \n     bill that was signed last August include: better \n     understanding of international al Qaeda networks, more \n     extensive knowledge of individual networks, including \n     personnel and planning for suicide bombers; and most \n     importantly, greater insight into terrorist planning that has \n     allowed us to disrupt attacks that intended to target U.S. \n     interests.\n\n  He also put in a very strong pitch for the Rockefeller-Bond \nbipartisan bill to extend the FISA through the FISA Amendments Act of \n2008. He thanked us and all the members of the committee for the \nleadership and hard work, and he said:\n\n        . . . and I would emphasize ``over many months''--in \n     drafting and passing draft legislation that governs and \n     enables this community. Your bill--draft bill provides the \n     needed updates to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n\n  He also went on to warn against dismantling that bill. He said:\n\n       Over the past several weeks, proposals to modify your draft \n     bill have been discussed. At the request of members, the \n     attorney general and I have submitted a detail letter that \n     addresses each of those issues, and it will be delivered to \n     you this morning. I would ask members to consider the impacts \n     of such proposals on our ability to warn of threats to the \n     homeland security and on our interests abroad.\n\n  We have received that letter. We have quoted from that letter and \nwill continue to quote from that letter on amendments which have been \nproposed that the intelligence community believes would hamstring their \nefforts.\n  As a sidenote, we were able, working on a bipartisan basis, to \nprovide significant new protections for Americans at home and Americans \nabroad who might be engaged in terrorist activities and are working for \nforeign powers as agents or officers or employees. These threats from \nAmerican citizens are sometimes as deadly, as dangerous as threats from \nterrorists abroad. We need to be able to listen in on them.\n  Finally, speaking about the civil liability protection for carriers \nwhich we included, he said:\n\n       Well, I would say, in protecting the homeland it's \n     absolutely essential. In this--it's absolutely essential that \n     we have the support, willing support of communications \n     carriers. In this day and age, our ability to gain \n     intelligence on the plans, the plots of those who wish to \n     attack us is dependent upon us obtaining information relating \n     to cell phones, the Internet, e-mail, wire transfers, all of \n     these areas. My concern is that if we do not have this \n     immunity, we will not have that willing support of the \n     communications carriers.\n\n  That quote was from Robert Mueller, Director of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, at a hearing.\n  General Hayden went on to say:\n\n       These are very fragile relationships. We lost industrial \n     cooperation, at CIA, with partners on the mere revelation of \n     the SWIFT program in public discourse. Not because they were \n     doing anything related to the program whatsoever but just the \n     fear that the vulnerability they would have to their smooth \n     functioning of their business had caused people, who are \n     otherwise patriotic and committed, to back away from their \n     totally lawful cooperation with our agency.\n\n  One other point. When there is talk about substituting the United \nStates as a party in litigation brought against carriers alleged to \nhave participated, we ought to take into account some very compelling \ncomments made yesterday by the distinguished deputy majority leader, \nSenator Durbin of Illinois. He pointed out that the release of a \nsupposedly confidential letter from the Department of Justice to the \nTreasury about the operation of one of the major exchanges in Chicago \nhad caused a $6 billion drop in the market value of that exchange. That \nmeans that people holding stock, many of them through pension funds or \nindividual accounts, lost a large share of money.\n\n  As I pointed out yesterday, having the substitution of the Government \nfor carriers, while it may remove them from the possibility of \nfinancial liability in a lawsuit, does not prevent significant damage \nto their business relationships here and abroad. The hit on any \ncarriers sued under a substitution agreement, even though it is \nsupposed to be reviewed in classified session by the CIA--everybody \naround here knows that if carriers are brought before the FISA Court, \nsomebody will be talking about it, it will become news. They will \nsuffer great harm to their business interests and potentially expose \ntheir employees and facilities here and abroad to violent attacks by \nterrorists or other radicals who wish to do them harm. As a result, \nthose carriers that have cooperated in the past or considered \ncooperating in the past are going to be advised by their general \ncounsels that they cannot do so willingly because they would be \nsubjecting their employees and their shareholders to great loss. I \nthink this is unacceptable. This is why I believe we have a good FISA \nAmendments Act before us, and we need to pass it.\n  We look forward to the debates today and Monday and voting on the \namendments and, I hope, passing the bill on Tuesday so the House will \nhave an opportunity to act. It is critical to the defense not only of \nour interests abroad but for the protection of American citizens at \nhome that, with the protections we have added in the bill that came out \nof the Senate Intelligence Committee, we also have the ability of the \nintelligence community to collect vitally needed intelligence \ninformation.\n  We have learned that tremendously valuable information has been \ncollected by high-valued detainees, less than 100 of them that the CIA \nhas captured. Less than a third of that 100 have been subjected to \nenhanced interrogation techniques. Three of them, as General Hayden \noutlined, were weatherboarded, and they provided in a cooperative \nspirit the most important information. Beyond that, electronic \nsurveillance is the best weapon we have to defend ourselves, to defend \nmajor population centers, tourist attractions, sporting events, and \noutdoor events from a terrorist attack. I hope all Members will keep \nthat in mind as they consider the amendments which will be brought \nbefore this body on Tuesday for a final vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n       honoring the 98th anniversary of the boy scouts of america\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Today marks the 98th anniversary of the founding of \nthe Boy Scouts of America. William D. Boyce incorporated the Boy Scouts \nof America, or BSA, on February 8, 1910. Boy Scouting had already been \nestablished in Great Britain a few years earlier by the father of \nScouting, General Robert Baden-Powell, when the American William Boyce \npaid a visit to that country. Legend has it that the Chicago publisher \nfound himself lost on a foggy London street. A Boy Scout came to his \naid and led him to his destination. When Boyce offered the boy a tip, \nhe refused, saying as a Scout, it was his duty to do a good turn.\n  Mr. Boyce was so impressed with the character of this young Scout, \nwho remains unknown today, that he was inspired to learn all he could \nabout the British organization and create something like it in America.\n\n[[Page S808]]\n\n  Congress granted BSA a charter in 1916. Today, nearly 3 million boys \nand over 1 million adult leaders participate in Boy Scouting. It is one \nof our country's most vital institutions to teach character, leadership \nand civic responsibility to our children. BSA membership since 1910 \ntotals more than 111 million.\n  With programs including Tiger Cubs, Cub Scouting, Webelos, Varsity \nScouting and Venturing, boys from as young as 7 to as old as 20 have \nthe opportunity to participate in Boy Scouting.\n  With parents often serving as adult leaders, Boy Scouting is actually \na family activity. Boys who are successful in Scouting often grow up to \nbe successful in life. My colleagues in this Chamber can attest to \nthat. We have 35 former Boy Scouts in the Senate of the 110th Congress, \nand 147 in the House of Representatives.\n  This Senate has 10 Members who have earned Scouting's highest \ndistinction, the rank of Eagle Scout. Every Boy Scout learns in his \nfirst meeting the Scout law, which states:\n\n       A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, \n     courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean \n     and reverent.\n\n  Our country is stronger because millions of boys have learned those \nwords. They are the values of Scouting, and they are the values of \nAmerica.\n\n\n                       honoring our armed forces\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a soldier who \ngave his life in the performance of his duty. On October 17, 2006, SSG \nGarth D. Sizemore of Mount Sterling, KY, was on patrol in Baghdad when \nhe was targeted by a terrorist sniper attack that tragically took his \nlife. He was 31 years old.\n  Staff Sergeant Sizemore had permission to take some rest and \nrelaxation at the base that day, but he bravely volunteered to go on \npatrol. After a first tour of duty in the strife-ridden area of \nFallujah, Iraq, this was his second tour of duty in that desert \ncountry.\n  For his bravery in uniform, Staff Sergeant Sizemore received numerous \nmedals and awards, including the Noncommissioned Officer Professional \nDevelopment Ribbon, the Bronze Star Medal, and the Purple Heart.\n  A fellow soldier once asked Staff Sergeant Sizemore how he felt about \nserving his second tour in Iraq. Staff Sergeant Sizemore replied, ``Hey \nman, I'd rather be at home with my wife, and giving my cat a hard time, \nbut if fighting the enemy here in Iraq keeps the enemy from fighting me \nin my own country, then this is where I belong.''\n  Staff Sergeant Sizemore had served in the U.S. Army since 1999, and \nboth his mother, Carolyn Sizemore, and his father, Glenn Sizemore, are \nveterans.\n  Carolyn and Glenn raised a boisterous boy who loved spending time \noutdoors, whether camping, kayaking, or rappelling. He participated in \nFuture Farmers of America. He enjoyed rock music and learned how to \nplay the guitar. ``He liked being active,'' says Garth's father, Glenn.\n  Glenn recalls the time he and a 16-year-old Garth went to a cousin's \nfarm to practice pistol shooting. On the way there, Garth told his dad \nthat he had dreamed the night before that, while shooting his gun, a \nbullet got stuck in the end of it. That very day, while target \nshooting, the same thing happened to Garth's pistol.\n  Glenn never forgot Garth's prophetic dream, and attributed it to his \nNative American heritage on his mother's side. An avid gun collector, \nGarth accumulated many rifles and pistols that he had gathered over the \nyears.\n  Garth attended Montgomery County High School and later received his \nGED. He attended Morehead State University for a while, and then chose \nto enlist in the U.S. Army as a career. Starting out with the \nmechanized infantry in Fort Hood, TX, Garth quickly advanced.\n  ``I loved working with Staff Sergeant Sizemore because he took his \njob very seriously and made sure everyone else took their job seriously \nas well,'' says SSG Raja Richardson.\n  ``When young soldiers arrived to the unit, Staff Sergeant Sizemore \nwould always remind us by saying, `These young privates don't know \nnothing but what we teach them.' ''\n  Staff Sergeant Sizemore took the responsibility of training the men \nunder his command very seriously. But that didn't mean his naturally \nengaging personality did not shine through.\n  Staff Sergeant Sizemore ``possessed a perfect balance of a work-play \nattitude, which was exactly what the young soldiers of his squad needed \nin training and in combat,'' CPT Michael Baka, his commanding officer. \n``He cared deeply for each and every member of his platoon, soldiers, \npeers and leaders alike.''\n  Staff Sergeant Sizemore served with the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry \nRegiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, based out of \nSchweinfurt, Germany. While stationed in Germany, Garth met Elena, who \nbecame his bride.\n  Sadly, Elena and Garth were married only 18 months before his \npassing.\n  My prayers are with Staff Sergeant Sizemore's loved ones today, \nincluding his wife Elena; his mother Carolyn; his father Glenn; his \ngrandmother Alliene Sizemore; his grandmother Dora Caldwell; and many \nother beloved family members and friends.\n  Garth's unit, the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, was \nknown as ``The Dagger Brigade,'' they had endured some of the roughest \nbattles in Iraq. Yet Garth never flinched from his duty.\n  The Sizemore family held Garth's funeral service in Greenup County, \nKY. Today, his wife Elena has embraced both the State and the Nation \nher husband called home by enrolling at the University of Kentucky and \nmaking plans to complete an ROTC program and join the U.S. Army.\n  This U.S. Senate expresses its deepest gratitude to SSG Garth D. \nSizemore for his service and sacrifice. Our Nation owes his loving \nfamily, who still grieve for his loss, a debt that cannot be repaid.\n\n\n                        sergeant robert w. ehney\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak today about a son of Kentucky who was \nlost to us in the desert sands of Iraq. On April 23, 2006, SGT Robert \nW. Ehney of Lexington, KY, perished from injuries sustained when an \nimprovised explosive device set by terrorists went off under his Humvee \nin the Iraqi town of Taji. He was 26 years old.\n  Sergeant Ehney was serving as the gunner in that Humvee. It was his \nsecond tour of duty in Iraq; he had served in the U.S. Army for 3 \nyears. For bravery in time of service, Sergeant Ehney received numerous \nmedals and awards, including the Noncommissioned Officer Professional \nDevelopment Ribbon, the Bronze Star Medal, and the Purple Heart.\n  ``I am very proud of the man he became,'' says Mary Beth Ehney, Rob's \nmother. ``He was proud of being a good soldier, he was a good father, \nhe was a good son, a good brother.''\n  Rob's father, William Ehney, worked for Federal Express, and so the \nEhney family moved around quite a bit when Rob was young. Rob attended \nschool in Centennial, CO, among other places.\n  Rob took up target shooting as a boy, and continued to enjoy it into \nadulthood. He played baseball, golf and soccer, rode motorcycles and \nwas good with computers. Rob loved to listen to music, and before he \nwas deployed his family gave him an iPod to take with him as a gift.\n  Most of all Rob loved playing with his young son Will, who is now 6 \nyears old.\n  Rob received his GED and then enlisted in the Army in 2003. He \nentered boot camp at age 23, a few years older than most of the other \nrecruits, who were 18 or 19. Soon his fellow soldiers gave him the \naffectionate nickname ``Pops.''\n  The nickname didn't just refer to Rob's advanced years--Rob took on \nthe responsibility of looking after his fellow soldiers. Both his \nmother and dad describe Rob as a caring person who saw his leadership \nskills blossom in the Army.\n  ``He told my wife and I that he was concerned about the young guys,'' \nsays his father, William.\n  ``He wanted to be all macho on the outside but a marshmallow on the \ninside,'' Rob's mother, Mary Beth, adds. ``He was just a kind person.''\n  Marshmallow or not, Rob had the bravery befitting a soldier. Once \nwhen he called his mother from a deployment, Mary Beth could hear \n``ping, ping, ping'' sounds over the phone. ``Oh, that's just snipers \nshooting at us,'' Rob told his mother when she inquired about the \nnoise.\n\n[[Page S809]]\n\n  ``Do you want to call me back at a better time?'' Mary Beth asked. \n``No,'' her son replied. ``They can't hit anything anyway.''\n  After Rob's death, William and Mary Beth received a letter from 1LT \nJames E. Harris IV, Rob's platoon leader in Iraq, telling them just how \nmuch their son strengthened the entire unit.\n  ``He was a rock in this storm we face daily over here,'' First \nLieutenant Harris wrote. ``It was apparent that many of the younger \nsoldiers found calm looking up to `their sergeant' after he lifted \ntheir spirits and encouraged them to drive on.''\n  ``More often than not I would walk away [after talking with Rob], \nribs hurting from laughing so much,'' First Lieutenant Harris adds. \n``He was the morale of this platoon.''\n  Rob had a fiance, Amanda Applegate, and they planned to marry after \nhe left active service. Both Rob and Amanda fell in love with Jessamine \nCounty, KY, just south of Lexington, and wanted to make their home \nthere. Rob hoped to become a Jessamine County police officer.\n  Rob's family held his funeral service in Lexington. The minister for \nthe service was the same man who had baptized him, and he told the \nstory of how the 6-foot-3 Rob had had to double over in the tank to be \nbaptized, and his knees never got wet.\n  Mr. President, Rob's loved ones have my deepest sympathies on their \ntragic loss. We are thinking today of his son Will, his mother Mary \nBeth, his father William, his sister Casey, his maternal grandmother \nBobbi Holst, his maternal grandfather Nicholas Reams, his fiance Amanda \nApplegate, and many other family members and friends. Rob was \npredeceased by his paternal grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. William Ehney, \nSr.\n  Sergeant Ehney's devotion to his duty and his fellow soldiers cannot \nbe denied. First Lieutenant Harris expressed this best in his letter to \nRob's parents. This is what he had to say:\n  ``Even though [Rob] did not pass away with his genetic family by his \nside, please know that his brothers were all by his side telling him \nthey loved him and that they would carry on for him.''\n  Referencing Shakespeare's ``Henry V,'' First Lieutenant Harris \ncontinued, ``[Rob] believed in the quote, `We few, we happy few, we \nband of brothers . . . for he who sheds his blood with me today shall \nbe my brother, and I his.' ''\n  No words can make up for the loss that Rob's family, fellow soldiers, \nand dear friends have suffered. But I hope the knowledge that Rob loved \nthose who were closest to him--his ``band of brothers''--and that they \nloved him in return provides some relief and comfort.\n  This United States Senate bows to SGT Robert W. Ehney's devotion and \nsacrifice. And we offer our deepest gratitude to him and his family for \nall they have given our Nation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n               Florida and Michigan Democratic Delegates\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have two subjects I wish to \ndiscuss for the Senate. The first is, with the dramatic events shifting \nas we select the nominees for President from our two great parties, we \npotentially have a significant train wreck that may start occurring in \nthe Democratic Party as a result of a divisive issue of seating the \nMichigan and Florida delegations to the National Convention because the \nFlorida legislature, a legislature that is controlled by the Republican \nParty, passed a bill that moved the Florida primary earlier than the \ndate allowed by the Democratic National Committee. In fact, it moved \nit, instead of the deadline of February 5, 1 week earlier to January \n29. The Democratic National Committee then stripped all of Florida's \ndelegates to the National Convention.\n  Mind you, the bill that was passed was an election reform bill. While \nit was being deliberated in the State legislature of Florida, in fact, \nthe Democratic leader of the State senate offered an amendment to take \nout January 29 and instead put it back to February 5, which would have \ncomplied with the Democratic National Committee's request and rules. \nThat amendment by the Democratic leader of the State senate was \ndefeated. The bill then went on to pass because it was an election \nreform bill having to do with the functioning of election machines in \nFlorida, something about which we are quite sensitive in our State as a \nresult of our electoral history.\n  As a result, the Democratic National Committee took great umbrage at \nthis and instead of their rules providing that they would take away \nhalf of Florida's delegates to the National Convention, they took away \nall of Florida's delegates and, in fact, the first four privileged \nStates that were allowed to have primaries or caucuses prior to \nFebruary 5--namely, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina--\nextracted a pledge from all the Democratic candidates for President \nthat said they would not campaign in the State of Florida. They honored \nthat pledge.\n  The election was held pursuant to State law, a law passed by the \nlegislature and signed into law by a Governor who happens to be \nRepublican. Because of that, Florida is being penalized by the national \ncommittee by not having any delegates.\n  In the meantime, the State of Michigan, under a Democratic \nlegislature, signed into law by a Democratic Governor, moved their \nprimary up to January 15. They had their primary January 15. Likewise, \nthe Democratic National Committee took away their delegates to the \nNational Convention. But the difference was that only a couple of the \nPresidential candidates' names were on the ballot because of a Michigan \nlaw that allows the candidates to withdraw their names from the ballot \nwhen, in fact, the Florida law does not allow that. The Florida \nelection, on January 29, had all of the candidates on the ballot.\n  Here is the coming train wreck: If one of our two leading candidates \ndoes not get a majority by the time all the primaries and the caucuses \nare over, with the last one being the South Dakota primary on June 3, \nif that does not decide who is the winner of the Presidential \nsweepstakes of being the Democratic nominee, then we go into a period \nduring June, July, and all the way to the end of August at the \nDemocratic National Convention, a period of enormous uncertainty and \nturmoil--first of all, the turmoil of whether the superdelegates, who \nare generally the members of the DNC, the congressional delegations, \nboth House and Senate, and the Governors, who are all unpledged as for \nwhom they would vote, so they would be getting in their back rooms and \ndeciding, and the turmoil of what to do with Florida and Michigan's \ndelegations.\n  Why is this important? It is certainly important to this Senator, the \nsenior Senator from Florida, because in fact, not only did Florida \nvoters turn out on January 29 for the primary, they turned out in \nrecord numbers. About 1.8 million Florida Republicans turned out, and \nthe Republican National Committee was penalizing Florida Republicans, \nnot by taking away all of the delegates to the National Convention but \nby only taking away half. Over 1.7 million Florida Democrats turned out \nto vote, and they expressed their will.\n  The turmoil is what to do about the seating of the Michigan and \nFlorida delegations. Just recently, the chairman of the Democratic \nNational Committee, an esteemed, very distinguished former Governor of \nVermont, Governor Dean, our chairman of the party, as reported in the \nNew York Post a couple of days ago, was proffering maybe having a new \ncaucus in Michigan and Florida as a way of selecting the delegates to \nthe National Convention from those two States. But, Mr. President, you \ncannot undo an election with a caucus, and especially you cannot undo \nan election where 1.7 million Florida Democrats have gone to vote in a \nsecret ballot and replace it with a caucus that maybe 50,000 people \nwould show up. It is a basic underpinning of our democracy, and it is a \nbasic\n\n[[Page S810]]\n\nunderpinning of a constitutional right to vote and to have that vote \ncounted.\n  So what do we do? I am certainly amenable for anyone who has a \nsuggestion to get us out of the potential train wreck because the \npotential train wreck could well be that if the Florida and Michigan \ndelegations are not seated at the National Convention in August, those \nare two key States that only 2 months thereafter would be voting on who \nis going to be the next President of the United States.\n  So with this speech, I am making a plea to all of our colleagues in \nthe Senate and beyond to try to find an accommodation in which the \nright to vote and to have that vote counted can be respected, \nespecially in the State of Florida where all of the candidates' names \nwere on the ballot.\n  That is the first issue about which I wanted to talk.\n\n\n                      International Space Station\n\n  The second issue about which I want to talk, and I want to put on my \nhat as the chairman of the Space Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, is the importance of the International Space Station of \nwhich the space shuttle launched yesterday successfully. And it was a \nmagnificent launch. They are now closing in on orbit onto the \nInternational Space Station. They are taking up a European module that \nwill be an important component of this International Space Station. \nThis International Space Station is two football fields long--this \nthing is huge--about 325 miles up, orbiting the Earth at 17,500 miles \nper hour.\n  The International Space Station was created as a multibillion-dollar \nfacility to do research internationally. One of the major experiments \nfor which NASA has yet to find space on the space shuttle to fly and be \nattached to the space station is the alpha magnetic spectrometer. This \nis an international consortium of some 20 countries and 50 universities \naround the world. It is being built as we speak. It is almost \ncompleted. It is being built in Geneva, Switzerland. It is looked upon \nas a scientific experiment that possibly several Nobel prizes will come \nas a result.\n\n  But we have to get it up there, Mr. President. And the NASA \nAdministrator, Dr. Michael Griffin, is saying: No, we don't have space \non the space shuttle. This alpha magnetic spectrometer was designed to \nfly in the cargo bay of the space shuttle. It takes up about 25 percent \nof the cargo bay of one space shuttle flight. The Administrator, in \ndetailed testimony in front of our committee, with this Senator \nquestioning him, said he doesn't have space. He said he had a couple of \ncontingency flights, after all the other flights are allocated.\n  Remember, the Administrator of NASA says his plan is to shut down the \nspace shuttle in September of 2010--and oh, by the way, we don't have a \nrocket ready that can start flying thereafter. The latest estimate is \nthere would be a 5-year gap, until 2015, in order to fly an American \nrocket with humans--called Aries--with a capsule called Orion.\n  Well, what do we do in the meantime? NASA is planning that we are \ngoing to pay for Russian Soyez vehicles. Well, what is the geopolitics \ngoing to be in the year 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, before we \nwill have a human-capable rocket to get to the international space \nstation? We are going to pay for Russian vehicles? In other words, we \nare going to lay off NASA employees and contractors in order to buy \nRussian vehicles in a geopolitical setting, and we don't even know what \nour relationship with Russia is going to be in the year 2011. If it \nisn't particularly good, what is the cost of that, or what is the \nability of them to say: Nyet, we are not going to sell you a ride on a \nRussian Soyez vehicle. Now, that is the danger.\n  So NASA is going to complete the construction of the space station. \nIt has two contingency flights. I said: Well, why are they contingent?\n  I asked that of Dr. Griffin, the Administrator of NASA, and he said: \nWell, they have additional equipment for the space station, and they \nhave extra spare parts we want to put up.\n  So I said: Well, then, you mean they are not contingent.\n  He says: Yes, I guess you are right, they are not contingent. But he \nsays: We don't have space to fly the alpha magnetic spectrometer.\n  What does this experiment do that all of these universities and all \nof these nations are so interested in getting it up there so they can \ngo to work? What it does is it identifies the origin of cosmic rays, \nand that means it can help us understand the origin of the universe. \nThis is not just an American experiment, this is an international \nexperiment of countries around the world. This is a part of us wanting \nto understand our beginnings. This is a part of our nature, as a \npeople, to want to explore the heavens and understand the universe.\n  This is an essential part of our space program, but the NASA \nAdministrator says he doesn't have space to fly it on the space shuttle \nand he is going to shut down the space shuttle in September or October \nof 2010. He said: You will have to put it over onto an expendable \nrocket, and that won't be for another 5 years. And instead of it being \n25 percent of the cargo bay of a space shuttle, for an additional cost \nof about $100 million, he is putting it over here on an expendable \nrocket, 5 years later, that is going to cost between $500 million and \n$800 million. Now, that is not a good tradeoff.\n  So how do we get it onto the space shuttle before they shut down the \nspace shuttle? There are three flights where this could be done. STS-\n129, which is set to go in August of 2009, has two express logistics \ncarriers. In fact, you could reconfigure that flight or another flight \nin July of 2010. You could reconfigure those two flights by taking some \nof the payloads on those express logistics carriers and creating space \nof 25 percent of the cargo bay and put on this critical experiment--the \nalpha magnetic spectrometer; or in the flight that is to go on February \n2010, STS-131, you could take the integrated cargo carrier vertical \nlight deployable and a docking cargo module, you could take that flight \nand you could reconfigure that integrated cargo carrier vertical light \ndeployable and create space for the alpha magnetic spectrometer. That \nwould allow the space shuttle to launch 8,800 pounds of these orbital \nreplacement units, plus the ICCVLD to the international space station \non the same flight as this critical experiment--the alpha magnetic \nspectrometer.\n  Now, why am I saying this? Because these are the specialists at the \ncenters of NASA around the country who are saying this can be done. The \nAdministrator tells our committee it can't be done, but it can. So I am \nmaking a plea. And it is not just this Senator because seated right by \nme is Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, during that hearing late \nlast year, making the plea as well. In a bipartisan way, we made the \nplea to NASA to reconfigure those last several flights to find room for \nthe AMS because if you don't, Dr. Griffin, if you don't, NASA, you are \ngoing to kill this experiment that has enormous support in the \ninternational scientific community, all of which is the very reason for \nhaving an international space station up there in the first place--to \ndo scientific research.\n  I hope all of the management of NASA will do a recomputing. My \ntremendous congratulations to them. And Dr. Griffin knows I have been a \nsupporter of his as he has turned around NASA, as he has taken very \ndifficult times after the destruction of the last space shuttle \nColumbia, and he has brought back NASA with a professionalism that is \nthe hallmark of NASA. The launch yesterday was another example of that \nprofessionalism, with that space shuttle closing in, as I speak, on the \ninternational space station to rendezvous, to dock, to deliver that \nEuropean module, and to continue to equip that international space \nstation to do what it was designed to do--scientific research.\n  Let's complete that task before the space shuttle is shut down by \nfinding space on the manifest to fly the AMT--the alpha magnetic \nspectrometer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      Russians Help Build Reactor\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is great to be with my colleague, \nSenator Nelson. His great knowledge of space and military defense \nissues is very valuable to this country. He chairs the Subcommittee on \nStrategic Forces in the Armed Services Committee, in addition to his \nNASA work on the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. I \nvalue his leadership and\n\n[[Page S811]]\n\nexpertise, and I am going to share some thoughts that dovetail nicely \nwith one of the points he was making about U.S. reliance on Russia as a \nlegitimate partner.\n  We desired and hoped as a nation that the fall of the Soviet Union \nwould usher in a new period of cooperation with Russia. We hoped they \nwould be a legitimate partner with us in improving both of our nations, \nand the world. We have the capability to create a partnership that can \nfoster progress, prosperity, and peace in the world. But the reality is \nthat a lot of things are happening to cause us great concern. We as a \nnation are going to have to face up to the fact that the Russians are \nnot reliable. They may not be reliable as a partner in space; they \ncertainly are not reliable in helping to contain the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons.\n  So we have some big issues facing us, and I thank the Senator from \nFlorida for at least raising that point about space.\n  Let me quote from yesterday's New York Times, an article by Matthew \nWald entitled: ``U.S.-Backed Russian Institutes Help Iran Build \nReactor.'' The headline alone is hard to believe.\n  This article begins:\n\n       The Energy Department is subsidizing two Russian nuclear \n     institutes that are building important parts of a reactor in \n     Iran whose construction the United States spent years trying \n     to stop, according to a House committee.\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       The institutes, both in Nizhny Novgorod, gave American \n     officials copies of sales presentations that listed the \n     Bushehr reactor, which Russia has agreed to fuel, as one of \n     their projects. One institute is providing control systems, \n     including control room equipment, and the other hundreds of \n     pumps and ventilation fans. The Energy Department is \n     subsidizing the institutes under the Initiatives for \n     Proliferation Prevention, a program set up in 1994 after the \n     collapse of the Soviet Union. The program was intended to \n     prevent newly impoverished scientists and their institutions \n     from selling expertise to States or terrorist groups that \n     want nuclear weapons.\n\n  A good goal, for sure.\n  The article goes on:\n\n       The United States supplements the salaries of scientists \n     and pays overhead at those institutes, according to the House \n     Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee. It was not \n     immediately clear whether the Energy Department was \n     contributing to the salaries of the very scientists involved \n     in the Bushehr reactor project. Two Michigan Democrats--\n     Representatives John D. Dingell, chairman of the House \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce, and Bart Stupak, chairman \n     of the Committee's Oversight and Investigations \n     Subcommittee--asked that question in a letter sent on \n     Wednesday to the Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman.\n\n  The article quotes their letter saying this:\n\n       What policy logic justifies the Department of Energy \n     funding Russian institutes which are providing nuclear \n     technology to Iran?\n\n  Pretty good question. It goes on to ask this additional question:\n\n       How does this advance our nonproliferation goals?\n  So I salute our House colleagues, Democratic Chairman Dingell and \nCongressman Stupak for asking these questions. The U.S. is going to \nhave to grow up and acknowledge some things are happening within Russia \nthat are not positive. We wish it were not so. We wish we could be in \nbetter shape with Russia today, and it is most discouraging and \ntroubling that we are not.\n  I had the opportunity to visit the Nizhny Novgorod region in the \nearly 1990s before I was a Senator. We spent about 2 weeks there living \nwith some wonderful Russian people. It was an exceedingly informative \nand wonderful trip and I value the relationships we built at that time.\n  But the Government of Russia is on a dangerous track now, I am \nafraid. We might as well begin to talk about it. Congressmen Dingell \nand Stupak's letter notes that in October 2007, the National \nIntelligence Estimate on Iran concluded:\n\n       Iranian entities are continuing to develop a range of \n     technical capabilities that could be applied to producing \n     nuclear weapons if a decision is made to do so.\n\n  If we will remember, the National Intelligence Estimate was written \nby a committee headed by State Department persons, not professional \nintelligence officers, who concluded that the Iranians were not \nattempting to build a nuclear bomb. But in that report they did note \nthat Tehran is pushing forward aggressively with creating a nuclear \nreactor to generate electricity, despite the fact that Iran sits on an \nuntold wealth of natural gas and oil. Also, the report buried the fact \nthat learning how to enrich fuel for use in nuclear reactors is by far \nthe most important step in building a nuclear bomb. If you can handle \nthat problem, it takes you very little time to create a nuclear weapon.\n  Mr. Dingell and Mr. Stupak go on to quote Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice in 2006 saying:\n\n       The United States faces no greater challenge from a single \n     country than from Iran.\n\n  So the Congressmen say this in their letter to Secretary of Energy \nBodman:\n\n       Given these dire warnings, it is troubling that the \n     Department of Energy would subsidize or otherwise support \n     Russian entities providing technology and services to the \n     Iranian nuclear program.\n\n  I would agree. This is not the first time this issue has been \ndiscussed. In December 21 of last year, Henry Sokolski, executive \ndirector of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, wrote in the \nWeekly Standard online that:\n\n       Perhaps the only thing more disappointing than Moscow's \n     shipment this week of lightly enriched uranium to fuel the \n     power reactor in Bushehr in Iran was Bush's endorsement of \n     it.\n\n  Mr. Sokolski quoted President Bush as saying:\n\n       If the Russians are willing to do that, [supply the \n     uranium,] which I support, then the Iranians do not need to \n     learn how to enrich.\n\n  So this apparently is a continuation of a State Department tendency \nto excuse problems with Iran and Russia. And the President apparently \nwas making a comment consistent with that view. The article goes on to \nstate:\n\n       Technically, this will only bring Tehran closer to getting \n     a bomb. If the fuel is diverted and used as fresh feed for \n     Iran's uranium enrichment centrifuges at Natanz it could \n     dramatically reduce the time and effort needed to make a \n     bomb's worth of weapons-grade highly enriched uranium.\n\n  Russia shipped 82 tons of lightly enriched uranium. At any time while \nit is loading the fuel, Tehran can seize it and have enough uranium to \nfeed its centrifuges at Natanz to make up to 150 crude nuclear weapons.\n  Former Under Secretary of State, John Bolton, repeatedly detailed his \nconcern over Russo-Iranian cooperation in testimony and speeches. Now \nthat he has left the Department, it looks as though people have decided \nto sweep the matter under the rug.\n  For an illustration of how dramatically our policy as shifted since \nMr. Bolton's departure, listen to this statement from a State \nDepartment press briefing in January 2003:\n  ``We believe that President Putin shares our deep concern at the \nprospect of a nuclear-armed Iran. We have made clear to Russia that any \nfurther nuclear cooperation with Iran, including construction of \nadditional power reactors, will assist directly or indirectly Iran's \nambitious request for nuclear weapons.''\n  So back in 2003, we were more alert to the danger posed by the \nBushehr project, and we were stating the unvarnished facts about it. \nThis kind of activity could only assist, directly or indirectly, Iran's \nambitious quest for nuclear weapons.\n  The State Department spokesman went on to say:\n\n       We underscored to Russia that an end to Russia's nuclear \n     assistance to Iran would allow the United States and Russia \n     to reap the full promise of our new strategic relationship, \n     benefitting Russia economically and strategically far more \n     than any short-term gain from construction of additional \n     reactors or other sensitive transfers to Iran.\n\n  And then he went on to suggest and state:\n\n       If the Russians end their sensitive cooperation with Iran, \n     we have indicated we would be prepared to favorably consider \n     such transfers of spent fuel back to Russia--\n\n  That now cannot be done legally without our accord--\n\n     an arrangement worth potentially several billion U.S. dollars \n     in revenue to Moscow.\n\n  So we had a carrot and a stick there. It looks as if it was not a \nvery good offer because the Russians did not accept it. They completed \ntheir work at Bushehr.\n  Now, with regard to the question of the National Intelligence \nEstimate on Iran, I believe that it created the very damaging false \nimpression that the Iranians had no interest in going forward with \ncreating a nuclear weapon. That was the headline that the press drew\n\n[[Page S812]]\n\nout of it. The Estimate, I believe, was written and designed to create \nthat headline. And the people who wrote it should be held to account \nfor the misapprehension they have created.\n\n  The NIE was done by a team under Director of National Intelligence, \nAdmiral Michael McConnell, and I guess he did review it, as did General \nMichael Hayden at CIA. But neither one of them personally signed it as \nan absolute position of the DNI or the CIA. Admiral McConnell testified \nabout this report at a Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing \nthe day before yesterday. He said this:\n\n       If I had 'til now to think about it, I probably would \n     change a few things.\n\n  He later added:\n\n       I would change the way we describe the Iranian nuclear \n     program. I would have included that there are the component \n     parts, that the portion of it, maybe the least significant, \n     had halted.\n\n  The portion of their nuclear weapons program that was halted was the \nportion which the intelligence community deemed least important; the \nmost important part is still ongoing. I say that to say we are not in \nsome academic exercise here. We are dealing with a rogue state, Iran, \nthat has been determined to obtain nuclear weapons and has been working \non it for years. The Iranians are receiving assistance from the \nRussians who, in turn, are receiving support and cooperation from us.\n  We are going to have to talk about this a good bit more as time goes \nby. But a lot of things are happening that are very troubling. As I \nsaid, I wish it were not so. For example, the Iranians tested a \nsatellite launch vehicle earlier this week. On February 4, the \nJerusalem Post reported that a successful satellite launch by the \nIranians would lead to ``a dramatic improvement in their missile \ncapability.'' Ahmadinejad was present at the launch site and gave \norders to launch the rocket himself.\n  This is what he said:\n\n       Our presence in space is a necessity. Any country that \n     respects itself should control the most advanced technology.\n\n  Does that include nuclear weapons?\n\n       We are grateful to God for witnessing the first and \n     determined step toward an Iranian satellite.\n\n  The Iranians are spending a lot of their money on satellites and \nweapons systems and even nuclear weapons. That is a fact. So we are \ngoing to have to reevaluate our relationship with Russia in light of \ntheir ongoing assistance to Iran. That is a fact. I wish that things \nwere different. They are not.\n  It is worth noting that there has been a string of belligerent and \nunwise actions by the Russians recently.\n  For example, in January of 2006, they cut off natural gas supplies to \nthe Ukraine, a deliberate act to try to pressure the Ukraine's--their \nformer satellite.\n  In May of 2007, Russian cyber-attacks shut down the Internet \nthroughout Estonia, a former Russian satellite, now independent. \nEstonia has no desire whatsoever to be back as a part of the Soviet \nUnion.\n  In August of 2007, Russian jet fighters invaded the airspace of the \nRepublic of Georgia and dropped a missile on Georgian territory. \nGeorgia is a free nation with elections and a highly intelligent \nleadership team, many of whom were educated in the United States. They \nabsolutely have no desire to fall under the sway of the Russians again.\n  But this is the way that Putin behaves. Russia has supported the \nGeorgian separatist movement. They have actively supported anti-Western \nopposition in Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan. They are ramping up their \nmilitary spending dramatically when there is no perceived increase in \nthe threat to Russia. What serious argument can be suggested that \nRussia is under military threat? From the EU? We cannot even get the EU \nto pull the trigger in Afghanistan.\n  Some of them will not even carry guns. They are not threatening \nRussia.\n  In the summer of 2007, Russia started bomber flights outside its \nterritory encroaching on the airspace of the United Kingdom, Norway, \nand Guam. In September of 2007, Russia loudly announced the test of a \nsuperstrength conventional bomb. In October of 2007, Putin announced a \n``grandiose plan'' to restore Russia's Armed Forces and develop new \nnuclear weapons. While we are dramatically reducing the number of \nnuclear weapons in our country, they are developing brand new weapons \nand testing missiles to evade U.S. missile defenses.\n  What about their relationship with Iran? Putin visited Iran in \nOctober and pledged enhanced Russian-Iranian cooperation, including on \nnuclear energy. Russia resumed work on the Bushehr reactor and provided \nIran with enriched uranium to fuel it. Moscow also conducted major arms \nsales with Iran, China, Syria, and Venezuela, including fighter \naircraft and antiaircraft missiles. With the Chinese, Russia has used \nthe threat of a veto to water down and block meaningful U.N. action on \nIran's illicit nuclear program.\n  One of the oddest Russian behaviors is their decision to trump up an \nissue over our perfectly legitimate and reasonable decision to build a \nmissile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. Putin says \nthat our decision to go forward with this project is a tremendous \nthreat to Russia, but there will only be ten defensive missiles \nstationed there. The interceptors are not designed in any way to defeat \na Russian attack, which would involve hundreds of nuclear weapons. But, \nno, they are trumping up a dispute between the United States and Europe \nand Russia over this. Some say it is for domestic political consumption \nto help Putin consolidate his power. Whatever the reason, it is not \nhealthy. This Nation has to wake up and be able to understand that \nRussia, fueled by all this new oil money and an increasingly autocratic \nregime under Mr. Putin, is not a healthy partner. We have to ask some \nreal questions. Are they going to be a legitimate partner for a better \nworld?\n  This article in yesterday's New York Times was very troubling to me \nand represents another example of confused thinking that may exist \nwithin the bowels of our Government regarding our relationship with \nRussia and with Iran. We have to be realistic and honest and accept the \nfact that things are not going well, that in many ways Russian activity \ngrows darker and darker and less and less positive. They continue to \nexpand their relationships with rogue states and bad actors, and \nfrustrate the legitimate actions of the developing world to create a \nmore prosperous economy and more peaceful world. We will probably talk \nabout this more as time goes by. We might as well start right now, \nquestioning how reliable Russia is as a partner.\n  Should we be participating in space programs with the Russians? \nFrankly, it has cost us more than we have gained from their assistance, \nexperts say. So this partnership has mainly been a good way for the \nRussians to gain insight into our technologies, but it has not been an \nadvantage to our space program. If we don't watch it, we will be \ndependent on them in a way that can keep us from following through on \nour goals for space.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Waterboarding\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to take a moment to try \nto clarify an issue that has caused a lot of concern for years now. It \nhas now come to a conclusion, and I am glad it has. I am glad to learn \nwaterboarding has not been used but three times by our country and has \nnot been used in almost 5 years. From the reports and statements made \nby Members of Congress and extreme groups around the world, one would \nthink we have had a systematic effort to waterboard people and \notherwise torture and abuse them. Only one prisoner has died since they \nhave been in U.S. custody since the beginning of the war on terror. We \ntreat them very well. I have been to Guantanamo Bay on more than one \noccasion. I have seen how interviews are conducted. So have large \nnumbers of our body.\n  As I indicated in earlier remarks, we wish the world were safer than \nit is. Unfortunately, it is not as safe as we would like. Those of us \nsitting comfortably at home forget the real threats out there. We tend \nto forget there are determined groups who want\n\n[[Page S813]]\n\nto attack the United States as they did on 9/11 and kill our people. \nThis is an unpleasant task. When confronted on the battlefield, in \nIraq, in Afghanistan, we shoot them and we kill them and we drop bombs \non them and we kill them because these are life-and-death matters that \nCongress has authorized. I wish that were not necessary. I know it is a \nfailure of us in some form or fashion. But as a practical person, we \nknow no other alternative than to defend ourselves. We are required to \ndo that.\n  I was reading an article from the Mr. R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr., in the \nWashington Times today. He talks about what Admiral McConnell, the \nDirector of National Intelligence, said a few days ago in \nhearings. Director McConnell said:\n\n       The number of terrorist attacks and deaths were greater \n     than in the past six years combined.\n\n  He was talking about the battle for Pakistan and its survival.\n  The article states:\n\n       Another [statement] from Mr. McConnell . . . is that al \n     Qaeda plans more attacks against the United States and was \n     working on a plan for attacking the White House as recently \n     as 2006. Homegrown al Qaeda cells here have been primitive, \n     but Mr. McConnell registered his concern that new, more \n     sophisticated cells might threaten us domestically in the \n     years ahead.\n\n  And that is a fair summary, I think, of Admiral McConnell's comments.\n  Since we have now openly talked about the waterboarding question, and \nMembers of Congress and the public have now gotten the information, I \nthink we need to make sure we know exactly how those three occurrences \ndeveloped.\n  The first thing we know is it worked. I hate to say, it worked. No. \n2, the Agency--only the CIA used water-\nboarding; never the U.S. military, never the Department of Defense; not \nin Iraq, not in Afghanistan--it was never utilized by our military, but \nthe Central Intelligence Agency on three occasions since September 11.\n  As the article says, they utilized it only on those:\n\n       [T]error leaders who have posed the utmost threat to our \n     [national] security, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, [who was the] \n     mastermind of [the] attack on our warship the USS Cole in a \n     neutral port.\n\n  We had hearings in the Armed Services Committee, of which I am a \nmember, about that dastardly attack. And I remember about a year after \nthe Cole was attacked--where we had 18 American sailors killed by this \nvicious attack; and it could have been a lot more--the Navy \ncommissioned a ship down at Norfolk, VA; and as we walked out of the \nceremony, a young sailor hollered out--and it still makes my hair stand \nup--``Remember the Cole.''\n  Well, we got the perpetrator, and justice was done.\n\n       Abu Zubaydah, [who was] the brains behind the thwarted \n     millennium attacks--\n\n  That we were able to block--\n\n     and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who directed September 11. . . .\n\n  The attacks on September 11. KSM, that is his name now for the \nprofessionals, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.\n  So I believe the Attorney General of the United States, after \nresearching this matter carefully, and after our intelligence agencies \ngave it thoughtful review, concluded we do not need to have \nwaterboarding now, that these three instances were justified.\n  Attorney General Mukasey, a former Federal judge--approved \noverwhelmingly by the Senate--was asked to make an opinion on \nwaterboarding. He said he believed those actions were justified under \nthose circumstances, and he would not say we would never ever do it \nagain in the future. He said circumstances would determine how you \nhandle those kinds of situations.\n  Let me note, again, for a lot of people, these are not honest and \nlegitimate soldiers of a nation state. The people who are subjected to \nthis procedure are persons who are unlawful combatants. They are \npersons who do not fight according to the rules of war, and they do not \nwear uniforms. They deliberately attack civilian personnel. They do it \nthrough subterfuge and violence, and their goals are outside all rules \nof warfare. Until some recent cases, they were clearly considered not \nto be provided any protections under the Geneva Conventions.\n  So I will say, Madam President, we hate to talk about these things. \nWe wish we did not face the kind of threats from the diabolical \nterrorists that we do. We wish we did not have to go to war and shoot \nand kill many of them. But we, as a nation--the Congress; both \nparties--have authorized that activity. We fund that activity. Our \nsoldiers are out there putting their lives on the line at this very \nmoment to execute that policy, placing themselves in harm's way.\n  I am glad the Attorney General has reviewed it carefully. I am glad \nhe is able to say waterboarding was utilized only three times, that it \nhad not been used in 5 years. But I am glad he also said he would not \nsay it would never be done again. This would be unwise advice to the \nenemy we face.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

KATHERINE MITCHELL\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I come today to honor one of \nthe great educational leaders of our time: Dr. Katherine Mitchell of \nAlabama. Dr. Mitchell is nationally acclaimed for her work in \ndeveloping the Alabama Reading Initiative, ARI. This scientifically \nbased program has not only been of tremendous benefit to students and \nteachers in Alabama but also in many other States that have modeled \ntheir State reading initiatives after ours. I firmly believe that Dr. \nMitchell's work will prove to be seen as resulting in the most dramatic \nimprovements in student learning in the last 50 years. Recently, the \nNational Association of Educational Progress, NAEP, test scores were \nreleased, showing Alabama to be No. 1 in reading improvement for the \nfourth grade. Between 2005 and 2007, Alabama's fourth graders made a \nsignificant gain of eight points in fourth grade reading. That is the \nhighest gain in the Nation. I must also point out that a number of the \nStates that are right behind Alabama in reading gains are States such \nas Massachusetts and Florida that have both modeled State reading \ninitiatives after the Alabama Reading Initiative.\n  I have spoken with Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings many \ntimes about Dr. Mitchell's work and the great things happening in \nAlabama, and she is ecstatic about the innovative ways Dr. Mitchell and \nher fabulous team have changed education in Alabama and across the \ncountry. I am always impressed with Dr. Mitchell's enthusiasm for her \nwork, and her strong desire to motivate and inspire educators wherever \nshe goes. She is a rare and admirable person, and I applaud the many \nways she has touched the lives of children and families around the \nworld throughout her life.\n  It is important to say, and not inappropriate, that Dr. Mitchell is a \nwoman of sincere and strong religious faith and that she has felt that \nher service is a calling by God. Such a conviction, it is plain to see, \nhas given power to her insight for improving education. An active \nmember of Frazer Memorial United Methodist Church, pastored by the \nwonderful John Ed Mathison, she is involved in so many good activities, \nwhile receiving inspiration that drives her work. I am sorry to say \nthat Dr. Mitchell is retiring from her position at the Alabama State \nDepartment of Education, and I know that this will be a great loss for \nthe State. However, I know Dr. Mitchell too well to ever think that she \nwill be less busy in retirement--she has far too much energy and too \nmuch to offer. I look forward to hearing about Dr. Mitchell's ongoing \ncontributions to our Nation with her expertise in education, and I am \nso thankful that Alabama's students, and America's students, will \nbenefit for years to come from her investment in a program that teaches \nchildren how to read.\n  Thank you, Dr. Mitchell, for your service. Your shoes cannot be \nfilled, I am sure of it, but I am also sure that the team you have so \ncarefully trained will continue to carry on your vision with the same \ncommitment and passion that you have so admirably displayed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/08/senate-section/article/S814-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 9:33 a.m. a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 5140.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to require the \nSecretary of the Treasury to transfer certain amounts to the State of \nColorado, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation--a \ncompanion bill will be introduced in the House by my colleague \nRepresentative Salazar--to ensure that the communities in northwestern \nColorado most affected by the enormous recent increase in oil and gas \ndrilling activities, especially those in Garfield and Rio Blanco \nCounties, immediately receive their fair share of the surplus funds \nfrom the Anvil Points cleanup fund. Our legislation will direct \nColorado's share of those surplus funds to land, water and wildlife \nprotection and conservation efforts, and for repair, maintenance and \nconstruction of roads and other infrastructure affected by oil and gas \ndevelopment in those counties.\n  Under the Transfer Act, Public Law 105-85, Colorado has not and will \nnot receive any of the leasing revenues from oil and gas production on \nformer Naval Oil Shale Reserve land until cleanup of the Anvil Points \nSuperfund Site is complete. Normally these substantial revenues would \nbe shared 50-50 between the State and Federal government under the \nMineral Leasing Act. Today the trust fund set aside for the cleanup of \nAnvil Points is in surplus, and that surplus currently amounts to \napproximately $66.5 million. The Salazar-Salazar legislation amends the \nTransfer Act to immediately release Colorado's share of the surplus \nfunds to Western Slope communities to mitigate development impacts in \nand around the former Naval Oil Shale Reserve in Garfield and Rio \nBlanco Counties.\n  The Anvil Points trust fund currently accrues approximately $1.5 \nmillion per month.\n\n[[Page S818]]\n\n  Under this legislation half of those incoming funds will go to \nGarfield and Rio Blanco Counties and half will go to the Federal \nGovernment. After the cleanup of the Anvil Points site is complete and \nthe Secretary of the Interior certifies that the Federal Government has \ncollected enough money to pay for the cleanup, the Anvil Points trust \nfund will cease to exist and oil and gas leasing revenues from the area \nwill be divided 50-50 between the State of Colorado and the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The oil and gas industry provides Colorado with much-needed revenue \nthat enables our State to flourish. We must ensure that some of those \nrevenues go back to the communities from which they originated. Our \nbill will ensure that the oil and gas industry does not leave the \ncounties of Garfield and Rio Blanco looking like a spoiled moonscape \nbut instead allows the watersheds and wildlife there to prosper and \ncontinue to be a haven for sportsmen and recreationists from across \nColorado.\n  Yesterday, I along with Congressmen Mark Udall and John Salazar also \nintroduced legislation that repeals the eleventh-hour money grab by the \nFederal Government in last year's omnibus appropriations bill that \nwould reduce from 50 percent to 48 percent the share of total royalties \npaid to Colorado and other States. The core underlying principle of the \nMineral Leasing Act--that our Nation and our States share equal claim \nof our precious mineral resources--should be maintained. Our bill \nrestores each State's share to its full, coequal 50 percent of mineral \nleasing revenues.\n  Together these bills restore Colorado's share of oil and gas leasing \nrevenue to its full 50 percent. With respect to the excess funds now \nheld by the Federal Government for the cleanup of Anvil Points, our \nlegislation will direct Colorado's share of those surplus dollars to \nland and water conservation, wildlife protection, and roads and other \ninfrastructure affected by oil and gas development in the local \ncommunities most affected by these activities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BARRASSO:\n  S. 2614. A bill to facilitate the development, demonstration, and \nimplementation of technology for the use in removing carbon dioxide and \nother greenhouse gases from the atmosphere; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on legislation I \nam introducing to address climate change.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to address a major technological \nchallenge that faces all of us. It is the challenge of how to solve the \nproblem of the warming of our planet. This bill is called the \nGreenhouse Gas Emission Atmospheric Removal Act, or the GEAR Act.\n  Members of this body have discussed various proposals to regulate the \noutput of greenhouse gases. Some advocate doing it through a cap and \ntrade approach. Others have advocated a tax on carbon.\n  Such proposals are aimed at limiting future carbon output into the \natmosphere. Many proposals have been introduced and debated using this \napproach of dealing with our carbon output. Overlooked in the debate \nare the greenhouse gases that are currently in the atmosphere.\n  The best science tells us that the greenhouse gases already in the \natmosphere are the gases that are causing the warming of our planet. To \nwhat extent, we are not certain. So let us resolve to find a way to \nremove the excess greenhouse gases that are already in the atmosphere. \nRemove them, and permanently sequester them.\n  To accomplish this goal, we are, as a Nation, going to need to make a \nsignificant investment to develop the technology. The approach my \nlegislation takes to address this is through a series of financial \nprizes where we set the technological goals and also define the \noutcomes we demand.\n  The first researchers to meet the criteria would receive not only \nFederal funds, but also international acclaim. The prizes would be \ndetermined by a Federal commission under the Department of Energy. The \ncommission would be composed of climate scientists, physicists, \nchemists, engineers, business managers, and economists. The commission \nwould be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the \nSenate.\n  The awards would go to those, both public and private, who would \nachieve milestones in developing and applying technology. Technology \nthat could significantly help to slow or reverse the accumulation of \ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The greenhouse gases would have to \nbe permanently sequestered. Sequestered in a manner that would be \nwithout significant harmful effects.\n  This is how it would work. There would be four different levels of \nprizes. The first level award would go to the public or private entity \nthat could first demonstrate a design for a successful technology that \ncould remove and permanently sequester greenhouse gases. Second, there \nwould be a prize for a lab scale demonstration project of the \ntechnology that accomplishes the same thing. Third, there would be an \naward for demonstrating the technology to remove and permanently \nsequester greenhouse gases that is operational at a larger, working \nmodel scale. Finally, there would be an award for whoever could \ndemonstrate the technology to remove and permanently sequester \ngreenhouse gases on a commercially viable scale.\n  There you have it--four different levels of development. First for \ndesigning the technology, then for a lab scale demonstration of the \ntechnology, then for a larger working model, and then finally, the \nproven use of the technology on a commercially viable scale. Once the \ntechnology is developed, the United States would share intellectual \nproperty rights to the technology with whoever invented it. This bill, \nas drafted, does not include a specific dollar amount for each prize. \nInstead, it authorizes such sums as may be necessary.\n  The commission will be directed to report to Congress 1 year after \nenactment of the law. The commission will recommend the levels of \nfunding that would be necessary to achieve the goals of this act.\n  I believe prizes can be a unique tool in creating technological \ndevelopment. It only seems natural that if we get all the best \nscientific minds thinking about the same problem, we significantly \nenhance our chances of solving it.\n  Historically, prizes have been used to spur all types of \ntechnological development to solve big problems. In 1714, the British \ngovernment offered the first prize of this type for a device capable of \naccurately measuring longitude. John Harrison, a clock maker, was \nawarded 20,000 pounds for designing an accurate and durable chronometer \n59 years later. This transformed our ability to sail the seas.\n  In 1775, the French offered a 100,000-franc prize resulting in an \nartificial form of alkali being produced. In 1810, the first vacuum \nsealed food was produced by Nicolas Appert, after 15 years of \nexperimentation, driven by a 12,000-franc prize offered by Napoleon. \nToday, vacuum sealing is still used throughout the world.\n  In 1909 the first flight across the English Channel was spurred by a \nprize offered by a newspaper. Charles Lindbergh was competing for the \nOrteig prize offered by the wealthy hotel owner Raymond Orteig, when he \nflew in the Spirit of St. Louis nonstop from New York to Paris in 1927. \nThe achievement spawned a $300 billion aviation industry.\n  The British Spitfire, the fighter plane that won the Battle of \nBritain, was developed as a result of the Schneider trophy, a series of \nprizes for technological development.\n  More recent examples include the creation of the X Prize Foundation, \nwhich gives multimillion dollar awards to the first team to achieve \nspecific goals. The X Prize Foundation began a revolution in private \nspace flight with the $10 million Ansari X Prize.\n  On October 4, 2004, the Mojave Aerospace Ventures team, led by famed \naircraft designer Bert Rutan and financed by Microsoft cofounder Paul \nAllen, captured the Ansari X prize for the historic space flight of \nSpace Ship One to space and back, twice within 2 weeks. Space Ship One \nis now hanging in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.\n  The U.S. Government also offers prizes through NASA's Centennial \nChallenges program. According to NASA, the awards are made based on \nactual achievements, not just proposals. The Centennial Challenges seek\n\n[[Page S819]]\n\nnovel solutions to NASA's mission challenges from non-traditional \nsources of innovation in our universities, in industry, and from the \npublic.\n  Most recently, Sir Richard Branson and former Vice President Al Gore \nannounced the Virgin Earth Challenge, a $25 million global science and \ntechnology prize. The prize was established to encourage a viable \ntechnology, which will result in the removal of at least 1 billion tons \nof atmospheric carbon dioxide per year for 10 years.\n  It is my hope and my goal that this legislation will foster the kind \nof solutions we need to address the concerns about climate change. What \nI am proposing is that we take a new look at climate change. With that \nnew look, our solution will be based on removing excess greenhouse \ngases that are already in the atmosphere.\n  We must think anew, and we must act anew. That sentence, ``we must \nthink anew and we must act anew,'' is engraved on a scenic overlook \nalong Interstate 80 between Cheyenne and Laramie, WY. It is engraved on \nthe pedestal that holds a large-size bust of Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln \nwas the one to have the vision for the Transcontinental Railroad. It is \nnow time for us, as Americans, to think anew and act anew about the \nissue of climate change and controlling greenhouse gases.\n  Americans have always looked within ourselves for solutions. We have \nalways had confidence in American ingenuity and American creativity to \ndeal with the challenges of the future. Yes, we want to protect our \nenvironment, and yes, we want a strong economy. The way to have both is \nby thinking anew and acting anew.\n  It is time to use our untapped human potential and American spirit to \ndevelop the technological solutions we need. It is now time for the \nU.S. Senate and for Congress to find a solution to global climate \nchange, not through limits but through imagination, innovation, and \ninvention.\n  I look forward to working with each and every one of you on achieving \nthis goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2615.

A bill to increase, effective as of December 1, 2008, the \nrates of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities \nand the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the \nsurvivors of certain disabled veterans; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President today, as Chairman of the Senate Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, I introduce the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-\nLiving Adjustment Act of 2008. This measure would direct the Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs to increase, effective December 1, 2008, the rates \nof veterans' compensation to keep pace with the rising cost-of-living \nin this country. The rate adjustment is equal to that provided on an \nannual basis to Social Security recipients and is based on the Consumer \nPrice Index.\n  Several of my colleagues on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \nincluding Ranking Member Burr, and Senators Rockefeller, Murray, Obama, \nSanders, Brown, Webb, Tester, Craig, and Isakson join me in introducing \nthis important legislation. I appreciate their continued support of our \nNation's veterans.\n  Congress regularly enacts an annual cost-of-living adjustment for \nveterans' compensation in order to ensure that inflation does not erode \nthe purchasing power of the veterans and their families who depend upon \nthis income to meet their daily needs. This past year Congress passed, \nand the President signed into law, Public Law 110-111, which resulted \nin a COLA increase of 2.3 percent for 2008. The 2009 projected COLA \nincrease is 2.5 percent.\n  The COLA affects, among other benefits, veterans' disability \ncompensation and dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving \nspouses and children. Many of the more than 3 million recipients of \nthose benefits depend upon these tax-free payments not only to provide \nfor their own basic needs, but those of their spouses and children as \nwell. Without an annual COLA increase, these veterans and their \nfamilies would see the value of their hard-earned benefits slowly \ndiminish, and we, as a Congress, would be neglecting our duty to ensure \nthat those who sacrificed so much for this country receive the benefits \nand services to which they are entitled.\n  It is important that we view veterans' compensation, including the \nannual COLA, and indeed all benefits earned by veterans, as a \ncontinuing cost of war. It is clear that the ongoing conflicts in Iraq \nand Afghanistan will continue to result in injuries and disabilities \nthat will yield an increase in claims for compensation. Currently, \nthere are more than 2.8 million veterans in receipt of VA disability \ncompensation.\n  Disbursement of disability compensation to our Nation's veterans \nconstitutes one of the central missions of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. It is a necessary measure of appreciation afforded to those \nveterans whose lives were forever altered by their service to this \ncountry.\n  I urge our colleagues to support passage of this COLA increase. I \nalso ask our colleagues for their continued support for our Nation's \nveterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/08/senate-section/article/S819-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 67--ESTABLISHING THE JOINT CONGRESSIONAL \n                   COMMITTEE ON INAUGURAL CEREMONIES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Bennett) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non Foreign Relations be discharged from further consideration and the \nSenate now proceed to S. Res. 432.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 432) urging the international \n     community to provide the United Nations-African Union Mission \n     in Sudan with essential tactical and utility helicopters.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, today, the Senate considers S. Res. 432, \na bipartisan resolution on Darfur cosponsored by myself, Senator Lugar, \nand a number of other colleagues. This resolution urges the members of \nthe international community, including the United States, to step up to \nfill a critical need in equipping the joint United Nations-African \nUnion peacekeeping force, namely, 24 tactical and utility helicopters.\n  Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has termed these aerial vehicles \nindispensable to allow the peacekeepers to carry out their mission to \nprotect civilians. I am pleased to see that several countries may now \nbe volunteering to begin to fill this gap. According to press reports, \nthe governments of Ethiopia and Bangladesh are discussing the matter \nwith the United Nations, and I hope that their contributions can be \nused to help meet this urgent need.\n  While I want to acknowledge these potential contributions, I would \nalso emphasize that other countries must do the same: the peacekeepers \nin Darfur need the full complement of 24 helicopters. Darfur is the \nsize of Texas. These aerial assets are critical. Our resolution urges \nPresident Bush to personally contact other heads of state on this \nmatter. I have been told that senior officials at the White House and \nState Department are continuing to engage in high-level outreach on \nthis issue. I respectfully suggest that this outreach should be \nelevated to conversations among chiefs of state. The United States has \nled the world in efforts to provide assistance to the people of Darfur. \nPersonally, I believe that we should also lead the world now in \nproviding the equipment or personnel that are needed to ensure the \nsuccess of the peacekeeping mission. Certainly, collectively, members \nof the United Nations should do so.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, \nand that any statements relating to this matter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 432) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 432\n\n       Whereas, on August 30, 2006, the United Nations Security \n     Council approved United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1706, providing that the existing United Nations Mission in \n     Sudan (UNMIS) ``shall take over from [the African Mission in \n     Sudan (AMIS)] responsibility for supporting the \n     implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement upon the \n     expiration of AMIS' mandate but in any event no later than 31 \n     December 2006'';\n       Whereas, on July 31, 2007, the United Nations Security \n     Council approved United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1769 reaffirming Resolution 1706 and stating that the \n     Security Council ``[d]ecides . . . to authorise and mandate \n     the establishment . . . of an AU/UN Hybrid operation in \n     Darfur (UNAMID) . . . [and] [d]ecides that UNAMID, which \n     shall incorporate AMIS personnel and the UN Heavy and Light \n     Support Packages to AMIS, shall consist of up to 19,555 \n     military personnel, including 360 military observers and \n     liaison officers, and an appropriate civilian component \n     including up to 3,772 police personnel and 19 formed police \n     units comprising up to 140 personnel each'';\n       Whereas, on December 31, 2007, the United Nations-African \n     Union hybrid mission formally assumed control of peacekeeping \n     operations in Darfur, but did so with only approximately \n     9,000 troops and police on the ground, far short of both the \n     authorized and necessary levels;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan continues to obstruct \n     implementation of Security Council Resolutions 1706 and 1769 \n     in several respects, including by refusing to conclude a \n     Status of Forces Agreement or to cooperate on issues such as \n     the force composition, the authorization of night flights, \n     customs clearance, land access, and visas for staff;\n       Whereas, on January 7, 2008, uniformed elements of the army \n     of Sudan attacked a clearly marked UNAMID supply convoy, \n     severely wounding a Sudanese civilian driver;\n       Whereas rebels, militias, government forces, bandits, and \n     others continue to prey upon the people of Darfur and upon \n     humanitarian workers, increasing the urgency of both \n     deploying the full complement of peacekeepers and police and \n     of reaching a lasting political settlement;\n       Whereas the preliminary results of a United Nations \n     assessment entitled the ``Food Security and Nutrition \n     Assessment of the Conflict-Affected Population of Darfur \n     (August/September 2007)'' reveal that global acute \n     malnutrition in Darfur increased in 2007, exceeding emergency \n     levels in some regions;\n       Whereas the United Nations-African Union Mission in Sudan \n     has been hampered not only by obstruction by the Government \n     of Sudan and other obstacles to peace in the region, but by \n     the failure of the international community to commit the \n     resources, equipment, and personnel needed to carry out the \n     peacekeeping mission, most notably the failure to provide \n     critically needed aviation and transportation assets;\n       Whereas the United Nations-African Union Mission in Sudan \n     needs, among other critical mobility capabilities that have \n     not been met, 18 utility helicopters and 6 tactical \n     helicopters and crews;\n       Whereas, in a report to the Security Council dated December \n     24, 2007, the Secretary-General termed these helicopters \n     indispensable and stated that ``UNAMID must be capable of \n     rapid mobility over large distances, especially over terrain \n     where roads are the exception. Without the missing \n     helicopters, this mobility--a fundamental requirement for the \n     implementation of the UNAMID mandate--will not be \n     possible.'';\n       Whereas a large number of countries possess the military \n     assets that could help to fulfill this requirement;\n       Whereas the United States continues to lead the world in \n     its contributions to efforts to end the genocide in Darfur, \n     including by providing more than $4,500,000,000 since 2004 in \n     response to the Darfur crisis;\n       Whereas continued failure on the part of the international \n     community to take all steps necessary to generate, deploy, \n     and maintain an effective United Nations-African Union hybrid \n     peacekeeping force will result in the continued loss of life \n     and further degradation of humanitarian infrastructure in \n     Darfur; and\n       Whereas it would be inexcusable for the international \n     community to allow an authorized peacekeeping mission \n     intended to help bring an end to genocide and its effects to \n     founder or be compromised because of a failure to commit \n     critical elements, such as the 24 helicopters needed to meet \n     the critical mobility capabilities of the United Nations-\n     African Union Mission in Sudan: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the members of the international community, \n     including the United States, that possess the capability to \n     provide the tactical and utility helicopters needed for the \n     United Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur \n     to do so as soon as possible; and\n       (2) urges the President to intervene personally by \n     contacting other heads of state and asking them to contribute \n     the aircraft and crews for the Darfur mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/08/senate-section/article/S820-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S820-S821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ESTABLISHING THE JOINT CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE ON INAUGURAL CEREMONIES\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nAUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE ROTUNDA BY THE JOINT CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE \n                        ON INAUGURAL CEREMONIES\n\n  Mr. REID.
