Mr. President, there will be a period for the transaction \nof morning business for 1 hour today. Senators are permitted to speak \nfor up to 10 minutes each, with the times equally divided and \ncontrolled, with the Republicans controlling the first half and the \nmajority controlling the final half.\n  At the close of morning business, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of H.R. 2419, the farm bill. As a reminder, the Senate \nwill stand in recess today from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. for the \nrespective party conference meetings.\n  I mentioned yesterday that we have a lot to do this week, and we do. \nI have spoken with the Republican leader. The House is going to pass \nthe conference report on Labor-HHS. As part of that conference report, \nthere will also be military construction and the veterans' benefits. I \nhave been told there is going to be a point of order raised against the \nmilitary construction-VA aspect of that bill. In fact, if that is the \ncase, we can set it up very quickly, as I explained to my Republican \ncounterpart, to find out if there are 60 votes for that bill without \nthe necessity of filing cloture. If, in fact, there are not 60 votes, \nthat part, of course, will be peeled off, and we will pass the Labor-\nHHS bill, and it will go back to the House. The House will concur in \nwhat we had done, and the President would be sent the Labor-HHS bill \nalone. We need to accomplish that work this week. We need to get our \nfirst appropriations bill to him--or bills, whatever the result.\n  As we speak--we started 5 minutes ago--the House and Senate conferees \nare meeting on the Defense appropriations bill. That conference will be \nwrapped up fairly soon. There has been a lot of preconference work done \non the bill. We have Senators Stevens and Inouye who have worked that \nbill for many years. They do very well with their House counterparts.\n  It is a huge bill. I don't know the exact amount--$470 billion or \nsome such amount. In addition to that, I think, as I told my friend, \nthe Republican leader, the senior Senator from Kentucky, a continuing \nresolution will be put on the Defense bill just as it was done last \nyear when Senator Frist was majority leader. That we should get soon. \nWe will get it in the next couple of days. And we have to finish that \nlegislation before we leave this week.\n  It is extremely important that we don't wait until the last minute \nnext week to take care of the Defense appropriations bill and the \ncontinuing resolution. That will leave us plenty to do next week. We \nhave a lot to do, not the least of which is the Mukasey nomination \nwhich the Judiciary Committee will take care of this morning. That \nmeeting also started 5 minutes ago.\n  We are on the farm bill. I will have more to say about the farm bill \na little later, but I do want to say this regarding procedures and the \nfarm bill. I have had some real good teachers over the years as to how \nto handle legislation. Some of those teachers have been my Republican \ncounterparts. No one was more versed in so-called filling the tree than \nmy friend, the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott.\n  We have just a few days until we break for Thanksgiving. This bill, \nthe farm bill, is a tax bill. It has tax provisions in it. So I want to \nmake sure everyone understands we should do all\n\n[[Page S13940]]\n\nrelevant amendments to the farm bill. There is no problem with that. \nThat is what I said we would do. But this bill, as I have indicated, as \nI learned from my friends in past years from teachers such as Senator \nLott, Senator Dole, and Democratic leaders, of course, is you have to \nbe very careful in the waning days of any work period because any one \nSenator can shut this place down.\n\n  So on the farm bill, that is not going to be the case. We are going \nto work to complete the farm bill. It is a good, bipartisan bill. There \nshould be amendments offered. We have a number of bipartisan amendments \nthat must be offered. We have one amendment that Senator Dorgan and \nSenator Grassley are ready to offer on payment limits. We have Senators \nLugar and Lautenberg who want to offer a whole substitute for this \nlegislation. So I hope we can get to this legislation.\n  I have been told one of the things the Republicans will do in protest \nof what I am doing, which has been done countless other times in the \npast, is to go into a quorum call and prevent us from doing work on the \nfarm bill. Everyone has a right to do that. We will have a few live \nquorums. If people don't want to do work on the farm bill, that is \ntheir right as a Senator.\n  The farm bill is something I believe we should do. I am certainly not \ngoing to file cloture on the farm bill this week. So if my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle just want to have us sit in a quorum call \nand not do any work on the farm bill and not do our other work, that is \nfine. I don't think it is very productive when I have indicated the \nfarm bill is certainly one where we can offer amendments relating to \nit, that will be relevant to the farm bill.\n  I, at a subsequent time prior to our getting on the bill, which will \nbe an hour or so from now, will make sure I ask consent that we handle \nthis bill with relevant amendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time I use and the time my \ndistinguished friend uses not count against the hour for morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/06/senate-section/article/S13940-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday we reached another tragic \nmilestone in Iraq. It seems it never stops. We lost five young American \nsoldiers. That means 2007 has been the deadliest year for our troops in \nthe entire war. In just a few months, we will be starting the sixth \nyear of this war. We have almost completed 5 years of the war. Our \nthoughts have to be, as they should be, with the families of the five \nlatest American victims of the civil war in Iraq. Our hearts go out to \nthe families--several score have been Nevada families--a total of about \nalmost 3,900 now, young men and women who have lost their lives, and to \nthe more than 30,000 who have been gravely wounded.\n  This war has caused so much suffering in America where losses \ncontinue to rise, not only in the loss of life and injury to our \nvaliant troops but our Treasury. The Joint Economic Committee is going \nto come out with a report soon showing it to be in the trillions of \ndollars this war has cost our country. That means our Treasury is going \nto be depleted for generations to come.\n  No one doubts that our military is battered, scarred, and stretched \nto the limit. And let's not forget about what is going on in Iraq. It \nis estimated that 2 million people have left the country. This was a \ncountry of about 25 million people when the invasion took place. We \nlearned today that 2.3 million civilians are now displaced, fleeing \nfrom their homes, their neighborhoods, their schools, places of \nworship. Violence is down, and certainly that is important and good, \nbut many of the experts are saying one reason the violence is down is \nthat so much ethnic cleansing has already taken place. It is true they \nfound 35 or 40 dead bodies today, and they are still finding them--not \nto the amount they were finding before. They were finding more than 100 \na day. Many of the areas have been ethnically cleansed.\n  Two-thirds of the displaced are children under the age of 12. This \nhumanitarian crisis rages with no end in sight. Two-thirds of the 2.3 \nmillion displaced are kids under 12. By the most critical benchmarks, \nPresident Bush's flawed strategy on Iraq is making America not more \nsecure but less secure.\n  We are seeing no signs of meaningful progress on political \nreconciliation, which is the key to success in Iraq. We have a civil \nwar going on with the Palestinians. Two factions are at war. We have \nLebanon, in effect, with an election that cannot be held because of \ncivil strife in that country. We have Iran which is causing trouble in \nthe whole region. And if a civil war in Iraq were not bad enough, now \nwe have 100,000 Turkish troops who have gathered on the northern \nborders of Iraq.\n  Our brave troops, more than 160,000 of them, are giving everything \nthey have to this war. Far too many of them have been buried; far too \nmany face lives forever marred by physical and psychological wounds. \nYet for all of our troops' sacrifice and suffering, Iraqi politicians \nare doing basically nothing. President Bush has said: As they step up, \nwe stand down. They have not stepped up.\n  What better reminder do we need than the crisis in Pakistan that the \nworld can change overnight? It is time to rebuild our military to \nrefocus on the war on terror and the grave challenges that face us \nthroughout the globe, not just in Iraq. We must repair the readiness of \nthe Army and Marine Corps, the finest fighting force in the world, but \na force that is under great strain. One only need look at the leader of \nthe Army, General Casey. He is saying that right now, and he has \ntestified under oath to that effect. We must be prepared to respond to \nnew challenges. We must have the strength and flexibility to promote \nfreedom and defend human rights when they are attacked. We must refocus \nour efforts on bin Laden and al-Qaida who threaten our safety, and it \nis long past time to give our troops the hero's welcome they so bravely \nearned. They need to come home.\n  After years of the Republican underfunding of veterans' care, \nDemocrats have provided $4 billion above the President's request to \nmake this failure right. President Bush remains obstinate. His allies \nin Congress have remained loyal. They have blocked our efforts so far, \nbut we will continue fighting to give our troops and all Americans the \nnew course in Iraq they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/06/senate-section/article/S13940-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13940-S13941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the farm bill, it is a 5-year bill, \nscored at about $280 billion. It is a bill we need to look at the \npositive aspects of, and I have done that on a number of occasions.\n  The nutrition title is one of the bright spots of the bill. Food \nstamp recipients under the bill will be allowed to spend more on \nchildcare and remain eligible, as well as save more for education and \nretirement without losing their benefits. Minimum benefits will rise. \nFunding for buying surplus food stuffs for food banks and other relief \norganizations have increased by $100 million each year. That includes \nover $1 billion for the School Lunch Program to provide fresh fruits \nand vegetables to these schools.\n  There are many other good things in this bill, and I was disappointed \nthe President again talked about a veto. This is a new word in his \nvocabulary, because in the first 6 years of his Presidency, he \nbasically never used the word. I should say the first 7 years. One year \nfrom today, we will have elections for a new President. So in the last \n12 months, in this man's Presidency, he has come up with a new word, \n``veto.'' Everything is veto--CHIP, WRDA, appropriations bills, farm \nbills.\n  Yesterday, I came to the floor to express my optimism for the farm \nbill. I said the bill is an example of the good work that can come when \nboth sides of the aisle work together. Chairman Harkin and Senators \nBaucus, Chambliss, and Grassley have done that. I also said this bill \nwould receive floor time for amendments dealing with the farm bill. \nApparently, the good work and good faith put toward this bill by \nDemocrats and Republicans does not count for much for the President. \nYesterday afternoon, Acting Secretary of Agriculture Chuck Connors \nannounced the President's intent to veto the farm bill--before it has \nbeen debated, before amendments are offered, and before, of course, it \nis passed.\n\n[[Page S13941]]\n\n  Here we go again, I guess is what people are saying. The President \nhas now threatened to veto 11 of 12 appropriations bills, including \nLabor-HHS, which provides crucial funding for schools, medical \nresearch, and police. He said he is going to veto WRDA, which passed \nthe Senate with 81 votes.\n  I am not alone when I say this latest veto threat of the farm bill \nrings kind of hollow. It rings hollow because Secretary Johanns went \naround the country giving lectures about the current payments system, \nwhat a bad deal it was. Yet the Bush administration had every \nopportunity to fix the issue of nonfarmers receiving farm payments. \nThis is what Johanns loved to go around the country saying. Why don't \nthey fix this? He is the Secretary of Agriculture, part of the Bush \nadministration. Yet even though he has gone around and given PowerPoint \npresentations to this effect, he should have been giving a PowerPoint \npresentation of why the Bush administration hasn't done anything to fix \nit. It can all be done by changing regulations. You don't need to \nchange the law.\n  What they now blame Congress for failing to do, they could have \nreformed--the ``actively engaged'' farming payments system--right now. \nThat is what they talk about all the time. They talk about people in \napartment houses drawing benefits. They can change it. The President \ncan do that. He has the power to do that. We gave him the power to do \nthat. We passed a bill 20 years ago that reformed the process. Yet an \nApril 2004 study by the General Accounting Office determined the Bush \nDepartment of Agriculture's track record in implementing this reform \nwas, at best, halfhearted, and that is being generous.\n  A problem exists in the farming payout structure. We have all heard \nof individuals who live in the city but claim they are farmers and \nreceive a subsidy. The Bush administration could change that with a \nregulation. The farm bill begins to tackle that problem--a problem that \nexists, in large part, because the Bush administration has failed to \naddress it.\n  Now, the President plans to veto a bill that reforms the payment \nprocess, while maintaining the President's administrative authority to \nact on it. This bill takes reform seriously. If President Bush were \nserious about it as well, rather than just looking at political points, \nhe would do something about it. He has the power to do something about \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/06/senate-section/article/S13941-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are now in the sixth week of the \n2008 fiscal year, and the majority still hasn't sent a single funding \nbill to the President for the 2007 fiscal year. It has been 20 years--\n20 years--since Congress has waited this late in the year to send a \nsingle appropriations bill to the President. The Veterans \nappropriations bill, for example, passed the Senate 2 months ago but is \nstill sitting in Congress.\n  So why do our friends on the other side of the aisle continue to drag \ntheir feet on this very important measure? We know everyone agrees the \nbill is important and needed. We know our veterans have sacrificed for \nour country, and it is our duty--our duty--to provide for them. We know \nthe bill holds wide bipartisan support, and the military construction \npart of the bill is important for providing housing, readiness, and \nimproved quality of life for our troops. We also know the President \nwill sign the veterans bill into law when he gets it. So why hasn't \nthis bill been brought to the floor for a vote? Why haven't we had a \nvote on the veterans conference report? Shouldn't we put aside the \ngamesmanship and send this bill to the President so it can be signed \nbefore November 11, which happens to be Veterans Day?\n  The majority has decided it wants to tie the veterans bill, which \nwill be signed into law, to the Labor bill, which is approximately $9 \nbillion over the President's request, which, of course, will be vetoed. \nNow, some have said $9 billion is not much of a difference, but to put \nit into context, $9 billion is more than the individual budgets of 33 \nof our States. It is more than the entire yearly budget for the FBI. It \nis more than the budget of the U.S. Coast Guard. More than that, this \nfigure will serve as a starting point for next year's budget, and that \nwill serve as the starting point for the year after that. In short, \nthis increase will compound into $120 billion in more Washington \nspending over the next 10 years.\n  To put this in context, for American taxpayers, for this same amount \nof money, we could have, instead, made permanent marriage penalty \nrelief and permanent the expensing for small business and have \nincreased taxpayers' standard deduction or we could have provided a 2-\nyear alternative minimum tax patch.\n  So why attach a bill that overspends so dramatically it would not be \nsigned into law and further postpone funding for our veterans? Our \nveterans deserve better. We shouldn't penalize them for the \nmismanagement and overspending of this Congress. We have a \nresponsibility to send the veterans bill to the President at the \nearliest possible time. Providing funding to our veterans by Veterans \nDay, November 11, is still a realistic and attainable goal, and \nCongress should do it.\n  The election was 1 year ago. It is time to get serious about funding \nour veterans. We must remember our current force is composed entirely \nof volunteers, and they have earned our support. If our colleagues are \nserious, they will bring the veterans bill to the floor. No gimmicks, \nno games. Let us get it done before Veterans Day.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/06/senate-section/article/S13941-3", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is a pleasure to rise today to \nrecognize the work of some remarkable Georgians, Ed and Mary Ettel, of \nMarietta, who happen to be in the gallery this morning. The Ettels have \nworked together in their community to help touch the lives of our men \nand women in uniform. Guided by the Any Soldier Foundation, Ed and Mary \nsend requested goods to our soldiers serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nKyrgyzstan, Somalia, and Kosovo. Soldiers can go to www.anysoldier.com \nand request what specifically they need and want. Good people such as \nthe Ettels are making sure these soldiers' requests do not go \nunnoticed.\n  Serving 4 years of Active Duty in the U.S. Navy and 22 years on \nReserve Duty, Ed Ettel undoubtedly knows what it means to sacrifice for \nhis country. However, his loyalties to his fellow men and women in \nuniform did not end with his retirement. Together with his wife Mary, \nand daughters Erin and Alison, the Ettels committed themselves to being \na support group for those who are serving overseas today.\n  For the Ettels, many Saturdays over the past 2 years have been \nsimilar to last Saturday. The smell of pancakes usually welcomes 40 \nvolunteers arriving at the Ettel's house at Sope Creek Farm. After \nbreakfast, the volunteers pick a soldier's request from the Any Soldier \nWeb site, take it into the inventory room, and pack boxes with food, \nmagazines, school supplies, clothing, toys or Christmas decorations. \nThey also include a handwritten letter of support to each individual \nsoldier, thanking them for their service.\n  Because of the Ettels' community leadership and the help they have \nreceived from the other members of the Mount Bethel United Methodist \nChurch in Marietta, volunteers have been able\n\n[[Page S13942]]\n\nto collectively send 496 boxes, weighing over 4 tons, to servicemembers \nin theaters around the globe.\n  One of the most fulfilling parts of the experience for these \nvolunteers is how the soldiers respond. There have been countless \nthank-you and appreciation notes sent from the soldiers, letting them \nknow how great it is that people back home support them and acknowledge \nthe sacrifices they are making.\n  It is unclear whether the motivation behind the Ettels' generosity \ncomes from Mary's history as a public servant in our school system, \nEd's service to his country in the Navy as well as the Navy Reserve or \nif it is out of sheer gratitude for the Nation in which they live. It \nis clear the Ettels' appreciation for the troops and their love of \ncountry has been contagious among civic organizations, school groups, \nchurch groups, businesses, and fellow members of their community.\n  People such as the Ettels make this Nation the greatest in the world. \nI am proud to say such patriotic Americans live in my home State of \nGeorgia. Words cannot express America's gratitude for our Armed Forces \nand their service and sacrifice for this Nation. As Veterans Day \napproaches, we should all remember to acknowledge those sacrifices, and \nI challenge all Americans to follow the lead of Mary and Ed Ettel in \nfinding a way to say thank you.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today to discuss the progress we are \nmaking in Iraq. Over the past few months, we have witnessed some \nencouraging developments, and I think it is important to acknowledge \nthe successes of our men and women in uniform and the successes of the \nIraqi people in helping to secure their own Nation.\n  Since the troop surge was fully implemented, in June 2007, we have \nseen a steady decline in Iraqi civilian deaths, a decline in the number \nof bombings, and a decline in the number of incidents involving the \nmost deadly form of roadside bombs known as explosively formed \npenetrators.\n  We have sent our forces into Iraqi neighborhoods in order to root out \nextremists and gain the trust and confidence of the people, and we are \nseeing encouraging results. Since the surge of operations began in \nJune, the number of IED attacks per week has declined by half. U.S. \nmilitary deaths have fallen to their lowest level in 19 months.\n  One year ago, Al Anbar was thought to be lost to the enemy. At the \ntime, al-Qaida staged a parade in the city streets to flaunt its \ncontrol. Last week, there was another parade in Al Anbar Province. Only \nthis time it was a parade of Iraqi citizens and Iraqi forces who had \nreclaimed their homes and driven the terrorists out. Iraqi forces have \nnow assumed responsibility for security in 8 of the 18 Iraqi provinces. \nAcross the country, brave Iraqis are increasingly taking on \nresponsibility for their own safety and security.\n  The improvements we are witnessing in Iraq further confirm the report \ngiven by GEN David Petraeus, Commanding General of the Multinational \nForces in Iraq, before Congress in September regarding the troop surge. \nWhile testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, he stated:\n\n       The military objectives of the surge are in large measure \n     being met. In recent months, in the face of tough enemies and \n     the brutal summer heat of Iraq, coalition and Iraqi security \n     forces have achieved progress in this arena.\n\n  Our enemies see the changes underway and increasingly fear they are \non the wrong side of events. Day by day, our forces are seizing the \ninitiative from the enemy. Osama bin Laden, who is in hiding out of \nfear of U.S. forces, has publicly expressed concern about al-Qaida's \nrecent setback in Iraq. In an audiotape, he talks about the mistakes \nal-Qaida has made and urges terrorists to overcome what he says are \ngrowing divisions in their ranks.\n  This return on our success in Iraq means we are slowly beginning to \nbring some of our forces home, and we are doing it from a position of \nstrength. The military did not replace 2,200 Marines who came home from \nAl Anbar Province in September, and we will also bring home an Army \ncombat brigade, for a total force reduction of 5,700 troops by \nChristmas.\n  While there is good news in Iraq, news that is important for the \nAmerican people to hear, there are also remaining challenges we need to \nbe realistic about. Parts of Iraq continue to be violent and difficult.\n  The terrorists are still capable of carrying out attacks that will \ndominate headlines, and the Iraqi security forces will continue to \nrequire U.S. support. Now is certainly not the time to give up, \nrestrict funding, or set a surrender date, as some in this body have \nargued we should do.\n  As we continue to debate Iraq in the body in the coming months, I \nhope we can all acknowledge there has been real progress, and work \ntogether to ensure this progress is not wasted. That approach is \nclearly in the interests of all Americans and is in the interests of \nthe Iraqi people as well.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a Member from \na State with a strong military presence, I am committed to supporting \nour troops and their families and making sure their needs are met.\n  Clearly our military has answered the call of duty and they continue \nto perform courageously, and I for one will do whatever I can to ensure \nthey have the resources and equipment to continue executing their \nmission, and that their families back home receive the support and \nassistance that we owe them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am honored to join Senator Chambliss of \nGeorgia in paying tribute to Ed and Mary Ettel, my neighbors, as a \nmatter of fact, in East Cobb County, Marietta, Georgia. I live about a \nmile and a half from their home, and my son and daughter-in-law attend \nMount Bethel United Methodist Church, where they are active members, a \ngreat church with a great minister, Randy Mickler, who does such a good \njob inspiring his congregation to do so many good things.\n  Ed and Mary do a tremendous service to our men and women in harm's \nway. I add my praise of them to the praise of Senator Chambliss. I \nthank them for the example they set and the blessing they are to our \nsoldiers.\n  I too want to talk for a second about Iraq, about the war in Iraq, \nand refresh some memories. Twice this year on the floor of this Senate, \nonce before Memorial Day and once before the August break, we had \nheated 1-week-long debates of whether the United States of America \nshould declare that we have lost and should leave Iraq. In fact, \nearlier this year, one Member of this body actually declared the war \nwas lost. Well, as Senator Chambliss has acknowledged, things have \nturned in Iraq. And they have turned because of the sacrifice of our \nyoung men and women fighting in harm's way. They have turned because of \nthe determination of a President who understands the threat of \nterrorism around the world, and the agents of terror, and those who \nwould harbor terrorists. Iraq is turning. We cannot declare victory in \nthe sense of a declaration of it being lost was declared earlier this \nyear, but we can declare and acknowledge that progress has been made \nand the country has accomplished a number of the enumerated goals we \nset out to accomplish when we went into Iraq.\n  In fact, if everyone will recall the President's speech 4 days before \nwe went into Iraq, he established three goals for this country going \ninto Iraq. No. 1 was to depose Saddam Hussein, and to find those \nweapons of mass destruction or their components that U.N. Resolution \n1441 declared were there; second, to allow the Iraqi people to hold \nfree elections and to write a constitution of their own, and establish \na government of their determination; third was to train the Iraqi \nmilitary to a capability of defending that new fledgling government.\n  Saddam Hussein has been deposed, was tried by a jury of his peers \nunder Iraqi law. There are those who say we found no weapons of mass \ndestruction, but they overlooked all of the components that we found, \nScud missiles buried in the sand between Damascus and Baghdad, elements \nof sarin gas, 4 of the 7 mobile biological labs, 400,000 bodies in mass \ngraves; all the signs, the telltale signs of the horror and the terror \nof mass destruction.\n  Goal No. 2, the Iraqis held free elections in 14 months, wrote a \nconstitution, established the government. Mission accomplished there.\n  And then, No. 3, to train the Iraqi military sufficiently to sustain \npeace\n\n[[Page S13943]]\n\nfor that fledgling government. We are not there yet, but we are moving \nso much closer. It should be noted that a few weeks ago, when all the \npress noted the British had left Basra and what a disappointment that \nwas, nobody took note of the fact that it was the Iraqi army that \nreplaced them, not the American army, not coalition forces but the \nIraqi army, trained and capable of doing it.\n  Of the al-Qaida operatives who have been captured or killed in the \nlast 6 weeks, the majority of them have been operations of Iraqi \nsoldiers, not American soldiers. The fact is, goal No. 3, training an \nadequate and sufficient military to protect the fledgling government, \nis not at hand, but it is getting closer.\n  So it is time today, on the week before the Veterans Day holiday, and \nVeterans Day in this country, to pay tribute to the men and women who \nhave sacrificed for this country, for freedom, and for the fight in the \nwar on terrorism.\n  I carry with me a dogtag. This dogtag is SGT Mike Stokely's. Sergeant \nStokely was killed in Iraq in September of 2005. I met his dad shortly \nafter he had lost his son and, in fact, had lunch with his dad 3 weeks \nago in Fayetteville, GA. I wanted to pay tribute to Mike and Noah \nHarris, another soldier from Georgia whose parents I have spent so much \ntime with, and reflect for a moment on what they always tell me every \ntime I see them. They said: Make sure you tell people that my son did \nnot fight and die in vain, but what he sacrificed for is a country that \nseeks to end terror, end the threat of terror, and promote democracy \naround the world.\n  Well, to Bob Stokely, Mike's dad, to Lisa Harris, Noah's mom, I say: \nThey did not die in vain. The evidence in Iraq across the board is \nproving that their hard work and their sacrifice has made a difference. \nIf we can stay the course, support our troops, finish the training of \nthe Iraqi military, the American forces can leave in large amount and \nleave the Iraqis to protect that free, self-determined government of \ntheir own.\n  It is time we acknowledge the success of our men and women in the \nU.S. military. It is time for us to say thank you for what they have \ndone, and to look to the day that their effort makes us as Americans \nand the world a safer and a better place. Yes, the Iraq news is good. \nThe war is not over. The progress is great, we need to stay the course, \nand finish the deal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time in morning \nbusiness this side has remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority has 16 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues from Georgia, \nSenators Chambliss and Isakson, in talking about the news from Iraq. It \nis important as we discuss the challenges we still face and that the \nIraqi people still face in Iraq to talk about the complete picture. \nUnfortunately, while we have heard much of violence in Iraq, and the \nchallenges that face us, we have not heard enough about the successes \nthe American military and our Iraqi allies are meeting with in that \ncountry.\n  It wasn't that long ago that the surge General Petraeus, the \ncounterinsurgency strategy that he is the architect of and which he has \nexecuted, was called a failure on the floor of the Senate. It is \nironic, looking back, as sometimes it is helpful to go back and learn \nfrom history--and you do not have to go back very far, actually, just \nthe summer and the spring of this year--when leaders on the other side \nof the aisle called the surge a failure.\n  The most ironic part of it is that General Petraeus, the commander of \nthe multinational forces in Iraq at the time, said: We have not even \nstarted the surge yet, so let me have a few months.\n  Well, General Petraeus has now had a few months, and the surge has \nnow had an opportunity to make a difference. In fact, there is much \npositive news to report. I have to think the biggest mistake the \nnaysayers have made is to bet against the men and women of the U.S. \nmilitary. That is always a mistake, because the American military men \nand women have demonstrated they can accomplish the goals they set out \nto do, and they are making a tremendous difference in Iraq in \neliminating terrorist strongholds, as we continue to train the Iraqi \nmilitary to take our place.\n  As I have always said, we all want to bring our troops home. The \nquestion is, are we going to bring our troops home based on conditions \non the ground and the Iraqis' ability to secure and stabilize their own \ncountry or are we going to do it regardless of the consequences in a \nway that will create the potential for a failed state in Iraq, another \nterrorist haven, and encourage our sworn enemies in Iran and elsewhere, \nembolden them to think that America cannot be trusted and America will \nturn its back on our allies?\n  In May, one of our senior colleagues said the surge was supposed to \nbring stability essential to political reconciliation and economic \nreconstruction. But he said at the time: It has not and it will not. \nOne short month later, the majority leader and the Speaker of the \nHouse, in a letter to the President, wrote: As many had foreseen, the \nescalation has failed to produce the intended results. The increase in \nU.S. forces has had little impact in curbing the violence or fostering \npolitical reconciliation.\n  We even bore witness to atrocious ads run by organizations such as \nmoveon.org slandering General Petraeus before he even had a chance to \ncome here and to report on the status of the surge in September.\n  Well, the numbers do not lie, to the dismay of many Americans. Some \nof my colleagues have chosen to conveniently gloss over and try to \nexplain away the progress that has been made by General Petraeus's \ncounterinsurgency strategy. Far from being a simple increase in troops, \nwe learned General Petraeus's strategy was a new way to attack the \nenemy in Iraq, that is, utilize support from both local Iraqi citizens \nand tribal leaders to form an offensive against insurgent and terrorist \ngroups, and the strategy has met with a resounding success.\n  It has become a common story, but one worth repeating, that Al Anbar \nProvince, a Sunni stronghold, was virtually overrun and lost to \nAmerican and Iraqi forces, because al-Qaida basically had its way with \nthat region, had terrorized the people so much that they would not \nstand up and fight them and basically were being held as victims of \nterror.\n  Now the so-called Anbar awakening has occurred. Tribal leaders have \ncome forward and volunteered their people to serve in the Iraqi police \nforce and the Iraqi security forces. Now Al Anbar Province has \nessentially been rid of organized al-Qaida strongholds.\n  The Washington Post editorial page on October 14 recognized the \ndecreased violence in Iraq and noted that evidence of a drop in \nviolence in Iraq is becoming hard to dispute. In September, Iraqi \ncivilian deaths were down 52 percent from August, and 77 percent from \nSeptember. The Iraqi Health Ministry and the Associated Press reported \nsimilar results. We are thankful that American casualties are down as \nwell.\n  Numbers recently released by the Pentagon corroborate the progress \noccurring in Iraq in and around Baghdad. The DOD reports terrorist \noperations are down by 59 percent; operations targeting Iraqi forces \nmore than 60 percent; car bombs are down by 65 percent; casualties due \nto enemy attacks are down by 77 percent; and violence during this last \nRamadan period was the lowest in 3 years.\n  But perhaps the most convincing evidence that things, good things, \nare happening in Iraq, is the fact that the Iraqi people are beginning \nto move back into areas they had previously left behind, hopeless that \npeace and security could ever be accomplished. According to recent news \nreports, even cab drivers are feeling it is safer to drive around \nBaghdad neighborhoods where sectarian violence once made it impossible \nfor them to enter.\n  But perhaps the most telling story of increased security in Baghdad \nis one told by the Iraqi people themselves.\n  According to an Associated Press article from this past weekend, \nthousands of Iraqi refugees who previously fled their homes in Iraq for \nthe relative safety of neighboring Syria have now returned to their \nhome country. While it is easy for some skeptics to second-guess \nnumbers and statistics pertaining to the security situation in\n\n[[Page S13944]]\n\nIraq, it is nearly impossible to ignore the fact that thousands of \nIraqis who not long ago were living as refugees in a foreign country \nnow feel safe enough to come home. This reversal of refugee trends \nclearly indicates that there are good things happening in Iraq and \naround Baghdad.\n  The AP reports that ``In a dramatic turnaround, more than 3,000 Iraqi \nfamilies driven out of their Baghdad neighborhoods have returned to \ntheir homes in the past three months as sectarian violence has \ndropped.'' The article goes on to quote one refugee who returned home \nto his neighborhood of Khadra. ``In Khadra,'' he said, ``about 15 \nfamilies have returned from Syria.'' He said, ``I've called friends and \nfamily still there and told them it's safe to come home.''\n  Where there was once widespread fear among Iraqi citizens, we are now \nseeing something new--hope, hope for a better and safer future. Nothing \nconfirms this more than the return of refugees and their testimony that \nit is becoming safer in Iraq. While not yet safe, no one is saying the \njob has been completed, but surely an honest, objective appraisal would \nacknowledge the improvements in the security situation as demonstrated \nnot only by these statistics but by testimonials from Iraqis \nthemselves.\n  These heartwarming accounts of families reuniting in neighborhoods, \nwhich not long ago had been written off as hopeless, and businesses \nopening their doors are important lessons for us all. The strategy \nemployed by General Petraeus has worked and is continuing to work. The \nefforts of our military men and women who have put their hearts and \nsouls into this mission are now paying dividends and producing results.\n  These security gains are not a fluke. What we are seeing is a direct \nresult of a carefully designed strategy which includes ramped-up \ncounterinsurgency operations, increased efforts to foster cooperation \nand reconciliation among local tribes, and our continued backing of the \nhard work of the American military and support for their families.\n  As we are presented with funding requests by the Pentagon to bring \nabout a stable and peaceful Iraq, we are ensuring that our soldiers \nhave the resources they need to bring peace and stability to a \ntumultuous land. My hope is we will not use the funding request from \nthe Pentagon for continued support for our troops as another political \nfootball, as it has been used in the past, particularly in the face of \nsuch hopeful and promising news for which I would expect we would be \ngrateful and thank our men and women in uniform and their families who \nhave sacrificed so much to help bring this about, along with our Iraqi \nallies.\n  General Petraeus told reporters this past weekend:\n\n       In general, we think that there are no al-Qaeda strongholds \n     at this point.\n\n  While he was quick to remind us that they are still a potent threat, \nhis assessment of the progress in Iraq can be nothing but reassuring. I \nshudder to think of what would have happened had we listened to the \nnaysayers months ago who said we have to withdraw all our troops, even \nbefore the surge was fully implemented. So far, we have voted 59 times \non Iraq-related resolutions, most of which are nonbinding sense-of-the-\nSenate resolutions; 59 times we have voted even before the surge had a \nchance to be implemented. Now we see what a mistake it is to bet \nagainst the men and women of the U.S. military. Thank goodness those \nresolutions were not successful, and thank goodness our American \nsoldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, and Coast Guard were able to carry \nout this new plan under the leadership of General Petraeus. We now see \nat least some hope in a land where hope was in short supply.\n  Although many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nprejudged the surge strategy and continue to oppose our efforts in \nIraq, some of whom call even today for cutting off funds to support our \ntroops, we see now substantial evidence of progress. It is my continued \nhope these positive developments may yet change the tone of the \nnational dialog on the global war on terror, including the campaign in \nIraq. It is time for all Members of this body to take an objective look \nnot through a political lens, not through a lens which sees only the \nnext general election, but to look objectively at what our troops are \naccomplishing in Iraq. Instead of focusing only on the challenges, we \nshould at least be honest enough to acknowledge the accomplishments, \nnot the least of which are the indisputable gains in security made \nthrough their sacrifices.\n  I, for one, am proud to applaud the undeniable achievements of our \ntroops in Iraq. Their hard work and tireless dedication have reminded \nus that a stable and peaceful Iraq is within reach. It is my fervent \nhope that my colleagues will join me in acknowledging and honoring the \nsuccesses achieved by our military personnel and renew their support \nfor them, their commander, and the counterinsurgency strategy that is \nbearing fruit and to always remember their families at home who wait \nfor their loved one to return as soon as our mission is accomplished.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to respond to what has become a \nregular drumbeat in this Chamber in terms of the distinguished \nRepublican leader and those on the other side of the aisle talking \nabout how we have not accomplished anything this year, how the budget \nhas not gotten done. It is important to continually remember what we \nhave been dealing with as the new majority coming into the Senate in \nJanuary, laser focused on changing the direction and the priorities of \nthe country, laser focused on getting things done for middle-class \nAmericans who are counting on us, who feel squeezed on all sides and \nsee prices increase on gasoline and health care and the cost of \ncollege, all those kinds of things that come down on Americans as they \nare working harder and harder every day, maybe facing the loss of a job \nor having lost a job, lower wages, and so on. Those are the folks we \nare fighting for every day and, I am proud to say, getting results.\n  It is important to realize what has been happening since January. \nDespite all of the lamenting on the other side of the aisle about not \ngetting things done, what we have seen are 52 Republican filibusters so \nfar this year--unprecedented, the number of times we have had to vote \nto stop a filibuster. By the end of this week, it will be 53 or 54. It \nwill continue right on, as there are efforts politically to stop what \nwe are doing to change the direction of this country and focus on those \nthings middle-class Americans care about every day and want to see \nfixed. In spite of that, we are, in fact, getting things done.\n  One of the areas I am proudest of is our refocus in the budget on \nkeeping our promises to veterans. We heard this morning that we need to \npass a veterans budget. There is no question about it. There is no \nquestion about the fact that we not only need to, but we will. But we \nneed to also remember that when we came in in January, last year's \nbudget wasn't done yet. The previous majority didn't get the budget \ndone at all in 2006. When we came in and were left, frankly, with a \nbudget mess, we made sure that in the process of keeping the Government \ngoing, public services going for the balance of the year, we addressed \nveterans first and foremost by placing dollars into what is called a \ncontinuing resolution because we know our veterans have not been \ngetting the resources they need, brave men and women coming home from \nIraq and Afghanistan every day who have not been able to get the health \ncare they need, too many caught in unfortunate bureaucracies.\n  We heard about Walter Reed and those who are receiving military \nhealth care and then moving to the VA, and too many folks who are \ngetting caught in that process and being hurt by the process. We have \nmade veterans and keeping our promises to them and our military the \nhighest priority. We addressed the issues that came up regarding Walter \nReed and passed the Wounded Warrior provisions in the Department of \nDefense authorization that my senior colleague from Michigan, of whom \nwe are so proud, Senator Carl Levin, helped lead. He led that, and we \nare making those changes.\n  In the budget--and I am proud to be a member of the Budget Committee, \nwhich has made sure this has happened\n\n[[Page S13945]]\n\nunder our great leader from North Dakota, Senator Conrad--we have said \nfor the first time we are going to fund veterans services at the level \nthe veterans organizations say we need. We are going to use the numbers \nthey recommend. We have seen consistently under this administration an \nunderfunding of those things which are needed by our veterans coming \nhome, the top of which has been health care, mental health services, \nand rehabilitative services.\n  We, since January, have made veterans health care the top priority. I \nam proud of the fact that we have added dollars. We have addressed the \nsystem problems. We have looked at what we need to be doing for \nfamilies, both of Active military as well as our veterans. We don't \nhave any concern at all about standing up and saying that we have been \nputting our veterans first, despite filibuster after filibuster after \nfilibuster. Anyone watching will see more this week. It seems to be the \nnature of things today. But we have increased the dollars, the \nresources, the commitment--keeping our promises to veterans. We have \ndone that in the budget for next year. We have done that in the funding \navailable now. It is part of our overall vision and commitment.\n  We are getting results for middle-class Americans. That is what we \nare all about, the folks who are sending their children, husbands, and \nwives to the war to fight for our country, coming home, expecting us to \nkeep the promises the country has made as it relates to veterans. We \ntake that extremely seriously. We are keeping those promises as part of \nour efforts to get results for the American people. We intend to do \nthat in this budget we will pass, that will go to the President, that \nwill be historic in that it is keeping the promises to our veterans \nthat they expect us to keep.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow).

But if what I have heard this morning here in \nmorning business is correct, I ask the leadership on the other side of \nthe aisle to bring that caucus together.\n  The farm bill is far too important to play politics. It is a critical \nissue dealing with this country's food security and dealing with this \ncountry's family farmers. As I have said many times before, if we ever \nlose family farm agriculture in this country, this country will change \nfor the worse--no ifs, ands, or buts about it. This farm bill is a good \nfarm bill, passing out of committee, I believe, unanimously. It is a \nbill that deserves an honest debate by this body and deserves passage. \nIt is critically important that this happen very soon, that we set our \ndifferences aside and work together to get this bill done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/06/senate-section/article/S13945-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WILD HORSE BORDER CROSSING\n\n  Mr. TESTER. With that, Madam President, I want to announce that \nyesterday I introduced a piece of legislation that will establish a 24-\nhour port of entry at the Port of Wild Horse, which is north of Havre, \nMT.\n  This legislation will establish this 24-hour port on the Montana-\nAlberta border. American trade with Alberta is growing at a rapid rate. \nExcluding pipeline shipments, Alberta's exports to the United States \nhave grown 86 percent over the last decade. America's exports to \nAlberta have increased 75 percent. So it is a good deal in both \ndirections.\n  The United States now sells more than $12.5 billion worth of goods to \nAlberta, most of which moves by truck through just five border \ncrossings--only one of which is open 24 hours a day.\n  Commerce between the United States and Alberta is expected to \nincrease. The Canadian development of the Alberta oil sands region \nmeans the United States is sending more heavy machinery north of the \nborder. That is traffic which must move by truck. But today, truck \ntraffic from Texas and other main shippers of these products must go \nhundreds of miles out of the way to reach the oil sands region. \nAccording to one Canadian study, an additional $4 billion worth of \ngoods will be needed annually as the oil sands are developed in \nAlberta. This represents more than 40,000 truckloads of goods each \nyear.\n  If all these trucks--as well as the 160,000 trucks that currently \npass through our 24-hour port of Sweetgrass--were forced to move \nthrough the one existing 24-hour border crossing, the result would be \nan average of 480 trucks crossing it every day of each year. There is \nlittle doubt that such a pace would be both economically insufficient \nand unsustainable for our security needs. It would be faster and more \neconomical for many of these products to move to the oil sands area \nthrough an eastern Alberta crossing, such as a crossing north of Havre \nat Wild Horse, and that is exactly what this legislation will do.\n  The State of Montana and the Provincial Government of Alberta have \nboth passed resolutions calling for an upgrade to the border crossing \nat Wild Horse. Over the next few months, Senator Baucus and I will work \nwith our colleagues and with Customs and Border Protection to determine \nhow best to accomplish this goal.\n  I understand that CBP faces numerous staffing challenges in order to \nmeet this proposal. I have tried in my short time in the Senate to \nhighlight and address these challenges. But the cost of ignoring \neconomic growth in Alberta and the border crossing needs in that region \nwould be harmful to Montana's economy and to our Nation's economy. For \nthat reason, I am pleased to have offered this bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/06/senate-section/article/S13945-3", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13945-S13946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RELEASE OF AITZAZ AHSAN\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a matter of \ngreat personal concern with respect to events in Pakistan.\n  On last Saturday, a Pakistani leader, Aitzaz Ahsan, was arrested \nwhile conducting a press conference in Islamabad. Aitzaz Ahsan is one \nof the most distinguished jurists in Pakistan. He is the chief counsel \nto the Chief Justice of the Pakistani Supreme Court. He is the head of \nthe Pakistani Supreme Court Bar Association. He is a longtime leader, \nor was a longtime leader in Pakistani Parliament. He has represented \npeople ranging across the political divide in Pakistan, from Prime \nMinister Bhutto to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Sharif, although \na political opponent, hired him to be his chief counsel.\n  Mr. President, this is a personal matter because Mr. Ahsan's son is a \nclose friend of our family. I want to say further about Mr. Ahsan that \nhe is pro-Western. He is prodemocracy. He was educated at Cambridge. \nHis son is a close friend of our family, who went to Harvard \nUniversity, graduated there, went to Yale Law School, graduated there, \nserved in the very prestigious law firm of Cleary Gottlieb in New York, \nwas then hired by Kofi Annan to be a speech writer for him at the \nUnited Nations, a post where he continues to serve.\n  I have, yesterday, written a letter to President Musharraf asking for \nthe immediate release of Aitzaz Ahsan. Today, I am circulating a letter \namong colleagues asking them to sign the letter to President Musharraf, \nasking for intervention.\n\n  Mr. Ahsan is not the type of person who ought to be detained, \narrested, threatened. That is not going to build respect for democratic \ninstitutions or for the future relationship of our countries.\n\n[[Page S13946]]\n\n  I repeat, Mr. Ahsan is pro-Western, prodemocracy, somebody who has \nlabored his life long to promote democracy and the spread of political \nfreedoms in his country.\n  The family has not been in contact for more than 3 days. You can \nimagine how worried they are. We have even been told there was a move \nto arrest his wife and that she was not home at the time the security \nforces came to detain her.\n  I hope the Pakistani Government realizes how this looks to those of \nus who have been friends of this Government, who have respected the \nalliance between our countries, to have somebody like Mr. Ahsan \narrested.\n  I repeat, he is the chief counsel to the Chief Justice of the \nPakistani Supreme Court. He is head of the Pakistani Supreme Court Bar \nAssociation, is a longtime leader of the Parliament, somebody who has \nbeen retained as counsel by leading figures in Pakistan for many years \nwhen they encountered legal challenges.\n  I very much hope the Pakistani Government is listening. I have spoken \nto the State Department yesterday. We will have further conversations \ntoday. I am going to be asking the Ambassador from Pakistan to come and \nsee me to discuss this matter.\n  I take this very seriously. When somebody of Mr. Ahsan's remarkable \nrecord and stature is detained in Pakistan--somebody who is pro-\nWestern, prodemocracy, upholds all the values America stands for--that \nis a serious matter.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Pakistani Government is listening. I hope \nthe State Department is listening. I hope my colleagues are listening. \nAt our caucus today, I will circulate a letter and ask other colleagues \nto sign the letter to President Musharraf asking for Mr. Ahsan's \nimmediate release.\n  If Pakistan is to have a future--and all of us pray that it will--it \nis critically important people of Mr. Ahsan's stature and standing are \npart of that future.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendments to \nH.R. 2419 be relevant to the bill or to the substitute amendment.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope beyond all hope that we can have a \nfarm bill that will be related to the substance rather than the \nprocedure. It is a good bill. The committee has worked very hard on it. \nPeople have some problems with parts of the bill. But if we had a vote \non the bill right now, we would get 70 votes. We are not going to be \nable to do that. People are going to come out here--and I suggest they \nare going to have to write new speeches. This has happened so many \ntimes, all you have to do is go to the Congressional Record and read \nwhat has gone on before. It doesn't matter whether it is a Democrat or \na Republican who is majority leader, the same thing always happens when \nwe are trying to get out of here.\n  This time we are trying to finish the work period before \nThanksgiving. There are things we have to do. I say to my friends, do \npeople really want an open process on this bill? Do we want to debate \nthe war in Iraq on this bill? Do we want to debate amendments relating \nto labor issues throughout this country? I have been told those are \nsome of the amendments that are going to be offered on my side. I have \nno idea what amendments the Republicans will offer, but I have kind of \na good idea. I have see the rule XIVs in the last few weeks and the \nvery mischievous amendments that have nothing to do with the farm \nbill--political amendments.\n  We are late in this year of Congress. We have just a few weeks left, \nand every majority leader does what I have done. I didn't invent this. \nAs I said earlier this morning, I learned a lot from my Republican \ncounterparts--from Senator Lott, when he was majority leader, and from \nSenator Dole. They did the same thing. I have to acknowledge that \nSenator Mitchell did it and Senator Daschle did it because it is the \nonly way we can get the business of the country done.\n  We have had an open amendment process this year--not always but \ngenerally speaking. Once we got to the bills--and that has been tough--\nI have had to file cloture on motions to proceed, which has been a big \nwaste of time. But we have been able to work our way through many \ndifferent things we have done.\n  I think we have accomplished a great deal, Mr. President. We have \ndone the minimum wage; the balanced budget, pay as you go; the CR; the \nwork on U.S. Attorneys; the excellent work we did on higher education, \nhealth care for vets, and Active-Duty servicemembers; disaster relief, \nwildfire relief, SCHIP--a lot of good things.\n  So I hope everyone will understand Harry Reid hasn't invented what is \ntaking place on the Senate floor. I am just copying what others have \ndone. Why? Out of necessity. I have told everybody this farm bill is a \npretty good bill. It is not everything I want, but one of the \ninteresting things about American farm policy is we don't import 65 to \n70 percent of our food as we do oil. Oil, we have been told, is soon \ngoing to go up to $4 per gallon.\n  Food, Mr. President, we pay too much for food. But we pay far less, \non a proportionate basis, than any other country in the world. Why? One \nreason is the farm policy in this country. Could the farm policy be \nbetter? Sure. That is why we are having a bipartisan effort to change \nthe underlying bill. Democrats and Republicans think it could be \nbetter.\n  Mr. President, we should move forward on this farm bill and finish \nit. We only do it every 5 years. If there are amendments that deal with \nthis, I have said--and that was my consent just asked--if there are \nrelevant amendments dealing with farm policy, move to change it, debate \nit, and vote on it. That is all I am asking. But I don't want to debate \nthe estate tax repeal. The American people don't deserve that at this \ntime. I don't want to debate another SCHIP bill that a number of \nRepublicans believe is the right way to go for children's health \nbecause they are in such desperate shape for the vetoes the President \nhas done. I have mentioned just a few things.\n  Mr. President, we are doing the right thing. I hope people will go to \nwork on the farm bill. Both Democrats and Republicans have worked for \nmonths on a farm bill to get here. Do you think it was easy for \nChairman Harkin to get a bill out of committee? No; it was difficult. \nHow many meetings did he hold--private meetings--with this group or \nthat group of Senators? I have no idea, but there were scores of them. \nWe are at a point where we are today so that we have a farm bill that \nreceived overwhelming support in the\n\n[[Page S13947]]\n\nAgriculture Committee, and now it is on the Senate floor. For the \nAmerican people, we need to do this bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the leader for his statement. I just want to make \nsure everyone understands what just happened. As I understand it, the \nmajority leader propounded a unanimous consent request that all \namendments to be offered to the farm bill be relevant to the farm bill; \nis that not correct?\n  Mr. REID. That is exactly what I said.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There was objection on the other side. Why would there be \nan objection to that? We have a farm bill, and we have worked hard. The \nleader is right. We reached a bipartisan agreement. I daresay none of \nus like every little bit in the farm bill, but that is the art of \ncompromise. You compromise on these sorts of things and you move them \nahead.\n  I don't know, for the life of me, why there would be an objection to \nsaying that all amendments should be relevant to the farm bill. Let's \nmove the farm bill. I hope people in farm country are watching this. I \nhope agribusiness is seeing this. I hope people know what is at stake \nin this farm bill for rural America for specialty crops, for our dairy \nfarmers, for rural development, and I might add the nutrition programs, \nfood stamp recipients, things that we have done good work on in this \nbill, to provide an underpinning of nutrition and support for some of \nthe least among us. We have done good work in that area. Now it is held \nup because some people want to offer nonrelevant amendments. For the \nlife of me--and this is my seventh farm bill, counting my time in the \nHouse, and my second as chairman--I don't understand why we cannot have \na bill. Yes, open it to amendments on the farm bill. If people have \namendments on the bill and want to change this, add this, or subtract \nthat, fine. But why should we now debate, as I said, the war?\n  Can the leader think of any reason we should not just stick to the \nfarm bill?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the chairman, and to the ranking \nmember, who have worked well together, I am not saying we are only \ngoing to allow Democratic amendments to be offered. I have made it very \nclear in my presentation to the Senate this morning that I am talking \nabout mischievous amendments not only by Republicans but my colleagues \nover here.\n  I also say this of the farm bill: I was listening this morning to \npublic radio as I was doing my exercise. There was one provision that \nstruck me on this bill. Over a billion dollars for fresh fruits and \nvegetables will go to schools. That may not sound like much to people. \nI was raised, as everybody knows, in rural Nevada. When I was a boy 9 \nor 10 years old, the only grocery store in Searchlight burned down. It \nwas never rebuilt. To this day, I like canned asparagus better than \nfresh asparagus. I love canned peas and canned fruit. The reason is, we \nnever had fresh fruits or vegetables. We didn't have them and could not \nbuy them. We all know fresh fruits and vegetables are better than that \nheavily salted stuff you get in a can that I am used to eating.\n  This bill is going to say the kids in Searchlight today are still--\nthere are a few, such as the 7-Eleven you can go to.\n  Places, such as where I was raised, where there are no stores, but \nthey have some food programs, they are going to be able to have fresh \nfruits and vegetables on occasion. Isn't that great? I would know--I am \nusing me as a point of reference--what a fresh asparagus is, an apple, \nan orange. So this is a good bill. It has a lot of warts and pimples on \nit, but it is a good bill. I only picked one provision.\n  Why don't we go ahead and try to get this bill passed? I am not \ntrying to play any games with anybody. I am trying to do what I have \nmade a decision on that I think is best for the American people. Do we \nwant to spend all this week on one amendment? People say: How would \nthat happen? Let's go back to the Amtrak legislation. What happened \nwhen we went on that bill? As soon as it was open for amendment, bang, \nout came a tax amendment, and we spent all week on it, Internet tax. I \nam glad it is done, and that issue has now been sent to the President. \nHe signed it. But we do not have time to do that this week. We must get \nan appropriations bill to the President. The House is going to work and \nsend us something tonight. The President will wind up getting Labor-HHS \nlater this week, unless we get hung up on some procedural issue.\n  We need to pass the Defense appropriations conference report, with a \nCR included in that, this week. So this is no effort on my behalf to \ntry to circumvent rules or procedures. I am following the rules of the \nSenate to the letter. But I am saying, I repeat, I am doing what every \nmajority leader has done, similarly situated, in recent history.\n  I said I hope we can deal with this important bill as we focus on \nefforts to pass an important farm bill. It appears the minority intends \nto offer unrelated amendments to the farm bill. They will have to wait \nuntil later to do that. Hopefully, maybe the time we are here during \nDecember, there will be amendable vehicles we can deal with. I hope we \ncan work on this bipartisan farm bill in an orderly, relevant fashion.\n  So in an effort to keep this debate focused on farm-related issues, I \nintend to fill the amendment tree, but I will be willing to lay aside \npending amendments for Members who wish to offer farm-related \namendments to this bill.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer to lay down the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/06/senate-section/article/S13947-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13947-S13952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I apologize to my distinguished colleague. \nThat was actually in my script and I should have done that. I apologize \nfor not doing that. Without losing my right to the floor, I yield to my \nfriend. I apologize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the majority leader is certainly within \nhis\n\n[[Page S13948]]\n\nrights to do what we call ``filling up the tree.'' It has certainly \nbeen done by majority leaders in both parties over the years. But let's \nget a picture of what we are talking about.\n  As I understand it, this is the amendment that has been offered. What \nmy good friend, the majority leader, is saying is that in response to \nthis amendment, the minority, this side of the aisle, will get an \nopportunity to offer only those amendments the majority leader allows \nus to offer.\n  The farm bill is a very important bill. It happens about every 5 \nyears. There are many people interested in agriculture, school \nnutrition, and energy and others who have an abiding interest in this \nbill. The minority is going to insist on an open process.\n  The last time we enacted a farm bill, the Democrats were also in the \nmajority and Senator Daschle was the majority leader. I asked my staff \nto check on what the procedure was then.\n  Senator Daschle attempted to limit amendments through early cloture, \nwhich is another procedural way to shut out the minority. Three cloture \nvotes failed. They were not supported by the Republican minority. \nAccording to my notes, on the third day of consideration, a cloture \nmotion ripened and failed by a vote of 53 to 45. The second cloture \nvote occurred 5 days later and also failed by a vote of 54 to 43. A \nthird cloture vote failed by a vote of 54 to 43.\n  Senator Daschle pulled the bill but returned to it later, and after 6 \ndays of floor consideration, the bill passed without a further cloture \nvote being necessary.\n  So let's look at the way farm bills have typically been handled. That \nis the way it was handled in 2002. In 1985, there were 30 rollcall \nvotes; in 1990, 22 rollcall votes; in 1996, 10 rollcall votes; and in \n2002, the year to which I was referring in which there were multiple \ncloture motions filed and cloture not invoked, there were 23 rollcall \nvotes.\n  I don't know, there may be a few people in the Senate who don't want \nto pass a farm bill at all, but that certainly is not the view of the \nRepublican leader, certainly not the view of the Senator from Georgia, \nour ranking member on the Agriculture Committee. But we are going to \ninsist on a fair process.\n  We can get this bill done the easy way or the hard way. I think a \nbetter way to do it would be to understand that a bill of this \nmagnitude is enormously significant, something we only do every 5 \nyears. The Republican minority is going to insist on an open process, \nwhich is what we will get to, one way or the other, in going forward. I \ndon't think that is unreasonable.\n  I thank the majority leader for giving me an opportunity to make some \nobservations.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is not a tit for tat. Each time we do \nthe farm bill, it comes at different times in the year and different \nsituations and circumstances. I explained to both the chairman and \nranking member that I have no intention of filing cloture this week. \nBut there will be a time we will have to file cloture. We have such a \nsmall amount of time left this year and next year with the Presidential \nelections coming and all the other business we have to do that there \nwill not be five cloture votes on this farm bill. People who vote no on \ncloture the first time should understand they may not get another \nchance to vote cloture on the bill, and there will be no farm bill. \nThis is not a threat, it is what we have to deal with in the Senate.\n  I also say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, once I \ncomplete the amendment process, the Republicans have equal authority as \nI do whether other amendments will be heard. It takes unanimous consent \nto set an amendment aside, and they have as much control over that as I \ndo. So I am not the ruling authority on that issue. It takes both the \nDemocrats and Republicans to move down the road.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3510\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I call up an amendment which is at the desk, \nto the underlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as I indicated earlier, I am \ndisappointed with the majority leader's announcement that he would fill \nthe tree, which he just did, and not allow the amendment process to \nperfect the farm bill. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave had all year to complete a farm bill prior to September 30, when \nit\n\n[[Page S13949]]\n\nexpired. Yet we waited until now, 2 months after the law's expiration, \nto bring it to the floor. Now we are told by the majority there is too \nmuch to do in this final 2 weeks for us to have an open and fair debate \non the farm bill. It is another unfortunate example of mismanagement of \nthis Congress.\n  Furthermore, filling the tree and shutting out amendments is not \nconsistent with previous statements by the majority on this bill. For \nexample, yesterday, Chairman Harkin reported the farm bill debate would \nbe ``wide open as usual in the Senate.'' The majority leader's own \nspokesman expected an open debate when he said:\n\n       The farm bill is the last truly amendable vehicle moving \n     through the Senate this calendar year.\n\n  But the majority leader's words and actions seem to be exactly \ncontradictory to this promised wide-open process, stating unequivocally \nyesterday afternoon that we are not going to have an open amendment \nprocess on this bill, and he has confirmed that, as we all know, again \nthis morning.\n  Unfortunately, we have been down this road before. Almost at the \ninception of the last farm bill debate, as I was describing earlier, \nthen-Majority Leader Daschle filed cloture in an attempt to similarly \nlimit amendments. After only 2 days of debate and only six amendments, \na cloture vote occurred on December 13, 2001, even a little bit later \nin the calendar year than we are in now. Not surprisingly, the cloture \nmotion failed 53 to 45.\n  Similar to a bird continuing to slam into a paned-glass window, we \nhad a second cloture vote on December 18, 2001, getting close to \nChristmas, with a similar vote of 54 to 43. Again, on December 19, 1 \nday closer to Christmas, in 2001. Not surprisingly, the contentious \ndebate took up most of December.\n  However, after the majority finally agreed to open the amendment \nprocess, something that will ultimately be done here, in my view, the \nfarm bill returned to the floor on February 6, 2002, no further cloture \nvotes were necessary, and final passage occurred fairly quickly about a \nweek later.\n  Let's not beat our head against a wall again this time. One of my \nfavorite old sayings from rural Kentucky is: There is no education in \nthe second kick of a mule. Our Nation's farmers are too important to \nwait until February.\n  Finally, look at the farm bill sitting on the desk in front of me. I \nheld it up a while ago. It is quite thick. Reported by the committee \nless than 2 weeks ago, it totals 1,600 pages. Is the other side of the \naisle suggesting this behemoth of a bill cannot be improved by an open \namendment process? Surely, that is not the suggestion being made.\n  I am surprised and disappointed we are in the position we are in. \nThis is not the way the Senate likely will be allowed to work on a very \nlarge bill that we only address every 5 years. It is not going to be \nrubberstamped by fiat.\n  I am dismayed by the attempt of the majority to ramrod this bill \nthrough, especially since the ink on 1,600 pages is barely dry and the \nadministration claims it contains $37 billion in new budget gimmicks \nand new taxes.\n  Let's have a fair, open debate. Believe me, I say to my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle, that is the way you get a farm bill \ncompleted. Our farmers and rural communities deserve no less and, \nhopefully, we can get back at the posture we ought to be in on this \nbill in the very near future.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I agree with my friend from Kentucky. \nFarmers do deserve more than what is going on here.\n  You know, I took only one course in logic in college, but I did \npretty well in that course. And what I would say to my friend is, it is \nillogical what he is talking about. A 1,600-page bill that needs to be \nimproved can only be improved--if, in fact, people think it should be \nimproved--by offering amendments to it--amendments to the farm bill. \nEvery farmer and rancher in America should understand we are trying to \npass a farm bill. We have said any amendment you want to offer to this \nbig bill, offer it, but it has to be relevant to the farm bill. That is \nall.\n  That is not a closed process. It is an open process. How can you have \nit both ways? The ink is hardly dry on this, is a gross overstatement. \nThis bill has been around for several weeks now--not in its final form, \nbut everyone knows what is in this bill. The tax portion was a little \nlate in coming, but it had been worked on for a long time.\n  This is a bill upon which Democrats and Republicans agreed. It is a \nbill that is here by virtue of that bipartisanship. The House has \nalready done their bill, and a lot that is in this bill is in the House \nbill. So if this bill needs to be improved, let's improve it. Let's \nimprove it. I have said let's offer amendments.\n  One of the amendments that might be offered, and we have debated it \nbefore, is dealing with payment limitations--a bipartisan amendment \noffered by Dorgan and Grassley, two senior Senators who come from farm \nStates. They think this bill can be made better. What are they doing \nabout it? Offering an amendment. That is what this is all about.\n  So for people to lament a closed process, look what Senator Daschle \ndid--two amendments before cloture. Mr. President, I don't have any \nconcern about how many amendments are offered, as long as they are \nrelevant to the farm bill. That is all.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Sure.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I never served in the House of Representatives, but my \nquestion is--it strikes me, I would say to my good friend, the majority \nleader, that he is attempting to act as if he is chairman of the Rules \nCommittee in the House in determining what amendments would be allowed. \nUnder this filling-up-the-tree process, where the majority leader is \nthen positioned in order to allow the tree to be open and select \namendments, is it not the case that my definition of ``open'' would \nprobably not meet yours in the sense that you would be, yourself, \nselecting which amendments would be allowed?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have served in the House of \nRepresentatives. It was a wonderful opportunity for me to understand \nthe Congress. The House is a great institution but much different from \nthe Senate. In the House, if you are in the majority, you can pretty \nmuch do as you want to do. That isn't the way we do it over here.\n  As I indicated a few minutes ago, the first amendment I offered, I \noffered on behalf of Senators Dorgan and Grassley. If someone wants to \noffer another amendment, I don't control that. Any one Senator who \nwants to offer another amendment, let's take a look at it. I don't \ncontrol that. It takes consent from both sides, or the pending \namendment must be set aside and another offered. I am not controlling \nthat.\n  That certainly is not like the Rules Committee. The Rules Committee \nin the House sets what amendments can be offered--usually not very \nmany--and how much debate time they can do on that amendment. That \nisn't anything like we are doing. What I am saying is, we have this big \nbill, and a number of people have said it can be improved upon. I am \nwilling to work with the Democrats and Republicans to try to improve \nit, but it will not be improved by nonrelevant amendments.\n  I have mentioned some of the suspects that are lurking out there: \nprovisions dealing with repealing the estate tax and getting us out of \nIraq immediately. I mean, there are all kinds of suspects there. I am \nsaying, if people want to change this bill, let's try to change it. I \nam not standing in the way of doing that, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Are you asking a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, I was preoccupied.\n  Mr. GREGG. So I am clear as to what the process is now that has been \nstructured, you have used the term it has to be a ``relevant'' \namendment. But, essentially, under the present process, is it not true \nthat for any amendment to move forward in this body it would have to \nmove forward on the basis of unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment?\n  Mr. REID. The distinguished Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the majority leader would yield for a \nfurther question, essentially, we have set up a process which is \nextremely constricted. And, in fact, in comparison\n\n[[Page S13950]]\n\nwith the Rules Committee, it is even more constricted than the House \nprocess because any Member--and there are 100 Members in this body--who \ndoes not like the fact somebody is going to offer an amendment which \nmight affect their interests--and, believe me, there isn't an amendment \nthat will be offered that would not have opposition on the other side--\nis going to be knocked down by an objection from that individual \nMember.\n  So you have essentially shut the floor of the Senate down because the \nonly amendments that can be brought up would be amendments that would \nhave unanimous consent, which means 100 people have to agree to them. \nBasically, they are amendments of no impact or significance, relevant \nor irrelevant.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to respond to my friend. I smile because \nthat is the way every bill comes before the Senate. That is the way it \nworks. Once you lay down an amendment and you want to set it aside, you \nhave to ask unanimous consent to set it aside. Today is no different \nfrom any other day. That is the way it works here.\n  I have bragged about my friend before. He has served in the House, he \nhas been Governor of his State, and he is now a longtime Senator. He \nknows that. Every time we have a bill here, and you have an amendment \nthat has been laid down, the only way you can set that aside is by \nunanimous consent. No one Senator can start offering amendments.\n  So this bill, I say to my friend, is no different than any other bill \nwe have done in that regard. The only difference is, I laid down the \nfirst amendment on behalf of Senators Grassley and Dorgan.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the majority leader would yield further, \nof course, the end of that sentence should have been: Yes, but I \ncontrol the ability to allow those amendments to come forward.\n  And, in fact, it has been made fairly clear that control will be \nexercised by the leadership in a way that limits amendments that are \nbrought forward to those which are agreed to by the majority leader \nuntil we get to the point where the majority leader is going to file a \nmotion for cloture, which, on a farm bill, of course, would most likely \nbe successful because we all know everybody around here is ``in the \nfield,'' so to say. I would not say ``in the tent,'' but they are in \nthe field for the farmer.\n  So as a practical matter, this is an extraordinarily closed process. \nJust to use one example, the majority leader said--he threw out, and \nmaybe it was just a throw-away line--estate taxes shouldn't be brought \nonto this bill because they are not relevant, under the majority \nleader's terms. If I want to offer an amendment which says we should \nreform the death tax--which I might like to offer in light of the fact \nthere is a tax title there--I happen to think that has a huge impact on \nthe farming community because, for the most part, it is family farms \nand small businesses that are most impacted by the death tax. But we \nhave already been told that would not be a relevant amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, any Senator--not me, any Senator--on any \nbill has the same power I have to stop the setting aside of an \namendment to offer another amendment. It is not me. The Senator from \nNew Hampshire can do it, the Senator from Arizona, or the Senator from \nGeorgia can do it. The Senator from Iowa can do it. Any Senator; it is \nnot me.\n  I laid down the first amendment by virtue of being the majority \nleader. I have the right to do that. But that is about as far as it \ngoes. Anytime after that, it takes unanimous consent to set aside that \namendment. I agree, and offered a consent agreement, that any relevant \namendment Senators want to offer, they should be able to do that, and \nthat was objected to. But for my friend from New Hampshire to try to \ngive a little mini lecture on what we are doing is different than \nanything we have ever done in the past, every day we are on a bill, it \nhappens the way he has described it. Any one Senator can stop another \nSenator from setting aside an amendment and offering another amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President I don't want to beat a dead subsidy, so I \nwill constrain myself to this last question.\n  The point is pretty obvious. Sure, any Senator on any bill can object \nto setting aside an amendment. That is not the way the institution has \never worked, in my experience. The way the institution works is the \namendment process is a free-flowing, Wild West exercise around here, \nespecially on bills such as this, which are huge authorizing bills with \na lot of mandatory funding in them. Amendments are simply taken up in \nseriatim as they are offered.\n  What will happen now, and the majority leader has been specific about \nthis and very open about this, he is going to limit the ability to \nbring forward amendments, and the unanimous consent is not going to be \ngranted unless he deems those amendments are relevant to the underlying \nbill, which means in his context of what is relevant. Well, a lot of us \nwill have different views on what that means, as I pointed out on the \ndeath tax alone as an issue.\n  So this is a process of shutting down the amendment process on the \nfarm bill. The last time we debated the farm bill, we had 245 \namendments and 19 rollcall votes, and we were on it for 4 weeks. I \nthink on the first day or the second day of the farm bill debate around \nhere, for those of us who may not be enamored with the bill, even \nthough we know a lot of effort was put into it--because it spends a lot \nof money, creates a lot of new subsidies and programs, and uses a lot \nof budgetary gimmicks--we would like to have a much more open process, \nand I am disappointed we are not going to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I am not going to, as my friend said, belabor the point, \nbut my friend from New Hampshire has made my case for me--4 weeks, 245 \namendments, and 19 rollcall votes. I have no problem with the 19 \nrollcall votes. I do have a problem with 4 weeks. I do have a problem \nwith 245 amendments. That is why I think we should have a process \nwhereby people offer amendments, if they are relevant, to the farm \nbill.\n  In the time we have spent debating this--and we only have 15 minutes \nbefore we take our usual weekly Tuesday break--we could have taken up \nat least one amendment. The people who offered this huge amendment, a \nbig amendment, and we had it described, for me, it is a pretty easy \ndeal. I have been here when this has been debated before. Most everyone \nwho has been here has heard this debate on numerous occasions. So I am \nsure they will go back, Senators Dorgan and Grassley, and pick out \ntheir favorite statements they made before, and they will talk about it \nagain. They do not want a lot of time on it. So we could dispose of \nthis amendment very quickly, as we could most every other amendment on \nthis bill.\n  But as I say, my friend has made my case for me--245 amendments, 4 \nweeks. I repeat: I don't have a problem with the 19 rollcall votes, but \nthe only ones stopping the amendment process are my friends who think \nsomehow this is different than other pieces of legislation we have. The \ndifference is I offered the first amendment. And I am very happy, as \nthe chairman of the bill is, and other people on this side of the aisle \nwho are very concerned about the passage of this bill--they want it \npassed--to be cooperative. If there is something wrong with this bill, \noffer relevant amendments. If there is something in there you want to \ncut, that is always relevant, to cut things in a program, at least that \nis my understanding.\n\n  The only ones stopping the amendment process are my friends on the \nother side of the aisle. They are making a big deal out of nothing.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The fundamental problem, I would say to my friend, the \nmajority leader, is: What incentive do Members on my side of the aisle \nwho object to the process have to grant consent to set aside an \namendment? What incentive do they have?\n  I would expect, just guessing, the senior Senator from New Hampshire \nmay not be very enthusiastic about the underlying bill. By setting up a \nprocess like the majority leader has set up, in which a number of \nMembers on my side believe the process is unfair, what is their \nincentive to give consent for the\n\n[[Page S13951]]\n\nmajority leader to set aside an amendment and then allow an amendment \nof his choosing to be dealt with?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to respond to that. Mr. President, I think \nthere is tremendous incentive. First of all, they could have their \namendment heard--their relevant amendment. And there is nothing to stop \nus from having the managers of the bill sit down and work out a \nprocedure where they can come up with 10 relevant amendments--\namendments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10--to this bill. Do one, do the \nother, and we can try to work out time agreements on these matters.\n  So there is tremendous incentive, because I am convinced there are \npeople on both sides of the aisle who have problems with this bill. \nSome do not like the bill and they want to change it; others want to \nimprove the bill. They want to do that in good faith. So the incentive \nwould be, as I have said to my dear friend, the Senator from Kentucky, \nto have their amendment and others heard.\n  There is nothing to prevent the manager of the bill from coming up \nwith a series--I would even go as far as to say my distinguished \nfriend, the Republican leader, if he wants to have the final say with \nme, if the managers do a good job, I would be happy to include him in \nthe mix. But there is a lot of incentive. We could, in the next couple \nof days, work out a procedure to get rid of a lot of amendments that \nare relevant to this bill and would either improve the bill in the mind \nof some people or make it a little worse, which is the goal some people \nhave.\n  There is tremendous incentive here, because we could agree to--we \nmight arrive at a point where people say we have had a pretty good \nopportunity to change this bill; we do not need to do an Iraq \namendment; we do not need to do an amendment dealing with firefighters \nthat has no bearing on this bill. In fact, what we need to do is work \non making this bill one where people have the opportunity to offer \namendments on the farm bill that are relevant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me sum up where I think we are. It \nhas been a very interesting and enlightening discussion. But here is \nwhere we are. The Senate is gridlocked on the farm bill because of the \ndecision to fill up the tree. And now where we are, as the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire has pointed out, is that any \none Senator, any one of the 100, can object to an amendment being set \naside in order to consider another amendment.\n  What will have to happen at this point is, as it happens every day on \nvirtually every bill, the majority leader and I are going to have to \nsit down off the floor of the Senate and talk about the way forward, \nbecause we will not be able to go forward in our current circumstance \nbecause of the decision by the majority to shut out the minority, or \ncontrarily to select what amendments will be permitted. That is simply \nnot acceptable on this side of the aisle.\n  So it has been an interesting and useful discussion, and I am sure to \nsome C-SPAN viewers quite boring, because it has largely been about \nprocedure.\n  Nevertheless, that is where we are. We are going to have to do what \nwe do every day in the Senate, sit down and figure out the way forward. \nThe farm bill needs to pass. We hope it passes sometime in the near \nfuture. But we are going to insist on a fair process consistent with \nthe way farm bills have been debated in the past.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know my friend from Arizona has been here \nand very patient. I guess the question I would ask--I have been asked \nmost of the questions, but I do not ask any one person to answer this \nto me. But the question I have is: Why would there not be an agreement \nto my suggestion, my proposal? Let's debate the daylights out of this \nbill, offer amendments. What is wrong with that? Is it because there \nare people wanting to offer unrelated amendments to the bill? I mean, \nwhat in the world is wrong with what we are trying to accomplish here? \nIt is a big bill. We do it every 5 years. People should have an \nopportunity to change it. I think they should do that. Why would they \nnot want us to do that? Is there something I am missing here? I mean, \nis it their last opportunity to do--as Senator Dole used to refer to as \ndecorating a Christmas tree? Is that what they want to do? Is this \ntheir Christmas tree to try to decorate it? I do not understand it.\n  I say to everyone within the sound of my voice: Do we need on the \nfarm bill amendments relating to labor issues? Do we need amendments \ndealing with Leave No Child Behind? Do we need amendments relating to \nenvironmental issues? Global warming? Do we need amendments dealing \nwith Iraq, the war in Iraq, Afghanistan, or the situation now in \nPakistan?\n  I do not think so. I think we need to work on this bill, get as much \nof it done as we can this week. I think it will spill over into next \nweek, but in the process, we are going to have to find time to do a \nconference report on the Labor-HHS bill. That has a rule violation in \nit, perhaps; we have to do the Defense appropriations bill with the CR. \nThose are the must-do items.\n  Now I am not trying, as I have said so many times here, to stop an \nopen amendment process on this bill, except I want them to be relevant. \nI think most everybody does who has any dealing in this farm bill. I do \nnot expect the ranking member to get engaged in this. He has \nresponsibilities to listen to his leadership, and that is \nunderstandable.\n  I will bet if the truth were known, those Senators who have worked so \nhard on this bill are thinking to themselves: Now, what has Reid said \nthat is unreasonable? What he has said is: I have offered the first \namendment, and it is not my amendment. I am not selfish, wanting my \namendment to be heard. I have offered a bipartisan amendment that we \nknow must be debated before this farm bill is completed. And then I \nsay, anyone who wants to offer another amendment relating to the farm \nbill that is relevant: Have at it. I am not going to stop anyone from \ndoing that. I don't think anybody on this side will either.\n  The Republicans are not having a debate on the farm bill, for reasons \nthat are beyond my ability to comprehend, unless it is the Dole theory \nof trying to put new lights on the Christmas tree.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's \nexplanation of his position. But I think in his own explanation he \nraises the issues on which we are concerned. He has now taken off the \ntable the estate tax. I cannot think of anything that is more relevant \nto the farmers, to the family farm, than the ability to pass that farm \non to your children without having it wiped out by punitive and other \ninappropriate taxes, the death tax.\n  He has now taken off the table global warming issues. Well, I have to \nsay from my little knowledge of that issue--I studied it a bit, I have \nspent a lot of time on it in a couple of narrow areas such as acid \nrain. Farming is a critical issue in the issue of global warming. What \nis done on a farm has a huge impact both positively and negatively on \nglobal warming.\n  Then he took off the table the issue of labor, labor questions. Well, \nin my experience, labor questions have a huge impact on farm policy, \nespecially the immigration labor issues, how you get people who are \nimmigrants to help you pick apples in New Hampshire, and the potatoes \nin Idaho. That is a labor issue.\n\n  So his concept of relevance is an extremely narrow one. But his \nconcept of relevance is going to be the concept that disciplines this \nfloor relevant to amendments being made.\n  The Senate was never conceived as being the House. This is supposed \nto be the place where we get into debates, where we exchange ideas, \nwhere people throw out a thought on a bill such as this that is fairly \nsignificant, and it gets debated, a position. But that is not going to \nhappen on this bill because the majority leader has decided to execute \na process which is even more constricted than what would be the House \nprocedure under this similar bill.\n  It is certainly inconsistent with the traditions of the Senate, on \nthe issue of the farm bills specifically, but on our traditions \ngenerally. He used my statistics to support his position. I do not see \nhow he can do that, quite honestly. Farm bills have always involved \nsignificant debate on the floor. Why? Because they are huge policy \nissues which affect a lot of people in this country--everybody who \neats, to begin with, and\n\n[[Page S13952]]\n\nthat is about everyone--and obviously the farm community, which is the \nproducers of food and do an extraordinary job for our Nation. They have \nalways taken a long time on the floor to debate--weeks, usually. And \nthey have always been open for amendments, which is totally reasonable \nbecause of the complexity of the bill. They have often brought in \nissues such as the death tax, immigration, labor, and how you get \nmigrant labor, global warming, and in the case of New England, for \nexample, they brought in the question of these subsidies, which we find \na little difficult to tolerate, which are now being expanded to \nasparagus. There is a crop that needs a subsidy or the walking-around \nmoney that has been put in this bill for the purpose of disasters or \nthe fact that there is probably $20 billion of gimmicks put in this \nbill that are budgetary games or the fact that they have moved \nmandatory spending over to tax expenditures.\n  What an outrage on the budget process. They opened a $3 billion add-\non in mandatory spending so they could go out and spend that on various \ninterest groups by creating a tax credit. The list goes on and on and \non and on.\n  Why should we not on this bill get into a debate over the issue of \ntax policy? Because tax policy underlines the way this bill is paid \nfor. The Senator from Arizona has an extraordinarily good proposal on \nthe death tax. Why should that not be on the table here?\n  The whole issue of AMT should be on the table, in my humble opinion, \nbecause there are a number of farmers, by the way, who pay the AMT tax, \na number of them. There are going to be a lot more when we bump up to \n20 million people paying that tax next year. These are all relevant to \nthis bill, in my humble opinion, of what relevant is.\n  By the way, in the Senate, relevance is everything when it comes to \nthe open amendment process. We are not functioning under postcloture \nrules here. Relevant is irrelevant when it comes to a bill on the floor \nof the Senate. Anything can be amended in any way, and it is an open \nbill. That is the concept of the Senate.\n  If somebody wants to put on this bill policies relative to Nicaraguan \nhousekeepers, they can put that amendment on traditionally. That has no \nrelevance at all to the average American looking at it, but it is the \nSenate's prerogative.\n  So we are undermining the fundamental prerogative of the Senate and \nevery Member of the Senate, I think in a very damaging way. I am \ndisappointed in the decision by the majority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I had hoped to ask the majority leader a question here, but \nI think my question has already been answered, so I will simply make \nthis point.\n  There may be extraordinarily unique circumstances where once in a \nblue moon it is important to move a very focused piece of legislation \nin a very hurried period of time so that the majority is warranted in \nsetting up a process such as that which has been established for this \nbill, where there are no amendments unless the majority leader says so. \nBut that is not the situation with this bill. It never has been with \nthe farm bill. This is the bill we are debating that we are taking up. \nAnd to suggest that the Senator's prerogative to offer any amendment--a \nlot of times they get voted down because they do not have the support--\nbut the Senator's prerogative to offer an amendment is going to be \neliminated through the gatekeeper of the majority leader or any other \nmember of the Senate who can object, is to derogate the basic rule of \nthe Senate and eliminate a basic right of Senators.\n  I recall not long after I got here, my colleague from Arizona \nobjected to the then-majority on this side establishing a process that \nwas not this drastic, but in some respects limited the right of \namendments. He said: The Senate is the body in which any Member has a \nright to offer an amendment. It will be wrong for us to do that. Our \nleadership relented, and there were amendments allowed on the other \nside that got us over that impasse. That is what our minority leader \nwas referring to a moment ago. You cannot impose a sort of dictatorial \nprocess where one person gets to decide whether you offer an amendment \nin the Senate.\n  Sooner or later that process is going to break down. And on a bill as \nbig as this bill, with as many diverse interests as the Senator from \nNew Hampshire was talking about, it is not right that Senators not be \nallowed to offer amendments. Again, if they are not good amendments, \nthey are going to be defeated, and they can always be tabled at any \ntime, so they do not have to take up time. If I offered a silly, \nnongermane amendment, any of my colleagues could immediately move to \ntable that amendment. Assuming it was simply nongermane, that motion to \ntable would presumably pass. That whole thing would transpire in less \nthan half an hour.\n  So it is not about Republicans trying to take too long or offer silly \namendments; it is about the regular process which ordinarily allowed us \nto offer amendments of our choice, not the choice of another Member of \nthe body. I would hope the majority would reconsider, and that we \ncould, after lunch, proceed with the process that is more amenable to \nall Senators being able to offer amendments they choose to offer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I only hope that both the minority and \nthe majority can figure out a way of moving forward with what has been \na labor that has taken up both Republican and Democrats for the last 2 \nyears to develop what is a very good farm bill. What the majority \nleader is attempting to do is to get us into a process where we will \nultimately get a farm bill to cross the finish line, which is good for \nAmerica. I hope the Republican minority can work with us to try to \nfigure out a way forward to get us across the finish line.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/06/senate-section/article/S13952-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that three speakers--Senator \nSalazar for 20 minutes, Alexander for 15 minutes, and Dorgan 20 \nminutes--go in that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the 2007 farm \nbill. Before I go to the specifics of the bill, I wish to acknowledge \nthose who have worked so hard in getting us where we are today.\n  This has been a huge undertaking spread out over several years, \nstarting under the leadership of Senator Chambliss and his work in the \nAgriculture Committee. The hearings he held around the country, the \nhearings he held in the West and the Southeast, all over, contributed \ngreatly to the bipartisan product that is before the Senate today. In \naddition, the leadership of our chairman, Senator Harkin, a man from \nfarm country whose heart and soul are about making sure agriculture and \nrural America thrive--his leadership and the help of his staff in \ngetting us to this point today is something we all must acknowledge and \nsomething for which I am grateful and something for which the farmers \nand ranchers in rural Colorado are grateful.\n  I also acknowledge both Senators Baucus and Grassley and their \nleadership on the Finance Committee. The energy and specialty crops and \nconservation pieces of the farm bill have been significantly enhanced \nby the actions taken by the members of the Finance Committee. Without \nthe leadership and bipartisan example of Senator Baucus and Senator \nGrassley, we would not be where we are today.\n\n[[Page S13953]]\n\n  It goes without saying that even though there are many laudatory \ncomments given to the chairman and ranking member of both the \nAgriculture and Finance Committees, there are working on both of those \ncommittees many other Members of the Senate who have helped craft what \nI believe is one of the most historic pieces of legislation to come \nbefore this body. It will open a new chapter for agriculture and rural \nAmerica, a product of which I am very proud.\n  I also thank the agricultural leaders in my State of Colorado who \nhave been so helpful to me over the last 2\\1/2\\ years as we have helped \ncraft the farm bill before the Senate: Commissioner John Stup, the \ncommissioner of Colorado's Department of Agriculture; Kent Peppler and \nLee Swensen with the Rocky Mountain Farmers Union; Alan Foutz and Troy \nBredekamp, leaders of the Colorado Farm Bureau; Nick Midcap, Darrell \nHannavan, and Dusty Tallman, who have labored so hard on this bill, who \nare with the Colorado Wheat Growers Association; Byron Weathers and \nMark Sponslor, leaders of the Colorado Corn Growers Association; Terry \nFrankhauser with the Colorado Cattlemen's Association; Scott Johnson \nand Bill Hammerich with the Colorado Livestock Association; and from \nthe Independent Cattlemen of Colorado, Doug Zalesky, John Reid, and \nReid and Kathleen Kelly. I thank Gregg Yando with the Colorado Dairy \nFarmers of America, Jim Ehrlich with the Colorado Potato Administrative \nCouncil, and a host of other Colorado people who have been instrumental \nin our efforts in moving this bill forward.\n  This legislation is truly a bipartisan, forward-thinking, balanced \npackage. It is truly the example of how this Senate ought to work, \nbringing Democrats and Republicans together on what is a major issue. \nThe effort of Senator Reid, the majority leader, to get us to a point \nwhere we will reach conclusion on this bill is something I appreciate. \nThis is, after all, the farm bill. We ought not be debating the great \nissues of our time, whether those be Iraq or immigration or issues \nhaving to do with Latin America, issues that are extraneous, on this \nlegislation. Senator Reid's effort to make sure what we are doing is to \nkeep the focus of this bill on agriculture and rural America and the \nsubstantive components of the farm bill is important. I hope my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, will \nsay: Yes, we have to get a process that gets us to conclusion on the \nfarm bill.\n  Today is a particularly proud day for me. The occupant of the chair \nwas very involved in helping me understand the importance of becoming a \nSenator. For that, I will always be appreciative. I still remember that \nin my maiden speech on the floor more than 2 years ago, I spoke about \nthe possibilities and the promise that America's small towns and rural \ncommunities offer for a country that is in need of clean renewable \nenergy, a secure food supply, and responsible stewardship of our land \nand our water. Unfortunately, for too long Washington has overlooked \nthe opportunities rural America can provide and, through a policy of \nneglect and disinterest, has allowed small towns and rural communities \nacross the country to wither on the vine.\n  This legislation will change that course of neglect. The bill before \nus will bring new life and energy to rural America. It will do so in a \nnumber of different ways. It will do so through a set of smart \ninvestments that help farmers and ranchers and business men and women \nbuild a clean energy economy that has its roots in the fields of \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers. It lays the infrastructure for rural \nbroadband and microbusiness loans for accelerated economic development \nin rural areas. It creates incentives for the wise stewardship of land \nand water--practices from which we can all benefit. It puts money into \nnutrition programs that take on the scourge of hunger and allow low-\nincome children to learn in our schools. It helps bring balance and \ncertainty to the agricultural markets so that Americans can continue to \nenjoy a healthy and secure food supply. It does all of this while \nclosing loopholes that have allowed Federal dollars to end up in the \nhands of people who should not have been eligible for assistance in the \nfirst place. It is a smart and fiscally responsible bill.\n\n  I grew up on a ranch in the San Luis Valley a few miles north of the \nColorado-New Mexico border. My family has farmed and ranched that same \nland for five generations. For much of my life, I spent long days in \nthe fields with my family tending to the cattle, baling hay, and fixing \nfences. It was hard work, and my hands are permanently calloused from \nnearly three decades of work on that ranch. But from that work, we \nalways knew we loved our ranch, our land and water, and our way of \nlife. To be a farmer or a rancher is a hard life, let there be no \nmistake about that. While the rest of the world might go home at 5 \no'clock in the afternoon, for those who are working the farms and the \nranches, you don't go home until probably half an hour after the sun \nsets at 9 o'clock. It is very hard work.\n  My parents always said that they could not give us--my seven brothers \nand sisters--material riches, but they could teach us values that come \nfrom work, family, and faith. These are the values one finds in rural \ncommunities across America. These are the priceless and timeless values \nthat built this country. In 1787, Thomas Jefferson sent a letter to \nGeorge Washington in which he talked about the role of the farmer in a \nyoung democracy. Thomas Jefferson said: ``Agriculture . . . is our \nwisest pursuit because it will in the end contribute most to real \nwealth, good morals and happiness.''\n  Those of us who have had the privilege of growing up on a farm or a \nranch or of visiting some farms and spending time with America's \nproducers can appreciate how important agriculture and our rural \ncommunities are. Unfortunately, in the coming days this bill will be \ncriticized by some in the media, by some Members in this Chamber, and \nothers for being too favorable to farmers, for putting too much money \ninto conservation programs, for supporting rural development \ninitiatives, or for making too many investments in biofuels production. \nIn short, critics will ask why Federal dollars should go into programs \nthat on the surface only appear to benefit rural communities. They are \nwrong. The answer is very simple: The health of our farms, ranches, and \nour rural communities is vital to American prosperity. Everyone \nbenefits from a strong and smart farm bill. The farmer in eastern \nColorado, the third grader eating fresh fruits and vegetables at lunch, \nand the mother who wants us to reduce our dependence on foreign oil all \ngain from a strong and balanced farm bill.\n  I wish to take a few moments to walk through the bill and explain why \nit is so important for farmers, for children, and for all Americans \nthat the Senate pass this bill.\n  Since being elected to the Senate in 2004, I have often spoken about \nhow Washington's policies in recent years have been blind to the needs \nof rural Americans. More than half of the counties in America are \nrural. In my State of Colorado, 44 of the 64 counties are rural. In my \nview, Washington's neglect of rural America has made rural America a \nforgotten America. Businesses on main streets in many towns and \nvillages across my State have been boarded up. FSA offices have been \nclosed or attempted to be closed, including the very recent actions of \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture. Family farmers are having to sell \ntheir land after years of drought. To see Washington's neglect of our \nrural communities is disheartening, when we know how much possibility \nand promise rural America holds. With modest investments, rural America \ncan be the engine of a clean energy economy, fueling an alternative \nenergy revolution that capitalizes on the hard work, productivity, and \nentrepreneurship of farmers and ranchers.\n  This is why I am so pleased that the 2007 farm bill makes such wise \ninvestments in rural development. The bill provides $355 million for \nrural development. These investments will enable entrepreneurs in rural \ncommunities to leverage microenterprise loans to build their \nbusinesses. They will help health care providers provide access to \nunderserved rural communities. They will help get broadband Internet \naccess into small towns. Broadband access is to rural communities in \nthe 21st century what highways were in the 20th century and railroads \nwere in the 19th century. It is the infrastructure that is essential to \neconomic development. The $26 million in this bill for broadband\n\n[[Page S13954]]\n\nwill help close the digital divide that is preventing rural businesses \nand entrepreneurs from fully participating in the global economy.\n  Second, this bill includes an energy title that opens up a new \nchapter of opportunity for rural America. In the 2005 Energy Policy Act \nand in the Energy bill we passed earlier this year, we planted the \nseeds for a renewable energy revolution so that we can reduce our very \ndangerous dependence on foreign oil. The farm bill takes the next step, \nhelping farmers and ranchers take advantage of new energy technologies \nthat have been developed in places such as the National Renewable \nEnergy Laboratory in Golden, CO. With the $1.3 billion this bill \ndevotes to energy programs, farmers will be able to apply for grants to \ndevelop biorefineries and to improve the handling, harvest, transport, \nand storage of feedstocks for biofuels. The bill includes tax credits \nfor small wind turbines and cellulosic biofuel production. It \nstimulates research into the methods and technologies that will allow \nthe most productive land in the world to provide more and more of our \nenergy. Our farmers and ranchers want to be a part of the solution to \nour addiction to foreign oil. They want to help reduce the amount of \noil we import while helping stimulate a clean energy economy that is \nbuilt on innovation, technology, and taking advantage of the production \ncapabilities of rural America.\n  This energy title is a win-win for our rural communities. It is my \nhope that with this energy title in the farm bill, together with the \nother energy legislation we have adopted in the Senate and in \ncommittee, the vision Senator Grassley and I had with respect to the 25 \nby 2025 resolution will help us grow our way to energy independence, \nbecause the 25 by 2025 resolution recognizes at its heart that we in \nAmerica can grow 25 percent of our energy from renewable energy \nresources by the year 2025. This farm bill takes us a significant way \ndown that road.\n\n  The third aspect of the legislation I want to emphasize is the \nconservation title. Farmers and ranchers are some of the best stewards \nof our land and water. We need a farm bill that recognizes and \nencourages the good stewardship practices from which we all benefit.\n  To understand why the conservation programs in the farm bill are so \nimportant--and to understand how we will all benefit from them--just \nvisit one of the ranches along the Yampa River in northwest Colorado. \nYou quickly see the ranchers there do not simply put high-quality, \ngrassfed beef on our dinner table. They guard the open spaces that draw \nsightseers and recreationalists from all around the world. They protect \nthe clean water that comes to our homes. They provide habitat for fish \nand game, bringing millions of dollars in revenue from fishing and \nhunting into our State.\n  Unfortunately, you cannot find a price on the Chicago Mercantile \nExchange for these values in clean water, clean air, habitat, and open \nspace dividends that ranchland and farmland provide to America. And if \na ranch goes under or is developed, we lose the conservation value that \nfarms and ranches provide.\n  So how do we address this challenge? How do we address this challenge \nin this bill? We do it through existing, effective programs that reward \nfarmers and ranchers for the conservation practices from which we all \nbenefit.\n  Thanks to Chairman Harkin's leadership, the 2007 farm bill is the \ngreenest farm bill in the history of America. It reauthorizes highly \nsuccessful conservation programs such as the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, EQIP, and the Conservation Reserve Program, CRP.\n  The bill reauthorizes EQIP, which provides cost-share funding and \ntechnical assistance to producers so they can address environmental \nissues on their lands. In Colorado, we receive around $30 million to \n$40 million a year for projects that, for example, reduce water waste, \nimprove water quality or provide fencing that keeps livestock out of \nsensitive areas.\n  The bill also reauthorizes the Conservation Reserve Program, which \nhelps producers retire and restore agricultural land that, if taken out \nof production, would provide significant environmental benefits. In \nColorado alone, we have around 2.3 million acres enrolled in CRP for \npurposes ranging from erosion control and habitat preservation to \nimproving water use. The reauthorization in this bill will allow us to \ncontinue to make these wise investments in stewardship.\n  Mr. President, a parliamentary inquiry: How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, if my colleague from Tennessee will allow \nme, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes to get through \nthe conclusion of my speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized \nfor an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend and \ncomrade from Tennessee.\n  Beyond the conservation programs which are so much at the heart of \nthis legislation, we also know that at the heart of this legislation is \nthe food security of our country and the nutrition title.\n  In addition to the rural development, energy production, and \nconservation practices in this bill, the 2007 farm bill helps ensure \nthe continued production of safe, healthy food right here at home.\n  Since our founding, agriculture has been indispensable to our economy \nand our prosperity. Corn, tobacco, and cotton helped fund the \nRevolution and the organization of our young States. The promise of \nfree land brought millions of new settlers to the West where they \nplanted wheat, raised cattle, and cultivated the earth. The \nproductivity of our farms sustained the war effort as we defeated the \nFascists and Nazis, helped rebuild Europe and Japan, and liberated the \nworld. Now, as we search for new ways to power our economy, our farms \nand ranches offer new promise for a new, clean energy economy.\n  Growing up on a ranch in the San Luis Valley taught me how tough it \nis to make a living off the land. You work sunup to sundown all year, 7 \ndays a week, to raise a good crop or a healthy herd, and then, without \nanything you can do to prevent it, a hailstorm, disease, drought, or \nflooding can wipe it all away in a moment's notice. When you do have a \nbumper crop, you sometimes find everyone else has had a bumper crop \nthat year too. As a result, prices fall and you actually sometimes do \nworse.\n  The bill that is before us helps producers and, therefore, helps all \nof us by bringing some level of certainty and structure to agricultural \nmarkets. We cannot and should not take the risk out of our farming \nand ranching--it is a tough business however you cut it--but we can \nhelp make the very bad years a little less painful in rural America. \nThe little bit of uncertainty that favorable loan rates or a \ncountercyclical program can provide is often the difference between \nwhether a family loses the farm or keeps the farm.\n\n  Why, some may ask, should we care about whether a family is able to \nstay on their farm? Why should we care? For many years--from my days as \nattorney general to my days in the Senate--I have always had a sign on \nmy desk that says: ``No Farms, No Food.'' To me, that statement tells \nthe story about the importance of food security for our country.\n  The fresh fruits, grain, meats, and vegetables that come from our \nfarms and ranches are essential to public health, reducing hunger, and \nensuring that Americans can always find affordable, safe food at their \ngrocery store.\n  A great example of how the bill benefits both producers and consumers \nis the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, championed by Chairman \nHarkin, which provides fruits and vegetables to schoolchildren across \nall of America. We are expanding this program now so it covers all 50 \nStates, up from the 14 States that have been covered by this program in \nthe past. For me and my constituents in Colorado, it means that 80,000 \nchildren are going to get fresh fruits and vegetables in their school \nlunches. This will reduce childhood obesity, increase productivity in \nschool, and teach habits for a healthy lifestyle.\n  I want to speak briefly about some farm bill reform measures that are \nincluded in the bill.\n\n[[Page S13955]]\n\n  Although we all benefit from smart investments in programs that help \nprovide stability and certainty for producers, we also must be wary of \nwaste and abuse. The 2002 farm bill was not perfect, and I am pleased \nthe Agriculture Committee took this year's reauthorization as an \nopportunity to address its shortcomings.\n  Our bill, for example, includes significant reforms on how we deal \nwith payment limits. USDA payments must now be attributed to an actual \nperson--a real live person, one who breathes and walks and works the \nsoil--as opposed to some amorphous entity. Previously, individuals were \nfinding ways to collect payments from up to three different operations \nunder the so-called three-entity rule. We have abolished that in this \nfarm bill.\n  The 2002 farm bill also left open several loopholes that have allowed \nfarm bill dollars to go to nonfarmers for land that is no longer in \nagriculture. I am proud to have worked with my colleague from Nebraska, \nSenator Ben Nelson, on language incorporated into the legislation that \nstops this waste. Our language prohibits the distribution of commodity \nsupport payments for land that has been subdivided for houses or \ntransferred to other nonagricultural uses. This is an important fix.\n  So is our reform to how Washington deals with agricultural disasters \nequally important. From time to time, farmers and ranchers get hit by \ndroughts, floods, or tornadoes that wipe away their crop. It happened \nto us in Colorado last winter in the southeastern part of our State, \nwhere a blizzard buried whole herds of livestock. Our producers lost \nthousands of head of cattle out in southeastern Colorado.\n  How did Washington respond to that agricultural disaster? Washington \nresponded in its own typical fashion: USDA declares it a disaster. \nCongress scrambles to find emergency funding. The bill gets stalled, \nand then farmers and ranchers have to wait 2, 3, 4 years before they \nget any kind of relief.\n  What is wrong with this picture? First, we are not delivering \ndisaster assistance efficiently. Second, we should not be relying on \nemergency spending to provide disaster assistance. We need to put these \nexpenditures back on the books.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 3 more minutes to \nfinish my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered. The Senator is recognized for 3 \nadditional minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. On disaster assistance and the importance of us creating \na permanent disaster assistance fund, first, we are not delivering \ndisaster assistance efficiently to date. Secondly, we should not be \nrelying on emergency spending to provide disaster assistance. We need \nto put these expenditures back on the books. Congress has passed 23--\n23--ad hoc disaster assistance bills since 1988. That is 23 since 1988. \nAlthough I am supportive of this emergency assistance and have helped \npush this emergency disaster assistance forward in the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, I believe we need to create a system for disaster aid that will \nrespond more efficiently and promptly to the needs of our ranchers and \nfarmers.\n  What we have done on this bill--thanks to the leadership of Chairman \nBaucus and Ranking Member Grassley on the Finance Committee--is to \ncreate a permanent trust fund for disaster assistance. This will allow \nus to maintain discipline and high standards for determining when to \npay out disaster funds, and it will allow producers to get help more \nquickly. It is a sensible and fiscally responsible solution.\n  The American farmer has always been an engine for prosperity and \nopportunity in America. Through revolution, western settlement, \ndepression, and world wars, the men and women who work our lands have \nalways been there to lead us through the next great challenge that \nfaces our country. Today, we are faced with a new challenge--that of \nbuilding a clean energy economy for the 21st century--and we need the \nhelp of our farmers and ranchers to get us there.\n  Our national security, our economic security, and our environmental \nsecurity all demand that we grow our way toward energy independence. It \nis an imperative, but it is also a great opportunity for our Nation.\n  The country that successfully replaces its imports of foreign oil \nwith clean, homegrown energy will reap competitive and technological \nadvantages that will keep it out in front of the rest of the world for \ndecades to come. We can play a part in this new economy, but the \nproductivity and ingenuity of rural America is our greatest untapped \nresource in our quest to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  I am excited about this bill, with its investments in rural \ndevelopment, energy technology, and wise stewardship. It taps the great \nresource of rural America while strengthening our ability to produce \nclean, safe, and affordable food.\n  This bill represents the best type of work we can do in the Senate--\ncooperative, bipartisan work that is focused on creating new \nopportunities for our country.\n\n  I thank again the leadership of both the Agriculture and Finance \nCommittees for allowing us to move forward with this legislation and to \nbring the legislation to the floor today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senator Dorgan, by unanimous consent, \nis to follow me. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Domenici be \nrecognized for up to 15 minutes, and then Senator Casey for up to 15 \nminutes, following the remarks of Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nthe next Democratic speaker in order be Senator Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that, \nalthough I may not need it, I be granted an additional 5 minutes for my \nremarks to complete my speech, and that I be able to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, would you please let me know when I have 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. President, I first congratulate Senator Harkin and Senator \nChambliss for their work on the farm bill. I know we want to move \ntoward that as quickly as possible, and I look forward to a successful \nconclusion of that legislation. But for the next few minutes, I wish to \nspeak on a different subject.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2312 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are now debating the farm bill, and a \nnumber of my colleagues have talked about the particular provisions of \nthe farm bill that is brought to us by the committee. I think the farm \nbill is a pretty good bill and I certainly intend to support it and I \nam pleased to be here to speak on it. I spoke last evening briefly. But \nI wish to make a couple of comments about family farmers, generally, \nbefore I talk about the bill and then also talk about the amendment \nthat I, along with Senator Grassley from Iowa, will be offering.\n  First, the issue of family farming is one that is not often discussed \nbecause when people here talk about the farm bill, the agriculture \nbill; they talk about the agricultural industry. Let me explain that my \ninterest in this is largely to try to keep a network of families living \nout in the country under the yard lights, trying to raise food for a \nhungry world.\n  These are family farms that exist because they are out there trying \nto make a living, grow a crop, raise a family. They face all kinds of \nchallenges--challenges that most of us don't face. They plant a seed in \nthe ground, and they live on hope. They plant a seed and hope it grows. \nThey hope it rains.\n\n[[Page S13956]]\n\nThey hope it doesn't rain too much to wash the seed out. Then they hope \nthey get a growing season that gives them a chance to raise a crop. \nThey hope it doesn't develop crop disease. They hope it doesn't hail \nand destroy the crop. They hope they get to harvest with something \nstanding in the fields that they can, at that point, get off the field \nand take to a grain elevator, and at that point they hope the price \nwill be decent. They don't know. If they survive all of those hopes and \nget to the grain elevator with the grain and perhaps get a decent \nprice, maybe they make a decent living, but it is just as likely that \nthey don't. Those families live out there alone, taking all the risks.\n  I recall about a year and a half ago driving into a town called \nZeeland, ND, and meeting with a group of ranchers and farmers. They had \nbeen through a devastating drought where everything was destroyed. It \nlooked like moonscape in the pastures driving into town. These ranchers \nand farmers had owned livestock they already had to sell, because if \nyou don't have feed, you cannot keep them; they have to go to the \nlivestock market. So they talked about what they were trying to get \nthrough, with no crops, no pasture, no capability to keep their cattle \nand conditions that forced them to market. That is just one issue, the \ndrought. In that case, it was everything to them.\n  So what most farmers face in times where they don't have a \ndevastating drought or some other natural weather disaster, they face \neconomic circumstances that don't give them much of an opportunity \neither. That is why we have a farm bill, a safety net, to try to help \nfarmers through tough times.\n  If you think about a farmer out there living under a yard light, \ntrying to plow the land, plant a seed, harvest a crop, and make a \nliving, here is what they face. When they order a load of gas to come \nout to gas up their tractor and their combine and till their fields, \nthey discover the diesel fuel or gas is costing a fortune. They could \nnot help that, they had nothing to do with that, but they are paying a \nfortune, as is the rest of the country, for this fuel they need.\n  The fertilizer prices are skyrocketing. If they are fortunate enough, \nfor example, to get a crop and get the crop to market someplace, they \nhave to find a foreign home for a fair amount of the crop, and they \nhave to pay the railroads. The railroads, as you know, overcharge, and \nin my State the Public Service Commission estimates they are paying \n$100 million a year more than they should. Farmers are bearing a \nsubstantial portion of that.\n  So if they get their crops to the marketplace and to the county \nelevator and ship it somewhere, if some of it goes into a grocery \nmanufacturing facility and comes out the other side, the farmer who \nstarted up the tractor, plowed the field, planted a seed of corn, and \nthen hoped and was successful, got a stand of corn, cultivated the \ncorn, and then harvested the corn, and that seed of corn then went to a \ngrocery manufacturer--guess what. They then flake the corn and put it \nin a box and call it cornflakes. It has a fancy logo on the front, and \nthey send it to the grocery store. They get more for flaking the corn \nthan the farmer does for driving the tractor, planting the seed, and \nharvesting the corn. The fact is, they get more than the farmer does \nfor growing it. The same is true for puffed rice and wheat chex. You \nrice it, puff it, flake it, you check it, and they get more than the \nfamily farmer who had to grease the combine and the tractor, plow the \nfurrow, and plant the seed.\n  The farmer faces near monopolies in every single direction. If they \nwant to sell a cow, steer, or bull, guess what. They face a packers' \nindustry that is highly concentrated in every direction, the oil \nindustry, the rail industry, the big packers, and the grain industry. \nIn every direction, the family farmers living out there are struggling \nand trying to make a living, trying to get along, when they are \nsurrounded by monopolies or near monopolies in economic circumstances \nwhere it is pretty tough for them.\n  Yesterday, I talked a bit about value. Why do we care? I suppose you \ncould have corporations farming America from California to Maine, and \nthen we would not sing ``this land is your land, this land is my \nland.'' I suppose we can produce America's foods that way. I think \nfamily farmers--at least in my part of the country--produce more than \njust food, they produce communities. They are the blood vessels that \nflow into rural areas and communities. I mentioned yesterday that an \nauthor named Critchfield once wrote a book about what this contributes, \nand that is that family farmers are the seedbed of family values, and \nthat seedbed nurtures family values from family farms to small towns to \nbig cities.\n  Family farms are important to this country. We put together a farm \nbill to try to provide a safety net because during the tough times, \nwhen they reach a really tough patch--international price depressions \nfor commodities, disasters, natural disasters, all kinds of things that \nconfront family farmers in a disastrous way--we want to have a safety \nnet for them to get through tough times instead of getting washed out \nevery time there is a problem. The big corporations and agrifactories \nhave the financial strength to make it through tough times. We have put \ntogether a farm program, called a safety net, to try to help family \nfarmers through difficult times.\n  I know some view this notion of family farming as some sentimental \njourney back to yesteryear. A friend of mine named Chuck Suchy is a \nsinger and songwriter. He has a song, ``Saturday Night at the Bohemian \nHall,'' describing what it was like growing up on the farm and \ngathering at the Bohemian Hall to swap stories and talk about the \nweather and the crops.\n\n  The description I gave yesterday of what one of the writers in North \nDakota--a farmer and a rancher--who used to ask the question that needs \nto be asked of this country, I think, is important. Rodney Nelson asked \nthe question, ``What is it worth?'' It is worth noting Rodney's \nquestion. What is it worth for the country to have a kid who knows how \nto pour cement? What is it worth for a kid to know how to drive a \ntractor? What is it worth to know how to teach a newborn calf to suck \nmilk from a pail? What is it worth for a kid to know how to grease a \ncombine, drive a tractor, plant a field, work in the cold winter, and \nwork in the hot sunshine outdoors? What is all of that worth? Well, the \nfact is that it is important, and it contributes to this country in \nsignificant ways. In World War II, we sent millions of young people \nfrom America's farms over to go fight. They could do anything, fix \nanything, drive anything. They were unbelievably important to this \ncountry. The only place you learn all those skills is on the family \nfarm in this country. That is why family farming is not just some \nsentimental journey; it is a value system for the country.\n  Does this country care about families who live on farms? Do they care \nabout putting together a safety net for them? The answer should be yes. \nThis farm bill says yes, and I support it. I want to make it better.\n  Senator Grassley and I are going to offer an amendment that says if \nwe are going to do this--and we should--then let's provide reform with \nrespect to payment limits and really make the payment limits effective \nso we are providing a safety net for family farmers, not a set of \ngolden arches for the largest corporate agrifactories in the country.\n  Let me read some of the records of farm payment recipients and \nexplain why it is necessary for us to have a payment limit. Senator \nGrassley and I say, No. 1, there should be a payment limit of $250,000 \nper farm. No. 2, we say you ought to have to be involved in farming to \nget a farm program benefit. That is not very radical.\n  I will read some of the payments. This comes from USDA information, \nand this is for 3 crop years, 2003 through 2005. The Balmoral Farming \nPartnership got $7.9 million. Phillips Farm in Mississippi got $5.9 \nmillion. Kelley Enterprises got $4.9 million. Walker Place got $4.6 \nmillion. Dublin Farms got $4.2 million. I could keep reading, but I \ndon't think I need to read a lot more. But take a look at what happened \nwith the farm program. Here is an example. In many ways, I am \nreluctantly reading the names, but they are public, and if someone is \ngoing to receive this funding and it is public information, it is \nreasonable to use it as an example. Benton Farms, Tyler, AL, got $2.5 \nmillion. Haney Farms of Athens, AL, Horace Haney got $607,000, and \nShirley, Keith, and Matthew Haney each got $607,000. Combined, the\n\n[[Page S13957]]\n\nHaney family got $2.3 million. Pickens and Son Company got $4.3 \nmillion. The Storey family got $2.7 million. Ronald Storey got \n$956,000, Hazel Storey got $932,000, Ben Storney got $478,000, Rebecca \nStorey got $430,000--I could do this for a while as well. I have pages \nof this. This is not a safety net for family farmers to get through \ntough times. It has become much more than that. It has become lucrative \nfor big enterprises to farm the farm program and get paid millions of \ndollars, and it is wrong.\n  Our amendment is reasonably simple. It says we should have a payment \nlimitation of $250,000, and you should have to be required to be \ninvolved in farming in order to collect farm program benefits.\n  It is important to note that the Agriculture Committee made some \nstrides in this area as they brought the bill to the floor. They \neliminated the three-entity rule, which itself was a loophole that \nneeded to be closed. They provide for attribution, direct attribution, \nso the payments are attributed to an individual. It is not as if the \nAgriculture Committee didn't do anything. They did.\n  My colleague, Senator Salazar, talked about section 1105, and that \nsection is also something that can be helpful. My own view of section \n1105 is that it doesn't solve the problem entirely. So the proposal \nSenator Grassley and I offer will address this in a significant way.\n  I mentioned yesterday that, to give you an example of how far this \nhas gone--having nothing to do with farming--if you had base acres for \nrice or other crops--for program crops--and have base acres on land \nthat hasn't been farmed for 20 years, has not produced a crop for 20 \nyears, people who own that land but have never farmed in their life are \ngetting farm program payments on land that hasn't produced a crop in 20 \nyears because it had a base acre in the mid to early 1980s. That makes \nno sense to me. That is not about providing a safety net.\n  There is no stronger supporter of family farming in this Chamber than \nmyself, and I am sure others would say the same about their support for \nfamily farming. But it seems to me we need to close these loopholes. \nWhy on earth would we have a production base, base acres, on land that \nhas, in many cases, nothing to do with farming?\n  I mentioned yesterday that down north of Houston, TX, they were \nselling what are referred to as ``cowboy starter kits.'' You buy 10 \nacres, put a house on 1 acre, run a horse or cut hay on the other 9 \nacres, and you can get a farm program payment. The reason it is more \nprevalent in rice is that the payment per acre is over a hundred \ndollars an acre, as opposed to the other crops that are much less. Does \nit pass the test of reasonableness anywhere for someone who has never \nfarmed to buy 10 acres someplace and get a farm program payment when \nthey are not farming the 10 acres and it hasn't grown anything for 20 \nyears? That does not meet any test of anything.\n\n  We can close that loophole, but the more effective way to close this \nis to say you can't get farm program payments unless you are actively \ninvolved in farming. Should an arts patron in San Francisco get $2-plus \nmillion? She is not a farmer. She just comes from a family who used to \nhave a farm, and she gets just over $2 million. We have, I think it is \n300 or 400 people living in New York City, in that mountain of \nconcrete, who get farm program payments. We have people in Los Angeles, \nCA, who don't set foot on a farm who get farm program payments. Does \nthat meet any test, or does somebody just not care about that and say: \nWe just want to give payments to make us all feel good.\n  I feel good when we give a payment to a family farmer as a safety net \npayment to help them through troubled times. When prices are high and \nthe crops are bountiful, if you have a bumper crop and good prices, in \nmy judgment, you don't need the Government's help. With respect to the \nlarge enterprises, if you want to farm three or four counties, God \nbless you. I don't think the Federal Government has to be your banker. \nYou have every right to farm as much as you want.\n  Some people would say to me, and they have said: That discriminates \nagainst the big operators, doesn't it? But I say: The purpose of the \nfarm program is to be a safety net to help the family farm get through \ndifficult times. They said: What is a family farm? Describe to me a \nfamily because you can't describe it. I remind them of Michelangelo, \nwho said when asked how did he sculpt David, he said: I took a piece of \nmarble, and then I chipped away everything that wasn't David. We could \neasily describe what most of us believe to be a family farm just by \nchipping away what isn't.\n  Is it a family farm when you have huge corporate enterprises with \nmultiple family members getting $600,000, $700,000? Is that a family \noperation? I don't think so. Huge corporations sucking millions of \ndollars out of the farm program by farming the farm program? I don't \nthink that is what was intended.\n  If you are a reformer, if you believe in reform--and we talk a lot \nabout change and reform around here--in my judgment, one has to decide \nto do the right thing on this issue, and the right thing is to limit \nfarm program payments to $250,000. That is a great deal of money. And \nat the same time, we have provided the disaster title in this bill, \nwhich I think is a significant improvement. Then decide, if you are \ngoing to get farm program payments, you have to be actively involved in \nfarming.\n  We provide opportunities for people to get, for example, loans to go \nto college, but we don't say to them: You can come and get your loan; \nwe don't care what you do with it. We will only give college loans to \nthose going to college. The same is true with a whole series of items. \nWe actually have a circumstance that we give farm program payments to \npeople who have never been on a farm and don't intend to be on a farm. \nThey just want to collect the farm program payments.\n  Even those who collect it think it is absurd. You can read the papers \nand gauge the reaction of people who say: I don't understand this at \nall. I bought 15 acres to build a house on, and I am getting farm \nprogram payments. What on Earth is the Government doing? Even the \nrecipients scratch their heads and wonder what on Earth this is all \nabout.\n  I only ask that we, in a bipartisan way--and this amendment is \nbipartisan--decide to join together to do real reform. I want to be \nproud of this farm bill. I think Senator Harkin, my colleague, Senator \nConrad, Senator Chambliss, and others have done some good work, but it \ncan be improved upon by the passage of this amendment. It has a payment \nlimit, and that also provides that those who receive farm program \npayments should be actively engaged in farming.\n  Some will think that is unbelievably radical. It is, of course, not \nradical at all. It is just a significant investment in common sense. My \nhope is that my colleagues will believe that is the right thing to do.\n  It is sad but true, this is a hungry world in which we live. \nPassengers on this planet circle the Sun. There are about 6.4 billion \nneighbors. We, through Divine Providence, ended up in this little space \ncalled the United States of America. We are blessed. We have the \nopportunity to have a wonderful lifestyle, standard, and scale of \nliving. We have the ability to produce a prodigious amount of food. But \neven as I speak, a significant number of children have died in the last \n10 minutes because they did not have enough to eat; 600 million to 700 \nmillion people go to bed in this world with an ache in their belly \nbecause they didn't have enough to eat. Think of that: They didn't have \nenough to eat. And we have economic all-stars called family farmers in \nthis country who produce substantial amounts of food, and some people \nwant them to believe somehow that is a liability. It is not. It is an \nunbelievable asset that in many ways can contribute to stability and \nworld peace.\n  Even as we think through all of these issues about our contribution \nto the world and about what we can do, it is important to think about \nour contribution at home in terms of building the kind of country we \nwant. I want to see a country in the future that continues to have \npeople living on family farms, producing food for a hungry world, and \ndoing so in a way with, in effect, a partnership with the policymakers \nwho have decided to create a safety net to say: We think you are \nimportant to this country's economy and this country's culture. For \nthat reason, we have\n\n[[Page S13958]]\n\na farm safety net. And when you run into tough times, you are not going \nto be alone. This country is going to have a safety net, and it is \ngoing to help you through.\n  I conclude by saying we should not ever believe that family farming \nis a liability. It is an enormous asset that contributes substantially \nto the character and value system of this country. I hope this Chamber \nwill stand up for that value system. When we do, family farmers around \nthis country will begin to be able to think about spring planting once \nagain and begin next year with renewed hope.\n  I said yesterday, and I will say it again: You cannot be a family \nfarmer, you cannot live out alone under the yard lights unless you live \non a reservoir of hope. Everything is about hope for a better future, \nand I think the farm bill, amended by our amendment, could give farmers \na substantial amount of renewed hope.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the next two Democratic \nspeakers, after the previously ordered lineup, be Senator Baucus and \nSenator Wyden, up to 15 minutes each; further, that in the previous \norder, Senator Stabenow be recognized for up to 30 minutes and Senator \nCraig for 30 minutes--sorry, Senator Isakson be recognized for up to 30 \nminutes and Senator Craig--let me try to get through this. I could say \nit is the penmanship, but it is not. It is my interpretation--that \nSenator Stabenow be recognized for up to 30 minutes, Senator Craig for \nup to 30 minutes prior to Senator Isakson--Stabenow, I am sorry.\n  Madam President, if you have that straight, you are an unbelievable \npresider. I will send it to you in written form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Thank goodness. Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise today, once again, to talk about a \nthreatened veto by the President of the United States. We spent many \nweeks debating the Children's Health Insurance Program, months, really, \nwhen you consider all the time. People worked very hard on both sides \nof the aisle on children's health insurance. Yet despite all that work, \ndespite all that bipartisanship, despite all of the hours and the \nenergy that went into getting a bipartisan bill on children's health \ninsurance, we have the President of the United States vetoing that \nlegislation and threatening to veto it yet again.\n  Unfortunately, I stand today to talk about another threatened veto. \nPresident Bush is threatening to veto the farm bill, which makes no \nsense at all not only because of the work that went into this bill by \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Senate, that is reason enough for him \nnot to veto important legislation such as this, but I think it is even \ngraver than that. It is an even graver threat than talking about \nvetoing legislation because when the President of the United States, if \nhe were to carry through on his threat to veto the farm bill, he is \nvetoing a lot of provisions that he should not be coming out against \nand fighting against. The President is vetoing a farm bill which does \nso much for nutrition, just taking one example. We know the committee \nthis bill came out of is not just the Agriculture Committee, it is the \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, and that word \n``nutrition'' is critically important.\n  To give some examples of what this means for families across America, \nhere is what we are talking about when we talk about nutrition \nprograms. Of course, food stamps being a big part of that, I will go \nthrough some of the elements of that program in a moment, the Fruit and \nVegetable Snack Program, No. 2; No. 3, the Emergency Food Assistance \nProgram, known in Washington by the acronym TEFAP--all of these \nprograms provide children and families who would otherwise go hungry \nwith food.\n  The farm bill reauthorizes those programs, a Washington word \n``reauthorize'' for telling us we are going to fund them again. \nFinally, the overall title, the section of the bill that is entitled \n``Nutrition,'' that title provides over $4 billion over 5 years to help \non these important priorities.\n  So what are we talking about with food stamps? A couple of points. \nWhile the rest of the world received an increase in wages or an \nincrease in purchasing power in parts of our Government and economy, a \nlot of people on food stamps were left behind the last couple of years.\n  What are we talking about? We are talking about a couple of changes \nthat make a lot of sense. No. 1, ending benefit erosion, and the \nincreases we provide in this farm bill will increase the purchasing \npower for families who benefit from food stamps.\n  No. 2, deducting the cost of childcare from program eligibility. That \nshouldn't be part of eligibility, a necessity such as childcare for \nworking families and poor families across America. They shouldn't have \nto factor in childcare costs. That is a mistake, and we have changed \nthat. Thank goodness.\n  No. 3, protecting family investments in prepaid college funds and \nretirement savings. Again, when a family's income is being evaluated \nfor eligibility, we should not include prepaid college funds.\n  No. 4, increasing purchasing power for fruits and vegetables with a \nnew pilot program. At long last--and I say this not just because \nPennsylvania will do well, and I am happy to say we have a part of the \nfarm bill that speaks directly to so-called speciality crops, of which \nfruit and vegetables are a big part of the economy of Pennsylvania and \nAmerica, but this is particularly important for poor families and for \nchildren. They should have every opportunity we can provide to have the \nbenefit of getting fresh fruits and vegetables. It is a great idea.\n  Along those lines is an actual program, the Fruit and Vegetable \nProgram. We are committing over $1 billion over 5 years to this \nimportant program. It expands the already-existing program so schools \nin every single State can participate. Does it cover every school in \nevery school district? No; there is not enough money to do that. But it \ndoes expand that program so at least some schools in every State can \nparticipate.\n  Finally, the Fruit and Vegetable Program targets the program to focus \non hungry children to give them the healthy foods they need the most.\n  After food stamps and the Fruit and Vegetable Program is the \nEmergency Food Assistance Program, known as TEFAP. This bill provides \n$100 million each year to purchase food that is then distributed by \nlocal food banks. Again, in addition to that, there is $50 million for \nthe Hunger-Free Communities Program. That particular program under \nTEFAP is for grants to local communities to combat hunger.\n  What does this all mean? It means feeding children in America who \nwould otherwise go hungry and providing basic health care for children \nis another element I talked about earlier when I spoke of the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. Both of these, whether it is the \nfarm bill investments in nutrition or whether it is children's health \ninsurance, are about investing in our children in the dawn of their \nlives, but also it is about building an economy many years from now.\n  I hope the President, when he is making a final decision about the \nfarm bill, will take a close look at what this bill does for children, \nwhat it does for families, and what it does for our farm families all \nacross America. We don't have time today to go through all of it, but \nsuffice it to say this is the first time in many years we have \naddressed these things, and I would ask the President to look at what \nthis farm bill does for dairy farmers.\n\n  I spent time back in the cold of the winter, in Wayne County, PA, and \nmet a young man by the name of Joe Davitt, who has a dairy farm. His \nfather had it before him and now it is his responsibility to take on \nthat incredibly difficult job of long hours, year after year, trying to \nmake ends meet. Our Government, frankly, hasn't done enough to help \nthem make ends meet in this very difficult job, and they are not asking \nfor anything a lot of us don't get help with.\n  This farm bill allows us to give some measure of relief; not nearly \nenough, but some measure of relief for dairy farmers, who are salt-of-\nthe-earth people, who helped build this country and build our farm \neconomy. Finally, at long last, we have a piece of legislation which \ntakes into consideration the struggles and the challenges of dairy\n\n[[Page S13959]]\n\nfarms across Pennsylvania but, indeed, across the country, from one \nshore to the other.\n  There is a lot to recommend in this farm bill, whether it is helping \ndairy farmers, whether it is an investment--long overdue--in specialty \ncrops, and what it does for nutrition for all of America, but \nespecially those who are vulnerable, those who happen to be poor and \nneed help with the basic necessities of life. I hope the President, \nwhen he looks at this legislation--after he has done so much over many \nyears now for people who make $1 million a year, or maybe they make $10 \nmillion a year, or maybe they even make $100 million or more; those \nAmericans have gotten an awful lot of help--he will see this farm bill \nfocuses on families in America having trouble making ends meet, whether \nthey are farm families or whether they happen to be poor Americans who \ncan benefit from our nutrition programs. I hope the President will \nconsider that in the interest of fairness, but also in the interest of \ninvesting in a stronger farm economy, investing in making sure our \nchildren have the nutrition they need, and also making investments in \nconservation, environmental protection, and a whole series of very \nimportant elements to the farm bill.\n  Unfortunately, I think the President, in his veto threat, is \noverlooking all that. I hope he changes his mind. There are some \nAmericans who have done fine, thank you, under this President. And so \nfor him to veto the farm bill would be contrary not just to all those \ninterests, important interests in America--children, families, farmers, \nand farm families--but also it would be contrary to a lot of the work \nthat was done by Chairman Tom Harkin, the chairman of our committee, \nand Ranking Member Chambliss from the State of Georgia; and not only \nthe work they put in, but the work their staffs put in, month after \nmonth after month, working in a bipartisan way, to get this bill on the \nright track.\n  It is not perfect. There will be lots of criticism of this bill, but \nnot nearly enough criticisms are warranted to justify the veto of this \nlegislation. We have to get this done. It is the only time we will work \non this in 5 years. We need to get it done. And the President, if he is \nthinking of the best interests of the country, will sign the \nlegislation.\n  I urge the President, as respectfully as I can, not to veto the farm \nbill. It has broad bipartisan support. We have to get this legislation \ndone.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Minnesota is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, the Senate is now considering the \nfarm bill, and with the leadership of Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member \nChambliss, Senator Conrad, and a Minnesota Congressman, Colin Peterson, \nin the House, the bipartisan farm bill will invest in our farms and \nrural communities so they will be a strong, growing, and innovative \npart of 21st century America.\n  America's farm safety net was created during the Great Depression as \nan essential reform to help support rural communities and protect \nstruggling family farmers from the financial shocks of volatile weather \nand equally volatile commodity prices. Almost 75 years later, the \nreasons for maintaining that strong safety net still exist.\n  The 2002 farm bill actually spurred rural development by allowing \nfarmers in Minnesota and across the country to take risks to expand \nproduction. Because of productivity gains and innovation, including \nadvances in renewable energy, the farm support programs in the 2002 \nfarm bill actually came in $17 billion under budget.\n  As the Senate debates a final 2007 farm bill this week, it is \nimportant not to underestimate the value of a strong bill for States \nsuch as my State of Minnesota, where agriculture is so vital to our \neconomy and our way of life. That is why, as a member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, I support the new farm bill. This includes an \nincreased focus on cellulosic-based ethanol, continued support for a \nstrong commodity safety net, and additional funds for conservation, \nnutrition, and disaster relief.\n\n  Of particular importance is the fact that we have balanced the budget \nwith every dollar of new spending fully offset.\n  Traveling around my State during the last 2 years, I have had the \nopportunity to visit all 87 counties of my State twice, last year and \nthis, and I had the opportunity to talk to many farmers about the good \nand the bad in the last farm bill. I can tell you this: The farm bill \nhas worked to revitalize many of our rural communities across America. \nIt has spurred rural development by allowing farmers in Minnesota and \nacross the country to take risks and expand their agricultural \nproduction. Because of strong commodity prices and advances in \nrenewable energy, the farm support programs in the 2002 farm bill are \nprojected to come in $17 billion under budget.\n  I am pleased this bill continues this safety net, and I appreciate \nthe effort that has also been made to rebalance the commodity programs \nto be more equitable to northern crops such as wheat, oats, barley, \nsoybeans, and canola.\n  Another top priority for Minnesota farmers was creating a permanent \nprogram of disaster assistance. I thank Senator Baucus for the work the \nFinance Committee has put into this provision. Farmers have to come \nback to Congress each year with a tin cup in their hands when in fact \nwe can do it differently. Our State has been hit by drought, flooding, \nand everything in between, and they had to wait 3 years for Congress to \npass another ad hoc disaster relief bill. A permanent program of \ndisaster relief will give farmers security moving forward.\n  One of my major goals for this farm bill was to include a strong \ncellulosic ethanol program. Our corn-based ethanol and soybean-based \nbiodiesel have taken off in Minnesota, and we are ready to expand to \nthe next generation of biofuels--cellulosic ethanol, prairie grasses, \nbiomass that yields more energy and, if done the right way, is better \nfor our environment and conservation.\n  I was proud to draft legislation to provide farmers with an incentive \nto grow cellulosic energy crops, and I thank Chairman Harkin and \nSenator Conrad for working with me to include this in the farm bill. \nThe fact these crops put carbon back in the soil and take less fossil \nfuel to produce offers us the promise of producing a carbon-neutral \nmotor fuel for this country. In short, the Biomass Crop Transition \nProgram, which is what the cellulosic ethanol provision of this farm \nbill is, will allow us to expand on corn ethanol and soy diesel to a \nnew generation of farm-based energy and greater freedom from imported \noil.\n  I am also pleased this farm bill includes legislation I introduced, \nalong with Senator Bond, to provide funding for E-85 pumps. It is a \nchicken-and-egg problem with E-85. Less than 1 percent of our gas \nstations have the E-85 pumps. In the Energy bill, we have more \nrequirements for flex-fuel vehicles, and this bill will help to get the \npumps out there so we can be investing in the farmers and the workers \nof the Midwest instead of the oil cartels of the Mideast.\n  I am also pleased the committee has accepted my amendment to double \nthe authorized funding levels for two programs that serve beginning \nfarmers and ranchers. There are real opportunities today to start out \nin farming, especially in growing areas such as organic farming and \nenergy production. But beginning farmers also face big obstacles, \nincluding limited access to credit and technical assistance, and the \nhigh price of land. The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Programs in this \nfarm bill provide mentoring and outreach for new farmers, and training \nin business planning and credit building--the skills they need to \nsucceed and stay on the land.\n  There are a lot of good things for rural America in this farm bill. \nThere is, however, one critical area where I believe more reform is \nneeded. We need to stop urban millionaires from pocketing farm \nsubsidies intended for hard-working farmers. This reform is in the best \ninterest of Minnesota farmers. Here are the facts: Nationally, 60 farms \nhave collected more than $1 million each under the 2002 farm bill, but \nnone of them were in our State. The average income of Minnesota farms, \nafter expenses, is $54,000. But under the current\n\n[[Page S13960]]\n\nsystem, a part-time farmer can have an income as high as $2.5 million \nfrom outside sources and still qualify for Federal benefits.\n  It makes no sense to hand out payments to multimillionaires when this \nmoney should be targeted to family farmers. Big payments to big-city \ninvestors threaten to undermine the public support for every farm \nprogram, even though the commodity payments are projected to be only 15 \npercent of the total farm bill budget over the next 5 years.\n  A poster boy for what needs to be changed is Maurice Wilder, a \nFlorida-based real estate developer. From 2003 to 2005, he has \ncollected more than $3.2 million in farm payments for properties in \nfive States, even though his net worth is estimated at $500 million. \nNearly 600 residents of New York City, 559 residents of Washington, DC, \nand even 21 residents of Beverly Hills 90210 received Federal farm \nchecks in the past 3 years. Some collected hundreds of thousands of \ndollars. Last time I checked, there wasn't a lot of farmland in those \nneighborhoods.\n\n  We can fix this and do better for our farmers by using the new farm \nbill to close loopholes, tighten payment limits, and enforce tougher \nincome eligibility standards. First, the current Senate and House farm \nbill proposals eliminate the three-entity rule. This will cut down on \nabuse by applying payment limits strictly to individuals and married \ncouples and ending the practice of dividing farms into multiple \ncorporations to multiply payments.\n  Second, a longstanding bill, which is an amendment that will be \nconsidered this week, proposed by Senators Dorgan and Grassley would \nlimit annual payments to $250,000. I will vote in favor of this \nprovision on the Senate floor, and the Senate should adopt it.\n  I also believe a third kind of reform is needed. Congress should act \nto prevent payments that are intended for hard-working farmers from \ngoing to urban millionaires and giant agribusiness.\n  We will be talking about these amendments in the week to come, but I \nwish to say as we move ahead to develop homegrown renewable sources of \nenergy, rural America promises to be central to our Nation's future \nenergy independence as well as the fight against global warming. This \nbill prepares us. This bill heads us in the right direction.\n  Inertia may be the most powerful force in the political universe, but \nafter 75 years, the best interests of America's rural economy demand \nthat we correct the abuses of the past so we can move forward with this \nbill, with some modifications of reform, to ensure a strong safety net \nfor our hard-working farmers.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, may I inquire what the order of business \nis at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is to be recognized for up to 30 \nminutes under the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, many of us are coming to the floor today \nto speak to the new farm bill that the Senate Ag Committee has proposed \nand brought to us over the last several months.\n  Over the years I have had the privilege to participate in a variety \nof farm bill developments and structures as we ultimately came to a new \n5-year farm policy in our country.\n  First of all, let me say for the first time in a good number of years \nwe have actually had the Secretary of Agriculture go out amongst \nAmerican agriculture, ask questions and listen, and send us proposals \nof change in farm policy.\n  We have also had both the House and the Senate committees operating \nextensively in bipartisan ways to hold hearings, looking at the \nexisting farm policy and what may need to be changed to justify a new \nfarm bill.\n  While many are caught up in the bits and pieces of a farm bill \nstructure, what is important to remember is a nation that feeds itself \nis a nation that is, by its own definition, strong and independent. And \nthat has been throughout our history one of our great legacies: that we \ncould produce our own food and fiber to feed our own populations, and \nthen step beyond that to help feed the world.\n  In fact, in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, as we saw a burgeoning \nexport market in agricultural growth, we were expanding our own growth \ncapabilities not only to feed ourselves but to feed the world.\n  That, in part, has been the product of a consistent farm policy over \nthe years that stabilized agriculture, agricultural producers who \nlooked at the primary commodity crops and said: This is the base of \nAmerican agriculture, and this is what we ought to support to assure \nthere is adequate food and fiber for the American consumer.\n  We now take for granted every day of the week that as we walk into \nthe supermarkets of America the shelves will be full and overflowing \nwith an abundance of food. We just take it for granted--unless you are \namongst the very poor, and then you might stand in a soup line. But \nthere are few of those in our country today. And, certainly, for those \nless fortunate there are a variety of food and nutritional programs \nembodied within farm policy that assure there will be minimal nutrition \nvalues offered and provided to America. That is truly one of our great \nlegacies and something I think all Americans can be proud of.\n  Over the years, American agriculture has changed. We think \ntraditionally of corn and wheat and soybeans and cotton and, of course, \nwe used to have a tobacco program in the South that was supported, that \nno longer exists for obvious and important reasons.\n  But little did we recognize something that we now value greatly as a \npart of our nutritional base today: our vegetables, our fruits, and \nthat huge variety that you see on the fresh produce shelves as you walk \ninto any of our great supermarkets across the Nation.\n  And to those of us who have been associated with agriculture all of \nour lives, it is not the meat shelf, it is not the bread shelf, it is \nthe fruits and the vegetables, the specialty crops, the kinds of things \nthat never have been in a farm bill, that we have never spoken clearly \nto, that embodied a very large part of American agriculture.\n  In fact, today, at farmgate, meaning the value of products leaving \nthe farm itself, we view specialty crops as somewhere in the area of 50 \npercent. Not a program crop, not a loan program, not a base support \nprice, but American farmers out there working to diversify and to \nensure the variety that all of our consumers enjoy today.\n  So it is, in my opinion, a very big victory that today I come to the \nfloor, along with a group of my colleagues, to talk about a new \nprovision within farm policy to deal with the specialty crops. And for \nthe next few moments, let me talk about it and its importance as we \nrecognize what it means not only today but what it could mean in the \nfuture.\n  This sector includes vegetables, fruits, nursery crops, herbal crops, \nfloriculture, horticulture, dried fruit, tree nuts, and turf grass. We \nknow about all of those things. Turf grass you do not buy at the fresh \nproduce stand, but if you are building a new home and all of a sudden \nyou have instant yard because the landscaper has laid turf, then you \nknow a lot about turf.\n  In my State of Idaho, that is a rapidly growing and, in some areas, \nurbanizing area; turf farms are a very important part of Idaho \nagriculture today. It may surprise some, when they think of specialty \ncrops, they think of the great agricultural belt known as the San \nJoaquin Valley of California, where you see one different crop after \nanother for hundreds and hundreds of miles across that phenomenally \nfertile stretch of American agricultural soil.\n  But in my State of Idaho, we are one of the top States in the Nation \nas it relates to producing specialty crops. Beyond being the No. 1 \nproducer of potatoes that we certainly recognize, and most of us enjoy, \nIdaho is proud to boost production of cherries, table grapes, mint, \napples, onions, carrots, and a variety of seed, nursery and ornamental \ncrops.\n  The specialty crop industry has never relied, as I earlier mentioned, \non the traditional farm program to support or sustain it. Yet they are \nsubject to high volatility in markets. They face significant risk in \ntheir operations, including pests and disease threats, along with \ntechnical trade barriers and disaster conditions.\n\n[[Page S13961]]\n\n  The inclusion of these new crops does not cost the traditional \nprograms at all because we are not looking for, nor has the specialty \ncrop industry asked for, the kind of program that is represented in \nwheat and barley and pulse crops and sugar and others. These new \nprovisions do not provide direct subsidy to producers but create and \nfund programs that will, among other things, help to improve the \ncompetitiveness of specialty crops, expand valuable nutritional \nprograms, and direct new mandatory funding to specialty crop research.\n  Let me give you an example of what I am talking about. Many States of \nthe Nation now have a growing wine industry. Idaho is amongst those. We \nhave a unique microclimate along the Snake River Valley of Idaho that \nallows us to raise quality grapes and to produce very fine quality \nwine.\n  But the problem of adapting an Australian-based or a German-based or \nan Italian-based grape to a new ecosystem takes research. A few years \nago I was able to get the wine industry of Idaho research grants, hire \na university professor, do the laboratory work, and learn how to manage \na Melbac, or a Shiraz, or a particular type of Cab grape that allows us \nto up our values and up the quality of the wine grapes of our State. \nThat is the kind of program we have embodied in the new specialty crop \ntitle and provision of the farm bill.\n\n  It provides producers better ways to address technical barriers in \ntrade. It assists in the prevention, detection, and eradication of \ninvasive pests and diseases in specialty crops.\n  I am pleased to see the bill extends the authority of specialty crop \nblock grants, a charge which I led back in 2004, and will provide \nfunding to States for locally driven and directed programs relating to \nresearch, commodity promotion, product quality enhancement, food \nsafety, and other areas.\n  These are all very critical to the quality, the safety of the food \nthat the average consumer, once again, walking into the supermarket on \na daily basis simply takes for granted.\n  Mandatory dollars for specialty crop research will help our Nation \nkeep a competitive edge on breeding, genetics, and genomics, also fund \ninitiatives to address a certain economy such as the increased need for \nmechanization and food safety initiatives.\n  Very frankly, fellow Senators, if we do not begin to ensure a labor \nforce to American agriculture, the kind that has largely left \nagriculture over the last 2 years because of the immigration debate and \nthe border crisis that we are now trying to fix, we are going to have \nto see more and more of our industry mechanized or it will simply have \nto move out of our country to an area where that labor force exists.\n  So here is an opportunity in the specialty crop bill to do a little \nmore of that research toward mechanization that again gives us \nopportunities that we heretofore did not have.\n  I also applaud the national expansion of the Fresh Fruit and \nVegetable Snack Program, a program in which Idaho has been fortunate to \nparticipate for several years now. With the expansion, it is estimated \nthat 4.5 million low-income elementary school children in 5,000 schools \nnationwide will benefit from receiving a fresh fruit or vegetable snack \nevery day of the school year.\n  This bill takes a major step forward in recognizing the significance \nof the specialty crop industry to the overall agricultural economy of \nour country. The benefits to the health of U.S. citizens and the need \nfor a stable, affordable, diverse, and secure food supply are clearly \naddressed within the specialty crop title.\n  For the first time in my years in Washington working on farm policy, \nI think it is possible to say the farm bill we currently have on the \nSenate floor, crafted in a bipartisan way, with the administration \nfully participating in the initial input of it, now covers a much \nbroader whole of the American agricultural scene than we have ever \nbefore had.\n  With the inclusion of specialty crops in the overall program, it can \nclearly be said that is the case. So while I know the bill currently \nhas its own problems on the Senate floor based on what may or may not \ntranspire here, this ia a very fine piece of work, in my opinion. Do I \nagree with all of it? No. Would I have written it this way had I been \nchairman of the Ag Committee or had the ability to do so? No, probably \nnot.\n  There are several provisions within it that would simply not be there \nbecause my State of Idaho, for example, does not necessarily care for \nsome of them. For example, the large milk program of dairy is not what \nadjusts or identifies to my State's large and rapidly growing dairy \nindustry. This is designed to protect a much smaller producer; in my \nopinion, a less economical producer today than the kind that has built \nthe dairy industry in my State.\n  Be that as it may, that has always been the character of farm policy. \nHas it been bipartisan? Yes. By definition it has to be. Does it need \nto recognize all regions of our country? Yes, it does.\n  But most importantly, in doing all of those things, what it always \nhas been able to do is to assure the American consumer that food in \nthis country will be relatively inexpensive compared to the amount of \nconsumer income required to put a meal on the table of an American \nfamily. Americans, without question, are blessed because of the \nphenomenal productivity of American agriculture, the ingenuity, the \ntechnology, all that goes there.\n  In part, the stability that has produced that is a product of farm \npolicies down through the decades that have recognized the basic \nprinciple that a nation that can feed itself, that can be assured there \nwill be an abundance of food for itself and use the surplus to sell to \nthe world, is a nation that not only can be preeminent but certainly a \nnation that can stand on its own.\n  Senator Stabenow has just entered the Chamber. She and I were the \nfirst two Senators to actually sit down with the fruits and vegetables \nindustry of our Nation and say: We need a specialty crop title. We need \nprovisions within the farm bill that recognize and bring forth all of \nthe kinds of programs that I have just talked about.\n  Over the course of the last 3 years, working in a bipartisan way, we \nhave done just that. Let me recognize Senator Stabenow for the \nphenomenal work she has done over the last several months in \nshepherding this piece of legislation through to inclusion in the farm \nbill, in working with both sides of the aisle to assure that happened. \nAnd I must say hats off to the Senator from Michigan because she, like \nI, recognizes the phenomenal diversity of agriculture in our State and \nthe need to not only recognize it and enhance it where we can, but to \ndo so in a bipartisan way, that has produced the work product we have \nbefore us.\n  I am proud to stand on the Senate floor today recognizing a small but \nvery important new provision within the farm bill, recognizing the \nnearly 50 percent of gross farm revenue across America today that is \nembodied within the phenomenal specialty crop diversity that makes us \nthe great agricultural Nation we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before my friend leaves the floor, I \nthank the distinguished Senator from Idaho for his leadership as we \nhave worked together on specialty crop issues. This is an important \nbipartisan effort. We began focusing on it when we defined specialty \ncrops in the Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act of 2004. We have now \ntaken that definition and gone on to include, as he said, 50 percent of \nthe cash receipts from the crops that had not been recognized fully in \nthe farm bill. It has been my pleasure to work with him and see that we \nhave been able to make this an important part of this farm bill for the \nfuture. I thank him and congratulate him.\n  I rise to speak about the farm bill in front of us. It is an effort \nthat has taken a tremendous amount of time, debate, and negotiation, a \n2-day markup. We ended up passing it unanimously out of the Agriculture \nCommittee, which is no small feat. I am pleased to have played a role \nin that process. A major reason for our success was our chairman, the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, who has been so diligent from the \nbeginning. He has had a vision about the future for agriculture, where \nwe needed to go in alternative energy, conservation, fruits and \nvegetables, nutrition, as well as our traditional support for \nagriculture. I thank Chairman Harkin and our distinguished ranking \nmember for their efforts together. We have put into\n\n[[Page S13962]]\n\nplace a farm bill for the future. I am very pleased we are doing that.\n  Our needs are different than when the first farm bills came about. \nEnergy independence, preserving and protecting the environment, making \nsure we have a nutritious supply of products to keep communities and \nfamilies healthy are all areas covered in this new farm bill.\n  I thank my dear friend and colleague, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Conrad, for his incredible leadership, putting all \nthe numbers together. We have only a relatively small increase above \nthe baseline in this farm bill, $8 billion. Contrary to what we are \nhearing from the administration, we are seeing a relatively small \nincrease, fully paid for under the budget. Thanks to the work of \nSenator Conrad, we have a farm bill that is done in a fiscally \nresponsible way.\n  I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, for \nhis extraordinary leadership. Serving on the Budget, Finance, and \nAgriculture Committees, I have to say we would not be here with a \nsuccessful farm bill if it were not for Senator Baucus and the work he \nhas done in providing revenues as well as a permanent disaster relief \nprogram, which is incredibly important.\n  I also thank my staff for their hard work. We have been working for \nmonths and months on this farm bill, many late hours, some all-\nnighters. I thank Chris Adamo and Oliver Kim, who have done an \nextraordinary job on the nutrition pieces of this bill; Ilana Levinson; \nand my legislative director, Amanda Renteria.\n  This new farm bill represents a progressive agricultural policy and a \nvision of the future. It focuses on and expands many new policies, such \nas specialty crops and renewable energy, conservation, nutrition, and \nrural development. When people think of Michigan, most of the time \npeople think of automobiles and manufacturing. But in fact, the second \nlargest industry in Michigan is agriculture. We have more diversity of \ncrops than any other State other than California. This is a very \nimportant part of public policy for Michigan. It is about supporting \nour growers, about communities, the schoolchildren, seniors, and others \nwho benefit from nutrition programs. It is also about jobs. In real \nways, this is a bill that will create jobs in my State.\n  We have everything from traditional commodities in Michigan, such as \ndairy and meat and pork and corn and sugar beets and soybeans. We are \nalso proudly the national leaders in the production of numerous \nspecialty crops--our fruits and vegetables, including blueberries, \napples, cherries, asparagus, and celery. Michigan farmers are in need \nof a safety net for the crops they now grow, our program crops. But \nthey also are asking us for a new set of policies, not payments, not \ndirect payments, but a set of policies that will allow us to support \nfruit and vegetable growers who make up half of American agriculture.\n  In addition to diverse farms and commodities, we also have expansive \nurban areas with strong interests in conserving our national resources, \nour land, our Great Lakes, expanding as well in our inner-city areas \naccess for fresh fruits and vegetables through farmers markets and \ncommunity gardens and school nutrition programs. Literally, for me, \nevery single part of the farm bill is important and impacts someone in \nmy State, whether they be involved directly in farming or not. Of \ncourse, as we sometimes don't think about, the farm bill does impact \neverybody, whether you have any part of agricultural production in your \nState or not because of what this means in food security, nutrition, \nand now focusing on other important areas such as alternative energy.\n  I understand, as we debate this important farm bill, we will be \ncontinuing to talk about reforming farm policy. I know for many, the \nreforms that have passed in the Agriculture Committee--and we have put \ntogether very important reforms--as well as for me, do not go as far as \nI would like. But they do represent a very important first step in the \nright direction. There is a tremendous amount of reform in this \nlegislation. It is important for us not to define reform as just \nchanging direct payments. It is about changing the focus, expanding the \nfocus toward the future, which is what this farm bill absolutely does. \nWe have made progress on farm payment reform, but we have also put in \nplace a new guide for the next 5 years in completely new farm policies, \nsuch as specialty crops, helping producers grow more and consumers to \nhave more access to healthy foods.\n  Energy is a very exciting part of this bill, the next economic \nopportunity for rural America, for our farmers. These new policies will \ncreate new jobs and new, clean, renewable energies. Conservation, \nagain, is a major focus for our chairman, and I commend him for that. \nHis leadership has brought us more than $4 billion in new investments \nin conservation that will help producers be the great stewards of the \nland they want to be.\n  Again, the chairman, in his leadership on nutrition, has been \nextraordinary, expanding the food and nutrition program and providing \nmore access to healthy foods. In fact, it is important to mention that \nroughly 66 percent of the farm bill is focused in some way on \nnutrition. That means this is truly a food security and nutrition bill \nfor every American. It is also important to mention that we have \nincluded a focus on beginning and disadvantaged farmers, new policies \nin the conservation title, as our Presiding Officer has focused on in \nso many of the areas around conservation and supporting our farmers and \nfamily farmers. The credit title also helps new farmers and those \nsometimes wrongfully left out to provide for more conservation and more \ncredit resources. We know we need a new generation of farmers to \ncontinue providing food security for our Nation.\n\n  Let me speak about each of these areas briefly. The area of the farm \nbill we call specialty crops, what does that mean? We are talking about \nfruits, vegetables, horticulture, floriculture, dried nuts. We had \ndefined those areas in 2004 in the farm bill. This is something I have \nbeen working on since coming to the Congress after the 1996 election, 4 \nyears in the U.S. House on the Agriculture Committee, and now in the \nSenate. I remember when we first started talking about specialty crops \nand trying to find something in the farm bill that would directly \nsupport the 50 percent of the crops that are fruits and vegetables and \nother specialty crops. It was difficult to find much. But finally, \nafter working together on a bipartisan basis and having wonderful \nsupport from the Agriculture Committee, we can honestly say we have \nplaced specialty crops as a permanent part of the farm bill.\n  This is incredibly important, particularly now when we look at the \nneeds for nutrition, the needs of the future for our families, our \nchildren, our seniors, as we look at a world economy, where it is very \nimportant that we be supporting our own fruits and vegetable growers.\n  There are 36 Members of the Senate who have come together, because we \ngrow specialty crops in our States, and have supported the efforts. I \nthank each Member who has lent their voice in support and strength to \nthis effort. We have over 120 different organizations that have been \nworking now for several years to come together to get to this point. I \nthank all of them for their efforts as well.\n  We have come a long way since the 2002 farm bill, when we were \ntalking about trying to get some help with tree assistance or some \nbasic nutrition programs. In 2004, we passed the Specialty Crop \nCompetitiveness Act which defined specialty crops and for the first \ntime gave us a policy from which to work. It laid the groundwork for \nthe progress we have made in creating a specialty crop policy in the \nfarm bill, including the centerpiece program such as specialty crop \nblock grants. Today, for the first time, there is a significant package \nto help our growers who supply our healthy foods. This package is what \nI call a toolbox, not a direct payment. They have not asked for that, \nbut they have asked for a variety of things to help them be successful \nand make fruits and vegetables available to our families.\n  The toolbox includes competitive grant programs, research funds, \nincreased protections from pests and disease, trade export promotions, \nvarious nutrition programs to help those in need, as well as a focus on \nour schoolchildren, assistance for organic farmers, a very important, \ngrowing part of agriculture, as well as important conservation \npayments. This multitude of\n\n[[Page S13963]]\n\npolicies offers real reform and is needed for a variety of reasons.\n  It is also important to note the new disaster assistance program that \nhas been put together accommodates specialty crops as well. There is \napproximately $1 billion of disaster relief for specialty crops \nincluded in the disaster relief program. It will expedite aid to \nproducers after natural disasters for which farmers cannot plan. A \ncritical part of this is new mandatory funding for the Tree Assistance \nProgram. This is absolutely critical to our farmers who have orchards \nbecause our orchards--such as cherries and peaches and apples--are \nbasically the assets. The trees are the assets for those farmers, and \nthey are expensive assets that take years to yield profits. So being \nable to support those growers who have orchards and to be able to help \nthem in a disaster is very important.\n\n  It is important to note that specialty crop farmers are also very \ndiverse. What is good for the Washington apple growers may not be the \nsame for Michigan apple growers. Different diseases and challenges face \ndifferent growers in different parts of the country. So policies such \nas the State-run block grants that we have included and competitive \nresearch grants are vital to help the over 200 different types of \nspecialty crop farmers across the Nation be able to have assistance for \ntheir particular issue, their particular areas of concern.\n  Second, fruits and vegetables are more susceptible to different pests \nand diseases. We must have the best inspection and rapid-response \npolicies in place. Currently, the costs borne by the fruit and \nvegetable industry due to invasive species reaches over $1 billion a \nyear. Our disease and pest policy will help prevent new invasive \nspecies as well as help mitigate them. This will help not only \nspecialty crop growers but all our farmers as well as our forests.\n  Third, just like our traditional row crops, such as corn and \nsoybeans, we need a strong domestic supply of fruits and vegetables. \nStudies suggest that even if every person in this country tried to eat \nthe five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables per day that are \nrecommended by the Federal Government, our domestic growers would \nsimply not be able to meet the demand.\n  Fourth--and while speaking of domestic fruit and vegetable farmers--\nthis Nation currently imports $2.7 billion more than it exports in \nfruits and vegetables. So we need to ensure our safety and health and \nhelp our growers as they export as well.\n  Finally, when we talk about specialty crops, we are really talking \nabout eating in a healthier way. A better supply of fruits and \nvegetables means more access for more people to the things they need to \nbe healthy and to prevent systemic disease in the future.\n  Along with our focus on specialty crops is a real partnership with \nthe portion of the farm bill that focuses on nutrition. This farm bill \nmakes important strides in reducing hunger in our Nation and improving \nthe nutritional health of our children. It makes a key link between our \ncommodities--our fruits and vegetables--and health by recognizing the \nimportance of fruits and vegetables in the new specialty crops \nprovisions.\n  The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has applauded \nefforts to increase consumption of fruits and vegetables. They noted \nthat HHS statistics have found that unhealthy eating and inactivity \ncause 310,000 to 580,000 deaths every year.\n  In addition, in this Congress we have made our children's health a \nlegislative priority. In addition to our fight for the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, we have expanded the successful Fruit and \nVegetable Snack Program so that schools nationwide will be able to give \nchildren a healthy snack. Again, my hat goes off to our chairman, who \nplaced the Fruit and Vegetable Program in the farm bill in the past as \na pilot project.\n  A lot of folks said: Well, even if you have a bowl of fruits--apples \nor other fresh fruits--and vegetables available in schools, the kids \nwon't eat them; they will just go to the vending machine. Well, it \nturned out that was not true. It turned out that children loved having \nthose apples and peaches and strawberries and plums and all of the \nother fruits available. Teachers across the country have been clamoring \nto expand this very successful Fruit and Vegetable Snack Program, and \nwe have done that in this bill. In fact, with the passage of the farm \nbill, about 120,000 children in Michigan alone will have access to \nfresh fruits and vegetables through the snack program.\n  This is a very important policy in terms of the future for our \nchildren. Making sure children eat right and understand good nutrition \nis, of course, critical for their long-term health. According to the \nNew America Foundation's child development and youth well-being index, \nhealth indicators for children are on the decline mainly due to \nchildren's poor nutritional health and obesity. By helping our schools \npurchase healthy snacks, we can not only give children better food but \nalso help guide their nutritional choices throughout their entire \nlives. Maybe if they pick up an apple or dried cherries--grown in \nMichigan, of course--rather than junk food, we will give them an \nopportunity for a healthier future.\n  Additionally, the farm bill addresses hunger by making long overdue \nchanges to the Food and Nutrition Program, formerly known as food \nstamps. Since 1996, the income standards for this program have been \nfrozen--in other words, no increases. Food costs go up, inflation goes \nup, and there have been no increases. This has caused the purchasing \npower for families to decline as food costs and inflation have \nincreased.\n\n  In just one example, a 32-year-old single mom named Sonya, who lives \nin Michigan near my hometown of Lansing, has two children ages 12 and \n13. She works two jobs. One pays $10.40 an hour, where she works 24 \nhours a week. The other one pays her $76 a day. She is working hard to \nhold things together for her family. She spends nearly $650 a month in \ndaycare expenses, right now, for her children. But under current law, \nshe cannot count the full value of her childcare costs when she applies \nfor the Food and Nutrition Program. This cap on childcare is a huge \nincentive against working.\n  The nutrition title will help Sonya and other families--and the vast \nmajority of Food and Nutrition Program households are three-individual \nhouseholds like Sonya's--because it takes that cap off and will cover \nand count the costs of childcare for working moms. For example, a \nmother of three who works 35 hours a week at $9 an hour and pays $350 a \nmonth for childcare for a preschool-aged child would receive an \nadditional $79 in food assistance for herself and her children. This is \na huge difference. It may not sound like a lot of money, but it is a \nhuge difference for families all across this country.\n  We should be very proud of the fact that on a bipartisan basis we \nhave placed these improvements in the bill. However, we still need to \ndo a lot more, and I certainly support other efforts to do that.\n  We still need to make improvements to the Commodity Supplemental Food \nProgram. Unfortunately, our senior citizens, who make up the bulk of \nthis program, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, are eligible at \na lower income threshold than are families. In other words, if you are \na senior up to 130 percent of poverty, you can get help with food; for \na family, it is 185 percent. There is really no reason to discriminate \nagainst senior citizens, and a number of organizations, including AARP, \nthe National Commodity Supplemental Food Program Association, and \nAmerica's Second Harvest, want to fix this program. I am working with \nthe chairman to offer an amendment to do that.\n  I mentioned a little earlier that this bill is also a job creator. \nThis farm bill is creating new jobs as well as a cleaner environment--\nboth very important goals.\n  The energy title will help bring forth a new rural economy. In \nMichigan's case, this is already happening, and we welcome the \nprovisions of this bill. They are very important to us in Michigan.\n  First, there are loans and loan guarantees for cellulosic ethanol \nrefineries. In Michigan, we have interest from multiple companies to \nset up new cellulosic refineries. We have corn, sugar beets, \nswitchgrass, and wood byproducts--timber--opportunities that can all be \na part of the cellulosic equation. Again, I know the distinguished \nPresiding Officer has worked diligently in\n\n[[Page S13964]]\n\nthose areas. They are very important for the future of this country and \ncertainly in my State will create jobs.\n  Financing is needed in the early development of these projects, as we \nknow, and these new policies will provide that missing link, which is \nso critical. Perhaps by the next farm bill we will see the fruits of \nour labor when we can truly say: Buy fuel from Middle America instead \nof the Middle East.\n  Next, farmers need assistance to switch to these new energy crops and \nto produce renewable energies. New policies will provide technical \nassistance and resources to help producers convert to new crops that \ncan produce ethanol and take advantage of their wastes by converting \nthem into energy. An example of this is anaerobic digesters that our \ndairy farms can use to convert animal waste to energy. Not only is this \na new source of income, but it also disposes of waste, therefore \nreducing pollution into the air and the water.\n  Finally, I would like to highlight another program important to \nMichigan that has the potential to spur economic development while \nalleviating our dependence on foreign oil. A Community Wood Energy \nProgram will help invest in projects looking to use more wood products \nto produce energy. With a State that is more than one-third forested, \nand paper mills are in the decline, this is a very valuable addition, \nfrom my perspective in Michigan.\n  The energy title will go a long way toward a cleaner environment, but \nthe conservation title in the farm bill is one of our most important \nenvironmental laws. Farmers are some of the best stewards of our land. \nWe know that. They produce high-quality, safe, nutritious products \nwhile meeting strong environmental standards. Our addition of $4 \nbillion in conservation funding this year is imperative to meet the \ngrowing demand of farmers who want to enroll in various conservation \nprograms. These programs keep our air clean, farmland productive, \nspaces open, land open, wildlife thriving, and offer some of the best \nwater quality protections.\n  The conservation title is especially vital to our Great Lakes, North \nAmerica's largest source of fresh water. Farm bill conservation \nprograms have ensured that once-marginal Great Lakes farmland now \nfilters sediment and erosion while providing millions of acres of high-\nquality wildlife habitat, which supports the local $18 billion hunting, \nfishing, and wildlife-watching industry in Michigan. Programs such as \nthe Wetlands Reserve Program improve water quality and are essential to \nthe continued health of the Great Lakes. These programs protect and \nrestore wetlands that serve to filter pesticides, fertilizers, and \nsediment out of the water that millions of Great Lakes residents depend \non for their drinking water as well as for swimming and bathing and \njust plain fun. And we invite everyone to come and be a part of the \nGreat Lakes experience.\n  I want to congratulate, again, Chairman Harkin and my colleagues on \nthe committee for their commitment to a strong conservation title. In \nspite of the tight budget we have once again, conservation is a \npriority.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize changes in a program that \nI was very pleased to author as a part of this conservation title. The \nGreat Lakes Basin Program for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control will be \nreauthorized for another 5 years under the current bill. This program \nhas a proven track record of efficiently providing grant funding to \nlocal organizations and governments to prevent soil erosion in the \nGreat Lakes region.\n  I am pleased to have been able to add language to the farm bill to \ntie the Great Lakes Basin Program to the Great Lakes Regional \nCollaboration Strategy to Restore and Protect the Great Lakes. This \nwill assist in accomplishing two of the Great Lakes Regional \nCollaboration Strategy's priority recommendations: first, targeting \ncleanup activities in severely polluted rural watersheds; secondly, \nrestoring urban watersheds that have been degraded by development.\n  The Great Lakes restoration strategy is really a comprehensive \nblueprint for restoring the Great Lakes. It was initiated following an \nExecutive order which recognized the Great Lakes as a national \ntreasure. The strategy was produced by a broad cross-section of people \nrepresenting our local communities, the State and Federal Government--\ntruly a bipartisan effort--NGOs, tribes, and various stakeholders that \ncame together.\n  The strategy identifies reducing nonpoint source runoff from rural \nand urban areas as one of the top eight sets of priority \nrecommendations necessary for restoring the health of the Great \nLakes. This program will enable the region to initiate pilot projects \nconsistent with these recommendations. I am very pleased this is part \nof the farm bill.\n\n  Restoring the Great Lakes must be a national priority. A recent \nBrookings Institute study clearly showed that Great Lakes restoration \nis about more than environmental restoration; it is about protecting \nour way of life. Reducing soil erosion, sediment, and pollutants helps \nmaintain a clean source of drinking water for over 42 million Americans \nand Canadians who depend on the Great Lakes. Decreasing nonpoint \npollution in the Great Lakes reduces the damage caused to fish and \nwildlife habitat and will help protect a sport fishery that generates \n$4 billion a year. Reducing nonpoint pollution will reduce the costs of \nmaintaining stormwater systems and the costs of dredging the harbors \nand marinas that are the economic backbone to the Great Lakes region's \nshipping capacity, in addition to a $1 billion recreational boating \nindustry. This program ties a Great Lakes program with a proven track \nrecord to the implementation of a comprehensive strategy that, when \nfully implemented, will protect an international treasure for the next \ngenerations.\n  I also want to acknowledge another important piece that I was pleased \nto author in the farm bill that is important to American producers. \nCurrent law clearly states that all purchases made--to the maximum \nextent practicable--with Federal funds for use in the National School \nLunch and Breakfast programs should be domestic goods; in other words, \nAmerican-made, American-grown. Congress has passed this law in multiple \nstatutes and has repeatedly reinforced its support for the Buy American \nprovision, and expects it to be implemented and enforced. \nUnfortunately, USDA has not adequately enforced the Buy American \nprovisions in current law. This is another example of this \nadministration's failure to enforce the laws on the books, and this \ntime our growers and consumers are paying the price. The list of trade \nenforcement violations is growing, and today the United States has the \nweakest trade enforcement effort of any developed country. It is \nimportant we make sure that while the USDA buys only domestically grown \nfood for schools, that we also make sure when the school programs \nthemselves--the local programs--are purchasing, that they know this \nprovision is in place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No objection. How many minutes? Two?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Two.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you very much.\n  There is so much in the farm bill that it is difficult to have a \nshort presentation. I am only touching on a few of the major areas.\n  Let me conclude, though, by summarizing the Buy American provisions \nbecause, unfortunately, even this past July at a national school food \nconference, a food company marketed peaches that said ``peaches from \nChina packed in Thailand,'' and I know we grow great peaches in the \nUnited States. So we want to make sure that as we are putting all of \nthese provisions together to support American agriculture, that, in \nfact the USDA is doing everything possible not only to purchase \nthemselves but to communicate with our school programs and other \nnutritional programs that we expect we will purchase from local \ngrowers, American growers first. We hope we will not have to say this \nagain. We have put this in numerous bills. It is\n\n[[Page S13965]]\n\nvital that we take this very seriously if we are going to, in fact, be \nsupporting American growers. This provision--the Buy American \namendment--matches the House-passed language, and I am hoping they will \njoin us in making sure it is truly enforced at this time.\n  As my statement shows, this farm bill is expansive. It is important \nto all parts of our country, our families, our communities. It is \nimportant in so many ways as we look for healthy foods and strong \ncommunities and jobs, preserving our land and our water. It has very \nimportant policies, traditional policies we have had for some time, \ncoupled with new approaches for the future in alternative energy and \nother areas that are critical for the future of our country. I regret \nthat the administration has indicated a possible veto of this bill. I \nhope, in fact, they will reconsider as we move along. This is an \nimportant bipartisan effort. A tremendous amount of work has gone into \nthis. This is truly a farm bill for the future of the country. It is \nfiscally responsible. It is paid for. I am very hopeful that not only \nwill we pass this with a strong bipartisan vote, but that the President \nwill support this very important effort to support our growers, our \nfarmers, our ranchers, as well as the food security of the United \nStates.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 15 minutes \nunder the previous order. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I am to be \nfollowed by Senator Thune, who has 15 minutes, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not yet a part of the order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that it be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to discuss the \nprocess under which we consider this bill that has been set forth by \nthe majority leader earlier. I also want to discuss a critical issue \nfacing our farmers. I do not want to belabor the point that has been \nmade by our distinguished Republican leader, Senator McConnell, and by \nSenator Gregg about the importance of an open amendment process, but I \ndo want to add some context, if I might.\n  I understand it is the majority's prerogative to fill the amendment \ntree, and it has been done by leaders of both parties in the past. \nHowever, I wanted to go on record about the potential serious danger of \nthis process. Earlier, the majority leader stated that only amendments \nthat are relevant to the farm bill will be allowed to be offered and \nvoted on.\n  Well, I cannot think of any amendment more relevant to the economic \nsecurity of the American farmer than an amendment to increase the \nrenewable fuel standard. I am very hopeful the amendment will meet the \ntest the leader has made for amendments. I don't know yet whether it \nwill, but I think before I am finished and before other speakers are \nheard, it should be quite obvious that there is no amendment that could \nbe offered that is more important to rural America and the farmers than \nthis one.\n\n  Since we passed the first ever renewable fuels standard in the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005--and the occupant of the chair was a member of the \ncommittee that wrote it--bipartisan--and played a very vital role in a \nnumber of its provisions--since that Energy Policy Act, we have seen a \nsurge in ethanol jobs and a surge in the construction of ethanol \nplants. I think we all know that. In 2006 alone, the ethanol industry \nsupported the creation of 160,000 new jobs, while producing 5 billion \ngallons of ethanol. These are American farm jobs which help produce \nAmerican fuels and help reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It seems \nto me the relevance of ethanol is asked and answered.\n  My bipartisan amendment would set annual requirements for the amount \nof renewable fuels used in motor vehicles, homes, and boilers. It would \nrequire that our Nation use 8.5 billion gallons of renewable fuels in \n2008 and progressively increase to 36 billion gallons by 2022.\n  My amendment will help the ethanol industry right now by doubling the \ncurrent ethanol mandate from 7.5 billion gallons in 2009 to 15 billion \ngallons by 2015. That will ensure that America will be using the \nadditional ethanol that farmers are producing.\n  Beginning in 2016, an increasing portion of the renewable fuels must \nbe advanced biofuels. Advanced biofuels include cellulosic ethanol, \nbiodiesel, and other fuels derived from unconventional biomass \nfeedstocks such as sorghum. The required amount of advanced biofuels \nbegins at 3 billion gallons in 2016 and increases to 21 billion by \n2022.\n  I want to depart from my text and talk a minute with the Presiding \nOfficer and any other Senators who are listening. This amendment is \npart of the so-called Senate Energy bill passed in June. It has three \nmajor parts, and this is one part of it. This is one that has a lot to \ndo with ethanol, but it was part of the Energy bill we passed and took \na lot of pride in. Since then, the House passed a bill. The House \npassed two bills on energy. Their bills were, for all intents and \npurposes, completely different than the Senate's bill. We have been \ntotally unsuccessful in moving anything in the direction of getting \neither our bill or their bill moving toward a bicameral solution in \nconference or by agreement between the two Houses through appropriate \npeople. That is not occurring. There is lots of talk but no action. \nPretty soon we will be giving the excuse for doing nothing for the \nethanol prices--we will be saying, wait another month and we will get \nthis agreement with the House. The Senate-passed bill will somehow get \nnegotiated out with the House, with somebody, somehow, sometime, even \nthough they don't have any provision in their bill that is like the one \nI am talking about.\n  This amendment is in our bill--the bill of the Senate--that we worked \nso hard on. It is the one the President talked about in his State of \nthe Union Address, as the occupant of the chair might remember. \nCellulosic was what everybody talked about: In about 2 years we break \nthat R requirement and we are ready to go with the most critical new \nfuel--cellulosic. Now we sit and say, let's not do anything. I am kind \nof prejudging what some will say tomorrow when this amendment, which \nwill be filed at the desk and which is nothing more than the Energy \nbill that was passed with all of the amendments that were adopted, that \nwas subtitle B, the biofuels for energy security and transportation as \npart of the Energy bill--it is now an amendment I am asking to be \nattached to the farm bill. I think it should meet the leader's test \nwhere he said it has to be something that is strongly related to \nagriculture or he isn't going to consider it. Considering things such \nas perhaps the Lugar bill, which is highly touted as a substitute--it \nwon't pass, but it will be permitted to be offered as an amendment, I \nassume.\n  This amendment is very important. We could get out of here in \nDecember and not have an agreement with the House on this energy bill. \nI repeat: They don't have this provision in their bill. They are going \nto have to accept a whole new approach. Energy security and \ntransportation through biofuels is part of the three components of the \nbill, of the big bill we are talking about. We would have to find some \nway for the House to accommodate all three of the big sections, because \nthey have none of them. They don't have this one. They don't have CAFE, \non which our fellow committee members on Commerce worked very hard. \nThey don't have CAFE in theirs. They don't have this provision, and \nthey don't have the very large provision we have in ours with reference \nto maintenance and security, reducing the costs of various fuel \nproducts. So it is not going to be easy to get that. It would be very \neasy--if the majority leader agrees tomorrow, it would be very easy to \nadopt this amendment and, eventually, if the agriculture bill passes \nand goes right over to the House, and they have no alternative--they \nhave to go to conference with a farm bill that is going to be very \npopular and it is going to have this provision on it, and it is very \npopular. As my colleagues know, if it were freestanding and didn't have \nany of the problems of: Does it belong on this bill, which I think is \nan irrelevant statement--we shouldn't be talking about that--it belongs \non this bill, we are going to make up a rule if we don't let it come on \nhere. It fits; it is germane;\n\n[[Page S13966]]\n\nit is relevant. Any words we have used historically for amendments, it \nis that.\n  Now, beginning in 2016, an increasing portion of renewable fuels must \nbe advanced biofuels, which must include cellulosic ethanol, biodiesel, \nand other fuels derived from unconventional biomass feedstocks, such as \nsorghum. The required amount of advanced biofuels begins at 3 billion \ngallons in 2016 and increases to 21 billion by 2022.\n  Advanced biofuels do not have many of the challenges that \nconventional ethanol does. The inclusion of advanced biofuels strikes a \nbalance that will allow America to begin diversifying our fuel supply \nin a very short term and in the long term.\n  That is why, when supporting these same provisions in the Energy \nbill, the Renewable Fuels Association said that they ``strike the right \nchord''--that is what this does--noting that ``such an investment in \nour Nation's energy future promises to spur the creation of new, good-\npaying jobs across the country.''\n  This amendment consists of the very same provisions passed by the \nSenate in June as we considered the Energy bill. Some may ask, then, \nwhy do I seek to offer this amendment to the farm bill? I have already \ntold you my answer. Repeating, first, the Energy bill is languishing \nlargely because the House has very different provisions, and we have no \nway of going to conference. We are not in conference. We are \nnegotiating in some way. People are talking. Committees are talking, \nbut nothing is agreed upon by anyone as to the process or procedure. \nCertainly, we have to have that bipartisan. It will not pass if it \ncomes here from the House and doesn't have some Republican input. I \nassume it will come from people such as me, as ranking member of one of \nthe committees, or maybe Senator Stevens, who would have to be part of \nit if it were to have a real chance.\n  The second reason is this amendment is relevant to the farm bill. It \nis necessary now to reinvigorate the ethanol industry, and that \nindustry and everything that makes it up is looking to Congress to \nextend this mandate as soon as possible.\n   In one sense, we have been a victim of our own success. Thanks to \nthe 2005 Energy bill, rural America has answered the call for increased \nethanol production. In fact, we have now exceeded the original mandated \namount in our fuel mix. For example, in 2006, the ethanol standard was \n4 billion gallons and, in fact, our domestic production of ethanol was \n5 billion gallons. We can do more and the American farmer is looking \nfor Congress to do more.\n  Over the last year, the price of ethanol has dropped nearly 40 \npercent. The reason for this is simple economics. We have an increased \nsupply and diminished demand in the marketplace. As a result the \nconstruction of new plants has been delayed meaning new job growth has \nbeen diminished and rural communities are looking to us to take action. \nWe cannot wait for a languishing energy bill while rural communities \nare losing their opportunities. This amendment is not simply relevant \nto the farm bill, Mr. President. It is necessary.\n  This matter will come back. It will be filed sometime tomorrow, or \nthe next day, depending on when the leader will talk to me on the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from New \nMexico for his leadership on energy issues, generally, as a former \nchairman and now ranking member on the Energy Committee, and \nparticularly regarding renewable fuels.\n  In 2005, the Senate, the Congress passed an energy bill that was \nsigned into law by the President, which, for the first time ever as a \nmatter of policy, put into place a renewable fuels standard. That was \nin no small part a tribute to the leadership of Chairman Domenici and \nhis good work, working with many of us who care deeply about renewable \nfuels and making sure we are advancing that industry in this country so \nwe can lessen our dependence upon foreign sources of energy. So I \nappreciate his leadership and am glad to be able to work with him again \nas we try to offer a renewable fuels standard to the farm bill, which \nhas already been adopted, as he mentioned, by the Senate regarding the \nEnergy bill. The Energy bill is currently tied up and, hopefully, we \nwill produce an energy bill this year before Congress adjourns for the \nholidays. But if, in fact, we cannot get that done, it is important for \nthis industry, and I believe for our country's interest, that we get an \nexpanded renewable fuels standard put into law.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us today is entitled the Food and \nEnergy Security Act of 2007, commonly referred to as the 2007 Farm \nbill. The naming of this bill is not without meaning. It is abundantly \nclear that agriculture and energy production are inherently related, \nand together will move our Nation toward greater food and energy \nsecurity.\n  The 2002 Farm bill was the first farm bill to include an energy \ntitle. As a member of the House Agriculture Committee during the 2002 \nFarm bill debate, I can attest that including an energy title in the \nfarm bill was not easy, nor was it without controversy. However, \nCongress had the foresight to realize that renewable energy was an \nintegral part to our agriculture economy and a comprehensive farm bill \nwould be incomplete without including renewable energy incentives.\n  The Food and Energy Security Act of 2007 also includes an energy \ntitle that builds on the success of the 2002 bill. The incentives in \nthis energy title will greatly benefit American consumers, our \nagriculture producers, and our Nation's energy independence.\n  As part of the 2007 Farm bill, the Senate Agriculture Committee \nworked with what little resources we had to meet the demands of a new \ngeneration of renewable fuel. In particular, the committee included a \nprovision that Senator Ben Nelson and I helped draft that will provide \nincentives for farmers to grow energy dedicated crops in conjunction \nwith the construction of a nearby biorefinery.\n  There is a chicken and egg dilemma with regard to cellulosic ethanol \nproduction. If you ask a farmer in South Dakota or Georgia or \nCalifornia to change his planting pattern to grow energy dedicated \ncrops, the response will likely focus on a lack of market to sell these \ncrops.\n  If you ask an ethanol producer about the prospects of cellulosic \nethanol, they will likely highlight the lack of energy dedicated crop \navailability.\n  In reality, energy dedicated crops such as poplar trees, switchgrass, \nand miscanthus, take 2 to 3 years to establish. Likewise, a new \ngeneration cellulosic ethanol biorefinery will take several months or \nyears to build. There is an obvious gap in the marketplace for \ncellulosic ethanol production, and this bill would fill this gap by \nproviding first-of-its-kind incentives for producers who grow energy \ndedicated crops in conjunction with the construction of local \nbiorefineries.\n  This provision represents significant progress in our agriculture \npolicy as we look for ways to promote advanced biofuels.\n  The Food and Energy Security Act also authorizes the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture to provide grants and loan guarantees for commercial \nscale biorefineries. Private sector investment in the renewable fuels \nwill ultimately determine the success of this industry, and it is \ncritical that funding mechanisms are in place that will move cellulosic \nethanol from the laboratory to full scale production.\n   Additionally, it is important to note that these loan guarantees \nwould also benefit existing plants that wish to repower their \nfacilities or retrofit with new cellulosic technology.\n  By leveraging a small amount of tax dollars with hundreds of millions \nof dollars in private equity, federally backed loans for new plants are \nan effective policy that will help grow the production of advanced \nbiofuels.\n  Although the Senate version of the 2007 farm bill includes several \nimportant energy provisions, it is missing one critical component that \nwould increase the market demand for renewable fuels.\n  Just a few moments ago, Senators Domenici, Nelson, Grassley, and I \nintroduced a bipartisan amendment to increase the renewable fuels \nstandard from 7.5 billion gallons in 2012 to 36 billion gallons in \n2022.\n  Last June, the Senate acted in a bipartisan manner and passed an \nEnergy bill that increases the role renewable fuels as a part of our \nenergy policy.\n\n[[Page S13967]]\n\nThis amendment reflects the Senate-passed RFS, and I hope my colleagues \nwill once again support this policy as an amendment to the 2007 farm \nbill.\n  Some of my colleagues may ask, ``Why include a renewable fuels \nstandard as part of the 2007 farm bill?'' The answer is simple, since \nthe beginning of Federal farm programs, no single policy has had a \ngreater impact on American's agriculture industry than the renewable \nfuels standard enacted by Congress in 2005.\n  The renewable fuels standard and the dramatic expansion of biofuels \nproduction has provided farmers with an alternative market for their \ncrop and increased demand for corn production. The renewable fuels \nstandard has created jobs in rural communities and spurred investment \nopportunities in rural America.\n  The expansion of the biofuels industry hasn't been perfect. The \ndramatic expansion of biofuels has led to concern among some livestock \nproducers and food processors about inflationary trends in commodity \nprices. However, these concerns are being addressed by the marketplace. \nProducers have responded with record corn production and will continue \nto meet the demand for feed, food, ethanol, and exports.\n  Additionally, like the Senate-passed renewable fuels standard, this \namendment would boost the production of advanced biofuels by requiring \nthe production of 21 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol by 2022.\n  Crude oil is trading at over $90 per barrel. Many analysts are \npredicting oil will hit $100 per barrel in the near future. Typically, \nin the late fall, early winter, consumers are granted a reprieve from \nhigh gasoline prices as demand subsides from the summer driving season.\n  However, this fall, the retail price of gasoline has remained at high \nlevels. Yesterday, the average price of gasoline reached $3 per \ngallon--an all time record for gasoline prices in November. Many are \npredicting even higher prices in the near future if the price of crude \noil continues to climb.\n  When is enough, enough? When are we going to take a stand and stop \nsending American dollars overseas to countries that want harm to the \nUnited States when we have an untapped resource for clean renewable \nfuel here at home?\n  I believe I speak for the majority of U.S. Senators when I say we \nshould purchase our fuel from America's agricultural producers rather \nthan from overseas oil cartels.\n  In 2005, Congress as acted to enact the first ever renewable fuels \nstandard of 7.5 billion gallons by 2012. By the end of this year, our \nNation's ethanol capacity will total almost 7.5 billion gallons, 4 \nyears ahead of schedule. With planned and existing construction, our \nNation's ethanol capacity will soon double.\n  Clearly, as our biofuels industry advances, so must our national \npolicy. Now is the time to increase the renewable fuels standard and \nusher in a new generation of cellulosic ethanol production.\n  I thank Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member, Chambliss for their \nsupport for a strong energy title.\n  Over the past several months, we have had a thoughtful and \nconscientious debate on farm and energy policy. Considering the limited \nresources presented to the Committee, we crafted a bill that will \nundoubtedly move production agriculture and renewable fuels forward in \na sustainable and reliable manner.\n  Adding a strong renewable fuels standard to the Food and Energy \nSecurity Act would greatly enhance these efforts. The U.S. Senate is \nalready on record for supporting provision by a wide bipartisan \nmajority. I encourage my colleagues to once again support this \namendment.\n  There are so many things we can do in this farm bill to help improve \nthe agricultural economy in this country. I will speak at a later point \nabout some of the other provisions in the bill that I think will do \nthat. But I cannot emphasize enough the importance of the energy title \nto not only American agriculture but to America's position and place in \nthe world relative to our need for energy and our ability to meet that \nneed here at home.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will move in an expeditious \nfashion to pass this farm bill. Before we do that, let's take a hard \nlook at what we can do to make this energy title even stronger and \ncreate an even more robust market for renewable energy, so those great \nAmerican farmers out there who are producing the food and fiber for \nthis country can also continue to produce fuel to meet America's \ngrowing energy demand and lessen our dependence upon foreign sources of \nenergy.\n  I, again, thank the Senator from New Mexico for his leadership on \nthis issue and for his important role in 2005 in getting the renewable \nfuels standard put into law for the first time--the 7.5 billion gallon \nstandard I mentioned--by 2012. But it is now important that we increase \nthat standard--as proposed in this amendment and as passed earlier by \nthe Senate in the Energy bill--to 36 billion gallons by 2022. If we do \nthat, we will make a very strong and bold statement about our \ncommitment to reducing our dependence upon foreign energy and making \nAmerica energy independent.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, there is a worldwide epidemic of illegal \nlogging which has been poisonous for the global environment and \ndevastating to vital American industries. Given the urgency of this \nproblem, Senator Alexander, myself, and more than 20 other Senators \nhave joined in legislation--S. 1930, the Combat Illegal Logging Act--\nand I and my good friend from Tennessee are on the floor and wish to \nspeak briefly about this legislation.\n  We have worked for many months on this bill, cooperatively with the \nforest products industry, with the conservation community, and with \nlabor organizations, and the Congressional Budget Office recently \nscored our legislation as having no cost. We have filed this \nlegislation as an amendment to the farm bill, and we believe it is \nurgent that the Senate pass this legislation on a bipartisan basis to \nprotect American companies from unfair competition and to protect \nforests around the world against illegal logging.\n  More than 1 year ago, a group of hardwood plywood manufacturers came \nto me with concerns about illegal Chinese hardwood plywood imports that \nwere threatening their businesses. A whole host of unfair and illegal \npractices was lowering the costs of the Chinese hardwood plywood import \nsector, giving them an unfair advantage over our American hardwood \nplywood and putting American companies in jeopardy of going out of \nbusiness and the workers they employ out of work.\n  Since then, I have been working to level the playing field for these \nplywood manufacturers, many of whom are in Oregon, and to protect the \njobs of the workers they employ. In the course of all this, I have met \nwith the Department of Commerce, the Office of the United States Trade \nRepresentative, Customs and Border Patrol, and the International Trade \nCommission, and have urged them to pursue these issues and act where \nappropriate. They have, I commend them for it, and they have raised \ntroubling practices that we have brought to light in diplomatic \nnegotiations, opening investigations and even filing a case before the \nWorld Trade Organization targeting Chinese subsidies that benefit the \nhardwood plywood industry.\n  Our legislation--the legislation Senator Alexander and I hope to win \npassage for as part of the farm bill--would level the playing field for \nall American plywood manufacturers as they struggle to compete against \nartificially low-priced wood and wood products. I am also pleased we \nhave been able to secure the support of the conservation community. \nThey have joined us in this effort because they know it is critically \nimportant to the protection of the environment worldwide to act against \nthis illegal logging epidemic.\n  From the Amazon to the Congo basin to Siberia, we are seeing illegal \nlogging devastate some of the most precious and valuable ecosystems one \ncan imagine. It has been gutting local economies. It has annihilated \nthe very way\n\n[[Page S13968]]\n\nof life for a number of these communities. Because of the speed and \nviolence with which illegal logging is occurring, failure to curb its \neffects now, in my view, is going to result in irreversible damage to \nforests around the world.\n  I note my friend from Tennessee is on the floor, and I want to make a \ncouple of additional comments and allow him to speak as well. I see \nother colleagues want to talk, but I want to take a minute to describe \nhow this illegal activity takes place.\n  It is typically done by complex criminal networks that have \nmultinational funding, which I think is almost analogous to the way the \ndrug trade works. There was a recent Washington Post article that \ndocumented how logs from Burma had been smuggled into Chinese \nprocessing facilities and then were exported to major retailers here in \nour country. In these Chinese processing facilities, what happens is \nthe logs are often mislabeled and misclassified. Sometimes they are \neven fraudulently stamped with counterfeit stamps that mimic those of \nwell-known wood certifications, such as the Forest Stewardship Council \nlabel.\n  There have been additional reports that have demonstrated how illegal \nlogs are being smuggled out of the last intact rain forest in Asia, in \nIndonesia, and then they are made into flooring in China to feed the \nhigh-end markets in the United States and the EU. So the world's final \nremaining stands of old-growth teak, for example, are being stripped \nfrom Burma's forests to finance the bloody oppression of the military \nregime. The trade in teak and other valuable tropical hardwoods of \nBurma and China has reached as much as $350 million in 2005. In some \ncases one tree is so valuable on the international market that illegal \nloggers will cut a road through dense tropical forests to access it.\n  The amendment Senator Alexander and I seek to offer--and there are \nmany bipartisan supporters--would curb illegal logging by making \nchanges in the Lacey Act, which currently regulates trade in fish, \nwildlife, and a limited subset of plants. The Combat Illegal Logging \nAct of 2007 would expand the Lacey statute so that violations of \nforeign law that apply to plants and plant products would fall within \nits protections. This would make it against the law to import timber \nillegally harvested and obtained in a foreign country. The act would \nchange the way people who are importing harvested timber and wood \nproducts do business. That is its intended purpose.\n  But I will tell you--and then I want to give what additional time I \nhave left to my friend from Tennessee--I commend the wood products \nsector, particularly the American Paper Association, which has worked \nso closely with us. As the Forest and Paper Association, as is their \nformal name, they have worked diligently with us to make sure the many \nwood products firms that have worked responsibly in this area can be \nsupportive of this legislation. I am grateful to them for their support \nand the many environmental organizations that have joined with us.\n  I see my friend from North Dakota and my friend from Minnesota are \nhere as well. With their leave, Mr. President, I yield whatever time I \nhave to the cosponsor of this legislation, I thank him, and we can \nconclude our remarks with Senator Alexander.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon. He has \npursued the illegal logging issue in his usual way, with a lot of \npersistence and in a bipartisan way as well.\n  If he has not already done so, I will ask unanimous consent to list \nthe 22 cosponsors of the Combat Illegal Logging Act he has helped to \nrecruit, and I thank him for including me as a part of this bill. It is \nimportant to the great Northwest and it is important to the Southeast, \nwhere we have large paper companies, but it is also important to \nconservation and to the rule of law in our country.\n  The Senator from Oregon made a point that is maybe the central point \nhere when he compared our efforts to stop illegal logging to our \nefforts to stop the bringing of illegal drugs into the United States. \nWe all know the tremendous amount of effort we go to, for example, to \nkeep cocaine out of the United States. We send millions of dollars to \nColombia and to other countries and we try to stop that. But the real \nproblem we have is we are a big, rich country, and there is a big \ndemand for cocaine here. So no matter what we do in the other \ncountries, the cocaine still keeps coming in, and the same with other \nillegal drugs. Here we have a chance to make a much bigger difference \nthan we can with illegal drugs. We still are creating the demand \nproblem. This is a country that accounts for 25 percent of all the \nwealth in the world. It is a country that perhaps buys a huge volume of \nillegal timber from around the world. Well, we can stop that. This is \nnot a drug addiction, this is a business practice, and it is a practice \nwe can stop according to the laws of this country. When we stop it, we \nwill make an enormous difference for our country and for the other \ncountries.\n  Let us be absolutely clear. We are talking primarily about the laws \nof other countries. We are not talking about imposing American laws on \nother countries. We are simply saying if you violate the laws of any \nother country in the world, you can't bring those logs into the United \nStates without violating a criminal law here. If this big economy says \nthat to the world, we will make a dramatic difference in illegal \nlogging.\n  As the Senator from Oregon said, it is an estimated $1 billion a year \nin depressed prices and reduced exports. It depresses prices $500 \nmillion to $700 million annually. It means the people who play by the \nrules in the United States are having money taken from them by \ncriminals who don't play by the rules in other countries, with the \nrules set by other countries; not by us, by other countries.\n  There are other ancillary benefits--climate change, for example. \nThere is a lot of talk about that here in the Senate. We are all \nlooking for ways to deal with that. It may be expensive to deal with, \nit may be inconvenient to deal with, but some estimates are that 20 \npercent of climate change is caused by deforestation. According to the \nWorld Bank, illegal logging accounts for 10 percent, or $15 billion, of \nthe world timber trade. So if we are able to slow down illegal logging \nin other countries, we will be making an inexpensive contribution, from \nthe American taxpayers' point of view, to dealing with climate change, \nand at the same time we will be putting money in the pockets of those \nwho work in this country in the timber and timber products business.\n  This is a rare intersection of the rule of law, of good conservation \npractices, and of keeping jobs in the United States.\n  I salute the Senator from Oregon for his leadership, and with his \npermission I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \n``Dear Colleague'' letter which he and I sent to our colleagues, \nresulting so far in 22 Members of the Senate cosponsoring the Combat \nIllegal Logging Act of 2007.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 17, 2007.\n       Dear Colleague:  We are writing to ask you to cosponsor S. \n     1930, the Combat Illegal Logging Act of 2007. This bill \n     enjoys the support of a very broad coalition that includes \n     members of the U.S. forest products industry, conservation \n     community and organized labor, and has already received \n     bipartisan support from many of our colleagues.\n       Illegal logging is a criminal activity that often \n     circumvents a nation's legal process and halts efforts to \n     establish good governance--by going around a nation's law and \n     relying on corruption, bribery and theft. It destroys \n     ecosystems, contributes to carbon emissions, harms often poor \n     and rural communities, and forces American businesses and \n     workers to compete against inappropriately low-cost forest \n     products made from illegally sourced fiber. Illegal logging \n     costs the U.S. forest products industry an estimated $1 \n     billion per year in depressed prices and reduced exports, and \n     contributes to ongoing mill closures and job losses.\n       The Combat Illegal Logging Act changes the incentives that \n     drive trade in illegal timber. This legislation will raise \n     the risks for illegal trade without harming legal trade and \n     will be an important step toward leveling a playing field \n     currently stacked against the U.S. forest products industry \n     and importers and retailers committed to trading in legal \n     wood products. Furthermore, it will also bring the power of \n     the U.S. market\n\n[[Page S13969]]\n\n     to bear on fighting the illegal logging problem and will \n     reinforce work being done with U.S. tax dollars to improve \n     governance in forest-rich developing countries.\n       Organizations endorsing this bill include: American Forest \n     & Paper Association, Center for International Environmental \n     Law, Conservation International, Defenders of Wildlife, \n     Dogwood Alliance, Environmental Investigation Agency, \n     ForestEthics, Friends of the Earth, Global Witness, \n     Greenpeace, Hardwood Federation, International Brotherhood of \n     Carpenters and Joiners of America, International Brotherhood \n     of Teamsters, Natural Resources Defense Council, Rainforest \n     Action Network, Rainforest Alliance, Sierra Club, Society of \n     American Foresters, Sustainable Furniture. Council, The \n     Nature Conservancy, Tropical Forest Trust, United \n     Steelworkers, Wildlife Conservation Society, and the World \n     Wildlife Fund.\n       We'd be glad to furnish additional information, or your \n     staff may wish to be in touch with Michele Miranda with \n     Senator Wyden at 4-5244 or LaTonya Miller with Senator \n     Alexander at 4-7198 if you would like to cosponsor this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Ron Wyden,\n                                                      U.S. Senator\n                                                  Lamar Alexander,\n                                                      U.S. Senator\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The value of this letter is to highlight the \norganizations endorsing the bill, ranging from the American Forest & \nPaper Association, to Defenders of Wildlife, to the Friends of the \nEarth. That is pretty good company in which to be.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Oregon. I hope very much that the \nSenate will agree to this amendment. It may seem like a small step, but \nit will put money in the pockets of American workers. It will help with \nclimate change. It will uphold the rule of law in our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise this evening to urge the White \nHouse to back away from their threats to veto the farm bill that is \npresently before the body. I think the White House would be much better \nadvised to wait until congressional debate has concluded before making \nany final judgments on this bill.\n  In fairness, it should be pointed out the veto threat that came out \nof the White House today was not from the President. It is very \ninteresting what did come out. This is the staff of the President \nsaying, if the farm bill were sent to the President's desk, they would \nrecommend to the President that he veto the bill.\n  Now, all of us know the dance that goes on in Washington on major \nlegislation, and we all know this is negotiating leverage for the \nconference committee to come when the differences are worked out \nbetween the House and the Senate. So that is what is really going on.\n  The fact is, this farm bill is fiscally responsible. It helps our \nNation's farmers and ranchers. It promotes new sources of energy, \nreduces our dependence on foreign oil, enhances conservation, and \nimproves nutrition. But it does it in a way that is paid for and is \nwithin the budget.\n  I saw that some administration sources were asserting that there is \nsomehow $36 billion of extra money in this bill. That is truly a \nconcoction, $36 billion. Let's be clear. This bill costs $288 billion. \nThe baseline is $280 billion. In other words, if we were just to have \nthe same farm bill for the next 5 years as we have had for the past 6 \nyears, it would cost $280 billion. This bill costs $288 billion. That \nis an $8 billion difference, not a $36 billion difference.\n  Why do we have more money than the current farm bill? Because the \nworld has changed. We are trying to adjust the farm bill to deal with \nthe new reality. What is that new reality? There is an energy \nopportunity for America, and this farm bill attempts to seize that \nopportunity. What is the opportunity? It is the chance to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Here are some key facts to remember about the bill. It is a 5-year \nbill. Its costs beyond 5 years will be determined in the next farm \nbill. So when the President's people take the 5 years of this farm bill \nand then extend it and look at its 10-year cost, that is not this bill. \nThis bill is a 5-year bill. It is fully paid for. It complies with pay-\ngo. It does not add one dime to the Nation's debt.\n  In fact, it cuts commodity title payments by $7.5 billion over 5 \nyears. Those are the provisions that have drawn the most fire. It \ntightens payment limitations and eliminates loopholes. Notably, it ends \nthe three entity loophole that has allowed some operators to \neffectively double their Government payments, and it begins direct \nattribution, requiring that Government payments be directly attributed \nto an individual.\n  The farm bill also keeps commodity program outlays which have been \nsingled out for criticism in the media below CBO's August 2002 \nbaseline, the baseline used in drafting the last farm bill. In other \nwords, we can expect farm bill commodity program costs to remain below \nthe level anticipated when the last farm bill was drafted.\n  This is what the last farm bill projected would be the cost of \ncontinuing those provisions. That is the red line. Here is the \nprojected cost of the new farm bill, far below what the estimates were \nwhen the last farm bill was written. In other words, if we look at \ncommodity programs, those are actually only 14 percent of this farm \nbill, commodity programs, but it seems to be the area that draws the \nmost controversy.\n  But somebody apparently has not informed the administration or the \nWhite House that if you extend the Congressional Budget Office's \nbaseline for commodity programs and compare it to this farm bill, this \nfarm bill is well below what the last farm bill would have cost if it \nhad just been simply extended.\n  So there are real savings. Over the next 5 years we can see the total \nfarm bill outlays, including baseline farm spending, and this new farm \nbill will make up only 1.9 percent of total Federal outlays. In other \nwords, this is the current bill we are working on now.\n  If you look at the total of Federal outlays, and you look at what \nthis farm bill will cost, total cost is 1.9 percent of total projected \nFederal outlays during the period. The last farm bill was well over 2 \npercent. So as a share of Federal spending, agriculture's share is \ngoing down, and the commodity provisions that are so controversial are \ngoing down significantly.\n  In the last farm bill, commodity programs cost less than 1 percent, \nthree-quarters of 1 percent of total Federal spending. But in the new \nfarm bill that will be down to one-quarter of 1 percent. Still people \ncomplain. My goodness, I do not think they have any idea what they are \ntalking about. I really do not.\n  The total farm bill has shrunk as a share of the total Federal \nbudget. Commodity programs have shrunk dramatically as a share of the \ntotal Federal budget. It is worth noting that the cost of extending the \n2001 and 2003 tax cuts dwarfs the funding in this farm bill. In fact, \nwhen shown on the same chart, the 2007 farm bill funding is barely \nvisible.\n  This farm bill funding is fully paid for. It is ironic that some of \nthe same people who complain about the farm bill funding are calling \nfor the far more expensive extension of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts \nwithout paying for a dime of it. And they are trying to talk about \nbeing fiscally responsible.\n  Look here. The President wants to extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. \nHere is what that costs. Here is what extending the 2007 farm bill \nfunding is.\n  There is no comparison. There is just no comparison. So if we are \ntalking about being fiscally responsible, let's get real.\n  In addition, when I say this bill is paid for, it is just not my \nclaim, this is the assessment of the Congressional Budget Office. They \nhave analyzed the bill. They say it is fully paid for. In fact, they \nsay: In the 5 years of the bill, there is a savings, when everything is \ntaken into account--the spending, the offsets--that we have $61 million \nleft over from 2008 to 2012, $61 million to the good. So there is not \none penny added to the deficit or the debt as a result of this farm \nbill.\n  The administration has claimed this farm bill includes tax increases. \nThat is wrong. This bill does not include tax increases. It does \ninclude loophole closers that have very strong bipartisan support. For \nexample, it would codify the economic substance doctrine prohibiting \nbusinesses from using certain tax avoidance schemes. It revokes tax \nbenefits for leasing foreign subways and sewers. I know this is hard to \nbelieve, but there are actually companies and individuals who are \nreducing their\n\n[[Page S13970]]\n\nU.S. taxes by buying foreign sewer systems, depreciating them on the \nbooks for U.S. tax purposes, and leasing those sewer systems back to \nthe European cities that built them in the first place.\n  Does anybody consider that a tax increase? I do not. I think it is \ncutting a tax loophole. It increases penalties for failure to file \ncorrect information returns, and it denies deductions for certain fines \nand penalties. I do not consider any of those tax increases.\n  Let's go to the next slide because I want to rivet the point. One of \nthe ways of paying for the farm bill, or at least a part of it, is to \nshut down this scam. This is a picture of a European sewer system. And \nyou do have to wonder, what has a European sewer system got to do with \nthe American farm bill? Well, one of the things we found is, some \ncompanies and some wealthy individuals are actually buying sewer \nsystems in Europe, depreciating them on the books in the United States \nto reduce their tax burden, and then leasing them back to the cities \nthat built them in the first place.\n  Now, I know this sounds too fanciful to be true, but it is true. And \nit does not apply just to sewer systems. We have people who are doing \nthis with European city halls. They are buying European city halls, \ndepreciating them on their tax bills here, and then leasing them back \nto the European cities that built them in the first place. That is just \na scam. So we are shutting down that scam. I do not think that is a tax \nincrease. I think that is shutting down an abusive tax loophole.\n  The fact is, we actually cut taxes in this bill. Here are the tax \ncuts that are provided: $7.3 billion for conservation, including a tax \ncredit for farm land, and a conservation reserve program, $2.5 billion \nfor energy initiatives, including a tax credit for small producers of \ncellulosic fuel, and $800 million for agriculture and rural areas.\n  Tax relief. That is what is in this bill. Tax relief. But it is paid \nfor. The entire bill is paid for. The administration has also \ncomplained that this bill contains sunsets. I would remind my \ncolleagues this is a 5-year bill. And some of the programs, if we would \nextend them, would go on for more than 5 years. But we do not have \nunlimited means, so we have had to cut things off. What does that mean? \nThat means when they write the next farm bill, those things are going \nto end unless somebody finds new money or savings to pay for them. That \nis how we always write legislation.\n  We cannot determine what is going to happen 10 years from now. This \nis a 5-year farm bill. Over the 5 years, this is the point I want to \nmake: This bill is fully paid for. There is no budget point of order \nagainst this bill. None. This bill fully complies with pay-go. The only \ndifference between this bill and simply extending the current farm bill \nis we have added less than 3 percent for energy initiatives to reduce \nour dependance on foreign oil and for certain conservation measures to \nfurther protect our vital resources. Every dime of it is paid for. That \nis the fact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. \nThere has been a lot of discussion about this being a costly bill. It \nwas worthwhile for me to sit here and be reminded again of the nature \nof this investment, the fact that things we are doing in renewable \nenergy are the future of America. It is not just about taking care of \nsome Minnesota and North Dakota farmers. Every gallon of gasoline we \nreplace with ethanol is less money in the pockets of thugs and tyrants \nsuch as Chavez and Ahmadinejad. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. \nIf you recall the last farm bill, there was a lot of discussion about \nwhether the President should veto that. Now we look back and across the \nboard folks are saying that was a good farm bill. That was a bill that \nin the end cost less. It kept the safety net in place. We moved forward \nwith a new world of opportunities with things such as renewables. So we \nhave this discussion again. I hope we pass this farm bill, and I hope \nit gets signed.\n  The farm bill begins by stating its necessity due to the fact that \n``the present acute economic emergency being in part the consequence of \na severe and increasing disparity between the prices of agricultural \nand other commodities, which disparity has largely destroyed the \npurchasing power of farmers for industrial products, has broken down \nthe orderly exchange of commodities, and has seriously impaired the \nagricultural assets supporting the national credit structure . . . ''\n  This is not the start of the 2007 farm bill. It is an excerpt from \nthe very first farm bill of 1933. When that farm bill was written in \n1933, net farm income was only one-third of what it was 3 years prior. \nFood went wasted in the field, while Americans went hungry because of \ndepressed commodity prices. There was no safety net. It was such a time \nof crisis that folks from across my State of Minnesota came together \nwith farmers from the Dakotas, Iowa, and Nebraska to protect each \nother's homes, farms, livestock, and machinery from being taken through \nforeclosure.\n  The Senate Agriculture Committee has proven that like minds from \nthese States still collaborate to save the family farm. Today I come to \nthe floor as part of a bipartisan multiregional coalition not just from \nthe Midwest and upper Midwest but from all across this great Nation. On \nthe Ag Committee, we came together under the leadership of Chairman \nHarkin and Ranking Member Chambliss and my friend from North Dakota, \nSenator Conrad, to build a stronger food safety net for working \nfamilies, an ag safety net for farm families. Over the next several \ndays, the U.S. Senate will have the responsibility to pass a farm bill \nthat will ensure Americans can meet the bare requirements of human \nsubsistence.\n  In today's world, relentlessly focused on the future, it can be \ndifficult to reach back into the past and conceive of a time before \nfood stamps, conservation programs, and a farm safety net. It doesn't \nseem possible that in this country hunger was widespread, massive \nclouds of dust roared from State to State, and farmers couldn't make \nenough money from their crops to even make harvest worthwhile. Yet our \npast bears witness to these struggles. Since these difficult years, \nCongress has struggled to perfect the omnibus legislation we call the \nfarm bill.\n  In 2007, with the bipartisan bill produced by the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, I believe we move closer yet to our final goal of crafting a \nsmarter, stronger safety net. As the Ag Committee has labored over the \nlast several months to build this bill, I have worked with my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to secure a number of \npriorities for my State of Minnesota. This bill not only strengthens \nthe farmer safety net but helps meet the food security challenges of \nAmerica's low-income families, makes a bold commitment to renewable \nfuels, and boosts investment in renewable fuels and conservation.\n  As the ranking Republican on the Nutrition Subcommittee, I am proud \nof this bill's efforts to assist those Americans dealing with food \nsecurity issues. This bill now provides an additional $5.3 billion in \nfunding for nutrition programs, such as stamps and the emergency food \nand assistance program, TEFAP. The Food Stamp Program, which assists \nover 260,000 Minnesotans, will be significantly strengthened. We will \nstop inflation from creating greater benefit erosion in the Food Stamp \nProgram and encourage savings among low-income families. During the \nmarkup, I fought to bring the bill's funding for TEFAP, which provides \nvaluable resources to our food banks and homeless shelters, up to the \nsame levels as the House bill. We have found the funds to meet this \nneed, providing an additional $10 million a year.\n  If you believe everything you read in the editorial pages, you might \nconclude that this bill funds farmers at the expense of the poor, but \nthat isn't true. Nutrition spending now makes up over 66 percent of the \nfarm bill, while we have found in the Ag Committee $7.5 billion in \nsavings in the commodity title. These savings come from programs that \ncost $22 billion less than was expected when the 2002 farm bill was \npassed. My colleague from North Dakota has laid that out. This is a \nbill wherein the commodity program baseline is lower than the estimate \nof the 2002 bill. This is a bill where the percent of dollars that goes \nto farms as a percentage of Federal spending is substantially lower \nthan in the 2002 farm\n\n[[Page S13971]]\n\nbill. Meanwhile, we manage to preserve the basic structure of the \nsafety net for our farmers who feed and fuel this Nation.\n  For years now as I have driven across the great State of Minnesota, I \nhave been hearing from farmers who have told me the 2002 farm bill \nworked. Families growing various crops told me we needed to make some \nadjustments. This bill makes needed updates for sugar, barley, wheat, \nand soybeans, among others. The bill includes a reauthorization of the \ndairy safety net, including the MILC Program, restoring it to the 45-\npercent payment rate. The committee included my proposal to create a \nfarm storage loan program that works for today's farmers.\n  I proudly support the new permanent ag disaster program we now have, \nthanks to the leadership of Senators Baucus and Conrad, that will lend \nfarmers a helping hand when faced with natural disaster. The faces of \nthousands of hard-working farmers I have seen over the years come to \nmind as I consider the importance of the farm bill safety net. I also \nreflect on the health of my State's entire economy, the survival of \nsmall towns on country roads. In Minnesota, the agriculture and food \nindustry is the second largest employer, with two-thirds of all \nagricultural jobs being off farm in processing, distribution, supply, \nand service sectors. We rank fifth nationally in farm exports and \nlead the Nation in sugar beet and turkey production. All of Minnesota \nneeds a strong safety net for our farmers.\n\n  Nationally, the farm safety net is critical to every taxpayer, to \nevery American. First, we all need food. Thanks to our farmers, U.S. \nconsumers spend 10 percent of their income on food, the lowest \npercentage in the world. For every dollar Americans spend on food, \nfarmers get only 20 cents. Our entire economy benefits. Some folks \nforget that agriculture employs 20 percent of the U.S. workforce, \naccounts for roughly 20 percent of the Nation's GDP, and is America's \nNo. 1 export.\n  Beyond preserving the safety net for rural Americans who work in \nagriculture, this bill provides significant mandatory funding for key \nrural development programs to build vibrant rural communities, \nincluding $50 million to rehabilitate small rural hospitals, $20 \nmillion to protect rural drinking water, and provisions to encourage \nlocal ownership of ethanol plants.\n  To revitalize our rural economy, this includes the rural renaissance \nlegislation I worked hard to pass with my colleague from Arkansas, \nSenator Pryor, that will provide $400 million in tax credit bonds to \nfinance rural infrastructure projects such as water and wastewater \ntreatment projects.\n  I have no doubt Minnesota is similar to Colorado. We have small towns \nthat simply don't have the tax base to do the infrastructure they need. \nThis bill will provide some opportunity to assist those small rural \ncommunities with infrastructure.\n  Another key to renewing Minnesota's rural communities has been the \nproduction of renewable fuels as our farmers work to reduce dependence \non foreign oil. In the Ag Committee, we worked to take the next step in \nhelping power ethanol plants with crop biomass and diversifying our \nbiofuels feedstocks to include cellulosic and sugar. All in all, this \nbill delivers over $1 billion in additional investment in the energy \ntitle. It will also help equip our existing corn ethanol plants with \nthe latest in renewable technologies, with $422 million for competitive \ngrants and loan guarantees. The future is cellulosic. We know that with \ncorn we can do about 15 billion gallons of ethanol. We consume 140 \nbillion gallons of gasoline each year, projected to go up to 180 \nbillion. Cellulosic is the future. This bill provides a pathway to \naccelerate us reaching that future.\n  This bill helps farmers transition to the production of biomass \ncrops. We provide over $200 million to help farmers with production, \nharvesting, transportation, and storage costs. I am hopeful one day we \nwill see a cellulosic ethanol plant in Kittson County, MN. This bill \nwill bring us closer to that reality. Meanwhile, this bill includes a \nsugar ethanol program which I have long advocated. If Brazil can do it, \nwe can do it. They made a commitment in the early 1970s to ethanol. \nThey do it with sugar. They didn't let up to that commitment when oil \nprices went down. They stayed the course. As a result today, Brazil is \nnot dependent on foreign oil.\n  We need to have that same commitment, that same persistence. Sugar \nshould be part of it. That opportunity is in this bill.\n  Finally, I have been concerned that those living near ethanol plants \ncontinue to have an opportunity to invest in these renewable \nopportunities. I am thankful to the chairman and ranking member for \nincluding my local ownership amendment to ensure communities continue \nto hold more of the value created by these plants in their small towns \nthrough ownership. On top of all these investments, this bill still \nmanages to include the single largest investment in conservation this \nNation has ever seen. Specifically, the bill increases funding for \nmajor programs such as the Wetland Reserve Program, the Conservation \nStewardship Program, and the Grassland Reserve Program, as well as \nprotecting 39.2 million acres allotted for the Conservation Reserve \nProgram.\n  This bill also includes Open Fields, a critical, voluntary program to \nencourage property owners to allow public access for hunting and \nfishing. All in all, the bill increases conservation funding by $4.4 \nbillion above the current budget baseline, which will mean increased \nwildlife habitat, cleaner water, and a healthy environment for all of \nus and it is paid for.\n  No bill of this size is going to be perfect. But I believe when the \nsum of these accomplishments is measured, folks will realize what an \nachievement this is. Of course, some will continue to criticize. \nDespite including what I consider to be great advances in farm \nnutrition, conservation, rural development, and energy policy, coupled \nwith dramatic reforms, there no doubt will be detractors who look at \nthis farm bill and cry that more reform is needed. They will argue that \nmoney should not to go factory farms. It should go to nutrition, \nconservation, and energy instead.\n  As I have traveled around Minnesota, I don't see factory farms. \nInstead, I meet family after family, such as the Meyer Family in \nNicollet County. They let me know how important the farm safety net is \nto them. They told me the advent of renewable fuels, what it has meant \nto them in terms of transforming their farming operation, has had the \nsame impact that electricity had for their grandfather. That is the \npath to hope and opportunity we are on. That is the path this farm bill \nfosters. I wholeheartedly agree this farm bill should invest more in \nnutrition, conservation, and energy. This bill makes remarkable strides \nin these areas. In fact, nutrition spending will grow to represent two-\nthirds of the bill's total spending. I also believe we need to reform \nto prevent nonfarming millionaires from getting farm payments and close \nloopholes to get around payment limitations. Ted Turner and Scottie \nPippen should not get farm subsidies. This bill closes the loophole. It \nsucceeds in doing that by the most aggressive farm payment reforms to \ndate, by lowering the adjusted gross income limit from $2.5 million to \n$750,000 by 2010, while eliminating the three-entity rule and commodity \ncertificate loopholes. No one wants multimillionaires to be getting \nfarm subsidies. This bill says that doesn't happen.\n\n  Again, some critics will say reform is not enough. I urge these folks \nto talk to Senator Chambliss, talk to my colleague from Arkansas, \nSenator Lincoln. Ask them how tighter restrictions under the banner of \nreform will throw a disproportionate burden on their farmers, rice \nfarmers and cotton farmers who have a greater cost of production for \ncotton and rice than in other regions of the country. Farm bills are \nabout achieving broad bipartisan compromise for the good of the \nAmerican people. This bill meets that standard and deserves this body's \nsupport.\n  I finish by asking my colleagues to take a look at the frescos that \nline the corridors of the hall of columns next time they find \nthemselves on the House side. Written near the top of one of the walls, \nthere is a quote by Carl Sandburg that reads:\n\n       Whenever a people or an institution forgets its hard \n     beginnings, it is beginning to decay.\n\n  The Senate must not forget this Nation's struggles on the farm and on \nthe\n\n[[Page S13972]]\n\ndinner tables before our farm and nutrition safety nets existed. We \ncannot afford to forget how far our farm bills have come since 1933. We \nhave come a long way over the last 75 years in building a thriving \nagricultural economy, responsible conservation policies, and responsive \nnutrition programs. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nfarm bill, which builds on the steady gains agriculture has made and \ncontinues the economic prosperity it has fueled.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to add my remarks to this debate \non the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007. I see our chairman of the \ncommittee in the Chamber. I wish to say a personal thanks to him for \nhis leadership and hard work, along with his staff, who worked \ndiligently through the committee process to really come together.\n\n  My colleagues, including Senator Coleman, who is on the committee as \nwell, working with others--Senator Conrad has been here--those of us on \nthe committee have worked so hard to come up with a compromise, a bill \nthat is practical and realistic but also actually exhibits reforms that \nmany people have been asking for. But the bill also moves forward in a \nprogressive way, a way I think Americans can be proud in the values and \nthe priorities we set. So as a member of our Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, I am extremely proud of the product our committee has \nproduced.\n  A lot of time and energy was put into the committee bill to ensure we \nmaintain the blessings we have here in American agriculture. Staff and \nthe members worked hard to come up with a good compromise, a compromise \nthat respects and appreciates the diversities across our country and \nthe great wealth and bounty of what our Nation has.\n  The farm bill does many other good things. Several of my colleagues \nhave already touched on those. Our investment in nutrition, \nconservation, rural development, and energy programs has been \ndramatically increased. All of these things will benefit our country \ngreatly.\n  As one of the cochairs and cofounders of the Senate Hunger Caucus, I \nfind it very important that we focus, through this bill, on nutrition. \nI hope others do, and I hope they are willing to look for resources we \nneed to make sure we pay for that, that we are serious about nutrition, \nand that we are going to continue to work on that. My faith requires me \nto look after the poorest among us, and I am very pleased the committee \nbill provides an additional $5 billion increase in programs targeted at \nreducing food insecurity among our children and our elderly, among our \nlow-income and those who are in need.\n  Conservation is a big part of this package as well. The chairman has \nbeen a tireless advocate for conservation programs. I am pleased that \nonce again he has produced a bill that is progressive in this area. It \nensures that we are the best stewards of the land we possibly can be \nand that we will leave our children the environment they deserve.\n  Having grown up on a farm myself and recognizing that my dad, as a \nfarmer, was one of the greatest conservationists I could ever meet--he \nwas conscientious with the way he handled his land. He knew it would be \nthere for future generations if he took good care of it. He also knew \nif he took good care of that land in the current, it would produce the \ncrops that would provide for our family. So conservation is an \nessential part of who we are as Americans. What is exhibited in this \nbill is a step forward--a large step forward--in a very progressive way \nof how we have invested in conservation.\n  Rural development is also well represented in this bill. Again, \ngrowing up in rural America, it is so important to see the investments, \nwhether it is investments in small businesses and entrepreneurs. The \nbroadband effort we have made here is incredibly important.\n  I have a gentleman who bought property in Arkansas to retire on. He \nwas not going to move there for another 10 or 15 years. When he \nrealized his business actually could access three major cities across \nthis country and access those cities through the technology he needed \nto use, he decided to move to Arkansas ahead of time, ahead of \nretirement, because it was a place he wanted to be.\n  The outmigration we have seen from rural America has been caused \nlargely because of a lack of opportunity. In rural development, we \nprovide not only many of those tools to help development, help \nentrepreneurs and small businesses grow their businesses, but we \nprovide for communities to invest in their infrastructure so it will be \na desirable place for people to build their businesses and raise their \nfamilies. That is important.\n  Reducing dependency on foreign oil is absolutely critical, and we \nknow that as a nation now. We see the passion in Americans for wanting \nan alternative and renewable energy source. In this bill, we have the \nbeginnings, particularly of making sure that not only we lessen our \ndependence on foreign oil but we do so in a way that is good for the \nenvironment. It provides an additional marketplace for our producers \nwith their commodities.\n  We have a win-win in this situation, with all of these things we have \nbrought together in this bill. Yet many of them are new programs over \nthe last couple of decades in terms of the farm bill in our outreach. \nIt is essential that we recognize the investment we are making in this \nbill and that we do not tarry in getting it passed and that we make \nagain the assurances to hard-working families, both on the family farm \nas well as in rural America, that we do believe in them, that we do \nbelieve as a government in investing in who they are, what their values \nare, and the contribution they make to the fabric of this country.\n  Most importantly, to me, as the mother of twin boys, the farm bill \ndoes something we should all be very proud of: It ensures our Nation, \nthe working families of this country, and the children of this Nation, \na safe and affordable domestic supply of food and fiber. We are the \nenvy of the world in how we can do that. Not only do we do it most \nefficiently and effectively, we do it by keeping the cost of our food \nper capita the lowest of any developed country in the world. We do it \nwith respect to our environment. It is the envy of the world. Many of \nmy colleagues and most, if not all, of the media seem to take that for \ngranted when we bring up this bill. It is something we should never \nlose sight of in this debate. As a mother, when I go to the store and I \nknow and can see what it is I am purchasing, knowing those crops and \nthose food sources--domestically produced--can ensure for me a quality \nfood source and sustenance of life for my family, that is \nunbelievable--again, the envy of the world.\n  We look at what comes out of the media. One day they are reporting \nabout the dangers our Nation is facing with unsafe food entering the \ncountry or the atrocities of outsourcing jobs, and the next day they \nare on the front page of the news criticizing farm programs that keep \nproduction agriculture here at home and level the disparities in global \nagricultural trade that U.S. farmers face abroad. The markets out there \nare not that open to certainly the commodities we grow in our region of \nthe country.\n  But we are a diverse nation. Our crops are different in each region \nof the country. For that reason, we have several different programs to \nsupport individual commodity needs. In the Midwest, with corn, sugar, \nsugar beets, and fruit and vegetable producers, they enjoy several \ndifferent programs outside our traditional farm programs to provide \nthem the support they need to continue producing right here at home. \nThey are different programs than my growers would probably access, and \nthey have different rules for those programs. With sugar, we limit the \naccess for foreign competition into the U.S. market. For corn, we \nprovide several different provisions in law that support those \nproducers, in addition to traditional commodity programs. We mandate a \nmarket through the renewable fuels standard. We provide a tax credit \nfor blenders, and we protect ourselves from foreign competition to give \nthis industry a chance to grow and an opportunity to reduce our \ndependency on foreign energy.\n\n  In other States across our country, in fruit and vegetable regions of \nour country, in addition to the nearly $3 billion worth of incentives \nfor this industry,\n\n[[Page S13973]]\n\nwe provide a planting restriction to limit competition from producers \nof other commodities.\n  Oftentimes, we are told in the South: Why don't you just grow \nsomething else, something different that may be less difficult or less \nof a problem in the international trade market? Well, in many \ninstances, we are unable to do that because of planting restrictions. \nBut I am proud of the recognition of this diversity, and I am proud to \nhave supported these initiatives tirelessly on behalf of the hard-\nworking farm families in other regions of the country.\n  I have also fought hard to ensure that American agriculture gets the \nrespect it deserves in the world marketplace because, as the budget \nchairman pointed out yesterday with his now famous charts, the world \nmarket for our farmers is not free or fair. My message is simple: We \nshould meet our global competition, and we should not unilaterally \ndisarm our farmers in the global marketplace.\n  The unfortunate reality is that our global agricultural competition \nis heavily subsidized, and their markets are closed to agricultural \ngoods that my State particularly produces. We have to fight hard for \nthe small bit of market access our crops need in those other countries \nand in those trade agreements. As a result, we have grown our \noperations to create an economy of scale that allows us to be \ncompetitive. If we are not careful, with the tighter payment limits, we \nare going to make our producers of staple commodities such as rice less \ncompetitive internationally. As I have pointed out, rice and cotton \nface much greater international competition than any of the other \ncommodities we are discussing in this bill.\n  So our point, with these commodities we have and what we face in that \nglobal competitive marketplace, is: Yes, our program might need to be \njust a little bit different, kind of like the sugar program or the corn \nprogram and the supports they need. I did not invent the global \nsubsidies in agriculture, but I am committed to ensuring that the \nSenate helps our farmers meet the global competition.\n  Working with both Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley on the trade \naspects, through the Senate Finance Committee, and the Office of the \nUSTR, we are going to continue the fight. I am going to continue to \nfight to ensure that global access is there for us. As we do that as a \nnation, I think it is our responsibility and duty to provide the \nsupport programs our farmers need. To not do so will simply result in \nan outsourcing of our food supply and our jobs in rural America.\n  Within the WTO negotiations, we have asked our trading partners to \nreduce their subsidies and their tariff levels on U.S. agricultural \nproducts. What we have said is that we will come down further and \nfaster on our subsidy programs, on our support programs. But the \nresponse from the rest of the world has been abundantly clear to us: \nNo, thank you, America. We don't want to bring down our subsidies. We \ndon't want to bring down our supports. We want you to. But, no, thank \nyou very much. We are not going to do that. You go right ahead. You \nlower your subsidies, and we will simply hang on to ours.\n  Here at home I have heard some of my colleagues and mostly media \noutlets that have said we needed to lower the caps on programs. Well, \nguess what. The committee bill does just that. It lowers the overall \ncap from $360,000 to $100,000.\n  I have also heard we needed to address the loophole that has allowed \nproducers to avoid the caps. The committee bill does just that. It \neliminates both of the loopholes most frequently cited--the three-\nentity rule and the generic certificates.\n  I heard we needed transparency, so the committee bill--yes, the \ncommittee bill we bring before this Senate--adds direct attribution, \nwhich will track payments directly to an individual farmer. Now, let me \nbe clear. This is only for traditional, what we refer to as ``program \ncommodities,'' not sugar or dairy or ethanol. They will not have direct \nattribution. But in this bill we provide direct attribution for the \ntraditional program commodities. As I pointed out, those programs \noperate in a slightly different fashion to provide support to their \nfarmers because we have a lot of different farmers in different regions \naround this great country.\n  I heard we needed to disqualify millionaire nonfarmers, those who are \nwalking around Fifth Avenue or Hollywood. So in the committee bill we \ndo just that. We move the adjusted gross income means test from its \ncurrent level of $2.5 million to $750,000.\n  Now I notice my colleague Norm Coleman bringing up celebrities such \nas Scottie Pippen. But the fact is, Scottie Pippen won't be affected, \nbecause most of those individuals--or certainly a large amount of \nthem--are reported because of their conservation payments. These are \ncontracts they enter into with the Federal Government for contracts on \nconservation, putting their land into conservation. Many of them will \nhave an adjusted gross income above that level, but they will still be \nlisted and they will still be getting their payments, because they have \nentered into that contract. We don't put an AGI means test on the \nconservation program. I think that is important for people to \nunderstand. Those people very often are not getting program payments; \nthey are getting conservation payments.\n  My sincere hope is this will all be seen as what it is. It is a good-\nfaith effort on my part and the members of the Agriculture Committee--\nall of the others on the committee--to address concerns and to \nrecognize this is the most significant reform in the history of our \nfarm program. We have made a tremendous progressive effort on the \nissues that are important to people, both reform as well as nutrition \nprograms, conservation, energy, renewable energy. Now we have some \ntime, it seems, to discuss what this farm bill does and doesn't do.\n  I am appreciative of this time, because throughout my career I have \ntried to look after family farmers and to respect the needs of farmers \nin every region of this great country. I have tried to do that first \nand I have tried to assist them in providing our Nation and the world \nwith the bounty they do. It is something we far too often take for \ngranted, the blessing of living in this country, knowing there is an \naffordable, abundant, and safe supply of food and fiber for the people \nof this country. We in this country are fortunate. We are fortunate to \nhave this bounty. I am not going to let anyone in this Chamber forget \nit. I am not going to allow anyone to send this bounty to some foreign \nland never to be seen again in this country, to outsource the \nopportunity that hard-working farm families in this country have to do \nwhat it is they want to do most and what they do most effectively, and \nthat is to provide this country with that safe, affordable, and \nabundant supply of food and fiber.\n  I look forward to the discussion ahead of us. I have to say if there \nis one unfortunate thing I find in all of this discussion, it is that \nthere are those people who would choose to misrepresent the facts. When \nthey misrepresent the facts, it breaks down the process. It breaks down \nthe process from what is real. What is real is those of us on the \nAgriculture Committee who have come together in good faith to produce a \nbill that makes sense; something everybody can support and that \nrespects people all across this country. My hope is we will continue \nthis conversation, and that those who choose to misrepresent the facts \ncan be countered or at least corrected, and those of us who want to \nwork hard to come up with something that makes sense, that we can \ncontinue to do so. I look forward to that debate. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues. Senator Grassley and Chairman Baucus are \nhere on the floor. They have done yeoman's work on behalf of farmers \nacross this country, and I look forward to continuing to work with \nthem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I know it is my turn to speak, but out \nof deference to Senator Baucus who is negotiating on the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, I ask unanimous consent that he go before me, \nand then I ask that Senator Tester would follow him, because I don't \nwant Senator Tester to have to sit around and listen to me. Then I ask \nunanimous consent after those two, I be the next in line.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S13974]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  WRDA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my very good friend from Iowa. \nSenator Grassley is a true gentleman and I deeply appreciate the \ncourtesy he is offering me, as well as my colleague Senator Tester.\n  A few moments ago, the House voted to override the President's veto \nby a vote of 361 to 54--361 to 54--clearly overriding the President's \nveto on the WRDA bill. I stand here today asking the Senate to do the \nsame. We too should have a very strong vote to override the President's \nveto. If the House can vote to override, certainly the Senate can too.\n  This conference report, as we all know, provides authority for the \nArmy Corps of Engineers to move forward on many very long overdue water \nresource projects. Let's not forget the West's battle with drought and \nthe coasts' recurring struggles against Mother Nature's harsh storms \nthat highlight the pressing need to address our water resource needs. I \nsaw a very alarming article not too long ago, 2 or 3 weeks ago, about \nthe effects of climate change and global warming. It is not just the \nice sheets melting and the coastlines rising; there is also increased \ndrought--increased drought in the Southeast and in the Southwest, \nespecially the Southwest. It is tough enough for my part of the country \nwhere the average precipitation is about 13 inches a year. That is all \nit is. I think in Washington, DC, the average precipitation is around \n40 inches. In the northern high plains States where we desperately need \nthese projects, the annual precipitation is again about 13 to 14 inches \na year. We need help.\n  I must say too it is important to keep in mind that since 1986, \nCongress enacted legislation known as the Water Resources Development \nAct, otherwise known as WRDA. Every 2 years since then, Congress has \nreceived a WRDA bill from the administration, seeking authorization for \nwater resources projects. These requests provided the Corps and local \nsponsors with a regular planning schedule.\n  It is kind of like the highway bill. We have people in our country--\nthe highway bill clearly is the contractors and the States--some \nability to plan for the future. That is why we have 5- or 6-year bills. \nThe same is also true with the Water Resources Development Act. We need \nto give some sense of predictability and some sense of certainty to \npeople so they can plan for projects, in this case the Corps.\n  I must say, however, that the administration has not requested one \nupdate of the program--not one--since the year he has been President. \nSo the question is, Why? Why has the President not suggested an update \nin the program? Well, according to the President, this is not a \npriority. He says the Congress is not being fiscally responsible. I \nhave to disagree. He is not accurate. Why? Well, one reason is the \ncosts in this legislation reflect an accumulation of projects that need \nto be authorized because we have not had a WRDA bill for over 6 years. \nIt stands to reason that if we haven't had an authorization for over 6 \nyears, clearly the costs are going to go up a little bit.\n\n  Investing in our water infrastructure is a cost we cannot afford to \nput off. I submit it doesn't make any sense to turn our backs on all of \nthese water projects because otherwise they continue to crumble, they \ncontinue to erode, and it does not make a lot of sense. In fact, many \npeople are worried about America's competitiveness, and I am one who \nthinks we do not pay enough attention to our infrastructure; that is, \nif we are going to compete in the future, we have to have strong \nhighways, we have to have a power system, a telephone system, and we \nneed to have a very good water resource system. We have to get water \nwhere it is needed because if we don't, there are going to be huge \ncosts not just in the immediate term but also in the long term.\n  It is very important that this legislation, in my judgment, pass. \nThere are several projects in this bill in the State of Montana, my \nhome State. One is the Yellowstone River and Tributaries Recovery \nproject, and another is called the Lower Yellowstone project at Intake, \nMT; third, the Missouri River and Tributaries Recovery project; the \nUpper Basin of the Missouri River project, and a riverfront \nrevitalization project in Missoula, MT. These projects will all improve \nand protect our valuable water resources.\n  The old saying about whiskey and water: You fight over water. Whiskey \nis for drinking, water is for fighting over. It is because water is \nsuch a precious and valuable resource.\n  There is also an important authorization for a very important project \nin my State of Montana, and that is the rehabilitation and improvement \nof an aging water project we call the Hi-Line. If you look at the State \nof Montana, it is a highway that goes across northern Montana. We call \nit Hi-Line. It is as though we are high above the Earth because we go \nacross northern Montana and up there, there is something called the St. \nMary Diversion. It is a Federal project built years ago. It is a mess. \nIt is dilapidated and crumbling. I have been up there not too long ago. \nI have been up there a couple of times. I am embarrassed that the U.S. \nGovernment has not kept up the system, not kept up the operation, and \nnot kept it going. I am embarrassed and I feel bad, and in fact I am \nangry that half of the people in the area--it is an Indian reservation \nas well, and a lot of people have moved off the reservation, and we \nhave to address this. This legislation does address it. It is very \nimportant. Without it, I might add, the Lower Milk River, which falls \nout of the Diversion, would go dry 6 out of every 10 years. Without \nthis St. Mary Diversion, the Milk River would go dry 6 out of every 10 \nyears. That is 60 percent of the time. This affects thousands of \nMontana families.\n  If you have been up on the Hi-Line, if you have been on the Milk \nRiver, you will get a sense and a feel for how valuable this is. It is \nour lifeblood. The President might not think these projects are a \npriority. I certainly do.\n  This conference report authorizes projects that will provide needed \nflood and storm damage protection, as well as a lot of navigation \nimprovements and a lot of environmental restoration. There is also \nauthority here that is so important for rebuilding and restoring the \ncoast of Louisiana devastated by Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, and \nauthority for modernizing the lock and dam system on the Mississippi \nRiver, and authority for ecosystem restoration projects from New Jersey \nto Florida to Colorado--all vitally important.\n  The 1986 comprehensive WRDA bill was enacted after a 16-year deadlock \nbetween the Congress and the executive branch. The deadlock we see \ntoday between the Congress and the President is about priorities. What \nare our priorities? What are America's priorities? What are the \npriorities of our country? The Congress has set priorities and enacted \nthis legislation. The American people clearly value--and it goes \nwithout saying--the water resources of our country and our need to \ninvest in them. The American people see this as a priority.\n  Again, the conference report passed the Senate by a strong 81-to-12 \nvote, clearly enough votes to override a Presidential veto, and the \nHouse voted moments ago very strongly to override the President's veto \n361 to 54. So let's not delay any longer. Let's get this conference \nreport enacted with a very strong vote and override the President's \nveto. We already did it in the House. Let's do it in the Senate when \nthe time comes--I think it is tomorrow--and then we can get on with \ndeveloping these projects, and we can be very proud of doing something \nin the Congress that is very worthwhile.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about this farm \nbill. Before I start, though, I thank Senator Grassley for allowing me \nthis time to speak. I certainly appreciate his hospitality.\n  This farm bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation we \nwill vote on this year. Along with the members of the committee, I \nthank Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Chambliss for their hard work \non this bill in committee. This farm bill just doesn't affect farmers \nand ranchers and folks who need nutritional assistance; it impacts all \nAmericans and it ensures that food in this country is secure.\n  Our agricultural policy has created the most dependable and \naffordable food system in the world. Americans have incredible choices \nat the grocery store. We have high quality and safe\n\n[[Page S13975]]\n\nfood, and our supplies and prices are stable. What makes this stability \npossible is a comprehensive farm bill that helps set national \npriorities, keeping our family farms and ranches productive and food on \nAmerica's tables.\n  I bring a different perspective to the farm bill than a lot of my \ncolleagues. I am a third-generation farmer. My wife and I farm the same \nland my grandparents homesteaded nearly a century ago. I have spent a \nlifetime with my hands in the dirt, and I know how difficult it is to \nget by in production agriculture, especially in these days. I am proud \nthat Sharla and I are passing that same farm down that my grandparents \nhomesteaded to the fourth generation of our family. If this bill is \nvetoed as the President has promised, many families won't have the \noption to pass their farm down, because over the next 5 years, many of \nthem will go broke.\n  American agriculture is facing very difficult challenges, such as \nskyrocketing land prices, aging populations in rural America, and the \nhigh cost of fuels and fertilizers. The changing global marketplace \ncreates more uncertainties for our producers and challenges when our \nso-called free markets sometimes come with a high price. America's \nfamily farms and ranches have a lot on the line right now. They also \nhave tremendous potential. This farm bill provides new opportunities \nfor rural America.\n  America's farmers and ranchers can be leaders in energy production as \nthey are leaders in food production. For years, Montana, especially \nfarm and ranch country, has adapted to our Nation's growing energy \nneeds.\n  The folks who put food on America's dinner tables also have \ntremendous opportunity in contributing to this country's energy \nindependence through biodiesel, cellulosic ethanol, and wind power--\njust to name a few.\n  That is good news for rural America, it is good news for our \npocketbooks, and it is good for family agriculture.\n  In Montana, an oil-seed crop called Camelina is being used for \nbiodiesel production. It grows on marginal soils, takes few inputs and \ndoesn't need a whole lot of water. This year Montana started its first \nbiodiesel facility--this farm bill will help this facility get off its \nfeet and supply this country with much needed energy. I hope this plant \nis the first of many.\n  We have only scratched the surface of our energy potential--and this \nfarm bill could really tap into it. This bill will put the necessary \nresources into the production of biofuels, and more incentives for \nrural wind power projects.\n  Many folks may not know that the farm bill is perhaps our largest \nconservation program. Our farmers and ranchers are stewards of the land \nand are constantly working to improve their operations to reduce their \nimpact on the environment.\n  This bill strengthens our working lands conservation programs to help \nmake our farms and ranches productive and protected.\n  This bill will finally implement mandatory country-of-origin \nlabeling. May I say it is about time. In Montana, we passed a country-\nof-origin labeling law in 2005. It is time we implement it at the \nFederal level.\n  Whether it is the t-shirt I wear, the truck I drive, or the toy I buy \nfor my grandkids, I can tell where it was made. It only makes sense \nthat we know where our food comes from, too.\n  COOL is good public policy. Americans deserve to know where their \nfood comes from, and implementation of mandatory country-of-origin \nlabeling is long overdue.\n  Part of adequate labeling is the ability for our producers to market \ntheir products. I am happy to see that this farm bill will allow for \nthe interstate shipment and sale of beef. Montana has some of the best \nbeef in the world and smaller producers should be able to market their \nsafe, healthy, quality products across State lines.\n  I don't like shopping all that much--but it is even worse here in \nWashington. The lines are too long and the prices too high. But I will \ntell you what, it sure would put a smile on my face to see a t-bone on \nthe shelf with a ``Made in Montana'' stamp on it.\n  We hope to include in this bill permanent ag disaster assistance. I \nhear that some of my colleagues don't think this is the best way to \nprotect family farm and ranch businesses but as a farmer I strongly \nsupport this measure.\n  I know what it is like in the good years when you have a crop to put \nin the bin. And I know what it is like to have no crop. Whether it is \nhail, drought, floods, grasshoppers, or any other disaster, we need to \nmake sure that our farmers and ranchers are protected. This is a real \nsafety net that will help family farmers get by when disaster strikes.\n  This disaster assistance program has strict requirements on who may \nreceive assistance and will only help those farmers who have taken \nsteps to mitigate their risk. This program will provide the predictable \nand consistent safety net that our family farmers and ranchers deserve.\n  This farm bill makes great strides in acknowledging the importance of \norganic agriculture in our food system. Organic foods have been growing \nat a rate of over 20 percent a year for 20 years. This bill offers \nmoney for research dollars to support organic agriculture. And it will \nprovide funds to help family farms--if they choose--convert to organics \nso that U.S. farms can meet the needs of this growing market.\n  Organic agriculture is really a value-added program. It allows \nfarmers and ranchers to find ways to increase the profitability of \ntheir products by consumers driving the marketplace.\n  As far as nutrition is concerned, of course, the farm bill has a \ntremendous impact on the underprivileged segments of our society.\n  The people who use these programs aren't lobbying our congressional \noffices, or sending thousands of letters, or using influence with the \nmedia to shape public policy. They are our children. They are the \nelderly. They are young, single mothers working two jobs. They are \ndisabled veterans who need nutritional assistance until times get \nbetter.\n  In Montana, nearly 20 percent of our children live below the poverty \nline. Each month, more than 80,000 Montanans seek assistance through \nthe food stamp program; 20,000 seek supplemental assistance through the \nWomen, Infants, and Children program. Out of a total population of just \nunder a million people this is a big impact on our State.\n\n  Montana also has some of the lowest unemployment rates in the \ncountry. We have good schools and college participation. We just can't \nalways make ends meet where there is high cost of living and low wages. \nThese nutrition programs are just the help folks need until they can \nget on their feet.\n  In the wealthiest, most-advanced society in the world, no person \nshould go hungry. I am glad that this farm bill has made long overdue \nincreases to our food assistance programs.\n  This farm bill is something that our Nation can be proud of. It \nstrikes a balance between our different regions, and different \ninterests. It does not have everything we want, but it has what we \nneed.\n  This is a farm bill that meets the needs of this country's family \nfarmers, and it takes great strides in helping families with a more \nrealistic nutrition component.\n  Mr. President, I know firsthand how important this bill is for \nAmerica's producers and America's consumers. This is mainstream, \nbipartisan legislation that was crafted and passed out of the Ag \nCommittee without a dissenting vote. The farm bill is too important for \nanyone to obstruct, or to delay, or to play political games with.\n  American consumers, from all walks of life, living paycheck-to-\npaycheck, depend on this farm bill. American producers, in every corner \nof this country, living harvest to harvest, depend on this farm bill.\n  The Senate needs to debate and pass this legislation, and the \nPresident of the United States needs to sign it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the amendment that is \nbefore the Senate--the Dorgan-Grassley amendment--on payment \nlimitations; in other words, limiting the amount of money that one \nfarming operation can get from a farm program in a specific year.\n  The second reason I come to the floor is to address the issue of the \nPresident's suggested veto of the farm bill because it contains tax \nprovisions that, presumably, the White House does not like.\n\n[[Page S13976]]\n\n  I would like to give a justification for the provisions that are in \nthis bill. I think everybody in this body would agree we need to \nprovide an adequate safety net for our family farmers. In recent years, \nhowever, assistance to farmers has come under increased scrutiny. The \nlargest corporate farms are reaping the majority of the benefits of the \nfarm payment program. These payments were originally designed to \nbenefit our small- and medium-sized farmers but instead have \ncontributed to the demise of the small- and medium-sized family \nfarmers. I believe we need to correct our course and modify the farm \nprograms before those programs cause further concentration and \nconsolidation in agriculture.\n  Today, most commodities are valued off demand, and the market \ndictates profitability. When farmers overproduce by planning for the \nfarm program or expand rapidly because of the security of those \nprograms, then the markets are not functioning. Unlimited farm payments \nhave placed upward pressure on land prices and have contributed to \noverproduction and lower commodity prices.\n  I am going to refer to a series of charts that I have. Increased land \nprices and cash rents are driving family farmers and making it \ndifficult, particularly for young farmers, to get into family farming--\nsomething that is probably there because for generations families have \nbeen farming sometimes the same land.\n  For instance, in Iowa, you can see how the value of farmland has very \ndramatically increased, particularly very recently. Around my hometown \nof New Hartford, IA, land is selling somewhere between the poor land at \n$4,000 an acre and the very best land for $6,000 an acre. In my home \ncounty of Butler, the value of an acre is up 64 percent since 2000. \nAcross the entire State of Iowa, the average land value per acre rose \n72 percent just in the last 6 years.\n  You will see from the next chart that the average typical cash rent \nper acre in Iowa rose 25 percent in that same timeframe. So you can \nlegitimately ask, how are family farmers, particularly young farmers \nwho cannot buy land and who have to rent land, going to survive when \nthey have had such a rapid increase in either the price of land, on the \none hand, or cash rents on the other hand? How are they even going to \nbe able to get into farming for the very first start?\n  I have been hearing directly from producers for years what former \nSecretary Johanns heard in the series of farm meetings. I think either \nthe Secretary, or his staff, had well over 100 hearings on proposed \nfarm legislation prior to--well, during the years 2005 and 2006. So I \nhave heard what Secretary Johanns has heard in his farm bill forums: \nYoung farmers cannot carry on the tradition of farming because they are \nfinancially unable to do so because of high land values and cash rents.\n  What does all this have to do with farm programs? I am going to quote \na famous and well-known Midwestern agricultural economist, Dr. Neil \nHarl, now emeritus. He came out with a report on this subject. He is \nand was at Iowa State University. The report states:\n\n       The evidence is convincing that a significant portion of \n     the subsidies are being bid into cash rents and capitalized \n     into land values. If investors were to expect less Federal \n     funding--or none at all--land values would likely decline, \n     perhaps by as much as 25 percent.\n\n  So here we have an article from last year's Washington Post, when the \nPost did a series of articles on the disparity that farm program \nsupports are causing. They reported:\n\n       The largest farms' share of agricultural production has \n     climbed from 32 percent to 45 percent, while the number of \n     small and medium-sized farms has tumbled from 42 percent to \n     27 percent.\n\n  I assume the printing on the chart is so small that you will have to \ntake my word for it that is what it says. The law creates a system that \nis clearly out of balance.\n  If we look at the results posted here, we have a system where 10 \npercent of the biggest farmers get 73 percent of the benefits from the \ntax-supported farm programs. Worse yet--or more extraordinary, I should \nsay--the top 1 percent get almost 30 percent of all of those payments. \nI tend to concentrate on the top 10 percent of the biggest farmers \ngetting 73 percent. But I think this other top 1 percent of--how do you \nsay it--the big farmers, the top 1 percent are getting 30 percent of \nall of the benefits out of the Treasury. So we are back where we were 5 \nyears ago.\n  This body passed as part of the farm bill, by a vote of 66 to 31, \nputting limits on farm payments. Well, it didn't survive a House-Senate \nconference. Senator Dorgan and I were working together then, and here \nwe are back 5 years later. The farm bill is up for reauthorization, and \nwe are filing an amendment that, I believe, will help revitalize the \nfarm economy for young people across this country.\n  This amendment that Senator Dorgan put before the Senate this \nmorning--actually, Senator Reid did it for Senator Dorgan--will put a \nhard cap on farm payments at $250,000. No less important, it will close \nthe loophole that has allowed large operations to avoid even the \nexisting $360,000 limit and, as a result, receive benefits far \nexceeding the limit.\n  If I could say that another way, we have a situation where we do have \ncaps in place, but there is legal subterfuge to get around those caps. \nOne of them is the three-entity rule--split up your farming operation \ninto three entities, and each one of those could qualify for that \n$360,000 limit.\n  The other one is where generic certificates are used. Those are not \nincluded in the limit. So that is why you read where some farmers are \ngetting millions of dollars through the farm program.\n  We use the adjective, hard cap; $250,000 is the absolute limit. We do \naway with the legal subterfuge of getting around the cap to make it so \nit works and so it is effective.\n  I have another article by the Washington Post from last year \noutlining the ongoing abuse of farm support programs. It is entitled \n``Farm Program Pays $1.3 Billion to People who Don't Farm.'' We are \npaying $1.3 billion to people who are not actively engaged in the \nbusiness of farming. Senator Dorgan spoke better about this last night \nand this morning and gave better examples than I can on that point. We \nhave examples of people who live on land collecting direct payments \nbecause a commodity was once grown on that land. Any agricultural use, \nincluding having a horse on that land, qualifies them for a direct \npayment, even though they are not even growing a crop.\n  Our bill addresses these problems by doing away with the loopholes \npeople have abused over the years to continue to get the payments. I \nhave already referred to the three-entity rule. We also put in place a \nsystem we call direct attribution. Most importantly, we tighten up what \nis already in the law but not enforced by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, that you have to be ``actively engaged'' in the business \nof farming.\n  I wish to make a very clear distinction. Some Members of the Senate \nhave advocated that the Dorgan-Grassley amendment is not as tough as \nwhat is in the Senate Agriculture Committee bill before us. I wish to \nexplain why that is not true.\n  I have another chart. We have to compare apples to apples. Saying the \ncommittee has a hard cap on payments at $200,000 is not accurate. They \nonly have a hard cap on two categories of payments: direct payments and \ncountercyclical payments. The Dorgan-Grassley amendment actually caps \nthose at $100,000.\n  In addition, my amendment will cap marketing loan gains at $150,000, \nwhile the committee bill before us that the Dorgan-Grassley changes \nleaves the marketing loan unlimited in the amount of money you can get \nthrough the marketing loan.\n  This actually weakens current law, and if you can believe, after all \nthe bad publicity about 10 percent of the biggest farmers getting 72 or \n73 percent of the benefits out of the farm program, why, the \nAgriculture Committee might write a bill that actually weakens current \nlaw. But I wish to make clear our bill at $250,000 is a hard cap, and \nit is more effective in taking care of this issue of the biggest 10 \npercent getting 73 percent of the benefits.\n  I anticipate there will be other votes on other types of reforms, \nincluding even means testing, also known as the adjusted gross income \nlimit. I wish to make sure my colleagues are aware\n\n[[Page S13977]]\n\nthat an adjusted gross income cap and a hard cap on payments are two \nvery different things and each should be looked at and considered \nindividually.\n  Back in 2002--and I referred to this before, that Senator Dorgan and \nI have been working together--back in 2002, I voted against the farm \nbill out of conference committee. A lack of payment limits in that bill \nbecause it was lost in conference, the Senate position was lost to the \nHouse position, was one of my reasons for voting against the bill.\n  I have been fighting to reduce large-scale subsidies since I was a \nMember of the House of Representatives in the 1970s. Then we were, \nbelieve it or not, arguing over a $50,000 limitation.\n  Our amendment produces some considerable savings. Senator Dorgan and \nI have identified very critical and essential programs to help \nproducers and farmers, small business owners, conservationists, and \nlow-income people, including seniors and children. We support beginning \nfarmer and rancher programs and the Rural Microenterprise Program. \nThese programs are crucial to bolstering young farmers and to helping \nmain streets across America.\n  It will also provide funds for the organic cost-share program and the \nfarmers Market Promotion Program. These growing components of our food \nsupply system will create new opportunities for farmers and increase \nhealthy food options for our consumers.\n  A large priority of mine has always been seeing justice for Black \nfarmers--discrimination cases brought against the USDA, but not \neverybody eligible got in on it. This amendment puts some money, double \nthe amount provided by the committee, in for late filers under the \nPigford consent decree for farmers who haven't gotten a chance for \ntheir claims to be heard. It is time to make it right for these farmers \nwho were discriminated against in their attempts to get help from the \nFederal Government in farming.\n  We also support the Grasslands Reserve Program and the Farmland \nProtection Program with additional dollars. Conserving our natural \nresources is one of the most important components of agriculture, and \nthis investment will make a substantial difference in the availability \nof these programs.\n  Finally, while the Agriculture Committee makes significant \ncontributions to the nutrition and food assistance programs, they were \nnot able to go far enough due to tight budget constraints. So Dorgan-\nGrassley adds money to this program so it can be adjusted for inflation \nand other nutrition priorities to assist low-income seniors, as well as \nchildren.\n  I worked with Senator Dorgan on a similar measure, as I have said for \nthe third time, in 2002, and it passed with bipartisan support by a \nvote of 66 to 31. Unfortunately, it was stripped out of conference. My \ncolleagues might remember the last time we had a vote on payment limits \nwas on the budget resolution. Many of my colleagues said they agreed \nwith what we were trying to do, but they voted against us at that \nparticular time because they said doing it on the budget resolution in \nthe middle of a farm bill authorization of 5 years was not the right \ntime. Everybody said it needed to be done the next time the farm bill \ncame up for debate.\n  Well, that time is right now, and I ask those who maybe thought it \nshouldn't be done on the budget resolution a couple years ago to \nremember what they said. They came up to us individually and said: We \nagree with what you are trying to do, but it shouldn't be in the middle \nof the farm bill reauthorization, and it shouldn't be done on the \nbudget resolution. The inference was they will be with us at the right \ntime. The time is right now, or within the next 24 hours, when we vote \non this amendment.\n\n  I remind this body that in addition to what was said by our \ncolleagues at that particular time, in the last farm bill, we set up, \nas supposedly a sop for those of us who didn't get what we wanted in \npayment limitations out of conference 5 years ago, a commission on the \napplication of payment limitations for agriculture.\n  This commission was set up, and for a couple years they studied this \nissue. The purpose was to conduct a study on the potential need for \nfurther payment limitations on farm programs. The commission met. \nFarmers, agricultural economists--I can't think of everybody who was on \nit, but they knew the business of agriculture. This commission \nrecommended the very same loophole-closing measures which we included \nin this amendment that is now before the Senate. Those people who \nthought they threw us a sop or some sort of a compromise that we ought \nto accept a commission instead of the real hard change in law to \naccomplish what we wanted to accomplish, that we would have people \nstudy it and then give some respectability to it, or maybe they thought \nwe would forget about it and go away 5 years later, we haven't \nforgotten about it; we haven't gone away.\n  We are taking the recommendations of this commission that was set up \nto say what we ought to do in the area of payment limitations, and we \nare doing exactly what they said. We not only have the promise of those \npeople who said it shouldn't be done on the budget resolution, we have \nthe recommendations of all these experts of how it ought to be done, \nwhen it ought to be done, and why it ought to be done. It is for all \nthose reasons that we have Dorgan and Grassley back again suggesting \nwhat we thought should have been done 5 years ago. If it had been done \n5 years ago, we wouldn't have this problem of 10 percent of the biggest \nfarmers getting 73 percent of the benefits out of the farm program.\n  There are several problems connected with that situation. One, when \nurban people read about this, they are going to say: Why do you need a \nfarm safety net if all the help is going to biggest farmers? So we lose \nurban support. We lose support of a farm program in the House of \nRepresentatives controlled by urban people, and we don't have a farm \nsafety net, and family farmers don't have the ability to withstand a \nlot of situations that are beyond their control. We also have a \nsituation where we drive up the price of farmland so the next \ngeneration of farmers cannot get started. But also, we depart from the \nprinciple of a farm safety net of the last 70 years that was supposed \nto be directed to medium- and small-sized farmers, the very same people \nwho produce the food we eat in a way so consumers spend less of their \nincome on food than any other society anywhere on this globe, and to \nkeep them strong when they cannot withstand natural disasters or the \npolitics of agriculture or a war or energy problems. They don't have \nthe staying power, but the larger farmers do.\n  For 70 years, we have directed the benefit of a farm program, until \nvery recently, to small- and medium-sized farmers. How it gets out of \nwhack so we get 10 percent of the biggest farmers getting 73 percent of \nthe benefits of the program is hard to explain. But it has happened, \nand we are trying to get back to the original purpose of farm programs \nto help small- and medium-sized farmers over the hurdles they have to \ncross, through no fault of their own, situations they cannot control, \nthat larger farmers have the ability to have a little more staying \npower.\n  So here we are. By voting in favor of the Dorgan-Grassley amendment, \nwe can allow young people to get into farming and lessen dependence on \nFederal subsidies. This will help restore public respectability for \nFederal farm assistance by targeting this assistance to those who need \nit the most.\n  So let us quit dragging our feet and let us pass real reform with a \nreal payment for real farmers. I call upon my colleagues to support \nthis commonsense legislation that is referred to as Dorgan-Grassley.\n  I told you, Mr. President, in my opening remarks that I wished to \naddress a second issue as well, directly related to the farm bill, but \nincluding some issues that are a little bit broader than the farm bill, \nand that deals with the tax policy.\n  Remember, a very significant part of this farm bill is tax policy \nthat we in the Finance Committee--Senator Baucus, me, and the other 19 \nmembers of the committee--set up that are directly related to soil \nconservation and drought relief, and we raise revenue to pay for it. In \nthe process of this broad policy, we have freed up money the \nAgriculture Committee would otherwise spend on a lot of programs, such \nas disaster relief and conservation, so the Agriculture Committee would \nhave a little more leeway to do what needs to be done in farm policy, \nand that is directly related to the fact that under the budget adopted \nby this Congress,\n\n[[Page S13978]]\n\nwe find the Agriculture Committee $15 billion under benchmark, and that \nis a big bite to swallow with the needs in American agriculture. So we \nhave come up with, in the Finance Committee, a little bit of help for \nthe Agriculture Committee.\n\n  As recently as yesterday, the President, or his people, have \nsuggested because of the tax policy that is in this bill, they might \nveto the whole farm bill. I want to tell the President why that is a \ncrazy idea--a crazy idea--so I will take the time to comment, then, on \nthe revenue raisers that are in this farm bill.\n  The revenue raiser is a proposal to clarify a judicial doctrine in \nthe tax law known as the economic substance doctrine. I am here not so \nmuch to justify revenue raising through this definition of economic \nsubstance, but I am here to say there are four circuit courts of appeal \nin different parts of the country that have had four different \ndecisions on economic substance and each has said Congress ought to \ndefine economic substance. So as far as I am concerned, in putting \neconomic substance in here, it is not just to raise revenue and to have \nan offset for the programs we have set up, it is for Congress to do the \njob of making the Tax Code on economic substance clear so the courts \nare not defining it, and most importantly so that four different courts \naren't defining it in four different ways. We need to have some \ncertainty, and this bill brings that certainty to the definition of \neconomic substance.\n  But before I get into that, I have to be a little more general. For a \nlot of folks, this proposal may sound like an esoteric tax policy \nmatter, and they might wonder why I am focusing on it today. The reason \nis the White House has indicated the President will veto the farm bill \nif this proposal is included in the bill sent to the President's desk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Washington Post article reporting on the President's suggested veto \nof the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From washingtonpost.com, Nov. 6, 2007]\n\n                  Bush Vows To Veto Senate's Farm Bill\n\n                            (By Dan Morgan)\n\n       The Bush administration, setting the stage for another \n     confrontation with Congress over a major spending measure, \n     issued a veto threat yesterday against the Senate version of \n     the $288 billion farm bill.\n       The announcement came as a disappointment to bipartisan \n     Senate supporters, who had hoped the farm legislation avoided \n     some of the pitfalls that prompted a similar veto threat this \n     summer against a House-passed version.\n       But in a news briefing held as Senate debate began \n     yesterday, acting Agriculture Secretary Charles F. Conner \n     charged that the five-year legislation had been inflated by \n     $37 billion through the use of ``tax increases and budget \n     gimmicks.''\n       ``It will need significant changes. . . . We have a long \n     way to go,'' he said. Conner said details of the \n     administration critique will be issued shortly in the hope \n     that they ``will impel Congress to work with us.''\n       Despite the enormous congressional popularity of the bill--\n     which funds farm subsidy programs, food stamps, environmental \n     programs and biofuels research--the administration believes \n     it can sustain a veto by rallying Republicans against tax \n     provisions used to fund some of the new outlays.\n       Conner charged that the bill's funding depends on $15 \n     billion in new taxes and added that ``we don't believe other \n     sectors should pay'' so that farm subsidies can go to \n     ``millionaires living on Park Avenue.''\n       Most House Republicans voted against that chamber's version \n     of the bill in July after Democrats offset new spending on \n     nutrition programs by tightening tax rules on U.S. \n     subsidiaries of foreign companies. Democrats said they were \n     merely closing a loophole, but Republicans and the White \n     House branded it a tax increase.\n       The Senate version, which includes a new $5.1 billion fund \n     that farmers could tap when hit by weather losses, would be \n     financed in part by a different set of measures clamping down \n     on tax-avoidance techniques used by business.\n       Conner also said the bill contains too little reform of \n     subsidies. He said the administration is dissatisfied that \n     the bill does not place stricter limits on subsidy payments \n     to rich farmers.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The title of that article is: ``Bush Vowed to Veto \nSenate's Farm Bill.''\n  Before I discuss the specifics of the economic substance doctrine, I \nwish to put this revenue raiser in context. We have heard a lot about \npay-go. That is short for pay as you go. If you want to spend money, \neither raise taxes to offset it or cut someplace else to offset it. Or \nif you want to cut taxes, raise taxes someplace else to pay for it or \ncut spending someplace else to pay for the tax decrease. But around \nhere we use the term pay-go for short.\n  Now, of course, pay-go was in place for many years before the current \npolicy was put into place after a few years of absence. The difference \nis the old version of pay-go applied it as a backstop to a budget \nresolution. So if a proposal spent more than the budget permitted and \nadded to the deficit, a pay-go point of order was possible. Likewise, \nif a proposal to cut taxes more than the amount of the revenue the \nbudget assumed would come in, pay-go would apply.\n  This year Congress is struggling because a rigid notion of pay-go has \nhamstrung the committees--meaning every committee of the Congress that \nprocesses revenue or spending policies. The rubber has hit the road \nwith pay-go here, more so at the end of the session than throughout the \nrest of 2007, and it has been a somewhat bumpy road for all of us. Of \ncourse, I think this road is even going to get bumpier as time goes on \nbetween now and Christmas.\n  As everyone knows, Congress has a lot of unfinished business. I am \ngoing to focus on the unfinished tax business. I have a chart here I \nwant to point to. It is a chart I have used before. This chart shows \nthe unfinished tax business that has got to come before the Congress \nbetween now and Christmas. It accounts for all the bills we passed out \nof the Finance Committee. It also accounts for the expiring provisions \nthat are known as tax extenders. The biggest item of the revenue loss \nchart is the alternative minimum tax and the fix for that alternative \nminimum tax so 19 million additional middle-income taxpayers and their \nfamilies are not paying the AMT. You see all of those various aspects \nlisted there separately--the 2007 AMT fix, 2008 AMT fix, 2008 \nextenders, the Energy bill that has already passed the Senate, the \nairport reauthorization bill, and then eventually we will spend some \ntime on the farm bill. But you can see they add up to a heck of a lot \nof money.\n  Since we are in the 2008 fiscal year, I have included then extenders \nfor 2008 and also carrying a fix for AMT for not only 2007 but 2008.\n  This chart accounts for the revenue loss from the farm bill package \nthat is there at $13 billion. My chart shows the revenue loss side as \ndemands on the water well there. It is at the top of the well in the \nbucket what the shortfall is there. There are a lot of thirsty bills \nthat have to be paid for. Those thirsty bills carry a revenue loss of \n$170 billion over 5 years.\n  I have accounted for the revenue offsets. This figure includes all \nrevenue raisers proposed by Senate Democrats that are specified and \nscored by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. That figure \nincludes $32 billion from the Finance Committee-approved proposals and \n$29 billion in other proposals. That total is $61 billion. That is what \nwe know for sure that has been thought up and probably has a great deal \nof support to accomplish.\n  This offset figure is calculated from the vantage point of the Senate \nDemocratic leadership. In this total are proposals that House Democrats \nhave opposed, such as shutting off the foreign subway leasing tax \nshelter, known as SILOS. In this total are proposals that most Senate \nRepublicans have opposed, such as the reimposition of the Superfund \ntaxes. In this total are many proposals that even the Bush \nadministration has come out against.\n  Now with this favorable assumption to them, the pay-go advocates in \nthe Senate need to know that as we stand here today, there is not \nenough known revenue to meet the pay-go requirements that are on this \nchart that obviously have to be dealt with between now and Christmas. \nIn other words, the demands on the revenue well are $170 billion, and \nthe available revenue raisers are only $61 billion. So that is a \nshortfall that is clear there, in the middle of the well--a shortfall \nof $109 billion. In other words, the revenue well is dry.\n  Now, $109 billion is a lot of money even here in Washington, DC. If \nthe proposals are scored over 10 years, that shortfall does narrow \nslightly, from $109 billion down to $76 billion, and it is\n\n[[Page S13979]]\n\npossible that some of the revenue raisers in Chairman Rangel's bill may \nbe pursued by the Senate Democratic leadership. But as it stands now, \nfor unfinished tax business alone, by this accounting, we cannot meet \nthe requirements that the Senate must meet that we call pay-go.\n  I point this out because everybody has to see this big picture. They \nseem to be missing the big picture on how we wrap up our overdue \nlegislative business and meet the demands of the new pay-go rules. On \nthe farm bill alone, my chart treats the farm bill as fully offset. My \nchart is created from the perspective of the Senate Democratic \nleadership, and so it shows the farm bill as offset. That is the way it \nis as it came out of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  The problem is that President Bush's opposition to the key revenue \nraiser is not accounted for in this chart. President Bush's position \ndoes matter. His opposition to any revenue raiser, but specifically \nthis one, would have to be overcome with a veto override. As my friends \nand the Democratic leadership know, that happens to be a very tough \nhurdle, as we have found out, for instance, on the Children's Health \nInsurance Program recently before the House of Representatives.\n  My point is it is time to get practical around here. This chart of \nthe water well shows that as we sit here today, looking at it from a \nSenate Democratic leadership perspective, the revenue well is dry. To \ninsist on pay-go without a sense of realistically available offsets is \ntrying to go up a blind alley. I say to my Democratic friends: At this \nlate point in the legislative session, let us focus on what is \npractical. Let us apply the offsets we can agree to and in a manner we \ncan agree on. We need to get to a posture of what can be agreed to by \nthe House, by Senate Republicans, and by the White House. The AMT fix \nis the 800-pound gorilla in this discussion. It is $55 billion of the \n$109 billion shortfall. It affects 23 million families and could affect \nadversely another 27 million families. The AMT fix is long overdue. It \nneeds to be completed expeditiously.\n  To address this important matter solely from a pay-go perspective is \nto ignore the realities that it needs to get done. Republicans are \nready, Republicans are willing, and Republicans are able to help get \nthis AMT fix done, and done very shortly, but for many reasons I have \ndiscussed all year, not at the price of offsets.\n  I will now go into the reasons why clarification of the economic \nsubstance doctrine is an appropriate revenue raiser and why it is basic \nto this farm bill before us, because it is a part of the farm bill; and \nwhy the President is crazy to use that as an excuse for vetoing the \nfarm bill.\n  The provision made the Finance Committee package revenue neutral, \nraising $10 billion over 10 years. But I support codification of \neconomic substance not just to raise revenue--although it does that, \nand it is important that it do that because otherwise we would not have \nour provisions offset, according to pay-go. As ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, and even when I was chairman in the last two \nCongresses, I have supported codification of economic substance because \nit is the right policy. This provision is an improved version of a \nprovision that passed the Finance Committee and the full Senate in the \nlast two Congresses.\n  The prior version was included in two bills passed by the full Senate \nin the 109th Congress, twice in the tax reconciliation bill, once in \n2005 by a vote of 64 to 33, and again in 2006 by a vote of 66 to 31. It \nalso passed the full Senate two times in the 108th Congress, once in \nthe 2003 tax bill by a vote of 51 to 49 and again in the 2004 JOBS bill \nby a vote of 92 to 5.\n  This Senate is acquainted with the need to codify economic substance \nfor us to do our job of making the Tax Code understandable so you do \nnot get four different circuit courts of appeal giving four different \ndefinitions to economic substance. We ought to have one national policy \non what is economic substance. Codifying it will clarify the test. It \nis a conjunctiva test requiring both a meaningful change in economic \nposition and a business purpose, independent of Federal taxes. The \ncourts are split on whether a transaction must have both economic \nsubstance as well as business purpose. This will give courts, then, a \nuniform doctrine to apply to noneconomic transactions that are \ninappropriately motivated solely to avoid Federal taxes--in other \nwords, closing loopholes.\n  It will also ensure that a court will not overturn the doctrine, as a \ntrial judge did in what is called the Coltec case, saying:\n\n       The use of the economic substance doctrine to trump the \n     mere compliance with the Code would violate the separation of \n     powers.\n\n  That judge--I don't have to say that judge was crazy because the \ncourt of appeals reversed that judge's decision. But I am still \nconcerned that another strict constructionist judge might reach a \nsimilar conclusion. Most important, codifying the economic substance \ndoctrine will provide an additional deterrent against taxpayers \nentering into transactions solely for tax purposes, in ways that are \ninconsistent with congressional intent.\n  As I said earlier, this provision is an improved version of what has \nalready passed the Finance Committee and the full Senate more than \nonce. So this Senate agrees with economic substance. But maybe Senators \nhave forgotten how they voted 2 and 3 and maybe 5 years ago, so I am \nhere to remind them this has been overwhelmingly accepted by the full \nSenate.\n  This improved version has modifications made in response to concerns \nof taxpayers that codification would throw legitimate tax planning into \nquestion and allow the IRS to substitute its business judgment for that \nof the taxpayers. I am going to talk about those modifications so \npeople understand, and all these lawyers in this town who are concerned \nabout our writing this, that they know we have taken some of their \nlegitimate concerns into consideration.\n  For instance, the strict liability nature of the penalty has been \nretained in order to effectively deter taxpayers from entering into \ntax-motivated transactions in unintended ways. Indeed, according to the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, the bulk of the revenue score is \nattributable to this strict liability penalty--not because the IRS will \ncollect the penalty but because people are going to start obeying the \nlaw and change their behavior. The penalty will alter taxpayer \nbehavior. It will cause taxpayers to forego entering into noneconomic, \ntax-motivated transactions that Congress never intended.\n  We have heard complaints that a strict liability penalty will cause \nIRS field agents to overreach and courts to be reluctant to apply the \ndoctrine. These are serious concerns, and we have addressed those \nconcerns by requiring the IRS to nationally coordinate through the \nChief Counsel's Office when the penalty is asserted and/or when it is \ncompromised. This procedure is similar to a process currently used by \nthe IRS to designate cases for litigation.\n  As a protective measure, taxpayers will be permitted to make their \ncase to the IRS at the national level before a penalty is asserted. Of \ncourse, cases involving the economic substance doctrine should be going \nthrough Chief Counsel anyway, and taxpayers currently have the ability \nto persuade the IRS not to assert a penalty. But because of the strict \nliability nature of this penalty, it is important to formalize this \nprocess and move it to a higher level of review.\n  Getting the Chief Counsel's Office involved earlier in this \ncontroversy will help taxpayers and the IRS resolve or make litigation \ndecisions regarding tax shelters earlier.\n  We have also lowered the penalty for undisclosed transactions from 40 \npercent to 30 percent to bring it in line with the penalty on \nundisclosed listed transactions.\n  The proposal to codify economic substance has been controversial, \neven though it has passed the Finance Committee and the full Senate in \nthe last two Congresses. Taxpayers and practitioners expressed \nlegitimate concerns about it. We have addressed those concerns--maybe \nnot in the way everybody wants, but I think we have done it in a \nresponsible way.\n  As a general matter, in my tenure as chairman of the Finance \nCommittee before we went into the minority this year, I am proud to \nhave kept taxes down. During my tenure, we enacted bipartisan tax \nrelief bills that totaled over $2 trillion over 10 years. So for\n\n[[Page S13980]]\n\ncritics who look at any change in the Tax Code, regardless of how \nlegitimate it is, even regardless of not doing it for revenue-raising \nmeasures--they look at everything and say: You are changing the Tax \nCode; you are raising taxes--I am here to tell them on this issue of \neconomic substance how ridiculous that is. So for the critics of this \nrevenue raiser, I would refer them to my record of keeping taxes down.\n\n  By the way, for those on the liberal side of the political spectrum, \nI point out, as a percentage of GDP, the Federal Treasury is taking in \na percentage that is above the post-World War II average.\n  Codifying the economic substance doctrine should be considered on its \nmerits. It should not be dismissed because it scores as a revenue \nraiser. It should not be endorsed either because it scores as a revenue \nraiser. In my view, it should be enacted because it is the right tax \npolicy. Folks need to take off the bean-counting green eyeshades and \nlook at the tax policy.\n  The same goes for the long overdue AMT fix that I have talked about. \nIt is not about maximizing Federal revenues. It is about fair taxation \nfor 19 million middle-income families.\n  I am done, Mr. President, but I want to digress for one minute for \nthe benefit of faceless bureaucrats down at the White House. I want to \ntalk to those people who maybe were advising the President, and they \nput it in his veto message, that one of the reasons he was vetoing the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program is because our bill allowed \nfamilies earning up to $83,000 to have their children in a government \nprogram--when quite obviously most people making that kind of income \ncan have health insurance. What I have said to those very same people \nwho put that in the President's message is it was not in our bill; that \nStates could do that. That has been in the law for 10 years. But nobody \npointed that out to the President. Some stupid person said to the \nPresident: This bill allows people with $83,000 to get it. It didn't \nhave anything to do with that. It was in the law for 10 years.\n  I want those faceless bureaucrats to read why we are doing economic \nsubstance. It is about time Congress does its job and the courts don't \ndo the job we are supposed to do. Four circuit courts of appeal have \ndefined and found fault with various aspects of economic substance. \nThey said it is time for Congress to define it.\n  Yes, it is a revenue raiser, but it is not one of these changes in \ntax policy that is a change in rates of taxation that you can \nlegitimately call tax increases. But somebody down there at the White \nHouse is telling the President this is a tax increase. What we are \ntrying to do is do our job. This cannot be a reason for vetoing the \nfarm bill.\n  If anybody down at the White House wants to discuss my rationale for \nthis, come up and I will sit down and talk with them, or I will even go \ndown there if they want to talk about it.\n  I yield the floor. I guess nobody else wants to speak, so I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, within the past few weeks a series of \nevents has occurred that can help shed light on how tax relief enacted \nin the past 7 years has impacted the budget of the United States. On \nSeptember 27, the Senate voted to increase the debt limit so the \nTreasury would be able to borrow enough to meet our Nation's \nobligations. At the time, I made a statement that this was necessary. \nThe proper place to take a stand for fiscal responsibility is when we \nare considering bills that spend money and actually create our debt.\n  Unfortunately, some of my colleagues believe the only answer to our \nbudget woes is to increase taxes. But I believe this point of view is \nmisguided and would prove destructive to our budget in the long term. \nEspecially over the past 7 years, discussion of an increase in debt \nlimit has prompted excitable statements from my colleagues across the \naisle on the current administration's fiscal record. I am sure I do not \nhave to say these statements from across the aisle have not been \npositive.\n  Another event I want to mention is the release on October 5, 2007, of \nthe Monthly Budget Review from the Congressional Budget Office. The \nCongressional Budget Office budget review forecasts that the deficit \nfor fiscal year 2007 would be significantly smaller than the deficit \nfor 2006, and then the Final Monthly Treasury Statement, published by \nthe Treasury Financial Management Service, confirmed that. According to \nthe U.S. Treasury, the Federal deficit for fiscal 2007 was $162.8 \nbillion. The deficit for 2006, the year before, was considerably \nhigher, at $248.2 billion. The deficit for 2007 then is around $85 \nbillion less than it was last year.\n  The chart I am going to show you, taken from Treasury documents, \nshows how this decrease in the deficit has been driven by a 6.7-percent \nestimated increase in total receipts over fiscal year 2006.\n  If you are determined to show that tax relief has led to less revenue \nfrom the Federal Government, then this data is difficult to explain. Of \ncourse, the conventional criticism offered against tax relief was that \nit was going to be directly responsible for massive increases in the \ndeficit. This argument implies that as a result of tax relief, the \nFederal Government would collect less money in taxes.\n  On May 23, 2003, the Senate voted to agree to a conference report to \naccompany the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. \nThe vote was close. The conference report was agreed to only because \nthe Vice President cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of the report. \nAnyone who reviews the Congressional Record of that debate would see \nthat the rollcall vote was preceded by a very contentious discussion. \nMany of my colleagues had very strong criticism of the bill which, \namong other things, reduced the rates for capital gains and dividends.\n  Tax policy generally is not seen as something that attracts a lot of \nexcitement, but the floor debate of May 23, 2003, could have given a \nlistener the impression the sky was falling.\n  This chart of Chicken Little reporting that the sky is falling \nillustrates the tone of some of the criticism made by my colleagues.\n  One Senator claimed:\n\n       The tax base of the Federal Government is being destroyed.\n\n  This same Senator referred to the bill as:\n\n       One of the most dangerous, destructive and dishonorable \n     acts of Government that I have ever seen.\n\n  Another one of my colleagues claimed that the bill:\n\n       Is about helping the elite few with large tax cuts while \n     burdening the majority of Americans with huge debt.\n\n  Here again, you see the implication that the 2003 tax relief was \ngoing to diminish revenues collected by the Federal Government.\n  A third colleague claimed:\n\n       This bill I call the policy of the three Ds. This is the \n     policy of debt, deficits and decline.\n\n  This comment is especially interesting when examining a statement \nmade by this very same Senator on September 27 of this year during the \ndiscussion on increasing the statutory limit on the public debt. That \nsame Senator said at that time that:\n\n       Revenue has been basically stagnant in this country for 6 \n     years.\n\n  According to my colleagues in the Congressional Budget Office, \nrevenues in 2000 were $2 trillion, just a hair over $2 trillion, while \nrevenues in 2007 were calculated by the Treasury to be around $2.12 \ntrillion, taking into consideration inflation.\n  First, I wish to point out that the word ``stagnant'' used by my \ncolleague is a far cry from the debt, deficit, and decline that tax \nrelief was supposed to inflict on this Nation. I am not saying we do \nnot have a massive national debt fed by successive budget deficits, but \nthe specific tax relief enacted in 2003 and again within the past 7 \nyears is not the cause of that.\n  As my esteemed colleague pointed out, even accounting for inflation, \nthe revenues of the Federal Government are projected to be greater in \n2007 than they were in 2000. So this certainly shows that our tax base \nwas not gutted by tax relief as was so profoundly asserted by my \ncolleagues.\n  I also would like to say that I do not think that $90 billion is a \ntrifling\n\n[[Page S13981]]\n\namount of money. Maybe it is to some people in some places, but it is \ncertainly not for us people, for the Iowa farmer.\n  To offer a different perspective, let's consider this year's \nappropriations bills. The Democratic leadership wants to spend $23 \nbillion more than the President's budget on appropriations. That same \ngroup is preparing to force a showdown with the President over that $23 \nbillion. That is one-fourth of the amount I am talking about here. So \nwhen it comes to spending, extra dollars do count, but extra revenue \nfrom lower levels of taxation is to be belittled no matter what the \nnumber might be. It just sounds so inconsistent.\n  My excitable colleagues here in the Senate are not the only ones who \npredicted gloom and doom that never came because of the tax relief in \nAugust of 2003. Even the Congressional Budget Office published a \ndocument titled ``The Budget and Economic Outlook: An Update.'' The \nbill reducing rates on capital gains and dividends had become law at \nthe end of May, so the Congressional Budget Office was able to take tax \nrelief into account as they conjured their budget projections. This \nchart right here illustrates the discrepancy between what was forecast \nby the Congressional Budget Office in the summer of 2003 and what \nactually transpired. You can see the red line actual figure is way \nabove the blue line that was suggested by the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  In August of 2003, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the \nFederal Government would collect about $1,770 billion in revenue. \nAccording to the historical budget data--also from the CBO--revenue in \n2003 was actually about $1,783 billion. That difference is $13 billion. \nNow, $13 billion may be peanuts to some people, but I think it is a \ngood start.\n  In August 2003, the Congressional Budget Office projected Federal \nrevenues for 2003 to be $2,276 billion. Actually in 2003, Federal \nrevenues were about $2,407 billion. The Federal Government collected, \nthen, $131 billion more in 2006 than was originally forecast in the \ndark days of 2003, when several of my Democratic colleagues thought \nthat tax relief was poised to destroy our tax base. Revenues actually \ncollected were higher than projected when considered as a percentage of \ngross domestic product.\n  In August 2003, CBO projected that revenues in 2006 would be 18.2 \npercent of GDP. Actual revenues collected in 2006 were more than that--\nat 18.4 percent compared to 18.2 percent of GDP. In 2005, they were \n17.6 percent; in 2004, they were 16.3 percent; and in 2003, they were \n16.5 percent. After a small downturn in 2004, Federal revenues, taken \nin proportion, increased faster than the GDP.\n  Speaking of its 2007 projection, in an October 2007 monthly budget \nrevenue, CBO states:\n\n       Revenues rose to 18.8 percent of GDP, which is slightly \n     higher than the average of 18.2 percent over the past 40 \n     years.\n\n  Even with lower taxes, the Federal Government is collecting, on \naverage, a greater percentage of GDP in revenue year by year than it \nhas over the past four decades.\n  Incidentally, in 2003, CBO projected that revenues would equal 18.3 \npercent of GDP in 2007.\n  Next, I want to compare the 4-year period after the 2003 tax relief \nplan went into effect with the 4-year period after the tax increases \nwere enacted in the Clinton first year, 1993.\n  The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, signed into law by the \nPresident in August of that year, increased taxes on corporations and \nindividuals while increasing taxes on gasoline and raising the taxable \nportion of Social Security benefits.\n  I think this may be counterintuitive to some people, especially to \nthose who believe that the well-being of our Nation is directly \nproportional to our ability to seize income from taxpayers, but as a \npercentage of GDP, Federal revenues increased faster after tax relief \nthan they did after tax increases.\n  To set the stage, in 1993, Federal revenues were 17.5 percent of \ngross domestic product. In 2003, Federal revenues were a percent less \nat 16.5 percent of GDP.\n  By the way, all of these numbers are Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers, and until I get to 2007, they are not projections.\n  If you look at this chart we are now putting up, you can see that as \na percentage of GDP, Federal revenues increased faster in the 4 years \nafter the 2003 tax relief than they did after the 1993 tax increase. \nLet me emphasize that. Revenues came in faster after we decreased taxes \nin 2003 than they did after 1993 when we increased the taxes.\n  For 1997, Federal revenues were 19.3 percent of GDP. Between 1993 and \n1997, Federal revenues increased by 1.8 percent of GDP.\n  Now, in 2007, Federal revenues are projected by the Congressional \nBudget Office to be 18.8 percent of GDP. If this is the case, then over \nthe past 4 years, Federal revenues will have increased by 2.3 percent, \nand 1.8 percent subtracted from that 2.3 percent leaves one-half of a \npercent. The tax relief enacted in 2003 grew Federal revenues by one-\nhalf of a percentage point more than the tax hikes of 1993 in the 4 \nyears following each.\n  I like to emphasize this because I think that it just--too many \npeople see it as common sense that if you raise tax rates, you are \ngoing to bring in more revenue; if you lower tax rates, you are going \nto bring in less revenue. But I just showed that tax increases under \nClinton did not bring in as much revenue as tax decreases in this \nadministration. They brought in more revenue. So I would like to \ndisabuse people of the fact that increasing rates brings in more \nrevenue and decreasing rates brings in less revenue.\n  What is also important is that as a percentage of GDP, revenues were \nhigher in 1997 than they will be this year. In my opinion, they were \ntoo high.\n  The point that I am making is that the rate of change in revenues as \na percentage of GDP has so far been greater after tax relief than after \na tax hike. I think it is very important, especially for those who \nreflexively believe that the only way for the Federal Government to \nraise more money is to confiscate more income from taxpayers. Clearly, \nthat view is false.\n  To conclude, let me summarize the current budget situation.\n  Right now, taxes are lower than they would have been under Democratic \nrule. I want to make it clear that I am not saying that no Democrats \nsupported any tax relief. Some Democrats voted for the 2003 tax relief \nplan, and many more voted for the 2000 tax relief plan. However, I am \nskeptical that a Democratic Congress or White House would have allowed \ntaxpayers to keep so much of their own money.\n  The budget deficit is shrinking, and Federal revenues are increasing. \nAnyone who finds fault with this situation is determined to do nothing \nbut simply find fault. They would probably be unable to enjoy a sunny \nday because they would constantly be on the lookout for storm clouds \nregardless of what the forecast said. There is a problem with debt and \nwith Federal budget deficits, but tax increases are the wrong way to \napproach that problem.\n  We have a Federal budget deficit because the Federal Government \nspends too much money, and the best way to get rid of deficits is to \nspend less. Consequently, raising taxes makes the situation worse by \npunishing the overall economy and making conditions more difficult for \nthe economy--the source of Federal revenues--to function efficiently. \nWe have to remember that our economy supports the Government and not \nthe other way around. The budget data I have discussed today shows how \nwe can increase revenues and reduce deficits by removing impediments to \neconomic efficiency and allowing our economy to flourish.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate everyone's patience. The \nRepublican leader and I have been doing our best.

I was not \nalone, and since that time 38 States have either introduced or passed \nlegislation opposing the law. Seventeen States have enacted laws in \nopposition. I have joined Senators Akaka, Sununu, Tester, Baucus, and \nAlexander in introducing legislation to repeal the driver's license \nprovisions of the law and to replace them with the negotiated \nrulemaking process that had been originally enacted in the 2004 \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act. That bill, which REAL \nID superseded, was intended to improve the security of State driver's \nlicenses through a cooperative partnership with the States and the \nprivate sector.\n  The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on May 8 of this year to \nexamine whether the REAL ID Act is actually an effective way to improve \nour security. I agreed with many at the hearing who argued that the \nREAL ID Act was not an effective way to improve identity security, and \nthe sacrifices Americans would be compelled to make in their personal \nprivacy were unacceptable. All agreed more could and should be done to \nensure the integrity of identification documents, but many cautioned \nthat the REAL ID Act is not the most effective way to do it.\n  Opposition to the REAL ID Act has been bipartisan and widespread \namong the States and many Federal lawmakers. In addition to the \nenormous financial burdens placed on the States, the law raises serious \nprivacy concerns about the Federal Government's interference in a \nresponsibility traditionally left to the State. Proponents of the law \nproclaim it is not a national ID card. But when the Federal Government \nbegins directing how a State driver's license is issued, what \ncharacteristics the card must have, and conditioning access to Federal \nbuildings and airplanes on possession of a REAL ID card, it is \ndifficult to think this is anything but the first, big step toward a \nnational identification card that so many Americans oppose.\n  But the reality of the dissatisfaction among the American people is \ncatching up with the administration. The Washington Post recently \nreported that Secretary Chertoff is expected to announce yet another \ndelay for REAL ID's implementation deadline. Secretary Chertoff \npreviously waived the May 2008 compliance deadline and set a new target \nof 2013 for nationwide compliance. Now Secretary Chertoff will \nreportedly extend this date to 2018 for drivers who are older than 40 \nor 50, and officials have said the Government will not bar those not \npossessing a REAL ID license from Federal facilities and airplanes.\n  Despite being faced with determined opposition from the States and \nmany Members of Congress, the administration still refuses to \nreconsider implementation of the law and is ignoring the pleas of the \nStates. Without buy-in from the States and the American people, this \nprogram is doomed to failure. Delaying the inevitable by pushing back \ndeadlines is not the way we will improve identity security. Had the \nnegotiated rulemaking provisions enacted in the 2004 Intelligence \nReform and Terrorist Prevention Act been left intact, meaningful \nidentity security improvements could already be underway. \nUnfortunately, instead of addressing the fundamental problems this law \nposes for the States, the administration appears content merely to \nprolong a contentious and unproductive battle to force the States to \ncomply. Rather than improved security, this course will result in \nresentment, litigation, and enormous costs that States will be forced \nto absorb. The administration would do much better to treat the States \nas partners and forgo the paternalistic mandates that the American \npeople are rejecting. That spirit of cooperation would result in much \ngreater security than the administration's go-it-alone strategy to \nforce compliance with another ill-conceived policy.\n  Like the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, the REAL ID Act \nrepresents precisely the big-government interference the President's \nparty claims to dislike. The American people are demanding that the \nFederal Government take a second look at the wisdom of charging ahead \nwith a national ID card, and the administration ought to listen \ncarefully to what many have been saying since this law was enacted, \nbefore more time is wasted trying to force this unpopular and \ncumbersome law on the citizens of the United States. I welcome all \nSenators to join me and the other cosponsors of S. 717 in rejecting the \nburdensome mandates of REAL ID and advocating for a better system of \nsecuring our fundamental identification documents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/06/senate-section/article/S13982-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13982-S13983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HATE CRIMES, BIGOTRY AND ANTI-SEMITISM\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I attended a hearing of the Helsinki \nCommission on the increase in anti-Semitism and extremist political \nparties in Europe.\n  I take a deep interest in hate crimes, bigotry, and anti-Semitism. In \nour society, these issues are mostly restricted to the political \nfringe. Nobody in this country would gain widespread electoral support \nfor the formation of an explicitly racist party. We are perhaps unique \nin that respect. In Europe, these parties are not only formed--they are \nprospering.\n  Today's hearing did much to highlight the rise of bigotry and \ndiscrimination in Europe. A number of experienced witnesses from the \nU.N., executive branch, and nonprofit sector described the political \nsituation in Europe today, and it is alarming. Across the continent, \nextremist groups are parading openly and gaining support. In Russia, \ntwo thousand supporters of a fascist organization rallied on November \n4, the country's National Day, to shout xenophobic and anti-Semitic \nslogans. Many gave the Hitler salute. This in Russia, which suffered \nmore from the aggression of Nazism than perhaps any other nation in the \nworld.\n  In Hungary last month, 600 people were sworn in as new members of the \nextremist, paramilitary ``Hungarian Guard,'' wearing uniforms similar \nto those of the World War II fascist government. By its own account, \nthe Guard has thousands of applications to join its ranks, at a time \nwhen the elected Hungarian government is already unpopular because of \nits previous deceptive election campaign. This criticism led to \nwidespread street violence last year, creating a tense environment ripe \nfor radicalization. The Hungarian Guard is supported by the rightwing \npolitical party Jobbik, which is small but virulent. The Prime Minister \nof Hungary likened the formation of the Hungarian Guard to the \nincreasing influence of Brownshirts in Hitler's Germany, a comparison \nwhich seems to me--at least at an early stage--to be\n\n[[Page S13983]]\n\napt. The Jewish community in Hungary is understandably wary of its new \nGuard, and I feel it is incumbent upon all of us to watch future events \nin that country closely.\n  But it is not just the fringe organizations which are growing in \npopularity; inch by inch, more moderate groups with the similar tenets \nare moving to the mainstream. Last month, the somewhat xenophobic Swiss \nPeople's Party, SVP, romped to significant success in Switzerland's \nnational election. Perhaps this should not be cause for excessive \nalarm. After all, Switzerland has a highly developed political system, \nwith a republican tradition dating back hundreds of years. These people \nare also not marginalized discontents with a perennial grudge on their \nshoulder; indeed, they seem to address several issues about which the \naverage Swiss citizen is concerned. But if there is not cause for \nalarm, there is certainly cause for unease. One reason is an election \nposter used by the SVP, depicting a white sheep kicking a black sheep \noff of the flag of Switzerland. Because of its racial overtones, the \nU.N. has already condemned the poster, though the SVP claimed during \nthe campaign the poster was not racist. Perhaps.\n  I do not believe that the SVP are a fascist party, as some of its \ncritics allege. However, its success is indicative of a potentially \nugly mood across the Atlantic, as Europeans born into welfare state \nluxury are unsure how globalization and the mobility of capital will \naffect their economic birthright. In uncertain economic times, \nopprobrium then falls easily on traditional scapegoats; Jews, gypsies, \nand other minorities. It is critical for the Europeans to remember that \nthese minorities are no less citizens for being different. They lead \nlaw-abiding lives, pay their taxes, and serve in the military. It does \nnot thus stand to reason that European societies can treat them \neternally as second-class citizens.\n  Groups like the Hungarian Guard would likely protest that their rigid \nstance is only aimed at those who become illegal, who commit crimes or \nthreaten Hungary's law-and-order. But given the heated rhetoric on this \nissue, and the current torrid geopolitical climate, the status of \nminorities, particularly Jews and Muslims, in Western countries is an \nissue which needs to be tackled carefully. Many of the current \nchallenges facing the world are rooted in the Middle Eastern and \nIslamic nations, and it would be foolish to place lives in jeopardy \nover election-day rhetoric.\n  Coincidental with rise of the Hungarian Guard and its ilk, there is \nanother factor I find particularly troubling: the increase in overall \nanti-Semitism in Europe. This has several possible causes, and I \ncertainly do not want to lay the blame solely on the shoulders of \nrightwing extremists. Passions arising from the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict surely play a part, especially considering the large Muslim \npopulation in these countries. But it does seem true that there is \nstill a strain of the old European anti-Semitism running through the \nHungarian Guard, Russian fascists, and their like, a disturbing taint \nwhich has never quite vanished from European political culture.\n  Anti-Semitic violence was one of the terrible specters of the last \ncentury. After the Second World War, Europeans made a solemn commitment \nnever to let such hatred loose again on their citizens of Jewish faith. \nDespite neo-Nazi movements in several countries, the European \ncommitment to this resolution has been impressive. It is equally \nimportant to remember, however, just how recently was the Holocaust. \nThe slaughter was ended 62 years ago, and many still live who were \ncaught in its vice. In the breadth of human existence, 62 years is \nbarely a lifetime. So I strongly believe it is necessary, even as \nextremist parties become increasingly visible, that responsible leaders \nrecommit themselves to the eradication of anti-Semitism in their \nrealms.\n  Uncertain times often lead men to seek the simplest solutions, the \nelements of their national culture with which they are the most \ncomfortable. Two of these traditions are, unfortunately, extremist \nnationalism and anti-Semitism. Given the history of Europe, each nation \nshould redouble its efforts to make peace with those in their ranks who \nare different. And it is also up to Europe to ensure that when they say \n``never again,'' they mean it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/06/senate-section/article/S13983-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13983-S13984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record an excerpt from the remarks by President George W. Bush \nat the Presidential Medal of Freedom presentation at the White House on \nNovember 5, 2007, honoring Harper Lee of Monroeville, AL.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record.\n  Good morning. Laura and I are thrilled to welcome you to the White \nHouse. We welcome the members of Congress, the members of the Cabinet, \nand other distinguished guests. It's an honor to be with the Medal of \nFreedom recipients, as well as their family members and friends. We're \nsure glad you're here.\n  The Medal of Freedom is the highest civil honor that a President can \nbestow. By an executive order of John F. Kennedy, the medal is designed \nto recognize great contributions to national security, the cause of \npeace and freedom, science, the arts, literature, and many other \nfields. The eight men and women came to this distinction by very \ndifferent paths. Each of them, by effort and by character, has earned \nthe respect of the American people, and holds a unique place in the \nstory of our time.\n  The story of an old order, and the glimmers of humanity that would \none day overtake it, was unforgettably told in a book by Miss Harper \nLee. Soon after its publication a reviewer said this: ``A hundred \npounds of sermons on tolerance, or an equal measure of invective \ndeploring the lack of it, will weigh far less in the scale of \nenlightenment than a mere 18 ounces of a new fiction bearing the title \nTo Kill a Mockingbird.''\n  Given her legendary stature as a novelist, you may be surprised to \nlearn that Harper Lee, early in her career, was an airline reservation \nclerk. Fortunately for all of us, she didn't stick to writing \nitineraries. Her beautiful book, with its grateful prose and memorable \ncharacters, became one of the biggest-selling novels of the 20th \ncentury.\n  Forty-six years after winning the Pulitzer Prize, To Kill a \nMockingbird still touches and inspires every reader. We're moved by the \nstory of a man falsely accused--with old prejudice massed against him, \nand an old sense of honor that rises to his defense. We learn that \ncourage can be a solitary business. As the lawyer Atticus Finch tells \nhis daughter, ``before I can live with other folks I've got to live \nwith myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a \nperson's conscience.''\n  Years after To Kill a Mockingbird was put to film, the character of \nAtticus Finch was voted the greatest movie hero of all time. It won \nGregory Peck the Oscar. He was said to believe the role ``brought him \nclosest to being the kind of man he aspired to be.'' The great actor \ncounted Harper Lee among his good friends, and we're so pleased that \nGregory Peck's wife, Veronique, is with us today. Thank you for coming.\n  One reason To Kill a Mockingbird succeeded is the wise and kind heart \nof the author, which comes through on every page. This daughter of \nMonroeville, Alabama had something to say about honor, and tolerance, \nand, most of all, love--and it still resonates. Last year Harper Lee \nreceived an honorary doctorate at Notre Dame. As the degree was \npresented, the graduating class rose as one, held up copies of her \nbook, and cheered for the author they love.\n  To Kill a Mockingbird has influenced the character of our country for \nthe better. It's been a gift to the entire world. As a model of good \nwriting and humane sensibility, this book will be read and studied \nforever. And so all of us are filled with admiration for a great \nAmerican and a lovely lady named Harper Lee.\n  Thank you all for coming. I hope you've enjoyed this ceremony as much \nas I have. May God bless you all.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need to \nwrite government documents in plain language.\n  This past Sunday, November 4, 2007, the Washington Post ran an \narticle entitled ``Parsing the Fine Print in Federal Ads.'' This \narticle illustrates exactly why the Federal Government must begin \nwriting in language that the American people can understand.\n  The Federal Government has a pressing need to recruit skilled \nemployees. Many agencies are understaffed, and more than 50 percent of \nthe Federal workforce will be eligible to retire in the next 5 years. \nYet advertisements for Federal jobs are described as \n``incomprehensible,'' ``opaque,'' ``dense,'' and ``convoluted.'' The \narticle quotes two different people who have written entire books about \napplying for Federal jobs, one of whom states that understanding a \nFederal job announcement can take hours and likens the process to \nexplicating a poem in English class.\n  It is well known that the Federal hiring process is lengthy and \ncomplex. Agencies need to look for ways to streamline and improve the \nhiring process, especially now that the Federal government is facing a \nlarge number of retirements. One easy step that agencies can take is to \nwrite announcements in plain language.\n  Writing Federal job announcements in plain language would save \napplicants considerable time and energy spent attempting to figure out \nwhat a job advertisement means. Plain, clear, accessible ads are much \nmore likely to attract candidates' attention than opaque and \nincomprehensible ones. By writing job ads in plain language, agencies \nlikely would attract more candidates with strong qualifications, which \nwould go a long way toward addressing the Federal Government's human \ncapital challenges.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Plain Language in Government \nCommunications Act of 2007, S. 2291, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe article from the Washington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 4, 2007]\n\n                 Parsing the Fine Print on Federal Ads\n\n                        (By Mary Ellen Slayter)\n\n       Uncle Sam really does want you, even though at times it can \n     be hard to figure out what exactly he wants you to do.\n       Federal job ads can seem particularly opaque to people \n     looking to make the switch from the private sector. Or as one \n     wannabe fed put it in my online chat recently: ``What gives \n     with USAJobs.com? The job descriptions on that site are \n     incomprehensible to a person (like me) who hasn't worked for \n     a government agency before. Seriously, they don't make any \n     sense.''\n       ``The federal application process is complex to say the \n     least,'' said Dennis Damp, author of The Book of U.S. \n     Government Jobs'' and a retired senior manager for the \n     Federal Aviation Administration. Part of that is for good \n     reason, he said; the process is designed to be fair, judging \n     applicants on the basis of their qualifications, without \n     discrimination or nepotism.\n       Even when you agree that those are commendable goals, the \n     process can be exasperating. But those frustrations can be \n     overcome with a little patience--and by making that seemingly \n     dense job ad work for you.\n       Damp's book devotes a chapter to analyzing the job \n     announcement, breaking it down piece by piece and showing \n     applicants how to craft an effective resume based on the \n     information given. He said a common mistake people make is \n     not reading the whole announcement before throwing their \n     hands up in bewilderment--though he certainly sympathizes \n     with them. ``It's a ton of data that can be very confusing \n     initially. You can't stop at the first paragraph, because if \n     you do, you're probably bypassing positions that you're \n     qualified for.''\n       He also includes several cross-referenced indexes, which \n     can be particularly helpful to the truly lost hunter who \n     isn't sure if he's even looking at the right types of jobs to \n     match his private-sector skill set.\n       ``The announcement gives you so much content to use, if we \n     slow down and appreciate what's in there,'' said Kathryn \n     Kraemer Troutman, author of the ``Federal Resume Guidebook'' \n     and president of the Resume Place, a consulting firm that \n     specializes in helping applicants for federal jobs.\n       She offers a simple strategy for making sense of \n     announcements: Start with the ``duties'' section. Count the \n     sentences in the\n\n[[Page S13986]]\n\n     paragraph, and separate each one into a numbered line. Then \n     read each sentence again slowly. Within each sentence, \n     underline the key words.\n       ``Then you will understand the position,'' she said. (This \n     works, but ``simple'' does not mean ``quick.'' It can easily \n     take hours. If you ever had to explicate poems in English \n     class, you get the idea.) Do the same thing with the \n     ``qualifications'' section, which will probably cover five or \n     six things. ``Those key words must be in your resume,'' \n     Troutman said. ``Don't be creative.''\n       Something else to keep in mind: If the qualifications don't \n     make sense to you after careful study, perhaps you're just \n     not qualified. ``Private industry people many times do not \n     have the qualifications for federal jobs,'' Troutman said.\n       If that's the case, your work still wasn't a waste. If you \n     dream of a fed job, make acquiring those qualifications your \n     goals, she said. ``Make this list your list, taking classes, \n     volunteering.''\n       But lack of qualifications isn't always the problem. \n     Sometimes its just a language barrier--or a cultural one. \n     ``People from the private sector can't understand this \n     language,'' Troutman said. ``They just can't believe it.'' \n     Others just ``don't know how to play this paper game.''\n       Max Stier, president of the nonprofit Partnership for \n     Public Service, said that job seekers need to remember that \n     all federal agencies are all different--right down to their \n     job ads.\n       ``A lot of agencies still provide descriptions of job \n     openings that are convoluted,'' he said, but not all. ``Some \n     agencies get it. Some understand.''\n       But if you don't understand, he said, pick up the phone and \n     call the agency. Announcements on USAJobs, the government's \n     primary avenue for advertising new jobs, include contact \n     information for the appropriate human resources officer.\n       ``Even in the age of the Web, finding someone to speak with \n     can help,'' Stier said.\n       And be patient. ``There are more and more good tools out \n     there,'' he said, ``but obviously it's still not a hiring \n     nirvana.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/06/senate-section/article/S13986-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Kerry in \nintroducing the Global Change Research Improvement Act of 2007, that \namends and strengthens the existing U.S. climate change research and \nassessment program that will ultimately benefit all of the citizens of \nour Nation. Our intent is to improve upon the basic research and \nproducts that the Federal Government develops on climate change and its \ninherent impacts. We believe our legislation would refocus the emphasis \nof the nations' climate change program and fulfill the need for \nrelevant information for States, and local and nongovernmental \ndecisionmakers.\n  In addition, the creation of a new National Climate Service within \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, will provide \nclimate change forecasting on a regular basis to end-users, and create \na permanent network for the delivery of such information so that \ndecision makers in every city and town, county and State, and the \nFederal Government can make timely planning decisions to deal with \nimpacts and develop adaptation methodologies.\n  The legislation also calls for an Abrupt Climate Change Research \nProgram within NOAA--a program I have been supporting for at least 5 \nyears now--so that scientists can gather more knowledge about a change \nin the climate that occurs so rapidly or unexpectedly that human or \nnatural systems have difficulty adapting to the change. I am proud to \nsay that my alma mater, the University of Maine at Orono, has a world \nrenowned abrupt climate change research program under the direction of \nDr. Paul Mayewski. He and his colleague Dr. George Denton, UMaine Libra \nProfessor of Geological Sciences have been major contributors to \nresearch on abrupt climate change. There is a need for a national \nresearch program to coordinate and further research on past climate \nshifts so that scientists can better predict what future climate change \nholds for our fragile planet.\n  The Global Change Research Program, GCRP, the country's climate \nresearch and assessment program, was established in law by the Global \nChange Research Act of 1990. Consider what has happened technologically \nsince then, what was generally unheard of at that time. We now drive \nhybrid cars, we are tuned into iPods, we use hand held blackberries for \ninstant communication, we have much more advanced and high speed \ncomputers for modeling and, most importantly for our legislation, more \ncomprehensive knowledge and understanding of climate change through 17 \nmore years of peer-reviewed scientific research, monitoring, and \nassessments. Our nation's climate change research program needs \nrestructuring so that we can turn that knowledge into timely and useful \ninformation for decisionmakers. This is exactly what our bill does.\n  Unfortunately, the overall GCRP program's budget has been steadily \ndeclining since fiscal year 2004, which is alarming since, at the same \ntime, we have a growing need, a truly urgent need, to better understand \nand predict climate change. Over the past several years, independent \nreports, including a review by the National Academy of Sciences, have \ndocumented weaknesses and gaps in the current implementation of the \nGCRP. In fact, a Federal district court found that the current \nadministration had failed to comply with the statute's mandate to \nprovide regular assessments of the impacts of climate change on \ncritical resources; no such assessment has been published since October \n31, 2000.\n  Our legislation makes important changes to address these weaknesses \nand gaps, making important changes to strengthen the mandate to provide \nassessments, enabling the GCRP to perform critical climate observations \nand research on climate systems; improve our ability to predict climate \nimpacts at national, regional and local levels; and, importantly, to \ncommunicate those impacts in a timely and useful fashion to State and \nlocal decisionmakers, resource managers, and other stakeholders.\n  Back in the 14th century, a Franciscan friar William of Ocklam came \nup with the principle that has, through the ages, been called Occam's \nrazor. The Latin explanation ``entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter \nnecessitatem,'' which paraphrased means, ``All things being equal, the \nsimplest solution tends to be the right one.'' This is what Senator \nKerry and I are attempting to accomplish with this bill, to simply \nfocus rather than to continue to multiply and to dilute how our climate \nchange research programs are currently carried out with no real usable \ninformation for the decisionmakers who must deal with the problems of \nglobal warming. We hope our colleagues agree with these necessary \nimprovements and will join us with their support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/06/senate-section/article/S13986-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13986-S13987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO DON DIXON\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, it is with mixed emotions that I bid \nfarewell to a longtime member of my staff but, more importantly, a \ntrusted friend of many years. Don Dixon has served as my State director \nof agriculture for the past 12 years. His service has been exemplary; \nnothing less can be imagined from Don--he is a man of the highest \ncharacter, a man whose honesty, trustworthiness, kindness, \nintelligence, dependability and wisdom are firmly rooted in a \nfoundation of humility. He came to me with a well-established \nreputation for fairness and extensive knowledge of Idaho agriculture. \nThroughout more than a decade of public service, I can honestly say \nthat I have learned more from him than he from me. I have the highest \nregard for Don; he is irreplaceable. Fortunately, it is just Senate \nemployment that he is leaving, and I get to enjoy his friendship and \ninsight for years to come.\n  As a farmer with firsthand knowledge of the challenges faced by \nproducers, Don has been reliable counsel to the agriculture community, \nthe Idaho delegation and others as he has worked for sound agriculture \npolicy. Don has been recognized for his dedication to agriculture \nthrough awards, such as the Governor's Excellence in Agriculture Award \nand induction in the Eastern Idaho Agricultural Hall of Fame. It is \nalso nearly impossible to find an aspect of Idaho agriculture that Don \nhas not been involved with through membership of organizations and \ncouncils, service on boards, and continuous outreach.\n  In addition to his experience, Don brings contagious enthusiasm and \nenergy to everything he undertakes, and serves as not only a strong \nadvocate for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, but also provides \nexemplary counsel to fellow farmers and ranchers. Don's easy going \npersonality is complemented by a sharp mind and quick\n\n[[Page S13987]]\n\nwit. Idaho agriculture has benefited in incalculable ways from his \nwisdom, wealth of hard-earned knowledge and his ability to see the \nbigger picture when it comes to dealing with issues important to \nIdaho's agriculture community such as water, land use, grazing and \nanimal management, conservation, invasive species and community \nrelations. His has been a voice of reason and calm in the sometimes \nthorny conflicts that occur between Federal, State and local \nagriculture regulations and issues. Don has been a tireless spokesman \nfor Idaho's growers and ranchers, a community leader and a good friend \nto many. It has been an incredible honor and a pleasure to have him on \nmy staff. Don has taught me many things, among them the wisdom of a \ngate wide enough to accommodate a tiller, and the vast array of Idaho \nscenery that can be even better appreciated when ``big'' lost in the \nLittle Lost.\n  Don has been an essential part of my hometown office, in Idaho Falls; \nas a result, I share office space with Don when I am home. For most of \nus, the little things that make our offices ours say quite a bit about \nwho we are. Don keeps a supply of Whoppers in his desk, finishes his \ncoffee, cold, in the afternoons, tracks useful information--what \nIdahoans like to call ``scuttlebutt''--and keeps a dollar bill in his \ndesk drawer. He has created many different storage options for himself \nin his office, has a reputation as a skilled charades player and color \ncodes activities on his calendar. A little light-hearted personal work \nspace analysis reveals that Don, a whopper of a fellow and true to his \nfarming and ranching roots, is wisely frugal, keeps informed about his \ncommunity, and is prepared for any emergency. He is creative, inventive \nand works hard to keep his friendships colorful, nurtured and long-\nlasting.\n  I want to thank Don for his many years of service, and thank his wife \nGeorgia for her support as he has worked for me. The schedule isn't \nalways the most family-friendly, and she, like Don, has braved it with \na sense of humor and patience.\n  He has served Idahoans with excellence, and, as he takes the helm of \nthe Idaho State Farm Services Agency, his knowledge, character and \nwisdom will continue to serve Idaho agriculture. I will miss him on my \nstaff.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/06/senate-section/article/S13987-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     INDIANA SERVICE LEADERS SUMMIT\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I wish to tell you about a group of \nextraordinary young Hoosiers. On October 27, National Make A Difference \nDay, the fifth annual Service Leaders Summit was held in Indianapolis \nto honor high school students from across Indiana for their service and \ndedication to their communities and hopefully to inspire them to \ncontinue serving throughout their lives.\n  The young men and women who were honored have answered the call to \nservice. Some of them have helped build homes, some tutored and \nmentored younger students, and others have raised money to support \ncancer research or feed the hungry. Several of the young men and women \nled service projects on their own to address the problems in their \nschools and communities. Each one of the students spends hours making a \ndifference in their hometowns. They have impacted the lives of \ncountless Hoosiers.\n  During the summit, the students heard from Hoosier leaders who have \nchosen to dedicate their lives to serving others. The speakers \nhighlighted the five pillars of successful service: inspiration, \norganization, dedication, evaluation, and reflection. Following the \nspeeches, the students divided into groups and participated in service \nactivities at different sites throughout Indianapolis.\n  Robert F. Kennedy once said, ``Some men see things as they are and \nsay `Why?' I dream of things that never were and say, `Why not?' '' \nEach one of these young men and women has already asked themselves \n``Why not?'' and have worked to make positive changes in their \ncommunities. They represent a new generation of promise with the \npotential to make a real difference across Indiana and the nation.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank each one of the following \nindividuals for participating in the summit and for their service to \ntheir communities:\n  Laura Alexander, Kashua Alexander, Alex Anspaugh, Alexis Arnold, \nChase Arthur, Tiffany Aylor, Anne Baenziger, Kelsie Ball, Kristin \nBarnes, Kaitlyn Batt, Brittany Bedwell, Adam Bernaix, Stephanie \nBradley, Andrea Bright, Lesley Bright, Margaret Burke, Emily Burnworth, \nConner Caudill, Libby Chang, Joshua Clifford, Ashley Clodfelder, Carla \nCotton, Victoria Cottrell, Adam Crick, Conner Cunningham, Katie Day, \nBrittany Dunlavy, Christopher Ellison, Joey Etling, Iris Farries, \nLyndsey Fisher, Riley Fitzpatrick, Eva Flick, Emily Friesen, Laura \nGadson, Amy Gibson, Cody Goshert, Kimberly Gregory, Megan Haire, Katie \nHawkins, Tim Herniak, Shelby Hodge, Cody Hodges, Matthew Hollars, \nClinton Horine, Christopher Horn, Nick Horn, Stacey Houmes, Candice \nHoward-Perry, Kian Hudson, Taylor Jenkins, Ashley Jones, Lyndsey \nKellett, Ericka Kelley, Sarah Kelsey, Alison Kocur, George Mammarella, \nNicholas Marchi, Nicole McCann, Kristen McMann, Kandace McNeely, \nLindsey Meyer, Nicole Miller, Emily Miller, Dennis Moynihan, Kristina \nMuehr, Benjamin Myers, Megan Noonan, Kayla O'Brien, Michael Padilla, \nCarmen Perry, Sarah Polk, Shavonda Price, Ravon Price, Chloe Pugh, \nAlexis Rivera, Sable Robinson, Rachel Rominger, TaMar Shachaf, Emily \nShephard, Trevor Shockey, Aaron Smith, Jacob Sowers, Parker Stevens, \nColin Stretch, Tha Sung, Jordan Taylor, Jennifer Thilges, Cami Thomas, \nJessica Thompson, Vance Torres, Alyssa Vermillion, Tiffany Vogeler, \nNoah Wahl, Paul Weller, Mackenzie Williams, Lashaa Williams, Becky \nWilson, Virginia ``Ginny'' Wright, and Janelle Yaryan.\n  I would also like to take a moment to express my gratitude to the \nIndiana University Purdue University Indianapolis students who took \npart in the summit as well.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Sheriff \nJames Hayes, who passed away on a recent hunting trip. Sheriff Hayes's \nlaw enforcement career began at the Etowah County Sheriff's Office in \n1972 as a deputy sheriff. In 1986, he was elected sheriff and was \nsubsequently reelected to five more terms, distinguishing him as the \nlongest-serving sheriff in Etowah County history. He was a graduate of \nthe Hokes Bluff High School Class of 1965, and a member of the only \nundefeated football team in school history in 1964. Sheriff Hayes was a \npillar of the law enforcement community, not only in Etowah County, but \nin the entire State of Alabama and the Nation. In 1994, he carried the \ndistinguished title of president of the Alabama Sheriff's Association, \nserving both our State and sheriffs across the Nation with distinction. \nIn the course of his career, Sheriff Hayes served on committees and \nboards throughout Etowah County and the State of Alabama. His unfailing \nleadership, and his unwavering love of public service, are examples for \nus all.\n  During the course of my Senate career, Sheriff Hayes worked closely \nwith me and my staff to bring about positive change in Alabama. The \naccomplishment that I am perhaps most grateful to Sheriff Hayes for \ninvolves his vision for an immigration detention facility in the State \nof Alabama. In March of 1998, Sheriff Hayes started pursuing the \nexpansion of the Etowah County Detention Facility. He had a vision for \na long-term contract with the Federal Immigration Service, one that \nwould increase the bed capacity in the State, and one that would serve \nto ensure that Federal immigration laws were\n\n[[Page S13988]]\n\nmore effectively enforced within the borders of our State. It is common \nknowledge that without bed space, you cannot arrest and deport illegal \naliens. With the help of our office, he secured a 15-year agreement \nwith the Immigration Service and an $8.4 million expansion grant. This \ngrant added over 300 detention beds, more than doubling the number in \nthe existing facility.\n  When the Immigration Service turned over control of the facility to \nits New Orleans Field Office after September 11, 2001, Sheriff Hayes \nfurther demonstrated his commitment to a successful immigration \nenforcement system in Alabama by initiating a movement to return \noversight for the Etowah County Federal Detention Facility to \nImmigration Services' Atlanta Field Office. He firmly believed that the \nbeds would be used more effectively under the direction of the Atlanta \nField Office, which was hundreds of miles closer and wanted to use the \nfacility for short term, instead of long-term, immigration detainees. \nJust 2 weeks before his death, I received notification from the \nImmigration Service that his multiple year-long effort was not in vain. \nDHS had fully evaluated his position, and had decided to grant his \nrequest. My office was able to communicate the good news that his \npersistence had been met with success to Sheriff Hayes just before his \npassing.\n  I am confident that Sheriff Hayes' diligent efforts over the last \nseveral years have ensured a more effective Federal partnership with \nlaw enforcement in Alabama for years to come. As I read the recent \nnewspaper articles and messages reacting to Sheriff Hayes's death, I \nwas touched to realize that the appreciation of Etowah County's \ncitizens for Sheriff Hayes's unrelenting public service is only \nsurpassed by their love for him as a husband, father, grandfather, \nbrother and friend who will be missed tremendously. Alabama was indeed \nlucky to claim him as one of her own.\n  So, in closing, I want to let Sheriff Hayes' family know how much I \nappreciate his service, his professionalism, and his dedication to the \npeople of Etowah County and the State of Alabama. I know that words \ncannot adequately express the loss being felt right now in Etowah \nCounty, but we can all be assured that Etowah County and our State are \nbetter places because of Sheriff Hayes' leadership. Let his life be a \nexample for those of us who continue to serve in public office.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/06/senate-section/article/S13988-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO DR. GEORGE V. IRONS, JR., M.D.\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I commend Dr. George V. \nIrons, Jr., M.D., native Alabamian, for his outstanding achievements as \none of our Nation's foremost cardiologists.\n  Dr. Irons has treated the hearts of Americans for over five decades. \nHe graduated from the Medical College of Alabama, earning the highest \ngrades ever recorded in the school's history, straight A-plus. Since \nthat time, his professional accomplishments have been many.\n  While at the Medical College of Alabama, he was selected by the \nAmerican Medical Association as one of the top two medical students in \nthe nation. For his superior scholastic record, leadership and service, \nhe won the Stuart Graves Award, as the Medical School's top student.\n  After military duty as a flight surgeon, Captain, U.S. Air Force, \ninternship and residency, chief resident in cardiology, Dr. Irons \njoined the Duke University Medical School Faculty in 1964, where he was \nnamed fellow in cardiovascular diseases.\n  Dr. Irons' career has truly been notable. Since 1966, he has been in \nactive practice in Charlotte, NC, as the first board certified \ncardiologist in western North Carolina. Dr. Irons was Founder and is \npresident of Mid-Carolina Cardiology, a premiere coronary care \nprovider.\n  As a high school junior, Irons won the prestigious Bausch & Lomb \nAward, as America's top science student--a nationwide science talent \nsearch based on competitive examinations sponsored by the University of \nRochester, NY. As the winner, he was offered a substantial scholarship, \nwhich he declined, to attend Samford University.\n  He graduated from Woodlawn High School with a perfect academic \nrecord, first in his class, and served as president of the student \nbody. At Howard College--now Samford University--he continued his \ncourse, finishing a rigorous 4 year pre-med curriculum in 35 months \nwith a perfect 3.0--first in his class.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify \nthe service treatable as service engaged in combat with the enemy for \nutilization of non-official evidence for proof of service-connection in \na combat-related disease or injury; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce the proposed Compensation \nfor Combat Veterans Act. This legislation would remove a barrier to the \nfair adjudication of claims for VA benefits filed by veterans who have \ndisabilities incurred or aggravated by their military service in combat \nareas. Under existing law, veterans who can establish that they served \nin combat do not have to produce official military records to support \ntheir claim for disabilities related to that service.\n  At present, some veterans, disabled by their service in Iraq and \nAfghanistan as well as those who served earlier in Korea and Vietnam, \nare unable to benefit from this liberalizing evidentiary requirement \nbecause they have difficulty proving personal participation in combat \nby official military documents.\n  Under an opinion of the Department of Veterans Affairs General \nCounsel, VA GC Opinion 12-99, veterans must establish by official \nmilitary records or decorations that they ``personally participated in \nevents constituting an actual fight or encounter with a military foe or \nhostile unit or instrumentality.'' Oversight visits by Committee staff \nto VA regional offices have found claims denied as a result of this \npolicy because those who served in combat zones were not able to \nproduce official military documentation of their personal participation \nin an actual fight.\n  Some of these cases include a Marine Combat Engineer serving in Iraq \nwho encountered IEDs, an Army veteran accidently shot in Iraq by a \nfellow servicemember, and an Army Infantryman whose records showed \nparticipation in the Tet offensive of 1968, but not ``personal \nparticipation in an actual fight.'' In other cases, extensive delays in \nclaims processing occur while VA adjudicators attempt to obtain \nofficial military documents showing that a Marine who served in Bagdad \nor Fallujah was personally exposed to IEDs.\n  The legislation I am introducing would overturn the General Counsel \nprecedent opinion. I believe that the requirement in that opinion is \ninconsistent with the original intent of Congress in liberalizing the \nrequirements for proof of service-connection in cases involving \nveterans who served in combat areas. As the Senate noted in 1941, in \nthe report on the original bill providing special consideration for \ncombat veterans:\n\n       The absence of an official record of care or treatment in \n     many of such cases is readily explained by the conditions \n     surrounding the service of combat veterans. It was emphasized \n     in the hearings that the establishment of records of care or \n     treatment of veterans in other than combat areas, and \n     particularly in the States, was a comparatively simple matter \n     as compared with the veteran who served in combat. Either the \n     veteran attempted to carry on despite his disability to avoid \n     having a record made lest he might be separated from his \n     organization or, as in many cases, the records themselves \n     were lost.\n\n  S. Rep. 77-902 to H.R. 4905 at 2.\n  While some improvements have been made since 1941 in obtaining and \nmaintaining records in combat areas, record keeping and transmittal of \nrecords in combat areas remains problematic.\n  This bill would require that, in cases in which the veteran can \ndemonstrate service in a recognized combat area and alleges \ndisabilities related to that service the relaxed evidentiary principles \nintended by the Congress would apply, with no requirement for further \nevidence from the veteran regarding his or her specific activity.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure, so that combat \nveterans of the current conflicts, as well as those who served in \nearlier conflicts, can receive the benefits they deserve in a timely \nmanner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER:\n  S. 2312. A bill to amend title VI of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 to provide for State student achievement \ncontracts; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senators Kennedy and Enzi have recently \nsaid that early in 2008 the Senate will consider whether to authorize \nNo Child Left Behind.\n  That law, which was enacted in 2001 as a part of the regular 5-year \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, required \nevery State to set standards for math and reading and to test each \nchild once a year in grades 3 through 8, and once in high school, in \norder to measure their progress toward meeting these State standards. \nIn addition, the law requires States to report the results in a \ndisaggregated way, meaning according to racial, ethnic, socioeconomic \nstatus, disability, and limited English proficiency, report the status \nof the children so it would be clearer whether groups of children are \nbeing left behind in their academic progress.\n  So my purpose today is, first, to announce my support for the \nreauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act but ask that we find a \nbetter way to do the job of reporting results. We should be trying to \ncatch schools doing things right rather than seeming to penalize them \nfor doing things wrong.\n  Second, to introduce legislation providing for greater flexibility in \nadministering the law for up to a dozen States, if those States agree \nto maintain a high level or increase the rigor of the program, their \nstandard-setting process, and reporting requirements.\n  Third, to express my concerns about early drafts and proposals of \nreauthorizing legislation that seem to require more Federal control and \nless State responsibility for results--the reverse of what we should be \nseeking to achieve.\n  Finally, I wish to call attention to several parts of the legislation \nthat need to be strengthened and expanded: Support for teaching \nAmerican history; the Teacher Incentive Fund; charter schools, which I \nknow the Presiding Officer has been very interested in for a long time; \nand State collection of data to aid States in measuring student \nprogress.\n  First, support for reauthorization. I have decided to cosponsor the \nNo Child Left Behind Act of 2007, which has been authored by Senators \nBurr and Gregg, because I believe it represents a sound foundation for \neventual reauthorization of the legislation. This legislative draft \nleaves in place the framework of the 2001 law: high goals, State \nstandards, and disaggregated reporting of results, and it addresses \nsome obvious deficiencies in the existing legislation, including more \nflexibility in helping children learn English, in measuring the \nprogress of children with disabilities, and in how to report the \nprogress of children who make great progress but still fall behind \ntheir goals. This bill--the Burr-Gregg bill--does not retreat from the \nbold goal that all children will be proficient in reading and math \naccording to each State's standards by the 2013-2014 school year. Some \nhave argued that sets schools up for failure. I would argue it is the \nAmerican way to set high goals and then to\n\n[[Page S13992]]\n\nattempt to reach them. Our Declaration of Independence does not say \n``life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'' for 80 percent of us. \nOur national character is not that some things are possible. Rightly or \nwrongly, we Americans uniquely believe that anything is possible for \nall of us, and much of our politics and debates in this body are about \ndealing with the disappointment of not reaching high goals that we set \nfor ourselves, and then, of course, we set out and try again to achieve \nthem.\n  I do think we would be wise to find a different way to talk about the \nprogress of schools in reaching those high goals. Most schools, at \nleast today, are succeeding in reaching their State's No Child Left \nBehind standards. There are more than 100,000 schools in the United \nStates. According to the U.S. Department of Education, over 20 percent \nof those--21,000--did not make adequate yearly progress. Of those \n21,000 schools, about one-fourth missed their goals by one subgroup of \nstudents.\n  The same is true in Tennessee. According to our Department of \nEducation, there are 1,710 public schools. There were 245--or 15 \npercent--which did not make adequate yearly progress. Of those, 127 \ndidn't do it because of one subgroup.\n  Therefore, I suggest we find a different way to talk about progress. \nSchools that reach their goals might be called ``high-achieving \nschools.'' Schools that do so for more than 1 year in a row might be \ncalled the ``highest achieving schools.'' Schools that, on the other \nhand, miss their goal by only one subgroup might be called ``achieving \nschools,'' and those that do not do as well might be called priority \nschools.\n  Second: A new State contract for flexibility. I am introducing today \nthe State Student Achievement Contract which I will work to make a part \nof No Child Left Behind. The idea is simple: Now that we have 5 years \nof experience with No Child Left Behind, we should toss the ball back \nto at least some States and see whether those States can implement the \nlaw with at least as much rigor in reporting, more flexibility, and \nmore innovation.\n  I know if the Presiding Officer and I were still Governors of our \nrespective States, we would want to try that over the next 5 years.\n  This proposal would allow up to 12 States to negotiate with the U.S. \nSecretary of Education to enter into a State student achievement \ncontract, which would permit States to improve their own systems of \naccountability, and in exchange, receive the necessary flexibility to \ninnovate on finding ways to close the achievement gap.\n  In other words, instead of saying: ``Do it exactly this way'' to the \nStates, the Federal Government would be saying: ``Give us results, and \nwe will give you more flexibility.''\n  In determining which States would be eligible for this new contract, \nthe Secretary would expect States to increase their standards, \nassessments, and expectations of students.\n  Washington, DC, itself is not going to make schools better in \nWilmington, Maryville, Kansas City, and Sacramento. This can only \nhappen locally, when parents, teachers, communities, and State \nofficials take charge. In fact, No Child Left Behind is simply an \nextension of the State standards movement that began in the 1980s in \nmost States. While it requires the setting of standards and requires \npublic reporting, the solution to the problem of low-achieving students \nis left in the hands of communities, where it must be left. In fact, \nonly 8 percent of funding of public schools comes from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  So this proposal seeks to recognize that solutions are local, to \nencourage those States that are trying the boldest programs, and to \npermit the flexibility needed to achieve those results.\n  Third, creeping Federal control. One reason I have introduced the \nState contract proposal is I don't want the reauthorization of No Child \nLeft Behind to become a vehicle for increased Federal control of local \nschools. In fact, now that the first 5 years of confusion and learning \nthe new law are completed, there ought to be fewer Federal \nrequirements, not more. After all, the law is essentially a requirement \nfor State standards and reporting disaggregated results.\n  But, unfortunately, Washington doesn't work that way. Our motto seems \nto be: Once we have stuck our noses into something, we will meddle with \nit forever. In some of the early drafts of No Child Left Behind, I have \nseen examples of increased Federal regulation that in my view offer the \nprospect of more Federal control and less local accountability. It \nought to be the other way around.\n  Finally, there are three special provisions of No Child Left Behind \nthat, based upon the first 5 years' experience, need to be expanded.\n  One, teaching American history. The late Albert Shanker, president of \nthe American Federation of Teachers, once said the rationale for a \npublic school is to teach immigrant children the three Rs and what it \nmeans to be an American, with the hope they would go home and teach \ntheir parents. Yet the lowest test scores for American high school \nseniors is not math or reading or science, it is U.S. history. Senators \nKennedy, Enzi, and I have worked to create some new provisions for this \nreauthorization which would encourage putting the teaching of American \nhistory back in its rightful place in our schools so our children can \ngrow up learning what it means to be an American. These provisions \ninclude: The teaching traditional American history provision. That was \nput in 5 years ago. It is a program of grants to school districts to \nencourage professional development and teaching of American history. It \nhas been very successful. Senator Kennedy and Senator Byrd have had a \nmajor part in this law.\n  Next, Presidential and congressional academies. The pilot programs \nfor these summer academies for outstanding teachers and students of \nAmerican history have been low cost and very successful. It is my hope \nthat in a partnership with States and the private sector, these can be \nexpanded to a total of 100 each summer. They are very much similar to \nthe Governors' schools many States have for students and for teachers. \nDavid McCullough has suggested perhaps we can match up the 10-year \ncentennial program for national parks with these summer programs for \nstudents and teachers of U.S. history. Imagine what it would be like \nfor a group of U.S. history teachers to spend a week with David \nMcCullough at the Adams House in Quincy, MA.\n  Finally, a 10-State pilot program in U.S. history NAEP. Currently, \nthe National Assessment of Education Progress--the Nation's report \ncard--only measures student achievement in history every 4 years. We \ndon't get State-level data; only a national sample of student \nachievement. Senator Kennedy and I have offered legislation to create a \n10-State pilot program so there can be State-level data for 10 States, \nwhich will reflect the importance of this subject to our Nation and \ncall attention to student progress or lack thereof in American history.\n  A second area of special emphasis that ought to be considered when we \nreauthorize No Child Left Behind is the Teacher Incentive Fund. After \nparents, nothing is more important to a child's success than the \nclassroom teacher. In every hearing we have in the Senate, a witness \nemphasizes the need to attract specially equipped teachers for math, \nfor science, for children with disabilities, for inner-city schools, \nfor gifted students, and other special needs. Yet we struggle in this \ncountry with an across-the-board pay mentality that will not allow \nschools to lift themselves up when it comes to attracting and keeping \noutstanding classroom teachers.\n  Finding fair ways to pay teachers more for teaching well is not easy. \nI have tried it. But during the last 5 years, the Teacher Incentive \nFund has helped at least three dozen cities, usually working with local \nteachers' unions, to find new ways to train and reward outstanding \nteachers and principals. We need to do as much of this as we possibly \ncan. I wish to thank and acknowledge Senator Durbin of Illinois, the \nDemocratic whip, for working with me to make certain that \nappropriations for this program continue.\n  Then, charter schools. I mentioned earlier the Presiding Officer was \na national leader on charter schools when he was Governor of Delaware. \nLast year, I visited a charter school in Memphis. It was the Easter \nholiday, except those ninth graders weren't on vacation, they were in \nclass. To be specific, they were in a ninth grade advanced\n\n[[Page S13993]]\n\nplacement biology class. What was special was these children had come \nfrom so-called low-performing schools. To be blunt, they were labeled \nthe least likely to succeed, except they were succeeding. This was \nbecause they were getting extra help during holidays, longer school \ndays, Saturdays, and from special teachers.\n  The idea of a public charter school is simply to give teachers the \nfreedom to use their common sense and their skills to help the children \nwho are presented to them--freedom from Federal, State, and union rules \nso they can do it. It is nonsensical to me that we don't encourage, \nrather than discourage, such public charter schools.\n  Most of our children are learning, but for the 15 percent or so who \nare having genuinely special challenges in learning, it will take \ndifferent kinds of schools, even better teachers and different methods. \nIn this reauthorization of No Child Left Behind, we must do all of \nthese things to cause that to happen.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter addressed to Senator Kennedy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2312\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Over \n     the past 5 years, state and school district leaders, \n     teachers, parents, and students have made great efforts to \n     increase accountability and improve student achievement as \n     they have worked to comply with the No Child Left Behind Act. \n     I worry about efforts to inappropriately increase federal \n     control of decisions regarding education policy that are best \n     made at the state and local level in the name of greater \n     accountability. Unfortunately, in many respects, more \n     mandates from Washington may also lead to less \n     accountability. The worst outcome for this Congress would be \n     to reauthorize the law with more federal control and less \n     actual accountability.\n       I believe we have a responsibility to provide the utmost \n     flexibility to states and local school districts, while still \n     ensuring accountability for all students. Despite the common \n     desire to use the power of Washington to override what we may \n     think are bad decisions by individual states, we must refrain \n     from acting as a national school board and imposing one-size-\n     fits-all decisions from here in Washington. States must \n     maintain the necessary flexibility to reach the broad goals \n     we ask them to achieve; they should not be treated as \n     experimental sites for our good ideas.\n       The past five years since enactment of NCLB have proven \n     effective in transforming the landscape of education across \n     the country, and we cannot afford to turn away from decades \n     of standards based reform and the use of rigorous state \n     assessments to measure school accountability. However, in \n     light of recent proposals made public by the House Committee \n     on Education and Labor, as well as those by many in the \n     advocacy community, I am concerned about the desire to exert \n     greater federal control over decisions best left at the state \n     and local level at the expense of accountability. I am \n     particularly concerned about the following concepts.\n       Federally Mandated `n' Size: I believe that we should \n     continue to allow states to set uniform `n' sizes for \n     accountability. An `n' size is the minimum number of students \n     that must be present in a group or subgroup before a school \n     has to be held accountable for that group's academic \n     progress. Proposals have been put forth to establish a \n     maximum `n' size for accountability purposes. States \n     currently have `n' sizes ranging from 5 to 200. I understand \n     the intent of such proposals given isolated abuses of the \n     provision by individual states. But the law gives states \n     flexibility to take into account various elements such as the \n     complexity of the state data system, the diversity of the \n     student population, school size, district size, the rigor of \n     state assessments, and other factors when making decisions \n     about their use of an `n' size. Mandating a maximum number \n     from Washington not only runs afoul of the intended state-\n     level decision making in the law, but may jeopardize \n     statistical reliability in some states. Moreover, by \n     legislating a number that may be significantly higher than \n     some states have already set, we may be sending a mixed \n     signal and encouraging those states to set higher `n' sizes \n     and thus reduce accountability in their states.\n       Federally Mandated Confidence Intervals: I believe that we \n     should continue to allow states to establish confidence \n     intervals on their data. A confidence interval, similar to a \n     margin of error on a poll, is another statistical methodology \n     to ensure the reliability of data. States currently have \n     confidence intervals that range between 95 percent and 99 \n     percent, and some use other figures for measuring growth, \n     safe harbor, and other decisions. States are responsible for \n     setting these numbers and including them in their state plan \n     which was reviewed by the U.S. Department of Education. \n     Mandating a specific number from Washington would again \n     reduce flexibility for each state to take into account the \n     special circumstances within its borders and develop a \n     comprehensive data plan based on those circumstances. A \n     federal mandate could also lead to the unintended consequence \n     of reducing accountability in those states that would face \n     internal pressure to lower their standards to meet whatever \n     level is placed in the statute.\n\n[[Page S13996]]\n\n       Adequate Yearly Progress: I believe that we should allow \n     states to use growth models based on reaching `proficient' \n     targets to measure progress. One of the driving forces behind \n     No Child Left Behind, and its primary success, is the focus \n     across the country toward getting all students to a \n     `proficient' level of achievement by the 2013-2014 school \n     year. This is a tough goal, and one that we know many schools \n     find difficult to achieve. As a nation we tend to set high \n     goals, almost unachievable goals, and then work hard to try \n     to reach them. Because of the rigor of the 2013-2014 goal, \n     proposals have been put forth to give schools credit for \n     students reaching `basic' levels of achievement as opposed to \n     `proficient' achievement. This should be considered a \n     wholesale retreat from the core principle of the law of \n     accountability for all students.\n       `Basic' performance on a test is usually not considered \n     sufficient to ensure high school graduation or attain college \n     enrollment without remediation. I support giving states and \n     school districts flexibility to meet the overriding goal of \n     getting all students to `proficient' levels of achievement. \n     To do that we should follow the lead of states like North \n     Carolina, Tennessee, Delaware, and Maryland and allow states \n     to use growth models to track individual progress over time \n     towards proficiency.\n       Early Childhood Program: I believe that we should not \n     create a duplicative early childhood program that would \n     compete with the existing federal programs Before asking what \n     a new federal early childhood program should look like, we \n     should be asking whether current programs are adequately \n     funded and whether they are effective. According to the \n     General Accountability Office there are 69 early childhood \n     education and care programs, administered by 10 different \n     federal agencies, receiving over $20 billion. We should be \n     looking at how we enhance the efficiency of these programs \n     before we layer another on.\n       High School Reform: I believe that Congress should \n     authorize a competitive program with a matching requirement \n     to states to help them reform our nation's high schools and \n     that it would be a mistake to mandate specific reforms from \n     Washington on all our nation's high schools. Tremendous \n     effort is underway at the state and local level to transform \n     our nation's high schools. Many of our nation's governors and \n     school district officials are working diligently with \n     philanthropic organizations like the Gates Foundation and \n     Broad Foundation to learn how to improve high schools and \n     build on successful research to develop promising models of \n     reform. While there is some valuable research that shows some \n     promising methods, it is inappropriate for Congress to assume \n     that there is a limited set of choices on how to transform \n     our nation's high schools. Instead of prescribing a limited \n     set of reforms and mandating those reforms upon the states, \n     we should find ways to encourage these continued efforts at \n     the state and local level. It would be preferable to offer a \n     competitive program where the states or local school \n     districts find matching resources from the business community \n     or philanthropic organizations, rather than develop a limited \n     formula program that tries to proscribe reform without \n     sufficient resources to actually provide it.\n       High School Graduation: I believe that Congress should not \n     put into law a complex definition or graduation outcome \n     requirements that interferes with current state leadership \n     efforts on improving high school graduation results. Our \n     nation faces significant problems with low high school \n     graduation rates and poor student performance in our nation's \n     postsecondary education institutions. State and local \n     educational leaders are working diligently to address those \n     problems. But proposals have been put forth to improve high \n     school graduation rates by imposing a complex definition and \n     goal setting process that do not reflect the efforts already \n     underway.\n       We should instead allow states to develop their own goals \n     for improving high school graduation rates as part of their \n     comprehensive state plan. We must be mindful of the \n     leadership already being offered by the states. The National \n     Governors Association has demonstrated strong commitment \n     towards developing a uniform definition of graduation rate, \n     and Congress should not interfere or override those efforts. \n     If Congress were to override the efforts already being taken \n     by the NGA, or override the efforts of individual governors \n     in working with such leaders as the Diploma Project, we would \n     lose valuable years of work and effort by leaders in the \n     states.\n       I understand that staff discussions have been ongoing for \n     several months regarding proposals for the reauthorization of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and that many of \n     these areas are still open for improvement. I appreciate the \n     hard work and diligent effort of the staff, but I hope to \n     have at least ten business days to review any final draft \n     legislation so that I can consult with education leaders in \n     my state and across the country so that I can provide \n     suggested comments and revisions before this Committee is to \n     markup a bill. It would be helpful for me to have that \n     opportunity as I determine whether the bill meets my \n     priorities for ensuring state and local control of education \n     decisions.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lamar Alexander,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 2313. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to enhance \nefforts to address antimicrobial resistance; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Strategies to \nAddress Antimicrobial Resistance Act. This bill, also known as the \nSTAAR Act, is meant to reinvigorate efforts to combat antimicrobial \nresistance--efforts that accelerated in the late 90s but then stalled.\n  I want to thank Senator Hatch for his leadership on this issue and \nfor introducing this bill with me. I look forward to working with him \nto ensure it passage.\n  Antibiotics are the cornerstone of modern medicine, relied on to \ntreat countless diseases and responsible for some of the great advances \nin public health in the 20th century. But over time, bacteria, viruses, \nand other pathogens have mutated to develop resistance to antibiotic \ndrugs. This is a dangerous setback for modern medicine. Infections \ncaused by drug-resistant bacteria can cause serious, prolonged, and \ndebilitating illnesses, and even death.\n  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, is a drug \nresistant infection that can be contracted not only in hospitals but in \ncommunity settings such as gyms and playgrounds. A study that was \npublished in the Journal of the American Medical Association last month \nprojected that the number of deaths from MRSA exceeded the number from \nAIDS in 2005. That statistic alone should be a wake-up call for \nAmerica. We need to respond quickly to this problem, because it will \nonly grow worse with time.\n  We are creating these deadly infections. We create them by using \nantibiotics when we do not need to and by not following through on the \nfull regimen of antibiotic therapies as prescribed. More consistent and \nthorough hand washing in health care settings can also make a huge \ndifference.\n  Several of our Government agencies are involved in efforts to address \nantimicrobial resistance. However, we need more coordination among all \nthe federal agencies involved. This bill seeks to facilitate that \ncoordination by establishing an Office of Antimicrobial Resistance at \nthe Department of Health and Human Services. The bill also reauthorizes \nan interagency task force that has already done significant legwork on \nthis issue so that, spearheaded by the coordinating office, Federal \nagencies can turn that legwork into action. The STAAR Act calls for a \ncomprehensive research plan that would identify knowledge gaps and \nrecommend strategies for filling those gaps. It would significantly \nimprove surveillance by establishing a multi-site surveillance network \nand working to ensure uniformity in State collection of antimicrobial \nresistance data.\n  Drug-resistant infections set back the clock on medical progress. \nThey cost money and more importantly, they take lives. We need to take \nantimicrobial resistance seriously and fight it with as much passion as \nwe fight any potential killer.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as recent events in neighboring Virginia \nhave made all too clear, this country faces a number of troubling \nquestions about whether we are prepared to address the growing problem \nof drug-resistant, bacterial infections. Indeed, while recent media \nreports have raised the visibility of this issue, infectious disease \ndoctors have been sounding the alarm for years.\n  Now, Senator Brown and I are sounding the alarm as well.\n  Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that \nresistant strains of infections have spread rapidly. This alarming \ntrend continues to grow and treatment options are sorely lacking.\n  Senator Brown and I have collaborated to develop legislation that \ntakes a science-based approach to this problem. This legislation, the \nStrategies to Address Antimicrobial Resistance Act or STAAR Act S. \n2313, should be seen as a measure to catalyze a greater Government \nfocus on a frightening, growing, public health problem which should be \nof concern to each and every one of us in this Nation.\n\n[[Page S13997]]\n\n  One of the things that Senator Brown and I have found in our \nconsiderable study of this issue is that there is not adequate \ninfrastructure developed within the Government to collect the data, to \ncoordinate the research, and to conduct the surveillance necessary to \nstop drug-resistant infections in their tracks.\n  We believe that jump-starting a greater, stronger, organizational \nfocus at the Department of Health and Human Services will help our \nGovernment and our scientists develop an infrastructure that can grow \nas science develops.\n  At the same time, we make perfectly clear that our bill is not the \nsole answer to the complex, vexing problem of antibiotic resistance. At \na minimum we need better testing, better hospital controls, better \nmedications, and better funding to support these efforts, particularly \nthe work of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  The Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Institute of \nMedicine, the Resources for the Future, the Centers for Disease \nControl, and many others have been sounding the alarm about the growing \nthreat from resistant microorganisms.\n  Congress must listen.\n  In fact, it its seminal report, ``Bad Bugs, No Drugs'', the \nInfectious Diseases Society, IDSA, said:\n\n       Drug-resistant bacterial infections kill tens of thousands \n     of Americans every year and a growing number of individuals \n     are succumbing to community-acquired infections. An epidemic \n     may harm millions. Unless Congress and the Administration \n     move with urgency to address these infections now, there is a \n     very good chance that U.S. patients will suffer greatly in \n     the future.\n\n  Indeed, the seminal IDSA report points out a number of compelling \nfacts.\n  As the report notes, infections caused by resistant bacteria can \nstrike anyone, young and old, rich or poor, healthy or ill. However, \nthe problem of antibiotic resistance is especially acute for patients \nwith compromised immune systems, such as persons living with HIV/AIDS.\n  The scope of the problem is equally of note. As IDSA has calculated, \nabout 2 million people acquire bacterial infections in U.S. hospitals \neach year and as many as 90,000 die as a result. More and more, public \nhealth experts are finding infections developed in the home or \ncommunity as well. Infections in both settings are increasing, and the \nresultant drug resistance shows no sign of lessening.\n  This is a costly problem, costly for patients, for society, and \npotentially threatening to our global security.\n  And, in fact, health care providers are running out of treatments as \nthe resistance problem grows.\n  Nobel Laureate Joshua Lederberg said it well: ``We are running out of \nbullets for dealing with a number of bacterial, infections. Patients \nare dying because we no longer in many cases have antibiotics that \nwork.''\n  Indeed, last week, noted Utah infectious disease expert Dr. Andy \nPavia told me about a 14-year-old boy he had treated who had bone, \nmuscle and lung infections from MRSA, an aggressive, difficult to \ntreat, form of staph that has spread rapidly within communities. Half \nof the children he sees with severe MRSA infections acquired their \ninfection at home.\n\n  This young man, Dr. Pavia relates, was forced to undergo multiple \nsurgeries and 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. MRSA infections are \nsteadily increasing in Utah, as well as across all other States.\n  Fortunately, that young man is on the road to recovery. But the \nstatistics indicate it is just as likely that he would not be.\n  We are not only talking about MRSA. Dr. Pavia also cites the real \ncrisis growing with resistant gram-negative bacteria, which he calls \nthe ``Rodney Dangerfield of the infectious disease world''--in other \nwords, ``it don't get no respect.''\n  We are also seeing increases in extensively drug-resistant, XDR, \ntuberculosis. There are numerous reports of soldiers returning home \nfrom Iraq with Acinetobactor--a resistant infection that is especially \ndifficult to treat, and the only option is a very toxic antibiotic.\n  Senator Brown and I have worked on this issue for many months, \nstarting with our collaboration on provisions in the Food and Drug Act \nAmendments recently signed into law by the President. We are also \nworking with our colleagues in the House, foremost among them Utah \nCongressman Jim Matheson, author of the House STAAR Act.\n  Our conclusion is that the solutions to this problem are manifold, \nbut they must start with a stronger Government effort. That is the \ngenesis of the STAAR Act.\n  Let me review briefly what our legislation does.\n  The bill makes a series of congressional findings which layout the \nproblem and the need to address it.\n  In particular, we note that while the advent of the antibiotic era \nhas saved millions of lives and allowed for incredible medical \nprogress, the increased use and overuse of antimicrobial drugs have \ncorrelated with an increase in the rates of antimicrobial resistance.\n  An important component to this problem is the fact that scientific \nevidence suggests the source of antimicrobial resistance in people is \nnot only the overuse of human drugs, but also it may be from food-\nproducing animals, which are exposed to antimicrobial drugs.\n  As scientists have found, nearly 70 percent of hospital-acquired \nbacterial infections in the U.S. are resistant to at least one drug; in \nsome cases, the rate is much higher. In fact, each year nearly 2 \nmillion people contract bacterial infections in the hospital, and it is \nestimated that 90,000 of them die from the infections.\n  There seem to be no recent data on the costs associated with this \nproblem, but a 1995 report by the Office of Technology Assessment found \nthat six different antimicrobial-resistant strains of bacteria \naccounted for $1.3 billion in nationwide hospital costs--almost $1.9 \nbillion in 2006 dollars!\n  Here is how our bill attempts to address the problems I have just \nlaid out.\n  First, the bill establishes a new Office of Antimicrobial Resistance \nin the Department of Health and Human Services. That Office will work \nwith the Task Force to issue biennial updates to the Public Health \nAction Plan to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance, including enhanced \nplans for addressing the problem here and abroad. As appropriate, the \nOffice's Director will establish benchmarks for achieving the plan's \ngoals, assess patterns of antimicrobial resistance emergence and their \nimpact on clinical outcomes, determine how antimicrobial products are \nbeing used in humans, animals and plants, and recommend where \nadditional federally-supported studies may be beneficial.\n  Second, we renew the Antimicrobial Resistance Task Force authorized \nin section 319E of the Public Health Service Act. The Task Force, whose \nauthorization lapsed last year, is comprised of representatives from \nthe following Federal agencies and offices, plus any others the \nSecretary deems necessary: the new Office of Antimicrobial Resistance \nestablished in the bill; the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and \nResponse; the Centers for Disease Control; the Food and Drug \nAdministration; the National Institutes of Health; the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality; the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices; the Health Resources and Services Administration; the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency; and the Departments of Agriculture, \nEducation, Defense, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, and State.\n  It is important to note that Senator Brown and I gave careful \nconsideration to the location of this new Office.\n  We considered locating it at the CDC, the Office of the Assistant \nSecretary for Health (OASH), and in the Office of the Secretary, OS. \nThere are benefits and drawbacks to each. Indeed, had OASH its previous \norganizational structure, that is, line authority over the Public \nHealth Service agencies, that decision would have been easy. But since \na change was made many years ago to devolve most of the OASH functions \nto the separate PHS agencies, OASH was not the natural locus for the \nnew Office, we decided. Our final conclusion was that it was most \nappropriate to locate the new office in OS, both for reasons of \nprominence and flexibility.\n  Third, S. 2313 establishes a Public Health Antimicrobial Advisory \nBoard, a panel of outside experts who will advise the Secretary on ways \nto encourage an adequate supply of antimicrobial products that are both \nsafe\n\n[[Page S13998]]\n\nand effective; help determine what research priorities should be, what \ndata and surveillance are necessary to be collected, and assess how the \naction plan can be updated and strengthened.\n  It is very important to Senator Brown, if I may speak for him, and to \nme that our measure be seen as a collaborative effort that draws on the \nstrengths of existing organizations and catalyzes their efforts for \ngreater good.\n  So, fourth, our bill requires the Secretary--working through the new \nOffice, the CDC and the NIH, in consultation with other appropriate \nagencies--to develop a antimicrobial resistance strategic research plan \nthat strengthens existing epidemiological, interventional, clinical, \nbehavioral, translational and basic research efforts to advance our \nunderstanding of the emergence of resistance and how best to address \nit.\n  Fifth, the bill authorizes establishment of at least 10 Antimicrobial \nResistance Clinical Research and Public Health Network sites, \ngeographically dispersed across the U.S. The sites will monitor the \nemergence of resistant pathogens in individuals, study the epidemiology \nof such pathogens and evaluate the efficacy of interventions, and study \nproblems associated with antimicrobial use. In addition, we are asking \nthe network to assess the feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and \nappropriateness of surveillance and screening programs in differing \nhealth care and institutional settings, such as schools, and evaluate \ncurrent treatment protocols and make appropriate recommendations on \nbest practices for treating drug resistant infections. It is my hope \nthe network will be able to take into account successful models for \nsurveillance and screening such as inpatient programs of the Veterans \nHealth Administration, work done in States such as Illinois, New York \nand the Utah Aware program, and experience overseas in countries such \nas the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland. Our bill authorizes $45 \nmillion for these networks in fiscal year 2008, $65 million next year, \nand $120 million in fiscal year 2010.\n  Finally, I would like to speak about data collection activities in S. \n2313.\n  It has become obvious to me that there is a pressing need for better \nsurveillance of antibiotic resistance and better data collection that \nis shared both within States and across States. From my long work on \npublic health issues, it is equally clear to me that there is a need \nfor the government to give guidance--guidance, not a mandate--on \nuniform ways in which those data should be collected so that all of the \nagencies are talking the same talk, so speak.\n  Our bill asks the Office of Antimicrobial Research to work with the \nTask Force and member agencies to develop those uniform standards for \ndata collection. In drafting S. 2313, Senator Brown and I were very \nsensitive to the jurisdictional needs of other Committees. At the same \ntime, it is clear that any serious effort to address antimicrobial \nresistance must be spread across the many agencies of Government, each \nof which has a role to play in our collaborative effort. It is for that \nreason that our bill asks the Office and Task Force to work with the \nother agencies, some of which do not fall within the jurisdiction of \nthe HELP Committee. If this language needs to be strengthened as \nconsideration of S. 2313 progresses, it is our hope to work with the \nother committees which have an interest in the bill.\n  A second issue related to data collection is the fact that there is a \npressing need for epidemiologists and other public health experts to \nbegin to see data showing how many antibiotics are being distributed \nand used by patients so that they can evaluate the amount of resistance \nthat is emerging. In writing our bill, we were sensitive to the need to \nprovide scientists with these data, while at the same time working to \nmake any new reporting provisions the least burdensome possible, while \nprotecting both the national security and propriety aspects of those \ndata. For that reason, our bill builds on current reporting to the FDA \nof pharmaceutical distribution data. Those data are currently submitted \nby manufacturers on the anniversary date of the product's approval. Our \nbill would move that reporting date to 60 days after the beginning of \neach calendar year, thus allowing epidemiologists to compare data from \nyear to year. Our second concern, that of potentially harmful release \nof data, was addressed in the following way. Our bill precludes the \nrelease of data which are proprietary in nature and whose release could \nhave the perverse result of providing a disincentive to antibiotic \ndevelopment. This strong section, section 7 of the bill, also precludes \nrelease of data which could be harmful to our national defense.\n  In closing, I wish to commend S. 2313 to my colleagues and ask for \ntheir serious consideration of this measure. For those who doubt the \nneed for this legislation, if there are any doubters among us, I ask \nthe following questions:\n  Where do we begin to get serious to address this concern?\n  Where do we begin to recognize that it will take literally years to \ndevelop an effective response?\n  What are we doing to develop the collaboration across agencies to \nassure the American public we are developing an action plan to combat \nthe problem?\n  It is our hope that STAAR Act will begin to catalyze that response.\n  That is the motive behind our introduction of this legislation.\n  We look forward to working with our colleagues on the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee as consideration of this \nlegislation begins and we remain available to our colleagues to answer \nany questions or concerns they may have about this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Tester):\n  S. 2314. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \ngeothermal heat pump systems eligible for the energy credit and the \nresidential energy efficient property credit, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, today I am joining my colleague Senator \nInhofe in introducing the bipartisan Geothermal Heat Pump Development \nAct of 2007, which would provide American homes and businesses with tax \ncredits to promote greater use of geothermal heat pumps, GHPs. \nGeothermal heat pumps are electrically-powered devices that use the \nearth's natural heat storage ability to heat and cool homes and meet \nenergy demands.\n  Buildings account for 39 percent of the primary energy consumption in \nthe U.S. and 71 percent of U.S. electricity consumption. The lion's \nshare of this energy usage is for heating, cooling, and hot water. \nMaking our buildings more energy efficient will therefore pay large \nenergy dividends. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, \nGHPs are the most energy-efficient and environmentally clean space-\nconditioning systems currently in use. GHPs can reduce site energy \nconsumption for climate control and water heating by as much as 40 \npercent compared to air-source heat pumps and as much as 70 percent \ncompared to a fossil fuel heating system and air-conditioner.\n  However, in the absence of Federal tax credits to help mitigate the \ncomparatively high installation costs associated with geothermal heat \npump systems, American homeowners and businesses are reluctant to tap \ninto this reliable technology. The Salazar-Inhofe bill would help \novercome these cost barriers by amending current tax code to make \ngeothermal heat pump systems eligible for the energy tax credit and the \nresidential energy efficient property tax credit, for businesses and \nconsumers, respectively.\n  Specifically, businesses could claim an investment tax credit in the \namount of 10 percent of the installed cost of a new geothermal heat \npump system, and could claim an accelerated 3-year depreciation on such \nequipment. For example, a business owner that spends $30,000 on a new \nGHP system would get a $3,000 tax credit and the accelerated \ndepreciation provision would allow that business greater flexibility in \nreporting this capital expense. Consumers could claim a credit in the \namount of 30 percent of the installed cost of a new geothermal heat \npump system up to a maximum credit of $2,000, so that, for example, a \nhome owner who purchases a $15,000 GHP system would receive a $2,000 \ntax credit. This consumer tax credit would be allowable against the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  Geothermal heat pumps are proven renewable energy technologies with \nsignificant energy efficiency gains and\n\n[[Page S13999]]\n\nlong-term cost-savings potential compared to conventional climate \ncontrol systems. Geothermal heat pumps typically cost more than twice \nas much as a conventional fossil fuel furnace, but GHPs' impressive \nefficiency gains allow a home or business owner to recoup their up-\nfront costs within about ten years.\n  Since their introduction in the 1980s, over 1 million GHPs have been \ninstalled in a wide variety of buildings, and in a diverse range of \nclimates, across the U.S. Senator Inhofe and I are optimistic that the \nwidespread adoption of geothermal heat pumps will not only save energy, \nbut also create good local jobs. Because GHP systems can be deployed \nvirtually anywhere, the demand for qualified engineers who can install \nand maintain these systems would surely expand.\n  Geothermal heat pumps should be an important element of our efforts \nto enhance our buildings' energy efficiency. By making it easier for \nAmerican homes and business to embrace these extremely effective energy \ntechnologies, we will help develop a more secure, efficient and \nsustainable domestic energy program founded on clean, renewable and \nreliable energy alternatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/06/senate-section/article/S13999-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 367--COMMEMORATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MASS \n  MOVEMENT FOR SOVIET JEWISH FREEDOM AND THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n       FREEDOM SUNDAY RALLY FOR SOVIET JEWRY ON THE NATIONAL MALL\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Smith, Mr. Voinovich, \nMr. Biden, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Martinez, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Cardin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Wyden, and \nMr. Casey) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 367\n\n       Whereas Jews living in the former Soviet Union were an \n     oppressed cultural minority who faced systematic, state-\n     sponsored discrimination and difficulties in exercising their \n     religion and culture, including the study of the Hebrew \n     language;\n       Whereas, in 1964, the American Jewish Conference on Soviet \n     Jewry (AJCSJ) was founded to spearhead a national campaign on \n     behalf of Soviet Jewry;\n       Whereas, in 1964, the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry was \n     founded to demand freedom for Soviet Jewry;\n       Whereas, in 1964, thousands of college students rallied on \n     behalf of Soviet Jewry in front of the United Nations;\n       Whereas Israel's victory in the 1967 Six-Day War inspired \n     Soviet Jews to intensify their efforts to win the right to \n     emigrate;\n       Whereas, in 1967, the Soviet Union began an anti-Zionist \n     propaganda campaign in the state-controlled mass media and a \n     crackdown on Jewish autonomy, galvanizing a mass advocacy \n     movement in the United States;\n       Whereas the Union of Councils for Soviet Jewry was founded \n     in 1970 as a coalition of local grassroots ``action'' \n     councils supporting freedom for the Jews of the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas, in 1971, the severe sentences, including death, \n     meted out to 9 Jews from Leningrad who attempted to hijack a \n     plane to flee the Soviet Union spurred worldwide protests;\n       Whereas, in 1971, the National Conference on Soviet Jewry \n     (NCSJ) succeeded the AJCSJ;\n       Whereas, in 1971, mass emigration of Jews from the Soviet \n     Union began;\n       Whereas, in 1974, Senator Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson and \n     Congressman Charles Vanik successfully attached an amendment \n     to the Trade Act of 1974 linking trade benefits, now known as \n     Normal Trade Relations, to the emigration and human rights \n     practices of Communist countries, including the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas, in 1975, President Gerald R. Ford signed into law \n     the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, after \n     both houses of Congress unanimously backed it;\n       Whereas, in 1978, the Congressional Wives for Soviet Jewry \n     was founded;\n       Whereas, in 1982, President Ronald Reagan signed into law \n     House Joint Resolution 373 (subsequently Public Law 97-157), \n     expressing the sense of the Congress that the Soviet Union \n     should cease its repressive actions against those who seek \n     the freedom to emigrate or to practice their religious or \n     cultural traditions, drawing special attention to the \n     hardships and discrimination imposed upon the Jewish \n     community in the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas, in 1983, the bipartisan Congressional Human Rights \n     Caucus was founded to advance the cause of human rights;\n       Whereas, in 1984, the Congressional Coalition for Soviet \n     Jews was founded;\n       Whereas, on December 6, 1987, an estimated 250,000 people \n     demonstrated on the National Mall in Washington, DC in \n     support of freedom for Soviet Jews, in advance of a summit \n     between Mikhail Gorbachev and President Reagan;\n       Whereas, in 1989, the former Soviet Union opened its doors \n     to allow the millions of Soviet Jews who had been held as \n     virtual prisoners within their own country to leave the \n     country;\n       Whereas, in 1991, the Supreme Soviet passed a law that \n     codified the right of every citizen of the Soviet Union to \n     emigrate, precipitating massive emigration by Jews, primarily \n     to Israel and the United States;\n       Whereas, since 1975, more than 500,000 refugees from areas \n     of the former Soviet Union--many of them Jews, evangelical \n     Christians, and Catholics--have resettled in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the Soviet Jewish community in the United States \n     today numbers between 750,000 and 1,000,000, though some \n     estimates are twice as high;\n       Whereas Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union have \n     greatly enriched the United States in areas as diverse as \n     business, professional sports, the arts, politics, and \n     philanthropy;\n       Whereas, in 1992, Congress passed the Freedom Support Act, \n     making aid for the 15 independent states of the former Soviet \n     Union contingent on progress toward democratic self-\n     government and respect for human rights;\n       Whereas, since 2000, more than 400 independent Jewish \n     cultural organizations and 30 Jewish day schools have been \n     established in the independent states of the former Soviet \n     Union;

which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation:\n\n                              S. Res. 368\n\n       Whereas Atlantic bluefin tuna are a valuable commercial and \n     recreational fishery of the United States and many other \n     countries;\n       Whereas the International Convention for the Conservation \n     of Atlantic Tunas entered into force on March 21, 1969;\n       Whereas the Convention established the International \n     Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas to \n     coordinate international research and develop, implement, and \n     enforce compliance of the conservation and management \n     recommendations on the Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly \n     migratory species in the Atlantic Ocean and the adjacent \n     seas, including the Mediterranean Sea;\n       Whereas in 1974, the Commission adopted its first \n     conservation and management recommendation to ensure the \n     sustainability of Atlantic bluefin tuna throughout the \n     Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, while allowing for the \n     maximum sustainable catch for food and other purposes;\n\n[[Page S14000]]\n\n       Whereas in 1981, for management purposes, the Commission \n     adopted a working hypothesis of 2 Atlantic bluefin tuna \n     stocks, with 1 occurring west of 45 degrees west longitude \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``western Atlantic stock'') \n     and the other occurring east of 45 degrees west longitude \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean stock'');\n       Whereas, despite scientific recommendations intended to \n     maintain bluefin tuna populations at levels that will permit \n     the maximum sustainable yield and ensure the future of the \n     stocks, the total allowable catch quotas have been \n     consistently set at levels significantly higher than the \n     recommended levels for the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \n     stock;\n       Whereas despite the establishment by the Commission of \n     fishing quotas based on total allowable catch levels for the \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery that \n     exceed scientific recommendations, compliance with such \n     quotas by parties to the Convention that harvest that stock \n     has been extremely poor, most recently with harvests \n     exceeding such total allowable catch levels by more than 50 \n     percent for each of the last 4 years;\n       Whereas insufficient data reporting in combination with \n     unreliable national catch statistics has frequently \n     undermined efforts by the Commission to assign quota \n     overharvests to specific countries;\n       Whereas the failure of many Commission members fishing east \n     of 45 degrees west longitude to comply with other Commission \n     recommendations to conserve and control the overfished \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna stock has \n     been an ongoing problem;\n       Whereas the Commission's Standing Committee on Research and \n     Statistics noted in its 2006 report that the fishing \n     mortality rate for the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \n     stock may be more than 3 times the level that would permit \n     the stock to stabilize at the maximum sustainable catch \n     level, and continuing to fish at the level of recent years \n     ``is expected to drive the spawning biomass to a very low \n     level'' giving ``rise to a high risk of fishery and stock \n     collapse'';\n       Whereas the Standing Committee has recommended that the \n     annual harvest levels for eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \n     bluefin tuna be reduced from 32,000 metric tons to \n     approximately 15,000 metric tons to halt decline of the \n     resource and initiate rebuilding, and the United States \n     supported this recommendation at the 2006 Commission meeting;\n       Whereas in 2006, the Commission adopted the \n     ``Recommendation by ICCAT to Establish a Multi-Annual \n     Recovery Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean'' containing a wide range of management, \n     monitoring, and control measures designed to facilitate the \n     recovery of the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin \n     tuna stock;\n       Whereas the Recovery Plan is inadequate and allows \n     overfishing and stock decline to continue, and initial \n     information indicates that implementation of the plan in 2007 \n     by many eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna \n     harvesting countries has been poor;\n       Whereas since 1981, the Commission has adopted additional \n     and more restrictive conservation and management \n     recommendations for the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock, \n     and these recommendations have been implemented by Nations \n     fishing west of 45 degrees west longitude, including the \n     United States,\n       Whereas despite adopting, fully implementing, and complying \n     with a science-based rebuilding program for the western \n     Atlantic bluefin tuna stock by countries fishing west of 45 \n     degrees west longitude, catches and catch rates remain very \n     low;\n       Whereas many scientists believe that mixing occurs between \n     the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock and the eastern \n     Atlantic and Mediterranean stock, and as such, poor \n     management and noncompliance with recommendations for one \n     stock are likely to have an adverse effect on the other \n     stock;\n       Whereas additional research on stock mixing will improve \n     the understanding of the relationship between eastern and \n     western bluefin tuna stocks and other fisheries, which will \n     assist in the conservation, recovery, and management of the \n     species throughout its range: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate That it is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States delegation to the 20th Regular Meeting \n     of the International Commission for the Conservation of \n     Atlantic Tunas, should--\n       (1) seek the adoption of a harvesting moratorium, which \n     includes appropriate mechanisms to ensure compliance, on the \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery of \n     sufficient duration to begin the process of stock recovery \n     and allow for the development and implementation of an \n     effective program of monitoring and control on the fishery \n     when the moratorium ends;\n       (2) seek to strengthen the conservation and management of \n     the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna by making \n     recommendations to halt the decline of the stock and begin to \n     rebuild it;\n       (3) reevaluate the implementation, effectiveness, and \n     relevance of the Commission recommendation entitled \n     ``Recommendation by ICCAT to Establish a Multi-Annual \n     Recovery Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean'' (Recommendation 06-05), and seek from \n     Commission members that have failed to fully implement the \n     terms of the recommendations detailed justification for their \n     lack of compliance;\n       (4) pursue a review and assessment of compliance with \n     conservation and management measures adopted by the \n     Commission and in effect for the 2006 eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery, occurring east of 45 \n     degrees west longitude, and other fisheries that are subject \n     to the jurisdiction of the Commission, including data \n     collection and reporting requirements;\n       (5) seek to address noncompliance by parties to the \n     Convention with such measures through appropriate actions, \n     including, as appropriate, deducting a portion of a future \n     quota for a party to compensate for such party exceeding its \n     quota in prior years; and\n       (6) pursue additional research on the relationship between \n     the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \n     bluefin tuna stocks and the extent to which the populations \n     intermingle.\n\n

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S14003]]\n\n       (1) Pet turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter have \n     been banned for sale in the United States by the Food and \n     Drug Administration since 1975 due to health concerns.\n       (2) The Food and Drug Administration does not ban the sale \n     of iguanas or other lizards, snakes, frogs, or other \n     amphibians or reptiles that are sold as pets in the United \n     States that carry salmonella bacteria. The Food and Drug \n     Administration also does not require that these animals be \n     treated for salmonella bacteria before being sold as pets.\n       (3) The technology to treat turtles for salmonella, and \n     make them safe for sale, has greatly advanced since 1975. \n     Treatments exist that can nearly eradicate salmonella from \n     turtles, and individuals are more aware of the causes of \n     salmonella, how to treat salmonella poisoning, and the \n     seriousness associated with salmonella poisoning.\n       (4) University research has shown that these turtles can be \n     treated in such a way that they can be raised, shipped, and \n     distributed without having a recolonization of salmonella.\n       (5) University research has also shown that pet owners can \n     be equipped with a treatment regimen that allows the turtle \n     to be maintained safe from salmonella.\n       (6) The Food and Drug Administration should allow the sale \n     of turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter as pets as \n     long as the sellers are required to use proven methods to \n     treat these turtles for salmonella.\n\n     SEC. __. SALE OF BABY TURTLES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Food and Drug Administration shall not restrict the \n     sale by a turtle farmer, wholesaler, or commercial retail \n     seller of a turtle that is less than 10.2 centimeters in \n     diameter as a pet if--\n       (1) the State or territory in which the pet turtle farmer \n     of the turtle is located has developed a regulatory process \n     by which pet turtle farmers are required to have a State \n     license to breed, hatch, propagate, raise, grow, receive, \n     ship, transport, export, or sell pet turtles or pet turtle \n     eggs;\n       (2) such State or territory requires certification of \n     sanitization that is signed by a veterinarian who is licensed \n     in the State or territory, and approved by the State or \n     territory agency in charge of regulating the sale of pet \n     turtles;\n       (3) the certification of sanitization requires each turtle \n     to be sanitized or treated for diseases, including \n     salmonella, and is dependant upon using the Siebeling method, \n     or other such proven nonantibiotic method, to make the turtle \n     salmonella-free; and\n       (4) the turtle farmer or commercial retail seller includes, \n     with the sale of such a turtle, a disclosure to the buyer \n     that includes--\n       (A) information regarding--\n       (i) the possibility that salmonella can recolonize in \n     turtles;\n       (ii) the dangers, including possible severe illness or \n     death, especially for at-risk people who may be susceptible \n     to salmonella poisoning, such as children, pregnant women, \n     and others who may have weak immune systems, that could \n     result if the turtle is not properly handled and safely \n     maintained;\n       (iii) the proper handling of the turtle, including an \n     explanation of proper hygiene such as handwashing after \n     handling a turtle; and\n       (iv) the proven methods of treatment that, if properly \n     applied, keep the turtle safe from salmonella;\n       (B) a detailed explanation of how to properly treat the \n     turtle to keep it safe from salmonella, using the proven \n     methods of treatment referred to under subparagraph (A), and \n     how the buyer can continue to purchase the tools, treatments, \n     or any other required item to continually treat the turtle; \n     and\n       (C) a statement that buyers of pet turtles should not \n     abandon the turtle or abandon the turtle outside, as the \n     turtle may become an invasive species to the local community, \n     but should instead return the turtle to a commercial retail \n     pet seller or other organization that would accept turtles no \n     longer wanted as pets.\n       (b) FDA Review of State Protections.--The Commissioner of \n     Food and Drugs may, after providing an opportunity for the \n     affected State to respond, restrict the sale of a turtle only \n     if the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that \n     the actual implementation of State health protections \n     described in subsection (a) are insufficient to protect \n     consumers against infections diseases acquired from such \n     turtle at the time of sale.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3505.

The Subcommittee's November 14 \nhearing will cover the extent of the problem, as well as possible \nsolutions.
