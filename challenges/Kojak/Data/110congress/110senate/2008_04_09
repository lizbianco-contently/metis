Mr. President, yesterday's testimony before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee afforded \nGeneral Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker the opportunity to address the \ntwo central questions of the war in Iraq. No. 1: Has the troop surge \nbrought us closer to the day when our troops can come home? Second, is \nthe war in Iraq making America safer? By all accounts, the answer to \nboth questions is no.\n  While General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker both deserve our \ngratitude for their hard work--and this is hard work under \nextraordinarily difficult circumstances--their testimony gave our \ncountry no reason to believe the strategy will change. President Bush \nhimself described the purpose of the surge as giving the Iraqi \nGovernment and its people the space to achieve reconciliation. Recent \nviolence and the intensifying struggle between al-Maliki and al-Sadr \nproved beyond any doubt the window we provided may be closing.\n  President Bush clings to his talking points that the surge is \nworking, but he called his plan a return on success, meaning that if \nthe surge worked, our troops could return home. If we have the success \nhe claims, where is the return?\n  Since Monday, we have had 12 American soldiers killed in Iraq. We are \nstuck in the ``Twilight Zone'' in Iraq. When violence is up, the \nPresident says we can't bring our troops home. When violence is down, \nthe President says we can't bring our troops home.\n  So it is long past time for the President to be honest with the \nAmerican people: Under what circumstances\n\n[[Page S2768]]\n\ncould our troops come home? Under what scenario could this war end? \nBased on everything we have heard, we can reach only one conclusion \nwith 160,000 courageous American troops serving in Iraq. President Bush \nhas an exit strategy for one person--and that is himself--on January 20 \nof next year.\n  Here is what three Senators had to say during yesterday's hearings. \nOne Senator said:\n\n       I think Osama bin Laden is sitting back right now looking \n     at this thing and saying, in effect, ``We're kinda \n     bankrupting this country.''\n\n  Another Senator said:\n\n       I think people want a sense of what the end is going to \n     look like.\n\n  A third Senator said:\n\n       Our patience is not unlimited.\n\n  All three of these questions were from Republican Senators yesterday.\n  To my Republican friends I say: Let's work together. We had the \nopportunity to change course in Iraq last summer, but Republicans who \nwere willing to criticize the war proved unwilling to break with \nPresident Bush by voting against it. But it is not too late. Neither \nside is looking for a hasty withdrawal that would put our troops or the \nIraqi people at undue risk. We want a smarter, more sustainable \nstrategy that addresses all the national security challenges our Nation \nfaces--from Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida safe haven in Pakistan, to \nwinning the peace in Afghanistan, to rebuilding full combat readiness \nof our ground forces.\n  If we work together, Democrats and Republicans, we can set a new \ncourse that takes us responsibly out of Iraq and would focus on the \nglobal challenges that have gone overlooked for far too long.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/09/senate-section/article/S2768-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me say briefly, I wish to offer my \ncongratulations, along with those of others, to both General Petraeus \nand Ambassador Crocker for their astonishingly good work over the last \n9 to 12 months. In virtually every measurable way that you can look at \nIraq, conditions have dramatically improved. That is a direct result of \nthe smart military strategy that has put Iraq in a position where it \ncan realistically aspire to be a relatively normal country by the \nstandards of the Middle East and certainly an ally on the war on \nterror, which is extremely important.\n  I also think it is important for all of us to remember we have not \nbeen attacked here at home for almost 7 years--a direct result of the \nstrategy of getting on the offense and pushing back against those who \nwould attack us here at home, which we have done both in Afghanistan \nand in Iraq.\n  So it was an opportunity, with the appearance of the general and the \nambassador, to congratulate them for their outstanding work over the \nlast year. We look forward to going forward in Iraq in a way that \nleaves behind a stable country that can make a positive contribution to \nthe security of the United States here at home and in the Middle East.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 71 percent of the American people believe \nthat invasion of Iraq was a mistake, a foreign policy blunder, some say \nthe worst this country has ever done, the worst foreign policy \nblunder--71 percent. During that poll, there were a few percentage \npoints where people had no opinion. So about 15 percent of the people \nthink the invasion of Iraq was the right decision. We must get our \ntroops home. The sooner we do that, the better off we are.\n  I look forward to General Petraeus's and Ambassador Crocker's hearing \ntoday before the two relevant committees in the House. When this is all \nover and done with, we will be able to assess when we can have a better \nopportunity of bringing our troops home. As we indicated earlier today, \nit seems difficult--when the violence is up, we need more troops and \nwhen it is down we need more troops. We can't have it both ways.\n  The military is at a breaking point. I am not saying that; I am \nrepeating what others have said. General Cody, who is a four-star \ngeneral on Active Duty, has said he has never seen our military in such \na state of disrepair as it is now. So things aren't glowingly good. We \nhave to work together to try to rebuild our military, and one way we \ncan do that is focus on getting the right number of troops to \nAfghanistan and rebuilding our military, which is, as General Cody \nsaid, in very bad shape.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the troops are coming home in an \norderly way. Precipitous withdrawal we know would lead to a new haven \nfor terrorists with the opportunity to attack us here at home. I think, \nclearly, we will debate this issue in the fall. The American people \nhave this on their minds, obviously. They also have on their minds the \neconomy, health care, and other matters. They are interested in their \nfuture. I think the American people are not interested in having \nadditional attacks on the homeland in the future. That is something we \nwill debate not only in the Senate but out on the campaign trail this \nfall.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one of the things that will be debated this \nfall is whether our troops need to be in Iraq for another 50 or 100 \nyears. I think that will be a pivotal part of the debate that takes \nplace in the Presidential elections.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, of course, no one has said that, and my \ndear friend, the majority leader, knows it. That is a swipe at Senator \nMcCain, who was talking about troop deployments overseas, not the \ncontinued engagement in warfare. The mainstream media--which has not \nbeen particularly friendly to the war--has hammered those who have \naccused Senator McCain of saying we were going to have a 100-year war \nin Iraq.\n  This is a deliberate misrepresentation of what he has said. Anybody \nwho looks at the entire exchange, which occurred in a town meeting in \nNew Hampshire back in January, knows precisely what he was saying. He \nwas talking about having troops deployed overseas, which we have had in \nGermany and Japan and South Korea for many years. He was talking about \na situation under which they are not under attack, not being killed or \nwounded but deployed overseas, not only to protect our security \ninterests but also to reassure our allies. That is what Senator McCain \nwas talking about. No one I know is suggesting--and it is almost \nlaughable to suggest--that we are talking about that kind of lengthy \nmilitary engagement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if one of the Democratic hopefuls had said \nit, I would also be trying to spin it in a way that looked good. The \nfact is, you can't spin what Senator McCain said at that town hall \nmeeting in a favorable light. His record speaks for itself as to how he \nfeels about the war in Iraq.\n  My friend always talks about the fact the American people don't want \nattacks here. Of course, they don't want attacks here at home. Of \ncourse, they don't. Everyone should understand, though, that prior to \nthe invasion of Iraq, there was not a terrorist in Iraq, and now, of \ncourse, there are lots of them. We need to focus on Osama bin Laden, on \nhis safe haven he has in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and as General Casey--\nalso an active member of the military--said, we need to get more troops \ninto Afghanistan. We can't do that when we have 140,000 troops this \nJuly in Iraq.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, one other thing. One thing we do agree \non--in trying to end this exchange with something we do agree on--I \nthink both the Democrats and Republicans agree the size of the Marines \nand Army is insufficient. I think there is bipartisan support in the \nCongress to increase the size of both the Army and the Marines. I think \nthat is something we can agree on. Hopefully, that will be achieved in \nthe coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/09/senate-section/article/S2768-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in light of the fact that a few minutes ago \nwe opened the Senate in prayer, I want to say that last month I had the \nprivilege of cochairing with the Senator from Colorado, Senator \nSalazar, the 56th Annual National Prayer Breakfast, held here in our \nNation's Capital. This annual gathering is hosted by Members of the \nSenate and the House of Representatives, who have weekly prayer \nbreakfast groups. Once again, we were honored to have the 56th \nconsecutive participation of our President and the First Lady. \nPresidents since Dwight Eisenhower have spoken at the annual prayer \nbreakfast. We were encouraged and inspired by the remarks shared by \nWard Brehm. Unfortunately, a transcript doesn't give the superb pauses \nand delivery that we who attended got to enjoy, but it is a superb \nmessage I want to share.\n  This year, we hosted a gathering of over 3,500 individuals from all \nwalks of life in all 50 States and from many countries around the \nworld. So that all may benefit from this time together, on behalf of \nthe Congressional Committee for the National Prayer Breakfast, I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the transcript of the 2008 proceedings \nbe printed in the Congressional Record at the conclusion of my speech.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this is an example of what we do in our \nweekly prayer breakfast, with little exception, and the presenters at \nour weekly prayer breakfast are always Senators or former Senators. It \nis a chance for us to get to know each person in this body as they \npresent.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                    56th National Prayer Breakfast,\n\n                      Thursday, February 7, 2008,\n\n                        Hilton Washington Hotel,\n\n                             Washington, DC\n\n     Co-Chairs: U.S. Senator Mike Enzi and U.S. Senator Ken Salazar\n\n       U.S. Senator Mike Enzi: I would bet that some of you are \n     wondering, ``How did I get here?'' and ``What kind of an \n     outfit is this?'' We will try to explain a little bit. Ken \n     and I are part of a very small breakfast group made up \n     entirely of Senators that has met every Wednesday that the \n     Senate has been in session since the middle part of the \n     Truman administration. That was in the late 1940's. We share \n     with each other, we eat, we pray and we discuss things that \n     really matter.\n       I am reminded of a time I was in South Africa meeting with \n     their parliament for a breakfast and I suggested that our \n     Senate prayer breakfast could pray for their issues. A \n     parliamentarian named Paul brought me up short and said, \n     ``Don't pray for the issues, pray for the people and the \n     people will solve the issues.'' And that is what we do at our \n     weekly prayer breakfast. That is what we will be doing here.\n       Now once a year we hold our weekly meeting in a slightly \n     bigger room and we invite 4,000 people from around the world \n     to come along for the ride. Welcome to our prayer breakfast. \n     (Applause)\n       U.S. Senator Ken Salazar: We count it a privilege to serve \n     in the United States Senate but frankly it is not always an \n     easy job. President Truman once said that if you want to have \n     a friend in Washington, buy a dog. We see that all the time. \n     Our breakfast in the U.S. Senate is an attempt to put back \n     into all of us what the job takes out from all of us and \n     gives us a reason to have trusting relationships, to find \n     wisdom and to reconcile our differences.\n       For me, I don't need to buy a dog in Washington, D.C. \n     because I have a friend named Mike Enzi. (Laughter) Mike Enzi \n     brings his common sense, compassion and approach to the \n     issues that face our nation and it makes him a key leader in \n     the United States Senate. That helps us get to results by \n     putting the public purpose above the politics which sometimes \n     so confines this town.\n       Washington, in my view, does not need a lot more speeches. \n     It needs people who need to seek and listen and to \n     understand. More people like Mike and his wife Diana, who is \n     here with us this morning. It has been my honor and pleasure \n     to serve with Mike Enzi for the last three years in the U.S. \n     Senate.\n       Senator Enzi: I have enjoyed getting to know Ken and the \n     deep wealth of heritage and caring that he brings to the \n     Senate. His family has lived in Colorado for 150 years--\n     longer than there has been a Colorado. Our connection began \n     personally and now we are able to talk about things that \n     Republicans and Democrats do not talk about together. And \n     what do you know? We have figured some things out. We are a \n     couple of guys from the high plains, Colorado and Wyoming, \n     who are trying to keep things on a higher plane in our jobs. \n     We have been working on this breakfast for many months now \n     and we hope you enjoy it. A lot of prayer has gone into it \n     and we hope it somehow scratches where you itch.\n       One special note, folks, Dr. Billy Graham attended the \n     Breakfast and was the main speaker for the first few years. \n     He sent a special word to us last night that he would be with \n     us in spirit this morning and is praying for us at this very \n     moment from his home in North Carolina. Thank you for your \n     prayers and a lifetime of spiritual leadership, Billy. \n     (Applause)\n       Senator Salazar: 155 nations are represented here this \n     morning in Washington, D.C. I now want to introduce to all of \n     you the distinguished heads of state who have joined us from \n     other lands today: The Chairman of the Council of the \n     Ministers of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Prime Minister Nicola \n     Spiric; The President of the Republic of Burundi, Pierre \n     Nkurunziza; The President of the Republic of El Salvador, \n     Elias Antonio Saca Gonzalez, and the First Lady; The \n     President of the Republic of Honduras, Jose Manuel Zelaya \n     Rosales; The President of the Federated States of Micronesia, \n     Immanuel Mori; and The Prime Minister of the Independent \n     State of Samoa, Prime Minister Tuila'epa Lupesoliai Sailele \n     Malielegaoi. (Applause)\n       You are all most welcome. Thank you for giving that warm \n     welcome to our guests here to the United States of America. \n     We live with human borders but we are one family across the \n     face of the earth. Thank you for the honor of your presence \n     and the chance to get to know you as friends and fellow \n     travelers in search of truth and a better world.\n       Senator Enzi: When one of our members heard that our singer \n     was Michael W. Smith he said, ``Well that's worth getting out \n     of bed early for.'' Michael is here with his wife, Debbie, \n     this morning. He has been recording faithful music for more \n     than two decades and won countless awards but he does not \n     want the focus to be on him. He has always encouraged his \n     fans, young and old, that faith is not a spectator sport. He \n     has encouraged tens of thousands to sponsor children all over \n     the world. We are happy to have two selections from him this \n     morning. The first is ``Above All.''\n       Mr. Michael W. Smith: (sings) [``Above all powers above all \n     kings''] (Applause)\n       Senator Enzi: Oh, how faith shines. Thank you, Michael. \n     Everybody in life needs role models, including Senators. \n     Senator Dianne Feinstein is that for many of the new members \n     of the Senate. She personifies dignity and excellence in \n     doing the people's work. She did that as the Mayor of San \n     Francisco and she is certainly doing that in the Senate. To \n     present a reading, our friend and colleague, Senator Dianne \n     Feinstein of California.\n       U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein: Thank you very much Senator \n     Enzi. Mr. President, Mrs. Bush, ladies and gentlemen.\n       Religion is a very personal thing to me. I have been \n     privileged to draw on two of the world's great religions--one \n     being Judaism, and the other, Catholicism. I went to a \n     Catholic convent while I was going to a Jewish Sunday school. \n     Some people would say that left me very confused. But \n     nonetheless it was a very special experience. A very young \n     rabbi wrote what I am going to read. It is now part of \n     Reformed Judaism's prayer book and is used in the High Holy \n     Day services. I would like to share it with you.\n       ``Birth is a beginning, and death a destination and life is \n     a journey: From childhood to maturity, and youth to age. From \n     innocence to awareness, and ignorance to knowing. From \n     foolishness to discretion and then perhaps to wisdom. From \n     weakness to strength or strength to weakness and often back \n     again. From health to sickness and back we pray to health \n     again. From offense to forgiveness. From loneliness to love. \n     From joy to gratitude. From pain to compassion and grief to \n     understanding. From fear to faith. From defeat to defeat, to \n     defeat until looking backward or ahead we see that victory \n     lies not at some high place along the way but in having made \n     the journey stage by stage a sacred pilgrimage. Birth is a \n     beginning and death a destination and life is a journey, a \n     sacred pilgrimage to life everlasting.''\n       Thank you. (Applause)\n       U.S. Representative Bart Stupak: I am Bart Stupak, co-chair \n     of the House Prayer Breakfast. In my sixteen years in the \n     house this is the second time that I have had the honor to \n     address you from the dais. Some things never change--the \n     National Prayer Breakfast remains heavy on prayer and light \n     on breakfast. (Laughter) As we join in fellowship, filled \n     with the Holy Spirit, I ask that you remember two House \n     members who were devoted to the Prayer Breakfast and who are \n     no longer with us, Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis and \n     Congresswoman Julia Carson. We miss them. Now let me turn the \n     podium over to my co-chair, friend and colleague, Gresham \n     Barrett of South Carolina.\n       U.S. Representative J. Gresham Barrett: Good morning. Two \n     things--number one, we\n\n[[Page S2770]]\n\n     will not take up a love offering today and number two, we are \n     here to feed your soul. If you want to feed the body with ham \n     and grits and eggs we are going to the Waffle House after \n     this, OK? I do concur with Bart on that. It is an honor to be \n     here. Bart told me that being from South Carolina I tend to \n     speak a little bit slowly, but if I speak any slower it will \n     take all day so I will speed up just a little bit.\n       I want to tell you a little bit about what we do in the \n     House during our Prayer Breakfast. It is a bi-partisan \n     meeting. We meet every Thursday at 8 o'clock. We talk amongst \n     ourselves with fellowship, with food, with laughter. We pray \n     for one another, we pray for folks that we don't know. It is \n     open to members and former members, sometimes we have foreign \n     dignitaries. But the biggest thing of all is to be an \n     encouragement to each other. That is a little bit about how \n     we do it. The question is ``Why do we do it?'' And I can sum \n     it up the best in Paul's letter to the Corinthians. I \n     Corinthians 13:13: ``And now abideth faith, hope and love, \n     these three, but the greatest is love.'' We meet together \n     because we love each other, we love our families, we love \n     what we do, we love this nation and I believe that the one \n     thing we can do that is stronger than anything is to love. If \n     you don't take anything away from this Prayer Breakfast this \n     morning, remember this: someone in this room loves you. And \n     more important than that, someone up above has given us the \n     greatest gift of love. Thank you for being here this morning \n     and have a blessed day.\n       Senator Salazar: Thank you, Congressman Stupak and \n     Congressman Barrett. Part of what we try and celebrate here \n     as well is our nation's government and to pray for our \n     nation's government. Certainly the judiciary is very much a \n     part of our government and our democracy. This morning I am \n     honored to introduce my great friend and one of the most \n     distinguished jurists in the United States of America, the \n     Honorable Judge Carlos Lucero of the 10th Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. Judge Lucero practiced law in my native, beautiful \n     San Luis Valley in Colorado and like my family Judge Lucero's \n     family helped found the city of Santa Fe, New Mexico, the \n     city of Holy Faith, back in 1598. For the last 12 years he \n     has served with distinction on the 10th Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. To lead us in prayer for our national leaders help \n     me welcome Judge Carlos Lucero.\n       The Honorable Carlos E. Lucero: Good morning, Mr. President \n     and Mrs. Bush. As Ken says, our families go way back and \n     these early pioneers were sustained in their travels to what \n     was to them the new world by this deep abiding faith and \n     great sense of belief and commitment. Some of my earliest \n     memories of my grandfather were before there was \n     electrification--his sitting next to a window reading the \n     Bible and caring deeply about his prayer. My parents hauling \n     us children, as I am sure Ken's parents did as well, to go to \n     these early old adobe churches of southern Colorado and \n     northern New Mexico for their Te Deums. And it is really the \n     parents of the United States, the great families who \n     inculcate their children with a belief in God and with a \n     belief in values and in prayer that are the genuine heroes of \n     the United States. Back in the earliest of days the faith of \n     these pioneers carried them. There was an early territorial \n     governor of New Mexico who is said to have prayed at one \n     time, ``pobre Nuevo Mexico, poor little New Mexico'' he said, \n     ``so far from heaven, so close to Texas.'' (Laughter)\n       As public officials all of us take the oath of office to \n     support and defend the constitution of the United States. The \n     American history flows back to those images of the \n     President raising his arm and stating his oath. The rest \n     of us too are required, constitutionally, to take our oath \n     of office or affirmation, the constitution allows both, to \n     support the constitution of the United States. My prayer \n     today relates to seeking God's help in asking that the \n     leaders of our country faithfully discharge our \n     obligations and that we might have the providence of God, \n     the Creator, in aiding us to do so.\n       Dear God, as each of us may worship you in the many creeds \n     represented here today, my prayer is that you bless our \n     country, our government, the President of the United States \n     and his family, the members of the United States Senate, the \n     United States House of Representatives, the Justices of the \n     United States Supreme Court and the members of the federal \n     judiciary and all of our families. I ask the blessings of God \n     on the governors of the states, the state legislatures and \n     judges, the mayors of our cities, the members of our city \n     councils throughout the United States and all those who serve \n     in public service, most especially on the officers and the \n     men and women of the United States military who serve our \n     beloved country and our beloved constitution so faithfully.\n       May the Almighty grant us the wisdom and sound judgment to \n     discharge our constitutional oath with the clearest of \n     conscience and that our every action on behalf of the people \n     of the United States be true and loyal and faithful to you \n     and to this document. I pray that the citizens of our country \n     may be blessed with your Spirit and citizens of all races and \n     creeds may forge a common bond in true harmony, to banish \n     hatred and replace it with love, to banish bigotry and \n     replace it with understanding and to safeguard the ideals of \n     free institutions that are the pride and glory of our country \n     and of this world. I pray that this land under your \n     providence may be an influence for good throughout the world, \n     uniting all people in peace and in freedom. I have a very \n     brief reading from the Old Testament today that I would like \n     to conclude my prayer with. One word of explanation in \n     speaking to friends of many denominations in preparing for \n     today's prayer--I learned that in the earliest days of the \n     history of the Old Testament when the tribes went forth, \n     there were no kings or leaders as such but the judges \n     governed, so a rabbi tells me. Don't think that I am getting \n     any ideas. I know those of us in the judiciary know what is \n     buzzed about us but you have to have that understanding to \n     have a deeper understanding of what the Old Testament means \n     as it speaks of judgment because of the special ethics and \n     requirements that were imposed on these earliest leaders. \n     From the book of Deuteronomy chapter 1 verses 15-17:\n       ``So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and \n     respected men, and appointed them to have authority over \n     you--as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and \n     of tens and as tribal officials. And I charged your judges at \n     that time: Hear the disputes between your brothers and judge \n     fairly, whether the case is between brother Israelites or \n     between one of them and an alien. Do not show partiality in \n     judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of \n     any man, for judgment belongs to God.''\n       And from chapter 6 verse 8 of the book of Micah:\n       ``He has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the \n     Lord require of you but to act justly and to love mercy and \n     to walk humbly with your God.'' Amen.\n       Senator Enzi: Historically, we have been honored to have a \n     member of the United States military be a part of our \n     leadership of this breakfast and today we go all the way \n     to the top of the chain of command--Admiral Michael Mullen \n     is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is joined \n     this morning by his wife, Deborah. He was born in Los \n     Angeles, graduated from the Naval Academy and has served \n     our nation all over the world. To present our second \n     reading from the Holy Scriptures, Admiral Michael Mullen.\n       Admiral Michael Mullen: Mr. President and Mrs. Bush, good \n     morning everyone. It is great to see all of you and join you \n     in worship this morning. I testified before Congress \n     yesterday so believe me I know the value of prayer. \n     (Laughter) The verse I would like to read is from the book of \n     Philippians. It is short, powerful, poetic and concise. It \n     reminds me daily in this time of war and great uncertainty of \n     the things of which we must always remain certain. It speaks \n     to me of the nobility of service to one another, to the \n     nation and to a cause greater than one's self and it calls to \n     mind the sacrifices of those who serve and of the families \n     and loved ones who wait and worry and support those men and \n     women in uniform who serve this noble cause. Philippians 4: \n     8,9 ``. . . whatever things are true, whatever things are \n     noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, \n     whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good \n     report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything \n     praiseworthy, think on these things. Those things, which you \n     have learned, and received, and heard and seen in me, do; and \n     the God of peace shall be with you.'' Thank you.\n       Senator Salazar: I am delighted to introduce my good friend \n     from Minnesota, Senator Amy Klobuchar. Her husband, John \n     Bessler is with her this morning. In her short time as a \n     member of the United States Senate she has become one of the \n     stars of our Senate. With the values of the Iron Range and \n     the sharp mind and tongue of a prosecutor she is the champion \n     of the people of Minnesota. To lead us in prayer for world \n     leaders, Senator Amy Klobuchar.\n       U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar: Thank you, Senator Salazar, \n     President Bush, Mrs. Bush, members of Congress, friends. It \n     is an honor to be here today to share a prayer for our world \n     leaders. Like so many who are gathered here today, my faith \n     came from those before me. Their worlds did not stretch the \n     globe like the leaders for whom we will pray today instead \n     they lived in much simpler, humbler circumstances but they \n     still had the courage to believe. My grandpa worked 1,500 \n     feet underground in the mines in Ely, Minnesota and never \n     graduated from high school but he saved money in a coffee can \n     in the basement to send my dad to college. Up in Iron Range \n     there is a rollicking collision of ethnic cultures from the \n     Slovenians to the Serbs to the Croatians and to the Finns. My \n     grandma and grandpa were Catholic and you could worship up on \n     the range at polka masses held by an entrepreneurial polka \n     priest, named Father Frank Perkovich. He did so well that he \n     has been last heard of as a priest on a Caribbean cruise \n     line. Prayer is needed everywhere. But my faith also comes \n     from my mom who never learned to drive until I was in high \n     school but who was bound and determined to get our family to \n     church. Once a week she would load us into a cab, which was \n     quite a sight in a middle class Minnesota suburb on a Sunday \n     morning, and it was my job to say at the end of the drive to \n     the driver, ``add 50 cents please.'' I would be so nervous \n     that I would forget to say this and deny the driver his tip \n     that the entire way to church I would say in my head, ``add \n     50 cents, please, add 50 cents, please.'' Today I can never \n     go to church without thinking, `add 50 cents please'. That I \n     got from my mom. And, finally, my faith comes from my dad \n     who became a popular newspaper columnist and an avid \n     adventurer. He climbed mountains the world over but his \n     faith was\n\n[[Page S2771]]\n\n     tested time and time again through his own battle with \n     alcoholism. I watched him climb the highest peaks, but at \n     times slip in the lowest valleys. He finally overcame it \n     when in his own words, he was pursued by grace.\n       We bow our heads today, God, to pray that our world leaders \n     may also be pursued by grace. God, in the Himalayas of Nepal \n     there is a simple greeting that today we share as a simple \n     blessing for our world leaders. When the Nepalese see a \n     friend they bow their heads and clasp their hands and say, \n     Namaste, which in its most spiritual translation means, ``I \n     praise the God that lives within you.'' God, in this time of \n     year when an English poet once described it as the bleak mid-\n     winter, we are experiencing world events that too often match \n     that somber description. We pray that when our world leaders \n     are confronted by religion used to divide us, they will find \n     the God that lives within them to guide them to common ground \n     in peace. God, we pray that our leaders find the God that \n     lives within them to work together across borders to cure \n     disease, confront hunger and poverty and offer hope to the \n     children of the world. God, as the icebergs melt and the seas \n     flood we ask that our world leaders listen to you and answer \n     your call to care for your creation, to treasure the changing \n     of the seasons and to remember the philosophy of the Ojibwe \n     Indians that great leaders' decisions are not always made for \n     today but for children seven generations from now. And, God, \n     we know that leadership is sometimes a lonely place, wisdom \n     is often illusive and making the right choice can be hard but \n     we pray that when burdened with difficult decisions our \n     leaders will heed the God that lives within them and find the \n     best that is in our humanity, draw from the best of our \n     history and instincts and enlist the energy of our young. To \n     all our world leaders we praise the God that lives within \n     you. Namaste. Amen.\n       Senator Enzi: I am proud now to introduce our speaker, Ward \n     Brehm. I knew him before I ever met him. I was involved in \n     the United States AIDS bill and was headed to Africa to see \n     what could be done. I was given a copy of a book called \n     ``White Man Walking,'' written by Ward, telling of his effort \n     to get to know the people of a continent face to face, step \n     by step. As I read about how the Lord used Africa to change \n     his life it changed mine. Ward serves as the chair of the \n     board of the United States Africa Development Fund, a small \n     agency with a very big job--that of making micro investments \n     across Africa that build people up through emerging private \n     enterprise. Ward's wife, Chris, is here with us at the head \n     table as well. After I read his book I got to work with his \n     confirmation in the Senate. I then got to work with him to \n     increase the agency's budget. He encouraged and was \n     successful in getting countries to match the monies. He found \n     customers for products made in Africa without going through \n     middlemen. He has traveled to Africa more than 30 times. Each \n     time he has a prayer and a scripture for each day of his \n     journey and several of us join him in prayer from the United \n     States as he makes a difference in Africa. Did you ever \n     wonder what would happen if you allowed the Lord to really \n     get a hold of your life and use you for His purposes? Here is \n     a pretty good example of what happens when a great God gets a \n     chance to use a regular person like you and me. Ladies and \n     gentlemen, my friend, Ward Brehm.\n       Mr. Ward Brehm: Thank you, Senator Enzi. I am deeply \n     humbled by your introduction and proud to be able to call you \n     my friend.\n       Most of you were probably surprised when you picked up your \n     program and saw a speaker you have never heard of before. I \n     want to tell you, you are not alone. One month ago, I sent in \n     my registration to this breakfast and I was just hoping for a \n     good seat. (Laughter)\n       My thanks also to the members of the Senate group for this \n     opportunity. A good friend emailed me last night and said \n     that if God was going to speak through me, I did not need to \n     be nervous . . . God is the one who should be nervous! \n     (Laughter)\n       My wife read to me from Scriptures last night that Jesus \n     said when two or more gather in His name, He will be there. \n     That is good enough for me!\n       My work has given me the high privilege of serving you, Mr. \n     President, the American people, and above all, the poor in \n     Africa.\n       The best way to help the poor is to help them not be poor \n     anymore. The only way I know how to do that is through job \n     creation, and the very best form of sustainable development \n     is a steady paycheck.\n       It has been said that if you give a man a fish, you feed \n     him for a day; teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a \n     lifetime. But that is not the full story. If you want to eat \n     for a lifetime, you need to own the pond.\n       So a bit of background . . . Despite that eloquent \n     introduction, I am a recovering Type-A controlling \n     businessman. I have been described even by people who like me \n     as someone who is often wrong but seldom in doubt. I was a \n     bit of a problem child growing up. In fact, my pastor since \n     childhood, Arthur Rouner, recently referred to me as a \n     ministerial long shot!\n       They say that if God wants to get your attention he will \n     toss a little pebble into your life. If that doesn't work, He \n     will throw a rock. As a last resort, He will heave a brick!\n       Africa was my brick. In 1994, Africa was not on my personal \n     radar screen. In fact, the only significant thing on that \n     radar screen was ME!\n       In the Los Angeles airport I bought a copy of Stephen \n     Covey's book, The Seven Habits for Highly Effective People. I \n     didn't buy it to learn anything, but just wanted to make sure \n     that he got them all right. (Laughter)\n       I was intrigued by Covey's notion of paradigms: identical \n     sets of facts can mean something totally different because of \n     your world view.\n       Somalia was in the news at the time, and countless numbers \n     of Africans were dying from starvation. I felt no real \n     connection to this humanitarian crisis. My radar screen was \n     full.\n       Paradigms usually change because of shock or trauma, but I \n     wondered if it might be possible for someone to change their \n     paradigm on purpose. I supposed that if I were to see \n     people starving, it would change that paradigm and perhaps \n     much more. The thought left me as quickly as it came.\n       But God sent me a reminder . . . One week later, I made one \n     of my occasional stops at church . . . and my pastor, out of \n     the blue, took me aside and said, ``Ward, I'm going to Africa \n     in two months, and I would like you to go with me.''\n       I told him I couldn't believe the coincidence of his \n     invitation given my recent reflections on Somalia. Then I \n     said . . . ``No!'' (Laughter)\n       He looked at me in a strange way, and he said, ``Would you \n     at least pray about it?'' I looked at him and said, ``You're \n     the pastor; YOU pray about it. I will THINK about it but \n     suspect my answer will be.'' (Laughter)\n       He must have prayed hard . . . because two months later, I \n     found myself in the Minneapolis airport with a ticket to \n     Ethiopia in my hand. I was surrounded by (for the lack of a \n     better word) church ladies. (Laughter) And they were hugging \n     me . . . (Laughter) Then someone suggested that we pray \n     before we departed, so I found myself outside Gate 8A, \n     holding hands with a group of strangers. And as I stand here \n     before the National Prayer Breakfast, I can honestly say I \n     uttered my first heartfelt and sincere prayer . . . ``Lord, \n     don't let any of my clients see me!'' (Laughter)\n       And then we flew twelve thousand miles to Africa, and a \n     million miles from my comfort zone. I had the high privilege \n     of having my heart broken. I saw poverty on an obscene level. \n     Children with flies on their eyes and for the lack of a 50 \n     cent medicine doomed to blindness, the emaciated faces of \n     famine, families shattered by civil war. In Masaka, Uganda I \n     held the hand of a 22-year-old mother as she died of AIDS and \n     then turned to look directly into the faces of four brand new \n     orphans.\n       I was an eyewitness. It put a face on the statistics. I \n     always believed that those statistics were true, but now they \n     become real. It got personal. . . .\n       More recently, I took a long walk with a warrior turned \n     pastor friend, Lodinyo, deep into an unknown wilderness along \n     the northern Rift Valley that divides northwest Kenya with \n     Uganda. He took me to where they had never seen a person with \n     white skin. When they first spotted me, they thought I was a \n     ghost . . . a dead man walking. For a while, I thought they \n     would be right.\n       I fasted for five days on this walk to experience real \n     hunger, but had brought along protein bars in case of (as \n     Lodinyo put it) an ``emergency''. At the end of this walk, I \n     collapsed in a borrowed sleeping hut. When I awoke 13 hours \n     later, I saw a little boy peeking through the door. While he \n     was initially terrified, curiosity eventually got the best of \n     him, and I noticed he was concentrating more on my stash of \n     power bars than he was on me. He succeeded in snatching a \n     bar, and immediately ran away. ``Kids are the same \n     everywhere,'' I thought, until I stepped outside the hut, and \n     I found that little boy kneeling over his two-year old sister \n     with a terribly distended stomach, feeding her tiny pieces of \n     protein. . . .\n       Three months later, I was to learn that she died . . . \n     another paradigm shift.\n       Now after more than 30 trips to Africa, the question that I \n     have been asked more than any other by my African friends is \n     ``What do you pray for?''\n       Most of us among the affluent have too many things. Too \n     much food, multiple cars, great health care, retirement, \n     insurance . . .\n       It is only when things fall apart completely, and we are \n     totally out of control that we feel totally dependent, and \n     thus closest to God. Death, cancer, business failure, \n     addiction, divorce, crises; these are the things that truly \n     drop us to our knees.\n       All across the world, including America, things are \n     continuously falling apart for the truly poor . . . They are \n     always out of control, constantly living in crises mode, and \n     thus dependent and faithful to God's own commandment that we \n     love Him with all of our hearts. God is often all the poor \n     have.\n       The leaders that God anoints are their only hope. And \n     despite the often-horrific conditions that they live in, the \n     poor are thankful for their very existence.\n       Scripture asks, ``Hasn't God chosen those who are poor in \n     the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the \n     Kingdom?'' Yes, He has. I have seen it with my own eyes.\n       The question that I am asked by most of my American friends \n     is, ``Why cross an ocean to help people when you need only \n     cross the street, to help your own?'' It is a great question, \n     and the answer is, of course, that we need to do both.\n       Solzhenitsyn said that disaster is defined by two things: \n     magnitude and distance. So a small disaster close to home or \n     a huge disaster faraway, results in what he describes\n\n[[Page S2772]]\n\n     as ``bearable disasters of bearable proportion.'' We have \n     become too good at ``bearing.'' Our hearts should be broken \n     by the things that break the heart of God.\n       Specifically in Africa, there are many faraway disasters of \n     epic proportions. In 1994, in Rwanda, a country the size of \n     Maryland, the political genocide claimed over 800,000 lives: \n     9,000 lives per day for 90 days. That is two World Trade \n     Center disasters per day for three months.\n       Today, in Darfur, Sudan, 1.5 million homeless. Thousands \n     terrorized, raped and killed. AIDS is killing 4,400 people \n     per day in Africa, and even more are dying from curable \n     malaria. Epic disasters of epic proportions, far from home \n     for most of us. We have hundreds today right here in this \n     room from all around the world, our neighbors this morning, \n     who experience these epic disasters close to home.\n       I do want to say while I have the chance with the President \n     sitting right here. Very few people are aware that due to \n     President Bush's commitment and the resulting partnership \n     with Congress there has been an absolutely historic four-fold \n     increase in American assistance to fight poverty and AIDS \n     in Africa.\n       In 2003 there were 50,000 Africans on Anti-Viral medication \n     and today there are over 1.5 million. I have not met a SINGLE \n     person who hasn't agreed with this high calling.\n       Proverbs the book of Wisdom says ``speak up for those who \n     can not speak for themselves and defend the rights of the \n     poor and destitute.'' You have been that voice and on behalf \n     of the ``least of these'' in Africa as well as the collective \n     American conscience, I want to say . . .``Thank you Mr. \n     President.'' (Applause)\n       Do you remember when Jesus was talking to His disciples, \n     and asked them when He was hungry, why they didn't give Him \n     any food, and when He was naked, why they didn't give Him any \n     clothes? And the disciples said something like, ``Lord, we \n     never did any of those things to You.'' I always thought \n     (like most folks) that Jesus replied ``Whenever you did this \n     to the least of these, you did this unto Me.''\n       Except that's not what He said. What He said was, ``When \n     ever you did this to one of the least of these, you did this \n     unto Me.''\n       How often do we forget the word ``one.''\n       It changes the meaning of what Jesus said completely. In \n     our quest to be helpful, we can rob the poor of their \n     dignity. In order to be of any help to the poor, we need to \n     understand them, we need to know them, and we need to love \n     them. They are not a group. The poor is not a species. They \n     are identical to us in their hopes and dreams. They love \n     their families and long for a better life. The only \n     difference is that they are poor.\n       And people don't suffer and die in groups. It is one at a \n     time. And each one of those deaths leaves an identical wake \n     of agony to what you and I and our families would experience.\n       So what are we supposed to do with all this? How does this \n     fit with our world, so different and so far away? Frankly, I \n     am not sure, but we do have some clues. Jesus said, ``The \n     poor will always be with you.'' What an odd thing to say, \n     especially coming from Him!\n       Jesus also said, ``To whom much has been given, much will \n     be expected.'' So maybe this is a test of sorts. If so . . . \n     how are we doing?\n       I have heard stories similar to mine of peoples' lives \n     being changed: from orphanages in Russia to inner-city \n     schools in Minneapolis, from the slums of Calcutta to remote \n     medical clinics in the mountains of Afghanistan, from the \n     streets of Washington, D.C., to wretched prisons in East \n     Asia. Indeed, all across the world people are answering \n     Jesus' question, ``Who is my neighbor?'' And these people are \n     finding themselves changed, engaged, and discovering \n     meaning and relevance by being involved in things much \n     bigger than themselves.\n       I believe that, deep down, most people would love to have \n     God change their lives. Here's the thing: If asked, He will, \n     every time, guaranteed. And while these changes may initially \n     seem scary, they ultimately lay a foundation for a life lived \n     on purpose rather than by default.\n       I will forever be indebted to Africa. Africa awakened me \n     when I didn't even know I was asleep. I pray that everyone \n     who seeks one will find a similar path.\n       I pray that each of you will find your own Africa. . . .\n       A few years ago my friend, Gary Haugen, asked me the most \n     important question of all . . .\n       For those four orphans I was with in Uganda who watched \n     their mother die of AIDS and were suddenly and completely on \n     their own . . . For a twelve year old girl kidnapped and sold \n     into slavery in rural India . . . For a single mom evicted \n     and homeless on the streets of Washington, D.C. . . . For \n     each one of them: What is God's strategy for letting them \n     know that He's good?\n       For the mother in Ethiopia who sees her baby die of \n     malnutrition--Why would she think God is good? And what is \n     God's strategy for allowing her to know that He loves her?\n       The answer is astounding. The answer is . . . US!\n       Even more astonishing . . . He has no plan B. . . .\n       God bless you one and all. (Applause)\n       Senator Salazar: Thank you, Ward Brehm, for that \n     inspirational message. Ladies and gentlemen and guests from \n     around the world, it is my honor to introduce to all of you \n     the President of our United States. We are delighted to see \n     with President Bush his lovely and wonderful wife, Laura. \n     (Applause)\n       For all of us gathered here today in Washington, D.C. we \n     know that this is a funny town. If you only read the papers \n     you would think the Democrats and Republicans simply never \n     work together. The truth is since I first met the President \n     several years ago we have had a friendship that has helped us \n     work on issues that are important to our nation, including \n     the issues of renewable energy and the issues of immigration \n     reform. It is a friendship that is rooted in our shared love \n     for our nation, our faith and our reverence for family. The \n     President and I have spoken several times about the powerful \n     impact that our fathers have had on our lives. Our dad's \n     stories show how the American experience can send different \n     people down different paths to fulfill truly the American \n     dream. World War II inspired both of our fathers to don the \n     uniform of their country. The American West inspired their \n     love for open spaces and for the ranching traditions of our \n     states. Their love of God inspired them to work long days \n     in service to generations to come. And so here we are \n     today, the President of the United States and a United \n     States Senator from Colorado, bound by our service to our \n     country, by our faith in humanity, and by our hope that we \n     too will be heroes to our daughters as our fathers were to \n     all of us.\n       Ladies and Gentlemen, the President of the United States of \n     America. (Applause)\n       The President of the United States: Thank you all. Gracias, \n     mi amigo. Thank you, friend. Laura and I are honored to join \n     you all here for the 56th National Prayer Breakfast. There \n     are a lot of reasons to pray and one of course is to \n     strengthen us against temptation--particularly this morning, \n     the temptation to stay in bed. (Laughter)\n       Obviously there are a lot of prayerful people here and I \n     appreciate your warm welcome.\n       We have a lot of distinguished guests here today, members \n     of Congress, military leaders, captains of industry. Yet at \n     this annual gathering we are reminded of an eternal truth, \n     when we lift our hearts to God we are all equal in His sight. \n     We are all equally precious; we are all equally dependant on \n     His grace. It is fitting that we gather each year to approach \n     our Creator in fellowship and to thank Him for the many \n     blessings He has bestowed upon our families and our nation. \n     It is fitting that we gather in prayer because we recognize a \n     prayerful nation is a stronger nation.\n       I appreciate Senators Salazar and Enzi. Thank you for \n     putting this event on.\n       Madame Speaker, Leader Hoyer, Leader Blunt, thank you for \n     being here.\n       I welcome the members of Congress. I appreciate the Heads \n     of State who are here. Welcome to America, again.\n       I thank the members of the Diplomatic Corps who joined us. \n     I appreciate the distinguished dignitaries, all the members \n     of my cabinet--don't linger, get back to work. (Laughter) \n     Admiral, thank you for your leadership. I am always proud to \n     be with the members of the United States military. I thank \n     the state and local officials. Ward, thanks for your remarks. \n     Those were awesome. I guess that is a presidential word. I am \n     proud to be here with Michael W. and Debbie, long time \n     friends of our family. Thank you for lending your beautiful \n     voice. Judge, I am not going to hold the Texas thing against \n     you. (Laughter)\n       Every President since Dwight Eisenhower has attended the \n     National Prayer Breakfast--and I am really proud to carry on \n     this tradition. It is an important tradition, and I am \n     confident Presidents who follow me will do the same. The \n     people in this room come from many different walks of faith. \n     Yet we share one clear conviction: We believe that the \n     Almighty hears our prayers--and answers those who seek Him. \n     That is what we believe; otherwise, why come? That through \n     the miracle of prayer, we believe he listens--if we listen to \n     his voice and seek His presence in our lives, our hearts will \n     change. And in so doing, in seeking God, we grow in ways that \n     we could never imagine.\n       And in prayer we grow in gratitude and thanksgiving. When \n     we spend time with the Almighty we realize how much he has \n     bestowed upon us and our hearts are filled with joy. We give \n     thanks for our families, we give thanks for the parents who \n     raised us, we give thanks for the patient souls who married \n     us and the children who make us proud each day. We give \n     thanks for our liberty and the universal desire for freedom \n     that He has written in every human heart. We give thanks for \n     the God who made us in His image and redeemed us in His love.\n       In prayer we grow in meekness and humility. By approaching \n     our Maker on bended knee we acknowledge our complete \n     dependence on Him. We recognize that we have nothing to offer \n     God that He does not already have, except our love. So we \n     offer Him that love and ask for the grace to discern His \n     will. We ask Him to remain near to us at all times. We ask \n     Him to help us lead lives that are pleasing to Him. We \n     discover that by surrendering our lives to the Almighty we \n     are strengthened, refreshed and ready for all that may come. \n     In prayer we also grow in boldness and courage.\n       The more time we spend with God, the more we see that He is \n     not a distant king but a loving Father. Inspired by this \n     confidence we approach Him with bold requests, we ask Him to \n     heal the sick and comfort the dying and sustain those who \n     care for them. We ask\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\n     Him to bring solace to the victims of tragedy and help to \n     those suffering from addiction and adversity. We ask Him to \n     strengthen our families and to protect the innocent and \n     vulnerable in our country. We ask Him to protect our nation \n     from those who wish us harm and watch over all who step \n     forward to defend us. We ask Him to bring about the day when \n     His peace shall reign across the world and every tear shall \n     be wiped away.\n       In prayer we grow in mercy and compassion. We are reminded \n     in prayer that we are all fallen creatures in need of mercy. \n     And in seeking God's mercy we grow in mercy ourselves. \n     Experiencing the presence of God transforms our hearts and \n     the more we seek His presence, the more we feel the tug at \n     our souls to reach out to the poor and the hungry, the \n     elderly and the infirmed.\n       When we answer God's call to love a neighbor as ourselves \n     we enter into a deeper friendship with our fellow man and a \n     deeper relationship with our Eternal Father.\n       I believe in the power of prayer because I felt it in my \n     own life. Prayer has strengthened me in times of personal \n     challenge. It has helped me meet the challenges of the \n     presidency. I understand now clearly the story of the calm in \n     the rough seas. And so at this final prayer breakfast as your \n     President, I thank you for your prayers and I thank our \n     people all across America for their prayers and I ask you not \n     to stop in the year ahead. We have so much work to do for our \n     country. And with the help of the Almighty we will build a \n     freer world and a safer, a more hopeful, a more noble, \n     America. God bless. (Applause)\n       Senator Enzi: Thank you, Mr. President for that prayer for \n     our country. We thank you for your presence here. This is the \n     56th consecutive time that a President of the United States \n     has been at the National Prayer Breakfast, a tremendous and \n     important tradition. Ladies and gentlemen, we would ask that \n     you please remain at your places as the President and First \n     Lady take their leave of us. And we do thank you for your \n     presence, Mr. President, and the faithful way that you strive \n     to carry the burdens of our nation. I know all of us want to \n     join in saying we will pray for you and for your spouse and \n     for your family that the Lord will give you success in your \n     efforts toward the common needs of all mankind, which are \n     life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n       God bless you, Mr. President and Mrs. Bush. (Applause)\n       Mr. Smith: (Sings) [``Amazing Grace''] (Applause)\n       Senator Enzi: Thank you, Michael for the gift of worship as \n     you do it so well through song. We're very grateful for all \n     at our head table, the participants and the loving, \n     thoughtful spirit that they have shared with all of us. I \n     know that when I leave today, I will take with me the \n     prayers, the scriptures, the words of our two speakers and \n     try to remember that the word ``one'' is the important part \n     to the least and that we all have the opportunity to do our \n     part. I hope that God doesn't get too nervous when He is \n     working through us. This has been an outstanding morning. We \n     have shared with you a little bit of what our Wednesday \n     prayer breakfast is like, it is the way we get filled up \n     during the week and I hope this has helped to fill you today.\n       Senator Salazar: We hope you have all been encouraged. We \n     hope you have been challenged. We hope you take the faith and \n     hope and optimism and challenges that Ward Brehm has \n     presented to us here today that not only in Africa, but in \n     Latin America and all across this world that we work for a \n     more perfect world and I am sure that this prayer breakfast \n     will help us move along the way. Thank you to the 4,000 \n     people who are here, to the millions around the world who are \n     praying for us, to the 155 nations who are represented here \n     knowing at the end of the day we are one human race. Thank \n     you for coming this morning.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/09/senate-section/article/S2773-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2773-S2776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PROGRESS IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to talk about \nthe testimony given yesterday by General Petraeus and Ambassador \nCrocker regarding our progress and challenges in Iraq. I think it is \nimportant for the American people to understand and for our colleagues \nto understand that the surge of troops in Iraq that began in the early \npart of last year was a corrective measure, and that from the fall of \nBaghdad until January 2007, it was clear to me, Senator McCain, and \nothers that our strategy during that period of time was not working; \nthat we had too few troops; that the country got into a lawless state; \nthat political progress and economic progress was virtually \nnonexistent. There was a paralysis when it came to the ability to \ngovern in Baghdad: The economy was stalled; violence was spreading \nthroughout the country to the point, in 2006, that the al-Qaida flag \nflew over parts of Anbar Province.\n  So there was a moment of reckoning. The President had a decision to \nmake after the Republican losses in November of 2006. It was widely \nheld that the reason Republicans lost in the midterm elections was \nbecause of Iraq policy. Secretary Rumsfeld resigned and the President \nhad a choice. One of the choices would have been to adopt the strategy \nof withdrawing at a faster rate, the theory being to put pressure on \nthe Iraqi military and government to perform better because they were \nnot doing well because they were relying too much upon us. The other \ntheory was that the security environment is so out of control and so \ntenuous that you will never have military, political, or economic \nprogress until you get better control over security.\n  Well, the surge argument, advocated primarily by Senators McCain, \nLieberman, and others, won the day with the President. So it was clear \nthat we needed to change strategy at the end of 2006, and we did. There \nis an ongoing debate about whether that was the correct choice. To \nevaluate fairly the testimony of Ambassador Crocker and General \nPetraeus, I think one has to look at what happened from January of 2007 \nup to today and planned out to July 2008.\n  During that period of time, there was a surge of American combat \nforces into Iraq of 30,000 additional combat troops. The security \nargument prevailed over the withdrawal argument. The troops were \ndeployed in a significantly different way. Not only were there more of \nthe troops, which was a requirement, General Petraeus came up with a \nnew strategy. He got the troops out into the communities, at security \nstations, where American soldiers served with Iraqi soldiers and \npolicemen within the community. That built a sense of confidence we had \nnot seen before. At the end of 2006, something very startling happened \nin Anbar Province. Sheik Sattar, one of the young sheiks in the Anbar \nSunni region, after part of his family was murdered by al-Qaida, came \nto an American colonel and said: We have had it, we want to fight with \nyou. We want these guys out of Anbar. We don't want to be dominated by \nal-Qaida in Iraq. The commander seized the moment and put a couple of \ntanks around the guy's house. From that action by the colonel and the \naddition of combat forces, Anbar Province is a completely different \nplace.\n  If you ask me what is the most successful event of all within the \nsurge period of time, I would argue it is the uprising in Anbar \nProvince by Iraqi Sunni Arabs against the al-Qaida presence in Anbar. \nThey have rejected the al-Qaida agenda and joined forces with the \ncoalition forces, American forces, and we have literally delivered a \npunishing blow to al-Qaida in Anbar Province--to the point now that \nRamadi and Fallujah are some of the safest places in all of Iraq.\n  So for the American public to grasp what is going on here, I think \nyou have to understand this one fact. When Arab Muslim people say no to \nal-Qaida and we will fight bin Laden, his agents, and sympathizers, \nthat is a good day for America. That is what the war is going to be \nabout conventionally, in terms of how we win. If the people in the \nMideast turn on al-Qaida and they say no and shoulder the burden of \nfighting and create a community in place of al-Qaida's agenda that is \nmore tolerant, more open, that will allow the Shia and the Kurds to \nlive in peace; that will not try to pass on the al-Qaida philosophy and \nagenda to everybody surrounding the region. So this is incredibly good \nnews from the surge, with the increased combat capability and the \noverplaying of al-Qaida's hand in Anbar; they were incredibly vicious \nto the people.\n  I have been to Iraq 11 times, and the stories that come out of Anbar \nProvince while al-Qaida dominated the region are heart-breaking and \nbone-chilling. Now we have, in April of 2008, a completely changed \nAnbar Province, where we have over 90,000 Iraqis, called the ``Sons of \nIraq,'' patrolling their communities at night and during the day to \nmake sure al-Qaida doesn't come back.\n  Iraq is a changed place in many ways. If you had to list the winners \nand losers of the surge, I argue that the biggest loser of all is the \nal-Qaida presence in Iraq. Any time al-Qaida is losing, we are winning. \nWhat has happened in that period of time? The economic progress in Iraq \nis real and is fundamentally different than it was before the surge. \nThe reason I think we\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\nhave had economic progress in Iraq is because, with better security, \nyou can engage in commerce. It is hard to run an economy when you are \nafraid to go to work. It is hard to build a society when your children \ncannot go to school. The GDP growth in Iraq is about 7 percent, and \ninflation before the surge was at 66 percent. Now it is close to 12 \npercent, and dropping. The oil production is up by 50 percent. \nElectricity demand is up by 25 percent.\n  We have economic progress in Iraq that is showing signs of a vibrant \ncountry moving toward normalcy. We had a budget path in Baghdad by the \nIraqi Parliament, where Sunni, Shia, and Kurds took the $48 billion of \nrevenue that the central government has under their authority and \nshared it with each province and each and every group within Iraq. What \ndoes that mean? I think most political leaders in America would tell \nyou that money is political power. In our minority status as \nRepublicans, the Democratic majority gives us an allocation to run our \nstaffs and participate in committee activity. We share the resources of \nrunning the Senate. We sit down and say the Republicans get this and \nthe Democrats get that. That is a recognition that we may disagree \nwith, but we all have a vibrant role and we need the resources. The \nfact that the Shia, Sunni, and Kurds were able to come together and \nallocate resources owned by the country as a whole to each and every \ngroup is a major step forward. It would not have happened a year and a \nhalf ago. It is a buy-in by every group that Iraq is a separate country \nwith a common identity. When you can get all three groups giving the \nresources of the country to each other, that is a buy-in to win Iraq.\n  There is more than that. An amnesty law was passed about 90 days ago. \nThat means there are thousands of people in jail in Iraq--mostly \nSunnis--who were captured in part of the surge and some before--that \nwere taking up arms against the central government. These Sunnis in \njail didn't want to participate in democracy. They ran the show under \nSaddam Hussein. Even though they were a minority in Iraq when Saddam \nwas in power, they ran the show. They had an uprising, using violence \nto get their way, to topple the government. They landed in jail. One \nthing history will tell you and teach you, if you follow it closely, is \nthat there will never be a reconciliation of a country that is divided \nethnically or politically until there is a level of forgiveness. \nReconciliation is a word, and it means nothing without action. The \namnesty law was passed by the Shia, Kurds, and Sunnis, and it gave the \npeople in jail who were captured as part of the Sunni insurgency a \nchance to be released and to start over again. There have been 24,000 \napplications to be released from jail under the amnesty law and 17,000, \nI have been told, have been granted.\n  That is a statement by the Shia and the Kurds who were on the \nreceiving end of the violence to the people in jail, saying: Go back \nhome. Let's start over as a new country. That, to me, is an act of \nforgiveness that is a precondition to reconciliation, and it would not \nhave happened if there had not been a surge in the reduction of \nsectarian violence.\n  I see my good friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I wonder if I might interrupt the Senator to ask a couple of \nquestions.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Please.\n  Mr. KYL. I think the Senator from South Carolina makes an exceedingly \nimportant point here, and that is that our theory, which was that the \nMuslim world itself had to reject this virulent, militant Islamist \napproach, which is manifested in the terrorism of al-Qaida; that until \nthe Muslim world itself turned on those militants, those terrorists, it \nwould be difficult for the West itself to actually defeat terrorism. It \ncould pose a defensive posture, but it would not be defeated. What the \nSenator from South Carolina has said is what we are now seeing, as a \nresult of the American support for the Iraqi people: A, a unification \nof the Iraqi people and, B, importantly, a rejection of this militant \nIslamist terrorism to the point that they are now joining in the fight \nand have something invested in that in terms of their country.\n  The question I want to ask has to do with how all of this relates to \nAmerican security. Yesterday, Senator Warner asked both General \nPetraeus and Ambassador Crocker whether, as a result of the success of \nthe surge--and a key point that the Senator from South Carolina made, \nthat now the Iraqi Muslim population was itself fighting to excise this \ncancer from the region--whether this fact does translate into America \nbeing safer. I wonder if the Senator could comment on both General \nPetraeus's response to that and Ambassador Crocker's response, and the \nSenator's own extensive experience and what his comments on that would \nbe.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I asked General Petraeus that very question. He said that \nanytime Muslims would take up arms against al-Qaida, it is marching \ntoward the solution America has been seeking. I think General Petraeus, \nmyself, and Senators Kyl and Lieberman understand this war is not just \nabout killing terrorists; this is about supporting moderation where you \ncan find it, isolating the elements within the region.\n  If you had to put a list of extreme elements together, al-Qaida would \nbe at the top. To those men and women who have participated in the \nsurge and stood by the Anbar Iraqis who turned on al-Qaida, I think you \nhave made our country safer. To the Iraqis who took up arms against al-\nQaida, I think you have made Iraq safer and the world safer.\n  Mr. President, my question back to the Senator from Arizona, if I \nmay, is, from his understanding of what was said yesterday, what can \nthe Congress do, rather than criticize, what constructively can we do \nas a body to support those in harm's way and make sure we leave Iraq \nwith a successful outcome?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, that is an extremely important question \nbecause there is a lot of rhetoric about this war. The question is, \nWhat is the action line here, what can Congress do? Actually, it is a \nquestion of what Congress must do.\n  As I understand it, looking at General Petraeus's testimony, he was \nvery adamant that Congress needed to pass the supplemental \nappropriations bill that will actually fund the troops in the field. \nThis money was requested over a year ago. It represents a little over \n$100 billion.\n  According to his testimony, it is critical not only to the military \nneeds but also he importantly talked about the Commander's Emergency \nResponse Program, the State Department's Quick Response Fund, and the \nUSAID programs.\n  The Senator from South Carolina was talking a moment ago about this \ntwo-part process, not only the political reconciliation but the \neconomic reconstruction of the country.\n  General Petraeus himself, who clearly wants to get the troops funded, \nnoted the interrelationship of the funding to help reconstruct the \ncountry, as well as to support the troops.\n  We are very soon going to be in a situation, according to Secretary \nGates, where the Armed Forces are going to have to allow money to be \nborrowed from their regular operational accounts to fund the operations \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. He said the results of that would be a \nslowdown in training and equipping Iraqi forces, the halting of \nmilitary operations and pay of defense personnel, and losing the \nability to replace lost and damaged equipment by ongoing operations \nand, finally, that some operations simply would not be started because \nthey will not know in advance that the funding will be there to \ncomplete the operation, something with which I am sure no operational \ncommander in the field would want to live.\n  My understanding of his testimony is he very strongly urged the \nCongress to quickly pass the supplemental appropriations bill so the \ntroops in the field can be funded and do the mission, after all, we \nhave sent them to do.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I see our colleague, Senator Lieberman, is \non the floor. If I may, I wish to direct a question his way.\n  One of the themes of the testimony from General Petraeus is that \nafter the surge has progressed to this stage, the biggest threat to \nIraqi stability is no longer al-Qaida or sectarian violence but special \ngroups trained by the Iranian Government sent back into Iraq to \ndestabilize this effort of moderation.\n\n[[Page S2775]]\n\n  Mr. President, can Senator Lieberman tell us his take on Iran's \ninvolvement and where he thinks we need to go as a nation?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from South Carolina \nand also my friend from Arizona.\n  This is a very important question, and I thought it was a very \ncompelling part of the testimony offered both by General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Crocker yesterday. If I may approach this by going back to \nthe colloquy between my two friends earlier, they put their finger on a \nvery important point. Let me go even a little further back.\n  After 9/11/01, after we were attacked, one of the insights we had was \nthere is a violent civil war, both theological and political, going on \nwithin the Muslim world between a small group of fanatics, violent \njihadists and the rest of the Muslim world who are pretty much like the \nrest of all of us. They want to live better, freer, more opportunity-\nfilled lives for themselves and their children.\n  We went into Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein. We are there now to \nessentially help the Iraqis--and remember, Iraq is not just another \ncountry. It is one of the historic centers of the Arab world--to help \nthis great country and its leaders and people to take hold of their own \ndestiny and, in doing so, reject the extremists, the jihadists, the \nsuicide bombers, and create for the Muslim world a different path to \nthe future than the extremism and suicidal death and hatred and \nprimitivism that al-Qaida, the current leadership of Iran, and others \nof that sort present to them.\n  Part of what the testimony yesterday, I think, from Ambassador \nCrocker and General Petraeus said is that thanks to the backing of the \nUnited States through the surge, the Iraqis are taking control of their \ndestiny.\n  As my colleagues pointed out, the moderates are winning. They have \nal-Qaida on the run out of Al Anbar Province. The businesses are \nreopening. The children are going back to school. They have hopes of a \nbetter future.\n  One of our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee said to General \nPetraeus: What is going on here? I thought we were in Iraq to fight al-\nQaida. Now you are telling me we pretty much have beaten al-Qaida, we \nhave them on the run, and now you are telling us we are there to fight \nIran.\n  That question missed the point, the point my colleagues have made in \ntheir colloquy. The point is, we are there for an affirmative reason. \nWe are there to help the Iraqis establish a self-governing, self-\ndefending moderate country, an antiterrorist country. We do have al-\nQaida on the run, but as the two witnesses made clear yesterday, Iran \nis not on the run. In fact, Iran is an expansionist, fanatic power not \nonly working through these special groups in Iraq but through Hezbollah \nin Lebanon and through Hamas in the Palestinian areas. They were \ntremendous statements yesterday, very strong.\n  Ambassador Crocker:\n\n       Iran continues to undermine the efforts of the Iraqi \n     Government to establish a stable, secure state.\n\n  This takes me--and then I will yield back to my colleagues--to what \nseemed to be the frustration of some of our colleagues on the committee \nyesterday. They were trying to get General Petraeus and Ambassador \nCrocker to tell us again: We are going to get all our troops or most of \nour troops out by X date. Fortunately, General Petraeus and Ambassador \nCrocker are not accountable to political calculus. They have been given \nthe responsibility for this mission. They have American lives on the \nline. They have lost American lives.\n\n  The answer General Petraeus gave us is clearly the right one: I wish \nI could tell you how many brigades more I can pull out after July, but \nI can't until I see what conditions on the ground are. Maybe I can \nbring out some more, but maybe I can't. If I do it prematurely, we will \nrun the risk of chaos and a loss of all we have gained in Iraq; \nfrankly, a disrespect of the lives of Americans who have been lost \nthere. Their families and loved ones always tell us: Don't let them to \nhave died in vain. The No. 1 winner, if we pull out prematurely, would \nbe Iran. They are all over Iraq. They have their hands in just about \neverything.\n  If we leave and chaos ensues, as Ambassador Crocker said yesterday:\n\n       Iran has said publicly it will fill any vacuum in Iraq, and \n     extremist Shi'a militias would reassert themselves.\n\n  We cannot let that happen. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think our time expires in the next 5 \nminutes. I will quickly wrap up my thoughts and ask my colleagues to \ncomment.\n  People want to know when we are going to come home. Trust me, if you \nhave been to Iraq at all, if you spent any time with our men and women \nin uniform, you want them to be with their families and out of harm's \nway in the most desperate way.\n  The point I want people to remember is these are all volunteers. Some \nhave been there two, three, four times. They make one simple request to \nme as a Senator: Take care of us, but support us so we can win. The \nreason they go back time and time again is they understand the \nconsequences to our Nation if we lose.\n  So if you want to take stress off the military--and don't we all--the \nbest stress we can take off our military is the stress of not knowing \nif they are going to be allowed to win.\n  I hope colleagues in this body will respect General Petraeus's \nreasoned opinion and give him some deference because I think he has \nproduced results that will go down in history as one of the most \nsuccessful military counterinsurgency operations anywhere on the planet \nand give a little deference and respect to Ambassador Crocker, who has \nput together political progress under the most difficult circumstances, \nwhere the Iraqis are seeing each other now not as enemies but as \npartners in an endeavor to create a better life for themselves, to live \nat peace with their neighbors, and to make the whole world safer \nagainst extremism.\n  When we come home is not the question for the ages. It may be for \nyour next election and it may be about your political future; that may \nbe the way you are looking at it or it may be about the Republican \nParty's political future. It is not that way for me, Senator McCain, or \nI think anybody else, certainly not for Senator Lieberman.\n  The question for me, the question for our Nation, and the world over \ntime is, What did we leave behind? I am more confident than ever that \nwe can leave behind, in the heart of the Mideast, in the center of the \nArab world, a group of people called Iraqis, who will be our friends \nfor a long time to come, will contain Iranian expansionism, and will \ncontinue to be al-Qaida's worst nightmare. That day is coming. The only \nway we can lose now is for Congress to undercut it.\n  To Senator Kyl, how important is it for the Congress to pass a \nsupplemental without strings attached?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to my colleague there are going to be \nefforts apparently to hold this war funding hostage to other funding \nrequests. For example, one of our colleagues said we are going to look \nat the supplemental not only for the $190 billion for the war--by the \nway, that figure is incorrect; it is $102 billion--but also what we can \ndo on this bill for summer jobs programs.\n  I submit it is important to fund the troops because we have sent them \non a mission. They volunteered, and they deserve our support. We should \nnot threaten to withhold that support unless there is also funding for \nother programs that have a far lower priority than the security of our \ntroops and the security of the United States.\n  I will also add one other point. In reading from what General \nPetraeus said yesterday and focusing right down on the American people, \nit is clearly in our national interest, he said, to help Iraq prevent \nthe resurgence of al-Qaida in the heart of the Arab world. Both he and \nAmbassador Crocker said it is worth it to the United States that the \nsuccess there is making us safer here at home. That is what it all gets \nback to, when folks say we need to have supplemental funding on other \nprograms. This is making us safer at home.\n  I will conclude. I want my colleague from Connecticut to comment for \na moment, and the Senator from Tennessee also wanted a couple minutes \nat the end of our time. I assured him we would have a of couple \nminutes. We may have to ask for an extra minute or so.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend. Briefly, I recount a \nconversation with a friend of mine this morning. He said, watching the \nhearings yesterday, that he thought those\n\n[[Page S2776]]\n\nwho have been critical of our effort in Iraq seemed quite restrained \nyesterday. I said they were, and I think it is because the record \nGeneral Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker were giving us was one of \nremarkable progress militarily, politically, and economically. It was \nhard to criticize, so the criticisms were kind of around the side: Why \ncan't you tell us when we will get out exactly? Why didn't President \nMaliki consult more before he went south?\n  What I wish is that our colleagues had accepted the facts General \nPetraeus and Ambassador Crocker gave us of the extraordinary progress \nin Iraq, which is very critical to our security because it creates a \nvictory for the moderates, the good guys in the civil war within the \nIslamic world, and it protects our security in that sense because, \nremember, it is the fanatics who killed 3,000 of us on 9/11.\n  Let's hope for another day when there will be an agreement on the \nfacts, and maybe we can get together to figure out how we can \naccelerate progress in Iraq so what all of us want can happen, which is \nwe bring as many of our troops home as quickly as possible, with honor \nand after success. What can Congress do? I would say two things, after \nlistening yesterday. One is to pass a supplemental. The second is to \nstay out of the way and not force our military and diplomatic leaders \nto snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Don't impose deadlines.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nAlexander be recognized for 3 minutes to celebrate a big event for the \nState of Tennessee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the Senator from \nTennessee is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/09/senate-section/article/S2776-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATIONS TO THE LADY VOLS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina \nfor his courtesy, and the Senator from Arizona as well, and I note the \npresence on the floor of the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from \nConnecticut as well.\n  I am sure a great many of the men and women of our Armed Forces, over \nthe last few days, have been watching basketball when they could, and \nyesterday I expressed my pride in the University of Memphis Tigers, how \nthey got to the finals of the NCAA Men's Division in basketball only to \nbe defeated by a very good Kansas team. Well, today I have even better \nnews. Last night, the University of Tennessee Lady Vols won their \neighth NCAA women's basketball championship. They defeated an \nextraordinarily good Stanford team.\n  The Tennessee team has very good players. The Senator from Illinois, \nMr. Durbin, and I talked earlier this morning about Candace Parker from \nIllinois, from his home State. She may very well be the best woman \ncollege basketball player already. She is likely to be the first in the \ndraft today of the WNBA, and this is her last year. She has graduated \nand has played 3 years.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S2776, April 9, 2008, the Record reads: . . . Pat Summit \n. . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . Pat Summitt \n. . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  There were four seniors who played. But even though there were \nextraordinary players, this one has to be about the coach as well. Pat \nSummitt has won national championships so often, she has made it look \neasy. She won last year as well as this year. She has won back-to-back \nchampionships before. She has won 983 games. This has been remarkably \ndifficult. In her 34 years, she has dominated women's basketball. She \nhas defined it. But she has also helped it with her spaghetti suppers \nfor visiting players, with her encouraging other coaches, with her \npatience with the news media. She has shown her willingness to change, \nvisiting with Phil Jackson about what offense to put in; to react to \ndisappointment, playing with her superstar, the young woman from \nIllinois, Candace Parker, who was playing her last two games with a \ndislocated shoulder.\n  What I like best about the Lady Vols is not their winning streak over \nthe years, it is the example they set. When I was president of the \nUniversity of Tennessee, which was 15 or so years ago, I would proudly \ntell everyone that Pat Summitt and her teams have not only won \nchampionships, but their players graduated. It was true then and I \nbelieve it is true today that every single young woman who has played \nbasketball for Pat Summitt for 4 years has graduated from the \nUniversity of Tennessee. Pat Summitt not only requires them to go to \nclass, she says: You go to class and you sit in the front row. I want \nthe professors to know you are there.\n  Just a glimpse of Coach Summitt and her young players on national \ntelevision is the best possible advertisement for the University of \nTennessee that I can imagine. If Pat Summitt were the conductor of a \nsymphony, one would say she has mastered the crescendo because she \nalways plays the toughest schedule, but somehow she has learned as a \ncoach to get the most out of her team, to have them playing the best as \nthey get to the NCAA tournament, as they get to the Final Four, and as \nthey get to the championship game, as they have so often.\n  So congratulations to the players, Parker and Hornbuckle, Bobbitt and \nAnosike and Auguste--those are the young women who played their last \ngame last night. But special congratulations to Pat Summitt, whose \nremarkable career reminds us of what a mirror of the best of our \nsociety can look like.\n  I thank the President.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to address a question through the Chair, although \nit is more a comment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And I would like to join with the Senator from Tennessee. \nWe did speak this morning about that great game last night, and great \npraise to Stanford for yielding a wonderful squad and great players, \ntoo, and making it all the way to the finals. But a special praise to \nPat Summitt and the Lady Vols from Tennessee. We had a special interest \nin the team because of Candace Parker. She is an extraordinary young \nwoman, and watching her play with that physical challenge of her \ndislocated shoulder was an indication not only of her skill but of her \ncourage.\n  When one of the players on the Tennessee team was injured toward the \nend of the game, you could sense the team feeling. There were tears \nrunning down the cheeks of fellow players. There was the sense of such \na close-knit unit. That says a lot about them and an awful lot about \ntheir coach.\n  When we get into debates here on the floor of the Senate about title \nIX and women's athletics, I hope we can invite someone like Pat \nSummitt, someone like Candace Parker, and others to come and tell us \nwhat a transformative experience it has been for them to participate at \nthis level of sport and to really achieve so much, not only on the \ncourt but in their lives, and I salute the Lady Vols.\n  I congratulate the Senator.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his friendship, \nand we both admire a great coach and a great team and a great \nperformance, which we saw last night.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding the majority now \nhas 30 minutes in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/09/senate-section/article/S2776-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2776-S2779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the country is consumed with the \nappearance this week of General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker from \nIraq. This is our annual report. Companies make annual reports. People \nlike Warren Buffett call in to Omaha, NE, to shareholders of Berkshire \nHathaway to talk about the state of his corporation and what the \nprospects are of the future. It has become an annual occurrence here on \nCapitol Hill that the two leaders from the diplomatic and military side \ncome and make their report to Congress.\n  This is indeed the beginning of the sixth year of this war. This war \nin Iraq has lasted longer than World War II. By the end of this summer, \nit will have lasted longer than World War I and World War II combined. \nWe have lost over 4,000 of our best and bravest, our\n\n[[Page S2777]]\n\nmen and women in uniform who have given their lives in this conflict--\n30,000 injured. Many with permanent injuries have returned from this \nbattlefield.\n  Our military has been stretched to the absolute limit. There is no \ndoubt in my mind that the U.S. military is the best in the world. You \nonly have to meet them, you only have to understand the challenges they \nhave faced and the success they have shown to know that. But it \ntroubles me that in the midst of this debate about how long we can stay \nin Iraq, we are actually saying: How long can our military stay in Iraq \nwith the support of the American people?\n  An honest appraisal of the American military today, in the sixth year \nof this war, will tell you they have paid a heavy price beyond the \ndeaths and injuries. There is a serious challenge facing our military. \nThe leaders--General Cody, who testified just a few weeks ago, and \nGeneral McCaffrey--have told us that Iraq has pushed the U.S. Army to \nthe breaking point. That is a sobering appraisal by the military itself \nof what this war has done to our great military.\n  Just the other day, the Army reported increased stress, anxiety, and \ndepression for 27 percent of soldiers returning to Iraq for a third and \nfourth tour. Those of us who have been there to meet with soldiers, as \nI have on three different occasions, will tell you that these \nextraordinarily long deployments of our soldiers are virtually \nunprecedented since World War II, and they have taken their toll.\n  Our soldiers today are usually married. In previous wars, they were \nnot. So they go to battle remembering that they have left behind \nspouses and children. On a daily basis, they are in contact by e-mail. \nThey know if the car doesn't start. They know when the baby has to go \nto the doctor. They know when there is a problem paying the bills. They \nknow it in real time.\n  In addition to the stress of being in battle and in combat, they have \nthe added stress of separation from their families and the knowledge \nthat for many of them it will be 15 months in deployment before they \ncan come home.\n  A lieutenant colonel from Georgia, a career man, said to me as I \nleft: Senator, we have to do something about these deployments. They \nare just entirely too long. And the period between deployments isn't \nlong enough. He talked about leaving Georgia with his daughter in the \nfifth grade and returning after his deployment to find her in the \nseventh grade. He missed a year of her life.\n  He also talked about the fact that bringing these troops home for a \nyear or sometimes even less before they are sent away again doesn't \ngive them time to rest, to reunite with their families, to be \nreequipped, retrained, and to bring in new recruits and integrate them \ninto the unit. We turn them around so quickly because this \nadministration, and those who support it, look beyond the obvious, take \nfor granted that the military will be there time and time again, and \npursue a foreign policy which, sadly, has been a misguided policy from \nthe start.\n  I will recall that evening as long as I serve in this body, in \nOctober of 2002, when we cast that fateful vote to give President \nGeorge W. Bush the authority to invade Iraq, an authority which he \nused. It was a historic night and a sad night for many of us. Twenty-\nthree Senators, 1 Republican and 22 Democrats, voted against the \nauthorization to invade Iraq. I recall that evening believing that this \nPresident was poised and prepared and ready to go into Iraq. He had \nmisled through statements--inaccurate statements. The American people \nwere misled about the circumstance involving that invasion.\n  Do you recall the fear we had? We were told about weapons of mass \ndestruction--biological, chemical weapons, nuclear weapons. We were \ntold Saddam Hussein was somehow linked to the terrible tragedy of 9/11. \nWe were told his continued presence in the Middle East made it more \ndangerous for Israel, for many of our closest friends and allies. We \nwere told he was developing predator aircraft that could be sent in \nremote ways to drop these weapons of mass destruction all around the \nMiddle East, if not beyond.\n  Virtually every one of those statements made by this administration \nprior to the invasion of Iraq was wrong, inaccurate, and was proven to \nhave been false. America was misled into this war.\n  That does not diminish in any way the bravery and courage and \ndetermination of our troops, but it says that the policymakers, many of \nwhom are finally going to leave the scene in a few months, have to \naccept the verdict of history that they were wrong. They were wrong to \nlead us into this war, and the price we have paid has been a heavy \nprice for that deception and that mistake.\n  They come now and tell us that even if we were wrong getting into \nthis war, even if it lasted far longer than anyone anticipated, even if \nthe cost of this war in human lives and actual dollars went \ndramatically beyond anyone's expectation, we have to ``stay the \ncourse.'' We have to stay the course. How many times have we been told \nby these military leaders and by the President that when the Iraqis are \nprepared to stand up with their own defense force, America's troops can \nstand down? I have heard that until I am weary of it.\n  Years ago, when I went to Iraq, I was greeted then by General \nPetraeus, who was not in charge but was part of the leadership there, \nand he took me off for a little exercise at the airfield to show me \nwhat the troops were doing--the Iraqi troops. I couldn't tell you \nwhether it demonstrated skill or not. I am not an expert in military \ndeployment by any means. But a handful of Iraqi soldiers, whose faces \nwere hooded so they couldn't be identified by other Iraqis, went \nthrough the routine of a drill. I suppose it was undertaken to impress \nus. It didn't. I thought to myself: I will believe the Iraqi military \nhas really reached the point of professionalism when they start \nreplacing American soldiers and American soldiers start coming home.\n  Year after weary year, we have invested millions and millions of \ndollars in the training of their soldiers and their police. Yet 140,000 \nof our soldiers are still rising this morning and every morning risking \ntheir lives for the people of Iraq.\n  I sometimes wonder if the Iraqi people have really come to the basic \nconclusion as to whether they are a nation worth fighting for. I do not \nknow the answer to that. When you hear what is going on in Iraq \nrecently, where 1,000 Iraqi soldiers turned and deserted in battle, it \nis not encouraging. It tells me that despite all the time, all the \nmoney, and all the bloodshed, this war continues unabated.\n  I know now that many want to see this administration leave and hand \nover the quagmire of Iraq to the next President. That next President, \nwhoever that person may be, will inherit two wars from this \nadministration--in Iraq and Afghanistan--a recession, a situation where \nhealth care across America is in crisis, an energy challenge the likes \nof which we have never seen in this country, an environmental challenge \nof global warming that challenges not only our Nation but the entire \nworld, entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare on the \nropes, and, unfortunately, a country that needs real leadership. That \nis the legacy of the Bush administration.\n  For General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker to come before us and \ntalk about staying the course for another 9 or 10 months, to me betrays \nthe obvious. We have given the Iraqi people more than any nation can \nask, in terms of human life and treasure. It is estimated that the \ntotal cost of this war will be somewhere in the range of $3 trillion. \nWhat could we have done with that money in America had it been spent \nfor America's strength? Just imagine: We could have provided 5.7 \nmillion Americans with health coverage each year since the war began, \nhired 430,000 new teachers across America, built 1 million units of \naffordable housing, and provided 4-year scholarships at State \nuniversities for 4.7 million students. Instead, the money has been sunk \nin Iraq.\n  Just so the record is straight, the Iraqis are not paupers. They have \nbountiful sources of oil that they sell. While we labor with one of the \nlargest deficits--in fact, the largest deficit in the history of the \nUnited States, a debt, a mortgage we are passing on to our children--\nwhile we labor with that and are asked by the President to send another \n$100 billion into Iraq with the next request coming in just a few days, \nthe Iraqis today have a surplus in their\n\n[[Page S2778]]\n\ntreasury of over $25 billion. We are sacrificing in America to send \nmoney to Iraq to rebuild their country while they are building a \nsurplus in their treasury from their oil revenues. What is wrong with \nthis picture? There is no earthly explanation for that, and it is a \nfact.\n  I think, too, of what this means in the long term for the next \nPresident. That next President is going to inherit a terrible \nsituation, finding an honorable way out of Iraq. I notice when the \nRepublicans refer to that they always talk about a precipitous \nwithdrawal. No one is calling for that. But the Democratic candidates \nfor President are talking about bringing our troops home. I do not \nbelieve there is any other way for the Iraqis to be convinced that this \nis their nation and their future and their responsibility. As long as \nthey can dial 9-1-1 and order up the best and bravest soldiers in the \nworld to come from America and defend them, they are not going to \naccept their responsibility and do what is necessary.\n  Meanwhile, our military is devastated by this war. West Point-\neducated officers are leaving the Army in record numbers. Between 2001 \nand 2004, there was a doubling of the Army's divorce rate and a \ndramatic increase in suicide among the members of the military, \nparticularly from the National Guard. In addition to that, we know we \nare waiving requirements for recruits. One out of eight new Army \nrecruits has a criminal record, some with serious charges. We are \nlowering the requirements for basic education to bring in recruits. We \nare offering thousands of dollars to 19-year-olds fresh out of high \nschool if they will just sign up to be in the Army. That is not good \nfor the future of our country. It is not good for the future of our \nmilitary.\n  We know that an estimated 90,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed, \nand maybe more, innocent people caught in the crossfire of a war. We \nknow there are literally millions of Iraqi refugees, and shamefully the \nUnited States has been unwilling to even accept Iraqi refugees who have \nrisked their lives for our troops and our safety. It is just \nunconscionable that countries around the world are accepting these \nrefugees and the United States, which has needed them and used them, \nrefuses to accept them. It is a fact.\n  We have dangerously emboldened Iran, which is moving closer to the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons with this morning's announcement. In \nfact, it was actually Iran that helped broker an end to the recent \nviolence in Basra.\n  If this invasion of Iraq was determined to show the strength of the \nUnited States, it is hard to show while we are still there 6 years \nlater with no end in sight. If this invasion of Iraq was designed to \ndiminish the power of Iran in the Middle East, it is hard to believe \nanyone could make that assertion today, with proof to back it up. That \nis the reality of what we face.\n  When I hear Senator McCain and Republican leaders talk about staying \nthe course, I understand--and I hope Americans do--that we need to \nchange the course. We need to change the direction of this war. We need \nto start to bring our brave soldiers home to the victor's welcome they \ndeserve. We need to start to say to the Iraqis: Stand up and defend \nyour own country. We need to start extricating ourselves from Iraq so \nthis money we are now spending to build Iraq and make it stronger can \ngive us strength right here at home. Instead of creating jobs in Iraq, \nwe should be creating good-paying jobs right here in America, jobs that \ncan't be outsourced, jobs that make a decent paycheck with benefits and \nhealth care and a promise of a good pension. We should be investing in \nthis country's schools, in this country's hospitals, in this country's \ninfrastructure, and the Iraqis should use their oil revenues to \nstrengthen their own country and come together and make the hard \npolitical decisions which they have avoided.\n  I will close and turn it over to my colleague, Senator Cardin from \nMaryland, by telling you that the debate will continue, and in a few \nweeks the President's supplemental request will be before us. It is \nanother opportunity for us to engage this Chamber in a debate. I know \nand we all know that the majority of Republicans refuse to join us in \ntalking about the change in direction in this war. We know as well that \nthis President will veto anything that changes his policies. He is \ndetermined to leave office with Iraq in the same condition that we know \nit today, with no change in basic policy before us.\n  The time is coming and coming soon--in November--when the American \npeople have the last word. Finally, after 4 years, they get a chance to \nspeak. They get a chance to pick a leader, to change the direction of \nthis country in the right way, to make certain we have economic \npolicies that build America and make it stronger--our families and our \nbusinesses--and to make certain we have a new policy in Iraq which \nreally focuses on capturing Osama bin Laden, beating back the al-Qaida \nwherever they are found--in Pakistan or Afghanistan--making America \nsafe from terrorism, and stopping what has been a longstanding and \nnegative impact of this President's policy in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, first, let me compliment and thank the \nassistant majority leader, the Senator from Illinois, for his \nconsistent comments with regard to the U.S. role in Iraq. He has made \nit clear that the U.S. interest has not been served by these last 5 \nyears, that we have lost our focus on the war on terror. As he pointed \nout, we have real concerns, internationally, about terrorism, and we \nhave been distracted, particularly in Afghanistan, because of the focus \non Iraq.\n  He pointed out very clearly that the United States has invested so \nmuch--the lives of our soldiers, the cost to the taxpayers, those who \nhave come back wounded. And what have we done this for? These soldiers \ndeserve the right mission: that we concentrate on dealing with the war \nagainst terror, that we have the Iraqis take responsibility for their \nown country, particularly in the midst of civil war. A lot of this is \njust Iraqis fighting Iraqis--Shiites fighting Shiites for power--and \nthe United States has sustained fighters on both sides, in some cases. \nThis is so counterproductive to U.S. interests.\n  I congratulate the Senator and thank him for continuing to bring out \nthese issues. We hope in the next 10 months there will be some changes. \nWe also understand we have to transition to a different mission, \nconsidering the type of sacrifices that have been made by our troops \nand the taxpayers of this country. I thank him very much for his \nleadership.\n  Madam President, I was part of the Foreign Relations Committee \nyesterday when General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker testified before \nour committee. When I had the time, I started to thank, on behalf of \nthe people of Maryland, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker and all \nthe soldiers and all the diplomats who have served in Iraq. They have \nserved with great distinction. I am humbled by their skills and \nsacrifices. I acknowledge the tremendous sacrifices that have been made \nby their families. But I must tell you, they deserve the right mission, \nwhat is in the best interests of the United States. How should we judge \nthat progress? It is an interesting point, as to whether we have made \nsatisfactory progress in Iraq.\n  Let me go back to January 10, 2007, when the President brought \nforward his ``New Way Forward in Iraq.'' His own words were that:\n\n       If we increase our support at this crucial moment, and help \n     the Iraqis break the current cycle of violence, we can hasten \n     the day our troops begin coming home.\n\n  One of the reasons for the surge was to reduce our troop levels. But \nif we look at the presurge troop levels, it was 132,000 Americans; at \nthe height of the surge last July, 160,000; and today, we have more \nthan 140,000. We learned yesterday that General Petraeus believes we \nwill be at that 140,000 level for the indefinite future, that there \ncannot be a commitment made at this stage to reduce our troop levels \nbelow 140,000. So at the end of the day we have more troops in Iraq \nrather than less.\n  The President stated in that same speech:\n\n       Over time, we can expect . . . growing trust and \n     cooperation from Baghdad's residents. When this happens, \n     daily life will improve, Iraqis will gain confidence in their \n     leaders, and the government will have the breathing space it \n     needs to make progress in other critical areas.\n\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\n\n  As a result of that, benchmarks were established--not by the \nCongress, benchmarks were established by President Bush and his \nadministration with the Iraqi Government. When you look at the progress \nwe have made--let me use General Petraeus's comments that he made:\n\n       No one [in the U.S. or the Iraqi government] feels that \n     there has been sufficient progress by any means in the areas \n     of national reconciliation or in the provision of basic \n     public services.\n\n  Only 3 of the 18 benchmarks have been satisfactorily met. The \ncircumstances on the ground in Iraq are unsatisfactory. Iraqis are not \ngetting the basic services they need.\n  I questioned Ambassador Crocker, and following up questions that I \nposed to a panel we had last week before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, a panel of retired generals, experts in this area, and that \nwas: Can you name a national leader in Iraq who is willing to step \nforward to provide the type of leadership, make the necessary \nconcessions so that you can have a government in Iraq that has the \nconfidence of its people? Because that is what we need to make the \npolitical progress. No one could mention a person's name. Ambassador \nCrocker said--and I used the examples of South Africa and Northern \nIreland, where you had people willing to step forward--Ambassador \nCrocker said:\n\n       There is no Nelson Mandela in Iraq.\n\n  What an understatement that was. That was the understatement of our \nhearing.\n  We seem to be changing our goals as to what is success or what we are \ntrying to achieve, what is in the best interests of America, what type \nof government we want in Iraq. Well, our expectations certainly have \nchanged there. There is no expectation that we will have the type of \nstrong national government that has the confidence of all the ethnic \ncommunities. We have changed the expectation as to what that Government \nin Iraq's relationship will be with Iran. We seem to acknowledge that \nit may, in fact, strengthen Iran. There is no agreement now that we \nneed to reduce our troop levels--certainly by the administration's \nmission. They want to maintain the troop level at the current level \nwith no commitment to reduce it. There is certainly no expectation to \nreduce the cost to U.S. taxpayers. We are going to get a supplemental \nappropriation asking for more money from the U.S. taxpayers.\n  We certainly have not focused on the major dangers against terrorism. \nIf we did, we would be concentrating on Afghanistan, not spending so \nmuch effort in Iraq. The current situation yesterday was characterized \nby our experts as: fragile, uneven, reversible. We went through the \ncurrent flare-ups in Basra and Baghdad where Shiite are fighting \nShiite, a fight for power within Iraq with U.S. soldiers in the middle \nof that power struggle.\n  We went through the influence of Iran and that the U.S. soldiers' \npresence may, in fact, be generating more support for Iran within Iraq. \nSo let's take a look at the facts: The United States is supporting \nwarring parties within Iraq. The fact is, over 5 years, over 4,000 \nsoldiers have died, American soldiers; 30,000 American soldiers have \nbeen wounded.\n  I have visited them. I know these are life-changing injuries they \nwill have to live with for the rest of their lives. Six hundred billion \ndollars and still counting of U.S. taxpayer money has been spent. This \nis a difficult mission for us to maintain. Look at our military. Our \nmilitary is stretched. Look at our National Guards. I know what is \nhappening in Maryland and our National Guard. They are serving with \ngreat distinction, but they are exhausted, and we need them in \nMaryland.\n  Look at our economy. We are losing jobs here in America. One reason \nis we are so focused on spending money in Iraq, we are not investing in \nour own country. Look what is happening on our fight against terrorism. \nPrior to our invasion of Iraq, there was no al-Qaida presence in Iraq. \nNow we have hundreds of thousands of troops, American and Iraqis, and a \ncouple thousand al-Qaida, according to General Petraeus.\n  We are not focused on the war against terror, we are focused on a \npower struggle within Iraq, which should not be our focus. We need to \ndo a better job in Afghanistan, but yet we are stuck in Iraq. We have \nno plan to draw down American troops. I find that unacceptable. That is \nnot in the best interests of this country.\n  Let me mention one more aspect of what has happened in Iraq. This is \nfactual: the number of displaced people, nearly 5 million now, nearly 5 \nmillion displaced; 2 million in neighboring countries. General Petraeus \nand Ambassador Crocker acknowledged that one of the reasons why \nviolence in Baghdad is down is that the communities, the neighborhoods \nhave been ethnically cleansed and people have left. They do not want to \nbe in a violent neighborhood. They have left.\n  But they are displaced. What is going to happen to them? Nearly three \nmillion in Iraq alone. The United Nations High Commission on Refugees \nhas said it is not safe for them to go back to their neighborhoods. \nWhat is going to happen? If we are talking about a solution for Iraq, \nwe have got to take a look at the refugees. This is a humanitarian \nconcern, it is a security concern, it is also a concern about stability \nin the region.\n  Let me give you one example. Jordan has now an extra 8 percent of its \npopulation as a result of refugees; an 8-percent increase. Now, if you \nused the same numbers in America, that would be 24 million, 24 million \npeople coming to our country. Think about the stability of the region.\n  Well, my position has been clear. I have opposed the war since its \ninception. I opposed giving the President the right to use our military \nmore than 5 years ago. I have opposed the manner in which this war has \nbeen conducted. But we are where we are. We cannot reverse history. \nWhere do we go from here?\n  Well, we have 10 months left in this administration, 10 months to go, \nand the status quo is not what we need. We need to change course in \nIraq, focus on the war on terror, rebuild and restrengthen our \nmilitary. We have got to do that and stop spending $12 billion each \nmonth in Iraq at the expense of priorities right here at home. That is \nwhat we need to do starting immediately. We should not wait until the \nnext election. We should start doing this today.\n  We need to change our mission. Our mission should be U.S. soldiers \nfighting terrorists, not refereeing community fights, neighborhood \nfights; American troops protecting our interests and helping transition \nthe Iraqis to take responsibility for their own security.\n  We should draw down the U.S. troops, bring them home. The status quo \nis not acceptable, that is, 140,000 U.S. troops remaining in Iraq.\n  There was bipartisan recognition that the status quo is unacceptable. \nSeveral of our most distinguished Republican members of the Foreign \nRelations Committee made it clear that the status quo is not \nacceptable, yet this administration is trying to maintain the status \nquo for the next 10 months.\n  I hope we can change that. Public opinion is against the status quo. \nWe know that. What we need is a surge in diplomacy. We need other \ncountries that have a direct interest in what is happening in Iraq to \nstep forward. We need to engage international organizations, the United \nNations and the OSCE. We have to have the Iraqis step forward and take \nresponsibility for the security of their own country. They have oil. We \nneed the Iraqis to pay for the costs of their own defense. The American \ntaxpayers should not be doing this.\n  One more thing I should talk about that we do not need: We do not \nneed President Bush and the Iraqi Government negotiating a long-term \nsecurity plan without Congressional approval. That would only restrict \nthe options of the next administration or future Congresses. We should \nnever allow that to happen.\n  The world has an interest in a safe and secure Iraq, but in working \ntoward that end, we cannot ignore other competing needs around the \nworld and at home. We need a more thoughtful approach that will bring \nour troops home, refocus our resources on al-Qaida, and Afghanistan and \nPakistan, step up diplomatic efforts, and internalize the effort to \nbring stability to that country and to the Middle East.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/09/senate-section/article/S2780-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2780]]\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

She is someone who \nnot only is an outstanding coach and has won eight national \nchampionships, but she also teaches players life examples and ways to \nbe successful later in life. Our students who play on the Lady Vols \nteam are steeped and focused on academics and being successful later in \nlife.

Coach John Calapiari has been \na great addition to our State. While they fell short earlier this week \nin reaching the national championship, they still raised our excitement \nlevel in Tennessee and our tremendous respect for the University of \nMemphis and what they have accomplished. I am sure at some point in the \nnear future they will achieve the ultimate goal they have of winning \nthe national championship. My hat is off to both of these outstanding \ncoaches, to both of these teams and programs which focus on student \nexcellence and making sure players are prepared for life.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, last Saturday, I held two town meetings \nin Vermont on the collapse of the middle class, and both of them were \nvery well attended. Our guest speaker was Elizabeth Warren, who is a \nprofessor of law at Harvard Law School and one of the leading writers \nin this county on economic matters.\n  In preparation for that meeting, I sent out an e-mail on my Web site \njust asking people in Vermont to tell me their personal experiences \nregarding what is happening to the middle class. We have done that in \nthe past and, frankly, I expected we would get a couple dozen \nresponses. What happened was really astounding to me and speaks about \nwhat is going on in the economy in this country today. Over a period of \na few days, we have now had some 500 responses, mostly from Vermont, \nbut also I do a national radio show, and we made a similar request \nnationally, and we have had some from out of State. They are mostly \nfrom Vermont, some from out of State, but a total of some 500 \nresponses.\n  What was absolutely astounding was the nature of these responses. \nThey were so powerful, so overwhelming, that, in fact, they were \nsometimes difficult to read. Person after person wrote with amazing \nhonesty and with an articulateness which comes from telling the truth. \nThey were not giving a great speech, as we often do here in the Senate, \ntalking about everything under the Sun. They were talking from their \nown hearts. They were talking about what it means to be trying to raise \nkids, trying to send your kids to college, trying to pay your fuel \nbills, fill up your gas tank when you get to work--amazing stories. We \nare going to post many of them on our Web site.\n  What I want to do this morning, because I think it is terribly \nimportant that the Senate hears from ordinary people to get a sense of \nwhat is really going on in America, the struggles people are having--\nmaybe it is a good idea we hear from the people rather than just \ncampaign contributors, rather than just lobbyists. The language I heard \nthat came to my Web site was extraordinary. So what I want to do this \nmorning--I have the feeling I will be doing it more than once--is just \nhave you listen to what people have to say, reading exactly the words \nthey have written to me.\n  Let me begin by reading an e-mail that came from a small town in \nnorthern Vermont. I am going to do my best to disguise the identities \nof the writers. But this is from a small town near the Canadian border. \nThis is what this writer says.:\n\n       My family has been squeezed for years now. My husband and I \n     have two children. My husband works full time and has a \n     degree. He works 60 miles away from home, and has tried to \n     find a new job closer but has been unable to do so. I tried \n     for 2 years to find a job, when I could not find a job I went \n     back to school. I am hoping that my degree will help our \n     family.\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\n       The price of gas and oil now consumes 30% of our disposable \n     income. We have cut back on groceries, and recently was only \n     able to get groceries because my parents were nice enough to \n     give us money. We are going to buy a woodstove because we are \n     afraid we will not be able to afford oil next year. We do not \n     qualify for LIHEAP. My husband got a raise last year that \n     disappeared on Jan. 1st when the cost of our health insurance \n     increased. We have to have reduced cost lunch for our \n     children, we cannot afford to put our children on his health \n     insurance plan, and luckily they are on Dr. Dynasaur--\n\n  Which is the SCHIP program in Vermont--\n\n     but now we have to pay a premium where we didn't last year.\n       We have stopped doing any fun things. We have not been able \n     to go out to eat in a long time, or to bring the kids to see \n     a movie. There are no treats. I am praying that after I \n     graduate I will be able to find a job to help my family out. \n     Of course when I go back to work both my husband and I will \n     have to start paying our student loans, and this payment will \n     amount to about $500 per month. But what other option do we \n     have? I couldn't find work. He can't find a better job closer \n     to home.\n       Both my husband and I have degrees, we did everything \n     right, we are not doing better than our parents when they \n     were our age.\n       If it wasn't for our parents we would be worse off. Our \n     parents have helped us with oil. My parents gave us $600 last \n     year to pay for our oil, my husband's parents helped us with \n     car repairs so we wouldn't go into debt. My parents have \n     given us grocery money and bought our kids school clothes. I \n     don't know what we would do without our parents.\n       This is demoralizing, my husband keeps asking when will we \n     be able to actually afford to support our own family? I'm not \n     sure what the answer is.\n       Thank you for listening.\n\n  That is a letter from a woman in northern Vermont.\n  This is a letter from a woman in north central Vermont whose job, it \nturns out, was outsourced. This is what she writes:\n\n       My husband and I are in our mid-fifties. At this time of \n     our lives we should be at our peak earning power, putting \n     money away for our retirement. Two years ago, we were, but \n     now we are making about $42,000 between us and struggling \n     through this Vermont winter.\n       I was an international IT manager, making a nice salary \n     then. I spent 14 years getting my AS, BS and then my Masters \n     degree from Champlain College.\n\n  Which is a college in Burlington, VT.\n\n       We were comfortable, and able to go on a nice vacation \n     every couple of years. Then the company I worked for for 18 \n     years outsourced its entire IT operation to India. I received \n     a layoff package, but at my age it took me a while to find a \n     job for one third of my previous salary, and that job is not \n     even in my field--I am an accounting technician now.\n       My husband was laid off from a job as an electrician's \n     assistant and he is now working in a hardware store. He makes \n     $3 less per hour now.\n       Both of our moms are near 80 and live with us. We also help \n     to take care of our next-door neighbor, who is 83. We are \n     struggling to keep up with our bills. Fortunately when we \n     refinanced our home several years ago, we took a fixed \n     rate mortgage. Even so, our heating, gas and even grocery \n     costs are rising so quickly and our salaries are not.\n       When I was younger, I found it easier to regroup from a \n     loss like this, but then everyone wanted to hire me when I \n     was younger. I thought the government was ``of the people, by \n     the people and for the people,'' but it seems to me that it's \n     mostly ``of the people, by the lobbyists and for the rich.'' \n     By the time we get to retirement, maybe when we're 70 at this \n     rate, Social Security and Medicare will be gone and we'll be \n     on our own. I feel as though our government has sold us out \n     and even if we elect a new President who cares for the \n     people, it will take too long to recover for us to reach a \n     comfortable place again.\n       Thank you for listening Senator Sanders.\n\n  This is a very brief e-mail that we received from a small town in \ncentral Vermont:\n\n       Between my retirement & SS [Social Security], I get a grand \n     total of $804 a month. My last oil delivery was over $600 for \n     the month of March.\n       That's my story--and I'm stuck with it.\n       Thank you, Senator, for trying to ``make it better.''\n\n  This is from the wife of a logger in northern Vermont. A lot of \npeople in the State of Vermont earn their money in the woods. They go \nout and they cut trees.\n\n       This is the toughest time I have seen since I was a child. \n     My husband is a self employed logger and has an excavation \n     business. The way the economy is has really hit in both of \n     his employment very hard. The price of logs have dropped \n     drastically and no one is building.\n       He has extremely high blood pressure but some how we can't \n     receive any help. We do have catamount blue health insurance \n     that we pay $250.00 a month for but that does not cover some \n     of his medicine nor does it cover all hospital bills. We have \n     exhausted any savings we had but still have a small IRA but \n     cannot touch that with out being penalized. We have had to \n     refinance our home of 34 years and I have just started a job \n     but it requires me to travel 35 miles one way to work and \n     with the price of gas it is almost a hopeless case.\n       I'm sure there are other people in worse shape than us, but \n     I have to wonder why the government is not helping the \n     working person? The only thing I guess a working person has \n     is pride.\n       Is it worth it?????? I'm really beginning to wonder!\n\n  This is from a 57-year-old working widow, again from the central \nVermont area. This is what she says:\n\n       I have no--\n\n  Underline ``no''--\n\n     disposable income. Like many Vermonters I drive a long way to \n     my job and consider myself lucky to have one and like most \n     jobs in Vermont it does not pay as well as the same job in \n     other areas of the country. My roundtrip mileage is 60 miles \n     per day. I invested in an America made hybrid in 2004 which \n     gets between 25 to 30 mpg [miles per gallon]. Also, the \n     organization I work for does not reimburse me at the federal \n     rate for the miles charged to them. I have to have more and \n     more money each week to pay for that week's gas and then wait \n     to be reimbursed. It really is a tough squeeze and some of my \n     co-workers are in tighter spots.\n       I was fortunate to have locked in fuel oil last Spring at \n     $2.46/gallon for 800 gallons. This is to supplement wood \n     burning. However, I fell on the ice in December and hurt my \n     shoulder which makes lifting wood difficult therefore I \n     turned the thermostat back to 60 and live that way. Now the \n     thermostat is back to 50 and the burner only comes on to heat \n     hot water. I stopped using hot water to wash my clothes over \n     a year ago and just use cold water. I don't notice a \n     difference.\n       I have not had a vacation except a long weekend in years. \n     At 57 and a widow and a woman, I can look forward to living \n     in poverty. I am thankful for the things I have and pray that \n     I can hold onto them. I have first hand experience that there \n     are many, many Vermonters that have much less and are falling \n     through the cracks. They do not have enough food to eat and \n     are ``too rich'' for fuel programs.\n       I have a friend who is legally blind and lives on less than \n     $800 per month. She lives in Senior housing so her rent is \n     subsidized but she still has to pay for utilities and food. \n     How does she buy food and clothing on this pathetic amount of \n     money?\n       How can we be the richest nation in the world and allow \n     this to happen?\n       I vote. I give to charities when I can albeit small amounts \n     but how can I move mountains? I pray for peace and justice \n     because I don't know what else to do and I am thankful for \n     what I have and for what I am able to do.\n       I appreciate your keeping important issues before the \n     public.\n\n  As I said, these are stories from Vermont. But we have received \nsimilar-type stories from all over America. Let me conclude with four \nstories from families in States other than Vermont.\n  This is from a young man in Tulsa, OK:\n\n       Thank you so much for allowing me to tell the story of how \n     our family is being squeezed by the current economic \n     conditions in our country. . . .\n       In December of 2000, I started work for my current company \n     at the ``bottom rung of the ladder.'' I was changing careers \n     yet again and the old saying ``you can't start at the top'' \n     certainly applied. I have since worked my way up from a \n     starting position, part time at $7.65 an hour, through 3 \n     promotions and into a management position in the mid $30k a \n     year salary range. That used to be an ok salary here in \n     Oklahoma. Not anymore.\n       The rising cost of fuel, food, utilities and other \n     necessities has turned my ``ok'' salary into a near poverty-\n     level experience for my family. In addition to the above \n     mentioned costs, I experienced a $102 per month increase in \n     my portion of the premium for my ``employer provided'' family \n     health coverage.\n       I don't get it. I work hard, every day. I show up on time \n     every day, give it everything I have and never back off and \n     somehow everything except my salary is going up at an \n     alarming rate. My parents taught me that no matter what, if \n     we worked hard enough and never gave up, we'd get somewhere. \n     It seems these days, that doesn't hold true anymore.\n       Please encourage your colleagues in D.C. to do something, \n     and hurry. I am doing all I can and it just isn't enough.\n\n  This one is from a young engineer in Gladstone, OR:\n\n       I am a 26-year-old college graduate with a master's degree \n     in mechanical engineering. I have been working for two years \n     as an engineer in the Portland, OR metropolitan area, and \n     though I consider my compensation for my job to be \n     appropriate for my level of education and expertise (about \n     $60,000 a year), I am still struggling to make ends meet in \n     this economy.\n       Despite the fact that my home mortgage payment has remained \n     stable, I am finding that the average price of energy and \n     commodities has increased such that I can no longer afford to \n     contribute to my 401(k) retirement plan, and I am living \n     month-to-\n\n[[Page S2782]]\n\n     month with only about $200 in savings. I pay about $300 for \n     gasoline, $200 for heat, $100 for electricity, and about $400 \n     for food every month. This is fully twice as much as I was \n     paying for the same expenses just 2 short years ago. Ouch!\n       My situation is ironic and a bit frustrating. Whereas I now \n     make over four times what I made as a graduate student, I \n     live with the same quality of life as I did in college. I \n     cannot afford vacations or extravagant purchases, and I am \n     burdened as so many people are these days with a persistent \n     worry about getting sick or injured and stuck with a medical \n     bill that I cannot afford.\n       I realize that I am nobody special in terms of how hard I \n     work or how much I pay for food and gas or how ``sad'' my \n     story is, and that is why I write to you. I am moved by the \n     stories of how these middle-class families are surviving, and \n     I can sympathize with them in terms of some of the financial \n     worry they are experiencing. It is hard for me, it must be \n     incredibly difficult for them.\n       Thank you for your time and thank you for your service as a \n     U.S. Senator, and thank you for providing a forum like this.\n\n  This is from a 30-year-old man from the Pacific Northwest who feels \nthe American dream has failed him. This is what he writes:\n\n       I was raised in extreme poverty. My mom had a 9th grade \n     education and my father dropped out in 6th grade. My brother, \n     3 years my senior, dropped out of high school in 1996, the \n     year I graduated. I never knew a house; we grew up in one and \n     two bedroom apartments. I also never knew I was raised in \n     poverty until adulthood--when I tried to transcend this state \n     of economic marginalization.\n       I was the first of my family to graduate high school. Four \n     years later I entered junior college; transferred to a \n     private four-year institution and earned both an \n     undergraduate and graduate degree. I also earned $70,000 in \n     student loan debt. At that point, I had never earned more \n     than $7,000 in my life.\n       Three years after college, I purchased my first home. You \n     guessed it--my loan was predatory and was one of those ARMs. \n     This was the first home ever purchased in the Ryan family. As \n     you know, to truly gain a firm stance in the middle class, \n     one must own property.\n       I earned $50,000 in 1997, more money than I've ever known. \n     Yet I still have to charge my groceries or medications. My \n     ARM matured and my mortgage raised $300 over night. The first \n     home in my family is likely to go back to the bank and I'm \n     falling short of the finish line in the race out of poverty.\n       I'm now in credit card debt just to buy the essentials and \n     my student loan debt haunts me most days of my life. I feel \n     disillusioned by the ``American dream and the American middle \n     class.'' If you graduate, if you go to college, if you . . . \n     then you will rise above the poverty line. Let me tell you, \n     Mr. Sanders, I feel more impoverished today than I ever have. \n     Why? Because when I was poor, I didn't have nearly $100,000 \n     of debt; essentially making me indentured to my country. That \n     isn't freedom.\n\n  Finally, an e-mail from a woman in California in a city near San \nFrancisco. This is the last letter:\n\n       Both my husband and I have faced significant pay cuts the \n     last year. We feel grateful to still have jobs, however. Many \n     of our friends our age have no jobs and have been out of work \n     for many months with no prospects in sight.\n       We have 3 children and live in the high-cost San Francisco \n     Bay Area, where we were born. A combined income of $100,000 \n     to $150,000 doesn't go very far at all here when a modest \n     townhouse costs almost $600,000 and everything else is \n     proportionately more expensive. (The difference in the cost \n     of living across the country is never taken into account by \n     politicians planning tax breaks and should be . . . )\n       Our oldest daughter completed 2 years in Ameri-Corps after \n     graduating from the University of Vermont where she got a \n     Bachelor's degree in environmental science and conservation \n     biology. Some of her student loans were forgiven by Ameri-\n     Corps, but not many. Now she works for an environmental \n     consulting firm in Boston but her wages are so low she can \n     barely support herself and we are still paying $350 per month \n     on her student loans that remain. We will owe $350 a month on \n     those loans for the next 30 years--she has close to $70,000 \n     left to pay off.\n       My husband is almost 61 and I am 52. We have nothing saved \n     for retirement. One small IRA we have will be cashed out this \n     year to pay for a new roof on our townhouse. We can barely \n     meet our mortgage payments, property taxes and pay our bills. \n     We live month to month.\n       Over the past year we have cut out many of the extras we \n     used to consider necessities. My husband felt extremely \n     guilty running up a charge card to buy much needed clothes \n     for himself for work. He had not bought clothes for himself \n     in about 5 years.\n       Our home is now worth less than the loans we have on it. \n     There is no money to replace our old rug, (or even have it \n     professionally shampooed), no money to fix our broken clothes \n     dryer, no money to repair our bathroom sink, no money to take \n     even a modest vacation for a few days. The list goes on and \n     on.\n       We no longer have what we once considered a middle-class \n     standard of living. Now we are nearing retirement years \n     realizing we will have to work (if we have jobs) until we \n     die. How could we ever exist on Social Security alone in this \n     area? It would be impossible since we will not have our home \n     even close to paid off.\n       I have never felt so despondent about the state of our life \n     and our family's prospects for the future. We have slid down \n     the economic ladder one rung at a time. I used to believe if \n     we worked hard enough we would be rewarded for our work--but \n     no longer believe that. We are working harder than ever and \n     now make far less money. I see no improvement in our \n     financial well-being in the future whatsoever.\n       I am beyond anger. I have no more tears. I only have two \n     questions that no one seems to be able to answer.\n\n  Mr. President, I think it is appropriate to end on this note, and \nthis is what she says:\n\n       I have only two questions that no one seems to be able to \n     answer. Is everyone in Washington so far removed from the \n     plight of our country's middle class that they cannot see \n     what we are going through? Or do they see and simply not \n     care?\n\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and bring up the DeMint amendment No. 4474.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, if I may, I will mention a few things \nabout the amendment. I am, obviously, disappointed that a germane \namendment cannot even be brought up in this debate. A part of this \nhousing package is a $4 billion title III section that we are referring \nto as community development block grants. Many people here support \nthose.\n  I wish to make clear to my colleagues this is not a normal block \ngrant. What it is--in the name of helping homeowners who have lost \ntheir homes, this $4 billion goes to selected areas of the country \nwhere there has been the highest concentration of foreclosures. What it \nactually does is use taxpayer dollars to buy homes from banks. The \nbanks have taken these homes from former homeowners. This money doesn't \nhelp the people who have lost their homes. It takes taxpayer money from \nall over the country and bales out the banks that now hold this. What \nwe are going to end up with is this money that goes through States down \nto local communities, through the block grant process, to local \ncommunities themselves or through an intermediary who is actually \nbuying private property now owned by the banks, and we are spending \nmoney to fix those homes up and then to sell them, the local \ncommunities--we are helping to make them property owners.\n  The bill, as written, does not prevent them from keeping the property \nas rental property. This will not only spend $4 billion, it will not \nnecessarily do it in an equitable way around the country. It doesn't \nhelp homeowners who have lost their homes. In fact, it may hurt the \nhomeowners who don't get the benefit of Government money to fix up \ntheir homes. They don't get bailed out if they cannot make their \npayments. What we are faced with is the Government fixing up a home. We \nare giving someone a tax credit to buy that home but not the one for \nsale next to it.\n  We know this process of how block grants work, and these have been \ndeemed one of the least-effective programs by the General Accounting \nOffice and other Government agencies that looked at this. We are going \nto funnel money from here to the States, to the local communities, to \nthe banks, and the transactional costs to move these homes and to fix \nthem up is going to probably be more than any value from it. We put \nresponsible homeowners at a disadvantage in this package.\n  I encourage my colleagues to look at this whole bill. First of all, \nlook at the process. If we cannot have a germane amendment \npostcloture--which was promised when this bill was brought\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\nup--and we cannot strike a large provision such as this, which is \nclearly not in the interest of those who are hurting; it is obviously \nbailing out banks who have made bad loans, what this will ultimately do \nis encourage banks to foreclose on homes they might not have because \nthey know they are going to get the Government to buy that home if they \ntake it from the homeowner.\n  The perverse incentives built into this plan need to be thought \nthrough. There is no way this will work to help those who have been \nhurt. It is throwing the money into the wrong places and making \nhomeowners out of local communities in an inequitable way in this \ncountry.\n  It is unfortunate we are not allowed to up bring this amendment and \nvote on it in a fair and open process. Nevertheless, I appreciate the \nopportunity to speak, and I appreciate the chairman's indulgence today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague from South \nCarolina, I appreciate his generous comments. We have reached a point \nwhere, obviously, we are trying to complete this product. We have been \nat this for over a week. There are a lot of good ideas, while I \ndisagree with his conclusion on his own amendment. What we are trying \nto do, at the behest of the leadership, is accomplish as much as we \ncan, where we can, and move forward. I have said this so many times, \nbut if I were writing this on my own, it would look different. We live \nand work in an institution where we have to deal with 99 colleagues, \nand 435 in the other body, and an administration down the road. We are \ntrying to package these ideas in a way that would win a majority of \nsupport here and will be accommodated in the other body and to receive \nthe ultimate approval of the White House. It is an arduous journey and \ncomplicated and an emotionally charged set of issues. It is no easy \npath. While I, for one, have a number of ideas that have been offered \nby people I support--in fact, my own idea was rejected. As a principal \nnegotiator, I wasn't able to convince my colleagues on the other side \nto take an idea that I might point out the Wall Street Journal this \nmorning said the administration is moving closer and closer to. It is a \nvery valid point that the Senator raised, and I agree a lot of what we \nare talking about is dealing with the effects of foreclosure. Whether \nyou like the idea, we are dealing with after the fact. I would prefer \nto deal with an effort--and there are some provisions that deal with \nthis--to keep people out of foreclosure.\n  But with a major thrust we ought to be talking about--and the \nadministration, through the FHA Secure program, which they are opening, \nwill do a large part of that--we are heading in the right direction.\n  On the CDBG, there are legitimate criticisms about that money. This \nprogram is very differently designed. We keep it far more targeted, \nwith more accountability required. One of the values is the following. \nWe are oversupplied in housing. The marketplace is not doing as well in \nresolving this issue because supply and demand is not working as it \nnormally does because of the abundance of housing out there and the \nunavailability of capital to move a lot of it.\n  Our concern was, of course, not only to clean up the properties but \nto clean up the properties and move them because you get a declining \nvalue in neighborhoods with foreclosed properties. So that hard working \nneighbor my friend talked about who is sitting there going, wait a \nminute, I have done everything right here and I read all the documents \nand I made a responsible loan and here you are taking care of the \nproperty next door and someone is getting a break with the Government's \nhelp and I am not getting much out of it. Why are my tax dollars being \nused for that purpose?\n  My answer to his constituents, and to mine, is I understand what you \nare saying, but I am concerned because if the value of your property, \nwhich you have maintained and done everything right with, is declining \nby 1 percent immediately when the next-door neighbor's property or one \ndown the block is foreclosed on, to allow that to deteriorate affects \nyou directly. We know crime rates go up 2 percent and values, by as \nmuch as $2,000 to $5,000, go down that day on that property, and it \nwill continue to decline as that neighborhood further deteriorates. So \nthere is a direct correlation between trying to help the property get \nback on its feet, to make it marketable and able to be sold because the \nneighborhood will be adversely affected if we don't do that.\n  The community block grant program of $4 billion in this bill is \ntargeted. It is right that it is after the fact. We ought to, ideally, \nfigure out a way to keep a person out of foreclosure in the first \nplace. In this bill, we don't do a lot about that. We do it with \nmortgage revenue bond proposals and with the counseling in the bill \nthat does help.\n  Clearly, as the Presiding Officer and I heard at a hearing in his \nState in Philadelphia--we heard from people directly how counseling can \nmake a difference. So there are some provisions which do minimize \nforeclosure.\n\n  In the absence of doing more, we need to ask ourselves: Can we do \nsomething when these properties do fall into that situation? That is \nwhy this Community Development Block Grant Program has value beyond \nputting tax money into a community, but making a difference possibly \nfor those other homeowners who otherwise have watched everything they \nsaved and worked for--their single source of wealth creation is in that \nhouse, and that equity they built up by being responsible over the \nyears to protect themselves in retirement or to assist their child get \na college education, to take care of that unforeseen problem that can \nhappen with a health care crisis, that equity can make all the \ndifference in the world--and through no fault of their own, they \nwatched almost instantaneously that hard-earned equity decline rapidly \nbecause of what happened here.\n  Part of the goal here--and I cannot admit it is going to work in \nevery case--is to make sure that homeowner is getting some protection. \nThey ought to get something back for their tax dollars, and this is an \nindirect way to help them get back on their feet.\n  My colleague raised a legitimate point. If it is a great idea, why \ncan't we vote on it? We have reached a point where we want to move on \nand complete the legislation. There are a lot of ideas we want to bring \nup. The general thought was to see if we couldn't complete this work \nand move on to a conclusion. I appreciate my colleague's comments. I \nthank him for his indulgence and consideration as well.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment NO. 4400\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set \naside and call up amendment No. 4400.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. I object.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the chairman. I understand they desire no further \nvotes on this amendment.\n  I ask to speak on the subject matter of my amendment, knowing that it \nwill not get a vote--which is disturbing on such an issue as the one we \nhave in front of us.\n  We are talking about housing. For years we have spent a tremendous \namount of money on homelessness in this country. What this amendment \nwould do, frankly, is help us know what to do on homelessness. It would \ncause us to take an in-depth look at our current state of homelessness \nin hopes of providing constructive solutions to that problem.\n  We have spent billions of dollars every year for Federal housing \nprograms, but homelessness rates have remained constant for decades. In \nother words, it doesn't matter how much money we have spent, we have \nnot seen a decline in homelessness. We ought to be about asking the \nquestion: What is wrong? We continue to spend more money. Yet we make \nno impact on the rate of homelessness.\n  A number of reviews have found Federal housing programs are \nineffective and misspend too much money on nonhousing assistance, are \nnot sufficiently\n\n[[Page S2784]]\n\nallocated or distributed, and are subject to tens of millions of \ndollars of waste and fraud. The waste and fraud actually has been \ndocumented. HUD's ability to effectively carry out its mission is so \nimpaired that these shortcomings should be addressed if we ever hope to \neliminate homelessness in our country.\n  In the past year alone the inspector general of the department found \nnearly $1 billion--let me restate that--one thousand million dollars in \nwaste in HUD alone. That is their own inspector general. There is \nnothing in this bill that addresses this issue.\n  This amendment was designed for us to look at that. HUD also reported \n$1.5 billion, of which over 80 percent were overpayments in terms of \nimproper payments.\n  The charge on the Congress is to manage the programs effectively. We \nhave a bill before us, and we have an amendment that will help us do \nthat. To me, it is disconcerting in the fact that we are not going to \neven take up and look at $2.25 billion worth of waste every year.\n  I have sympathies with the chairman and his ranking member in that \nthey do not want other amendment votes. But this is an amendment we are \ngoing to see again. We are going to see it on an appropriations bill \nthe next time we have one with anything to do with housing.\n  Here are the following criminal activities found at the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development: 2,684 arrests with the fraud, 1,338 \nindictments, and 1,055 convictions.\n  We are going to pass a housing bill, and we are not going to address \nthese issues? We are not even going to vote on them, even though we \nhave 1,055 convictions and 1,338 indictments on fraud and overpayment \nand corruption within the Department of Housing and Urban Development?\n  In efforts to remedy the housing problems, Congress has allocated $4 \nbillion to HUD's community development block grants. One of the \nvehicles HUD uses to combat homelessness is this CDBG program. An OMB \nanalysis determined that the CDBG grants were ineffective in \naccomplishing what they intended to accomplish.\n  The conclusion stated that major problems, including the lack of a \nclear purpose and an annual and long-term outcome measure--in other \nwords, there is no metric to see if the money we are spending is doing \nany good. There is no requirement on us, either through this bill or \nany other bill, that there be a measurement to say we will spend money \nto help homelessness but look to see if that is effective. None of that \nis available. It is not available. Also, it was noted they did not \ntarget funds to the areas of greatest need. They went to the areas of \ngreatest political influence, not the areas of greatest homelessness. \nAnd the inability to produce transparent information.\n  The whole idea behind this amendment would help HUD and Congress \naddress those very issues. It also will help us know what to do about \nit, if we actually find them.\n  The average age of the world's democracies is 200 years. That is the \naverage. They are not conquered. They die from within. They die over \nlose fiscal policy. Those are not my words. That is a paraphrase of the \nScottish historian as he looked at the Athenian Empire and wrote about \nit about the time our country was being founded. I daresay I have great \nconcerns for us as a free country when we will allow $2.25 billion a \nyear to be defrauded out of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and then we will not allow an amendment that doesn't \nchange it. It just says let's look at it and find out where it is and \nwhat we can do about it. We are not going to allow it on a housing \nbill.\n  It is interesting where we have come. We say we want to help the \npeople who are in the midst of a housing emergency, in the midst of \nproblems with their mortgages, in the midst of those who were either \nbeing gamed into a mortgage or stupidly going into a mortgage they \ncouldn't afford, but at the same time we will not do the real work we \nare asked to do, which is to make sure the programs we do have, that \nare already authorized, already funded, are run efficiently. It is no \nwonder confidence in us is lacking.\n  Here is $2.25 billion that we could address in this bill toward a \nsolution--toward finding out how we at least eliminate 70 or 80 percent \nof that, and we will not even allow an amendment to address that.\n  That is not a reflection on the chairman. I understand what he and \nthe ranking member are trying to do to get this bill through. But this \nis not an amendment to which anybody should have any opposition. This \nis an amendment that should be accepted; to say, yes, we need to study \nthis. We need to find it. Yet when we have asked for that it has been \ndenied.\n  My only thought is, either we do not want to look at the fraud and we \ndo not want to look at the overpayments or we think it is just fine.\n  That is what I am left with and that is what the American people are \nleft with. Mr. President, $2.25 billion would do a lot to help a lot of \npeople having trouble with their mortgages today. That $2.25 billion \ncould come back in and, if directed in the proper way, could \nsignificantly increase the effort of holding onto the homes of 100,000 \npeople. Yet we are not going to look at it.\n  There is no question we need to do more. Unfortunately, I am not \ngoing to be able to vote for this bill because we are going to give tax \ncredit to builders who don't need to have a tax credit. We are going to \ngive $4.5 billion more in CDBG block grant money that HUD already said \nhasn't been spent wisely to begin with. We already have $1 billion \nworth of fraud in it. I will not support the bill.\n  I do support the right of the chairman in managing the bill in the \nway he is managing it at the present time, but I also will say this \namendment will be back--as it should--not just for us, and not, as it \nshould, just for the taxpayers but the real taxpayers who are going to \npay back this $2.25 billion, which is our kids.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Vermont wants to be \nheard, but let me just say a few things to my friend from Oklahoma.\n  First of all, I appreciate his comments about the importance of \nmonitoring and overseeing the programs, the homeless programs in the \nMcKinney-Vento legislation that goes back some time.\n  He may not be aware of this, but I will raise it with him anyway.\n  Senator Allard of Colorado and Senator Reed of Rhode Island have \noffered a piece of legislation to modernize and streamline the \nMcKinney-Vento legislation. It passed out of the Banking Committee some \nmonths ago unanimously. I commend Senator Allard and Senator Reed for \nworking together in a bipartisan fashion to come forward with the \nproposals dealing with homelessness.\n  The bill--and it can be corrected--we brought up here to bring it up \non the consent calendar with anyone who wanted to offer some amendments \nto it. It sounds as if my colleague from Oklahoma has an amendment that \nwould be right on the subject matter of the Reed-Allard proposal. There \nhas been a hold on the legislation to come forward with that bill, \noffered by our two colleagues from Colorado and Rhode Island, that \nspecifically addresses the issues, although I am not suggesting exactly \nthe amendment my colleague from Oklahoma has, but it would seem to me \nthat would be an appropriate place to deal with homeless programs.\n  We may have exact numbers--I tried to inquire here whether it is 1.8 \nor 2.1. It is a lot of money, obviously, and I do not question that at \nall. But we do have a bill that is enjoying pretty board-based support \nhere. Rarely, I might add, do we see that--it comes out of a committee \nof jurisdiction that authored and wrote this legislation, unanimously \nadopted by every Banking Committee member who had an opportunity to go \nthrough the hearings and watch all of it.\n  I am more than prepared--I do not want to speak for Senators Allard \nand Reed--that bill could be done this evening, and possibly the \namendment suggested by my friend from Oklahoma could be a part of that \nto go forward. He understands the situation Senator Shelby and I are \nin, in trying to get this particular bill done. If that hold could come \noff the legislation and someone sit down and try to work on\n\n[[Page S2785]]\n\nthis provision, we might very well accommodate the very issue that goes \nto the heart of the homeless programs.\n  So I raise that with him. It is S. 1518. It did come out I think \nseveral months ago.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first of all, I am the individual who has \na hold on that bill because I think we need to have real property \nreform, and there is a bill that is coming out of the Homeland Security \nCommittee that is a bipartisan bill authored by Senator Carper, with \nthe cosponsorship of both Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman, that \nhas real property reform.\n  As the Senator knows, McKinney-Vento places a limitation on all \nFederal properties before they can ever be disposed of. So the real \nproperty reform needs to go through at the same time the McKinney-Vento \nbill goes through so that we reform both of those, so that we still \nprotect the rights of the homeless in this country but at the same time \nenable the agencies of the Federal Government to dispose of them. We \nnow have 22,000 pieces of property the Federal Government does not want \nbut we can't get rid of. So the reason that is being held up is we are \ntrying to get those to move together and in tandem so that we can fix \nboth problems at the same time.\n  I would say this in response to the Senator. I understand how you \nhave locked arms to move this bill, but what the American people are \nnot going to understand is, if there is $2 billion worth of waste--and \nthere is; the IG of HUD said it, there is no question about it, a \nbillion dollars worth of fraud, a thousand convictions, another $1.2 \nbillion in overpayments to supposed landlords. There is no reason not \nto fix that right now. It can be fixed with this bill. This bill is \ngoing to get passed, it is going to get signed. Move it and fix it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Reclaiming my right on the floor, there is a vehicle moving \nincluding, possibly, the legislation that is coming from Senator Carper \nhere. It seems to me that making a case for exactly why probably \nallowing that bill to come up, the very bill that Senator Allard and \nSenator Reed have drafted on homelessness that was unanimously adopted \nby the committee after significant work would be the right place--if \npeople have ideas and suggestions on how to deal with Federal property \nor deal with allegations of fraud and the like, that is the vehicle.\n  As my colleague from Oklahoma points out, he is the only member with \na hold on that bill, so we are not going to be able to get to it, and \nthe suggestion somehow that we are denying him an opportunity is really \nnot the case. I am more than willing to entertain ideas and thoughts, \nand I do not want to speak for Senator Allard and Senator Reed--they \nare the authors of the legislation--but I am confident they would be \nmore than willing to sit down and listen to the arguments and possibly \ninclude ideas in the legislation.\n  Ninety-nine Members of this body have decided that this bill is a \npretty good bill, and one Member has not. I respect that. You have the \nright to do that here. But I think the right to do that should also \nsuggest that when you stand up and suggest we are not welcoming enough \nof an idea here in this bill, we might properly put our attention at \nthe focus where it deserves to be, and that is on bipartisan \nlegislation specifically dealing with the issue of homelessness, which \nincludes various other ideas, and we can get that done.\n  So I apologize to my colleague from Vermont, but I wanted to address \nthat situation and the work of the committee, on which the Presiding \nOfficer is a member, dealing with these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wanted to say a few words in support of \nthe Clean Energy Tax Stimulus Act, an amendment to the housing bill \noffered by Senators Cantwell and Ensign. Before I begin, let me thank \nSenator Cantwell for her determined efforts to ensure that we don't \nstand by while our renewable energy industry and energy efficiency \nindustry lose jobs due to expiring tax policy.\n  In these times of economic uncertainty, while we work to create new \njobs in the green economy of the future, we must also make sure we do \nnot lose existing jobs in the small green economy we already have, and \nSenator Cantwell, along with many of my colleagues, has made that a \npriority. I thank her for that.\n  The clean energy tax stimulus amendment which the Senate is expected \nto vote on later today and which is based on a stand-alone bill \nintroduced last week, which I am strongly cosponsoring, extends \nfinancial incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency that \nwould otherwise expire this year, and that is something we must make \nabsolutely sure does not happen.\n  More specifically, the amendment would extend for 1 year the current \nproduction tax credit--commonly called the PTC--which supports the \ngeneration of electricity from renewable energy such as wind, biomass, \nand geothermal. Additionally, the amendment would extend for 8 years \nthe business investment tax credit which provides financial help for \nlarger scale fuel cell and solar investments and the residential \ninvestment tax credit that helps homeowners by giving them the tax \ncredit for up to 30 percent of the cost of a solar PV unit and up to \n$2,000 for the installation of solar hot water heaters.\n  Finally, in terms of energy efficiency, the amendment we will vote on \ntoday would extend for 1 year the current credits for energy efficiency \nimprovements for heating and cooling systems, windows, and other \nqualified residential property, and it also extends the tax credit for \nbuilding homes that are energy efficient. In addition, the amendment \nextends tax credits for the purchase of energy-efficient appliances.\n  As you know, wind energy is the fastest growing source of energy \nthroughout to entire world. Unfortunately, in our country today, the \nwind industry is seeing a dropoff in investment which will quickly lead \nto the loss of thousands of jobs. This is totally absurd. The American \npeople want to move to sustainable energy. They want to move to wind \nenergy.\n  There are businesses out there prepared to build and install wind \nturbines. Yet we are not providing them the help they need to help us \ndeal with global warming and also to create many good-paying jobs. \nEvery month that passes without a production tax credit extension \ndiminishes the industry's capacity to create jobs, spur economic \ngrowth, and produce electricity that helps us reduce global warming. In \nfact, the American Wind Energy Association projects that the rate of \ngrowth in American wind power will decrease by more than 70 percent \nbetween this year and next in the absence of an extension of the \nproduction tax credit. This is totally absurd. All over the world, \ncountries are growing good jobs in terms of wind, and we are on the \nverge of losing jobs despite the fact that the American people want to \nmove us toward sustainable energy. What we are doing contrasts sharply \nwith the current trend of dramatic wind power growth that could \notherwise be expected to continue. People want sustainable energy, \npeople want wind power, and here we are sitting back, not providing the \nhelp the people in the wind industry desperately need.\n  If we do not extend the PTC, we will waste a tremendous opportunity \nto preserve existing jobs, create many thousands of new good-paying \njobs this year alone, and build, in addition, another 5,000 megawatts \nof new wind energy, which will spur another $10 billion in economic \nactivity.\n  Let me say a few words about the solar tax credit. The investment tax \ncredit is responsible for an estimated 6,000 high-quality jobs that \nwere created in the solar sector in 2007 alone, and another 9,000 to \n12,000 are expected in 2008 if Congress sends the signal that this tax \ncredit is here to stay. That is, of course, exactly what we must be \ndoing.\n  Without an extension of the ITC, some have estimated that we would \nlose over $8 billion in investments that would have been made, leading \nto a net loss of almost 40,000 jobs in the solar photovoltaic sector \nalone in 2009.\n  The ITC has real implications also for utility-scale solar projects. \nI have talked to people in the solar thermal plant business, talked to \nsome of the major utility companies. We have a potential in this \ncountry to produce an enormous amount of clean, relatively inexpensive \nelectricity through solar thermal plants which are now beginning to \nmove in the Mojave Desert, in\n\n[[Page S2786]]\n\nNevada, in New Mexico, and Arizona. It turns out that based on the \ngeography of the Southeast, there is enormous potential for dozens of \nsolar thermal units that could produce a significant amount of \nelectricity that our country needs. That electricity could be produced \nat a reasonable cost, in an effective way, emitting virtually no \ngreenhouse gas emissions. It is sitting there waiting to happen, and \nour job has to be to help those people in the utilities that want to \nmove forward. Without an extension of the ITC, these types of projects \nwill be in jeopardy or, in fact, face a significant delay.\n\n  Additionally, we are seeing a new solar powerplant located 70 miles \nsouthwest of Phoenix, AZ, and scheduled to go into operation by 2011 \nwhich would not go on line without the benefits of the ITC. The 280-\nmegawatt facility is expected to generate revenue of over $4 billion, \nbringing over $1 billion in economic benefits to the State of Arizona \nand enough electricity to power 70,000 homes. The solar thermal unit \nbeing planned by Pacific Gas and Electric would provide electricity of \n553 megawatts for over 400,000 homes.\n  All of this is sitting there waiting to happen, and all over the \nworld people are wondering, What is the U.S. Congress doing to \nstimulate this type of activity? Today is our day.\n  Let's take a quick look at the importance of extending the PTC and \nthe ITC, but let's not forget that extending these credits has a ripple \neffect on other sectors of the economy. For example, the American \nCouncil on Renewable Energy estimates that for every job created in \nrenewable manufacturing, there are an additional three high-quality \njobs created to design, install, operate, and maintain the renewable \nenergy infrastructure.\n  So I think it is pretty clear that we must act today to, at the very \nleast, extend some of the current renewable energy and energy-\nefficiency tax credits. I myself hope we are going to go a lot further \nthan this, but what we have to do is an absolute necessity.\n  Let me conclude once again by thanking Senator Cantwell for her \nleadership on this issue. This is enormously important. The rest of the \nworld is moving in order to deal with global warming, in order to \ncreate good-paying jobs. We have to pass this legislation today, and we \nhave to go beyond that in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage our colleagues \nto support the passage, hopefully later today, of the Foreclosure \nPrevention Act of 2008, the legislation that has been on the Senate \nfloor for the better part of a week now.\n  I like to think of this legislation not in isolation but as the third \npiece, if you will, of a series of steps that have been taken to try to \nstabilize our economy, to restore confidence in our economy, and to \ninfuse liquidity into our financial system.\n  The first was really a series of steps taken by the Federal Reserve. \nThe Federal Reserve has acted in an extraordinary way, not just in \nmonetary policy and trying to lower the Fed funds rate but also in \nencouraging Federal banks to act and now investment banks to take \nadvantage of the discount money, to borrow money when they need it, for \nthe Federal Reserve to be willing to take and swap, if you will, highly \nliquid Treasury securities for very illiquid mortgage-backed securities \nthat a lot of our banks are holding in their portfolios, allowing those \nswaps to take place to infuse liquidity into the banking system to \nencourage banks to begin lending money again.\n  The Federal Reserve is involved, as we all know, with JPMorgan Chase \nto engineer their takeover of Bear Stearns to prevent it from going \ninto bankruptcy and probably creating a domino effect that would have \nbrought down other financial entities and maybe made a bad situation \neven worse.\n  Those are some of the things the Federal Reserve has done. The \nPresiding Officer is different, he is not as old as me, but I have \nnever seen the Federal Reserve take these kinds of steps as we enter \ninto a period with this kind of uncertainty. But that is the first \nseries of things that has been done, needed to be done, and is being \ndone by the Federal Reserve. I applaud their action.\n  The second piece is the stimulus package we voted on and debated here \na month or two ago and passed. Sometimes when stimulus packages are \nagreed to by Congress and the President, it takes so long to debate the \npackage that by the time the effect actually takes place, we are coming \nout of the recession and it can have the overstimulative effect \nproviding inflationary pressures. In this case, I think what has \nhappened is the Congress and the President agreed in a timely way on \nour stimulus package, and it will have a modest effect on our economy, \nprobably in the second half of this year. Some have said it will raise \ngross domestic product by as much as 1.5 percent by the second half of \nthe year. I think the most important thing that came out of the \nadoption of the stimulus package was to send a clear signal to people, \ntaxpayers and others, businesses, that around here, when the chips are \ndown, Democrats and Republicans, Congress and the President can still \nagree on a series of actions to help boost the economy, to give the \neconomy a little bit of a jump start.\n  The third piece in this process is the legislation before us this \nweek and last. I call it a housing recovery package. There are a number \nof elements to it that are meritorious. I wouldn't oversell this \npackage. This by itself is not going to save the day and prevent all \nforeclosures and bring the housing market back overnight or within a \ncouple of weeks or months. But it is a third of a series of steps that \nwill be helpful. It is going to be followed within the next maybe 2 \nmonths with a handful of other steps that I will talk about in a few \nminutes. Let me talk about some of the elements I think are most \nbeneficial in this housing recovery package that is before us today. \nThe centerpiece is FHA modernization.\n  The Federal Housing Administration was created about 75 years ago. It \nwas born during the Great Depression. Out of the FHA came the \npossibility for home ownership for a lot of people who otherwise would \nnever have become home buyers. People wonder, where did we get the 30-\nyear fixed rate mortgages. They were a creation of FHA, a legacy of \nFHA. As recently as 6, 7, 8 years ago, probably 15 to 20 percent of \nmortgages were guaranteed or insured by the FHA, 15 to 20 percent. Last \nyear the number was about 5 percent. We dropped, in roughly half a \ndozen years, from 15 to 20 percent of home mortgages insured by FHA to \nlast year about 5 percent.\n  Where did those mortgages go? Where did people go for financial help \nto buy a home? A lot of them went to places they should not have gone. \nA lot of them ended up being induced or seduced and convinced to use a \ndifferent kind of a financing. They used exotic adjustable rate \nmortgages, some of them with no money down, no principal payments for \nan extended period of time. Some of these exotic adjustable rate \nmortgages called for very low interest, seductive teaser rates which \nmay have been 2, 3, 4 percent at the beginning and would later go up by \nreset within a couple of years to be 7, 8, or 9 percent. A lot of folks \nended up signing on to this deal and didn't realize there is a penalty \nfor trying to refinance out of an adjustable rate mortgage, making it \nvery difficult. I suppose the borrower and maybe the mortgage broker or \nthe lending institution that was involved, everybody expected housing \nprices to continue to go up; they had for years. As long as housing \nprices continue to rise, everybody comes out of the hole. If somebody \nis unable to make payments, they sell the house, do it for profit and \npay off their mortgage. Not many people thought about what happens if \nprices, instead of going up, all of a sudden come down. They have come \ndown, and in some places they have come down a lot.\n  Part of our legislation is designed to encourage people to take a \nsecond look at FHA. For folks, especially first-time home buyers or \npeople who have less than perfect credit, the FHA in the past has been \ntheir avenue to become homeowners. We wanted to make sure it is an \noption that is there for the 21st century.\n  Without getting into a whole lot of detail, let me say, of all the \npieces that are part of this bill, the most important one is FHA \nmodernization. I will mention a couple of those elements that I think \nare helpful. One of those takes the FHA loan limit starting at\n\n[[Page S2787]]\n\nthe end of this year to $550,000. Instead of being $420,000, it takes \nit up to $550,000. In Delaware, you can get a perfectly good house for \n$420,000. In some places in New Jersey one can get a perfectly good \nhouse for $420,000. In some places in New Jersey you probably can't. A \nlot of places in California, Florida, Connecticut, home values are such \nthat for $420,000, which is the FHA loan limit that will be in effect \nnext January 1, you can buy a cottage, but if you want to think about \nbuying a three-bedroom house with a garage and a bathroom, you can \nforget about buying anything close to that for $420,000. What we want \nto do is address the needs in high-cost housing areas so that FHA will \nstill be relevant in those States, as well as in States that have more \nmodest housing costs.\n\n  The second element of this bill that is good is that the bill seeks \nto streamline the bureaucracy of FHA. We hear a good deal about that \nfrom banks and from realtors, that the bureaucracy is inappropriate for \nthe 21st century. We have streamlined it. We do that in the context of \nthis legislation.\n  Another element that I believe is helpful is, we are going to make \nmore available counseling assistance to people who need it as they are \nlooking for a place to buy and to consider their options. There is a \nnew pilot credit scoring program that will be created. It is designed \nto increase access to credit for borrowers who may have a history of \nmaking required payments on time but haven't established a sufficient \ncredit rating to enable them to be considered as serious home buyers.\n  Those are some of the pieces of the FHA modernization portion of this \nbill. It is maybe the most important thing we are going to do.\n  A second important element of this bill deals with community \ndevelopment block grants. We appropriated this year around the country, \nI want to say, roughly $4 billion to communities, State and local \ngovernments, moneys they can use to help develop their communities. We \nwant to make sure that some additional moneys--in this case, another \nroughly $4 billion--might be made available to State and local \ngovernments to help communities that have been hit hard by foreclosures \nand delinquencies. The money could be put to use in many communities \naround the country.\n  A third element of this bill that I believe has merit deals with \nhousing authorities. Housing authorities currently are able to issue \ntax-exempt revenue bonds. The proceeds of those tax-exempt revenue \nbonds are used in probably every State in the country to allow people \nto become first-time home buyers and to realize a low interest rate. \nThey do this with moneys raised by tax-exempt revenue bonds. The \nproceeds of these same bonds can be used by housing authorities to \nbuild multifamily, affordable housing as well. The proceeds of these \nbonds cannot be used, though, to assist in refinancing of subprime \nloans. With this legislation, we say you can do that, too. State and \nlocal housing authorities can use the proceeds of these tax-exempt \nrevenue bonds. In fact, we allow them to issue another $10 billion \nworth and a permissible use is to help folks to refinance out of these \nsubprime loans that they have gotten themselves into.\n  Another element of this bill is actually one offered by our colleague \nSenator Isakson from Georgia. He has been good enough to let me advise \nsome changes in his earlier proposal. Let's use the situation here. We \nhave 100 desks here, and we will assume for this example that these are \nnot desks but homes in a community. Maybe there are two or three of \nthese homes where the families have run into trouble and cannot keep up \nwith the mortgage payments. The homes have gone into foreclosure and \nthey are decaying, the grass is growing, the shrubbery is not cut, \ntrash not removed. Those homes are destroyed and beginning to decay, \nand they bring down the value of the other homes in the community. \nSenator Isakson suggested that we allow a tax credit to be used for \nsomeone who will come in and buy a home in foreclosure and live there. \nHe proposed that that person be provided by the U.S. Treasury a $5,000 \ntax credit. To buy a foreclosed home and to agree to live there, $5,000 \nfor year 1, $5,000 for year 2, $5,000 for year 3, is a pretty expensive \nproposition. That would certainly get people's attention and encourage \nthem to buy homes in foreclosure, but it is a serious hit on the \nTreasury.\n  I urged him--I am sure others did as well--to make the proposal a \nlittle more modest. What he has done, I think prudently, is to say, in \nthe same situation, a home in foreclosure, to encourage people to come \nin and buy homes in foreclosure so they don't bring down the values of \nother properties, that they will get a tax credit but year 1 is $3,500 \nand year 2 is another $3,500; $7,000 in all as a tax credit from the \nTreasury to the person making that purchase. It is more modest. There \nis an impact on the Treasury, but it is not nearly as great as would \notherwise have been the case. It is a good proposal.\n  Another idea in this legislation that makes a lot of sense deals with \npeople who are in some distress--maybe they have lost their job, they \nhave sickness in the family, they are finding it difficult to pay their \nbills, they are getting behind on their mortgage payments. They are not \nsure what to do, and sometimes they end up turning to people who take \nadvantage of them, shysters who take advantage of them. And rather than \nhelping them with their problems, to work their way through it, they \ntake advantage of the distressed homeowner.\n  There are nonprofit entities. They work under a broad umbrella of \nsomething called the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. The \nshorthand title is NeighborWorks. And the idea there is to have these \nnonprofits provide counseling assistance. They are not trying to take \nadvantage of home homeowners in distress. They want to help them find \nthe best option for themselves and their family. We provided, I think \nthrough HUD's budget, about $200 million initially. That money has been \nused. Under this legislation we provide about another $100 million, \nmaybe more. I think an amendment by Senator Murray would take that up a \nbit higher. The idea is to make sure that when people are in trouble \nand they turn to someone for help, they will turn to someone who is \nreally going to help them. This is a good proposal as well.\n  Senator Reed of Rhode Island has offered an amendment that has been \nmade part of the package that seeks to address complex paper \ndisclosure. When you buy a house, you have all these papers. You sit \ndown with a realtor. It is pretty confusing stuff, even for people who \nare pretty smart. Senator Reed has come up with some suggestions that \nwould protect a person who is going through the forms, trying to \nunderstand what they are signing on to. Without going into a lot of \ndetail, his ideas have a great deal of merit and are part of the \npackage and ought to be.\n  As to another element of the package--I say this as a veteran who \nserved in the Navy during the Vietnam war and came back; they had to \nprotect us--to protect others who have served in our Armed Forces \nsince, we have something called the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act.\n  The idea is to try to make sure our soldiers and sailors--\nparticularly when they are deployed overseas--and their families are \nnot taken advantage of. We have given them, if you will, a break in \nmaking sure they are not taken advantage of by those who are, for \nexample, lenders who loaned money to them.\n  Right now, the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act--say I am deployed to \nIraq or Afghanistan. I come back from my year or 15-month deployment. \nMy home cannot have been foreclosed on. My family and I live in the \nhome, and we had a hard time making our mortgage payment. Maybe I gave \nup my regular civilian job and took a much lower paying job, was called \nup for Active Duty in the military, and I have been unable to keep up \nwith my mortgage payments.\n  Under the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act, my home could not be \nforeclosed on for at least 3 months while I am away and for 3 months \nfrom when I come back from that deployment. This legislation would \nextend that by an additional 6 months. I would be protected for 9 \nmonths, my family would be protected for 9 months, after my return to, \nhopefully, get back on our feet to be able to meet our financial \nobligations.\n\n[[Page S2788]]\n\n  Also, this provision provides returning soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines with 1 year of relief from increases in mortgage interest \nrates. Where these adjustable rate mortgages are resetting, the \nmilitary personnel get an extra year.\n  The final part of this provision is that the Department of Defense is \nrequired to establish a counseling program to ensure veterans and \nactive servicemembers can access assistance if they have seen financial \ndifficulties. Again, the idea is for folks who are in distress--in this \ncase, military personnel--who are homeowners, that they could actually \nget access to advice from people who have the best interests of the \nveterans at heart.\n  Those are some of the provisions, not all of the provisions. There \nare other provisions dealing with standard property deductions and to \nallow folks who do not itemize to take a standard deduction--$500 for \nsingle filers, $1,000 for joint filers. It is in this legislation.\n  There is an extension of net operating loss carry-back that will help \nsome of the homebuilders who are in trouble. There were concerns \nraised. I think Senator Gregg raised the concern yesterday--and there \nare other concerns about it as well--that the cost to the Treasury is \nconsiderable. The cost over 10 years, I am told, is about $6 billion, \nso it is not inconsequential. But we also know among the companies that \nare undergoing real distress right now are those that build homes. This \nis designed to try to extend some relief to them.\n  Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho and I have offered an amendment which has \nbeen accepted by both Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby on behalf of the \nmajority and minority sides that tries to help homeowners who are in \ndistress in another way. A lot of people do not know in this country we \nhave something called the Federal Home Loan Banks. There are 12 of them \nacross the country. Together they make up the Federal Home Loan Bank \nsystem. A primary job they have is to raise money they then turn around \nand lend to smaller financial institutions, principally for home \nownership, to make home ownership more affordable.\n  Delaware is in the Pittsburgh Federal Home Loan Bank region. A lot of \nfinancial institutions--banks, savings and loans--work with the Federal \nHome Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. They get loans, if you will, below \nmarket-rate loans, from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh.\n  But one of the requirements under Federal law is these Federal Home \nLoan Banks have to contribute 10 percent of their net income into an \naffordable housing fund. The affordable housing fund is used by local \nentities, local financial banks, local financial entities, banks, \nthrifts, in order to provide home ownership opportunities for, in a lot \nof cases, first-time home buyers or low-income home buyers. It is a \ngood program. We use it a lot in my State. It is used to leverage money \nfrom State and local governments. It is used to leverage money from \nnonprofits, from for-profits, from banks. It is a real good thing.\n  The problem with this affordable housing program fund is none of the \nmoneys in this program can be used to help subsidize or refinance--\nsomebody who is in one of these adjustable rate mortgages that is \nresetting. They need to refinance and get out of it and maybe get into \na 30-year fixed rate mortgage. This is affordable housing money. It is \ncompiled. It is built up. It is about a third of a billion dollars this \nyear. It cannot be used to help folks refinance out of a mortgage they \nhave no business being in. This amendment that has been accepted will \nallow that to take place.\n  My friend, Senator McCaskill of Missouri, along with Senator Kohl and \nmyself, has offered an amendment. I understand it has been accepted, \nand we are grateful for that. That amendment seeks to protect folks who \nhave taken advantage of reverse mortgages.\n\n  One of the nice things about being a homeowner with equity in your \nhome, in a lot of cases when you reach an older age and maybe your home \nis paid off, you ought to be able to live off the equity of your home \nfor the rest of your life. In some cases, people who are in that \nsituation do not get very good advice, and they are duped into making \ninvestments with the equity of their home in ways that really do not \nhelp the homeowner trying to live off the equity of their home for the \nrest of their life. It helps them less than maybe someone who is a \nscoundrel trying to take advantage of them.\n  So Senator McCaskill's amendment, that Senator Kohl and I have joined \nin sponsoring, allows HUD to use a portion of the mortgage insurance \npremiums collected under this program to adequately fund counseling and \ndisclosure activities. So the idea there is to make sure people have \ngood advice. If you think about it, that is a theme of almost every \nelement I have talked about in this bill. Many of the elements of this \nbill are designed to make sure that consumers, homeowners, purchasers \nhave access to good advice, someone who is going to be there for them \nand not take advantage of them.\n  I said this housing recovery package is the third step so far of \nthree steps we need to take. The first step is action by the Federal \nReserve; the second step, our stimulus package; the third step is our \nhousing recovery package; a fourth step, that I hope will follow in the \nnext month or two--certainly before we get to the Memorial Day recess--\nis when the Senate Banking Committee takes up another measure that will \nconsider a Hope proposal, one that Senator Dodd and Congressman Frank \nhave been working on that has a lot of merit to help people, families \nwhose mortgage is underwater; that is, they owe more than the value of \ntheir property, find a way to get out of that situation.\n  The lenders, the investors, the homeowners themselves will probably \ntake a little bit of a financial haircut, but by doing that they would \nbe able to stay in their homes and maybe end up with a little bit of \nequity in their homes in the end.\n  A number of us--Senator Martinez and I and Senator Schumer and \nSenator Jack Reed--have been very much interested, along with some of \nour colleagues, in trying to make sure we have a strong independent \nregulator for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. \nThat ought to be part of our next package. We need to license mortgage \nbrokers to make sure they have the kind of training and the kind of \nregulatory structure under which to operate, to make sure the \nappraisals that are written on a lot of homes are actually worth the \npaper on which they are written.\n  So there is a lot that can be done and should be done, and my hope is \nwe will have the opportunity to take those up, have hearings as \nappropriate in the Banking Committee, and mark them up before the \nMemorial Day recess and literally have them on the Senate floor to \ndebate by the Fourth of July. That would be good for our country, and \nthat would be the fourth step, if you will, to help stabilize our \neconomy, to begin to restore some confidence in our economy, especially \nin the housing sector of our economy, and to make sure we put some \nliquidity back into our financial system and our banking system where \nit is needed.\n  But the last thing, and maybe the most helpful, it would do is to \nclearly demonstrate to folks around this country that this place still \nworks, that Democrats and Republicans can find common ground, work with \nthe administration, and do what is in the best interests of our \ncountry, our citizens, and our families.\n  None of what is done in the legislation that is before us today is \ndesigned to reward bad behavior. For people who have been borrowers and \nbought homes as a speculator, where they were interested in buying it \nto watch the price go up, to simply flip it, flip the house, and take \nadvantage of these exotic adjustable rate mortgages to do that, to work \nthe system, and to look for some short-term profit, we are not \ninterested in helping.\n  With all due respect, we are not interested in borrowers who have \nmisbehaved or mortgage brokers or investors who have misbehaved. That \nis not what this is about. This initiative is to restore confidence in \nthe system, liquidity in the system, and to say to people: The system--\nour legislative system, our political system--still works, and it works \nfor the interests of people who need our help.\n  That said, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an amendment I \nhave\n\n[[Page S2789]]\n\noffered with Senator Wicker from Mississippi. Our amendment is pending. \nIt is germane. We hope to have a vote sometime soon on this amendment, \nif we can move past this present standstill.\n  I want to just put up some numbers to try to explain our situation in \nLouisiana. I have used this chart before. This chart is the underlying \nreason for the bill that we are on because these are the top 10 \ndistricts in the country, according to the official data, where these \nforeclosures are taking place.\n  As you can see, there are about 40,000 distressed properties in and \naround Detroit; about 10,000 in Stockton, CA; 30,000 in Las Vegas; \nabout 51,000 in San Bernardino, CA; about 23,000 in Sacramento; about \n27,000 around the Cleveland area--and it goes on. These are the top 10.\n  Now, this data is readily available. I am sorry I do not have more \nthan just the top 10. But I used this chart to make my point about our \nsituation still in Louisiana and on the gulf coast.\n  You can see, the percentage of households in Detroit is about 5 \npercent; the same with Stockton, CA, and Las Vegas is 4 percent. That \nis a real crisis in those areas. It seems like a small percentage, but \nif you are in a neighborhood where there is a concentration of these \nkinds of homes, the problem is--and what we are trying to solve, those \nof us who are supporting this bill; and I am supporting this bill--to \ntry to provide some additional community development block grant \nfunding because not only are we trying to perhaps come up with State-\nbased local solutions that might help these particular families, but \nthe real tragedy, in my mind, is those families around these homes who \ndid absolutely nothing wrong. They took out a 30-year mortgage. They \nhave paid their mortgage every month. They did not enter into any \nflimflam kind of agreement.\n  But the problem is, as homes collapse around them and become vacant \nand are foreclosed on, these homeowners who did nothing wrong, who have \nmost of their net worth tied up in the value of their home, are seeing, \nthrough no fault of their own, their property values plummeting.\n  Now, if you are a young person, and you are a homeowner in this \nsituation, you might have time to ride it out. But if you are a senior \ngetting ready to retire, or if you are getting ready, in middle age, to \nsend your two children to college and were hoping to refinance your \nhome to do that and had planned for 20 years--this was your plan to \nsend your kids to college. You did not get to go to college, but you \nhave saved and scrimped and worked hard, and you were going to \nrefinance your house to send your children to college. Guess what. Your \nkids do not go to college because your neighbor took out a subprime \nloan, and it is causing your property value to plummet.\n  Now, I know the President does not understand why community \ndevelopment block grant moneys are important. He does not understand a \nlot of things. But some of us do understand why we need to help people \nin these neighborhoods.\n  So I am just explaining that while the numbers are very high, and \nthese percentages are startling, I want to show you what our numbers \nlook like in Louisiana because if these look bad, ours are terrible.\n  It is not because we had foreclosure problems. It is not because we \nhave subprime--in fact, our State does not really have the same problem \nthat California and Nevada are facing. But we had our own sets of \ncatastrophes, and that, of course, was in the storms of a few years \nago, Katrina and Rita, that hit the gulf coast--both just historic in \ntheir devastation.\n  We are still having a housing crisis throughout the gulf coast, \nreally from Alabama to the southern part of Texas, as people struggle \nwith the impact of those storms. In New Orleans and Saint Bernard and \nin the southeastern portion of Louisiana, our situation was even \nfurther complicated when the Federal levees that should have held did \nnot. They failed, and people who had never had an inch of water in \ntheir home had 14 feet and lost everything they had worked for their \nentire lives.\n  So in St. Bernard Parish we see not 5 percent, not 4 percent but 54 \npercent of the homes are empty or devastated. In Cameron, LA, not 4 \npercent or 5 percent but 46 percent of the homes; in Plaquemines \nParish, 44 percent; in Orleans Parish, 78,000, almost 80,000, out of \nonly 122,000. That is an extremely high percentage almost 42 percent of \nhouseholds that are still damaged or destroyed.\n\n  Now, what has been done to help these homeowners? Some have been able \nto collect their insurance, but very few people have collected all of \nwhat they thought they were due. Some have collected a modest grant we \ngave from this Congress of an average of $60,000. Some have received--\nthat is about the average for homeowners. But I would contend that a \n$60,000 to $75,000 to $85,000 grant and some insurance proceeds they \nwere able to receive does not, by any means, get these homeowners back \nto where they need to be.\n  So we have tried to pass additional legislation that might help and \nhave been unable to move anything substantial through the Housing \nCommittee. However, we now see an opportunity on this floor on a \nhousing bill that is attempting to reach communities that are in \ndistress--ours is in distress for a different reason, not, as I said, \nbecause of failure to pay or because of delinquency or foreclosure. We \nsee an opportunity, by making a very modest change in the underlying \nbill, to help these homeowners. This would make it clear, with the \namendment I offer with Senator Wicker--our amendment would simply say \nthat in the community development block grant portion of this bill, \nthat it be allowed to be used not just for homes that were foreclosed \nbut for homes that were conveyed to local land banks.\n  To deal with this situation, we have created in Louisiana--or are in \nthe process of actually creating--parishwide authorities that are done \nat the local level; they are called land banks. They have other names \nfor them, such as redevelopment authorities. They exist throughout the \ncountry. It is not anything new. But we are finding we may need to be \nsupporting these kinds of land banks as properties are conveyed back to \nthe Government--not in every case, but some people are making choices. \nThey don't want to rebuild in that place; they would rather take their \ngrant money and build somewhere else. That piece of property is then \nconveyed back to our State land bank, and our land bank is trying to \nmove these properties back to local parish-based land banks so these \nneighborhoods can be redeveloped with some sort of rhyme and reason to \nthem; so it is not hit or miss but that there is some sort of local \nplanning. We are being required to build better and stronger and \nsmarter. We are trying to actually live up to that challenge by being \nsmart about the way we redevelop.\n  I see the ranking member of the committee on the floor, the Senator \nfrom Alabama, who is familiar, of course, with some of the devastation \nthat occurred because some of it, unfortunately, happened in Mobile--\nnot to the extent it happened in the southern part of Mississippi and \nLouisiana. But what I am saying to the Senator from Alabama is that \nwith one modest change that actually is germane, according to the \nChair, and does not cost anything, we would simply allow our portion of \nwhatever comes to Louisiana and Mississippi--not a dime more than what \nis already in the bill--to be used for land banks associated with the \nredevelopment of these kinds of properties. I am afraid, if we don't \nmake this change, it might put Mississippi and Louisiana and, frankly, \nAlabama and parts of Texas in the position of not being able to use \ntheir community development block grants for the problem they have.\n  So in this whole country, some States have problem A. In other \nStates, we have problem B. I am trying to make sure our problem is met \nwith this amendment. It is not adding anything; it is an allowable use \nof our community development block grant, and it will go a long way to \nhelp.\n  Now, we estimate--I don't know if the Senator from Alabama has these \nnumbers--that for our State, based on the formula that is in the bill, \nLouisiana may get somewhere between $90 million and $100 million, but \nwe don't know until that formula is promulgated by the Secretary of \nHUD, but we estimate that based on the formulas in the bill. So we want \nto make sure the $90 million or $100 million can actually\n\n[[Page S2790]]\n\nbe used to help these homeowners because they are technically not in \nforeclosure. They are in various stages of legal status, but they are \nnot necessarily in foreclosure.\n  So that is the purpose of our community development block grant \namendment. I would most certainly appreciate it if the leadership would \ntake a look at it. Again, it is amendment No. 4447. It doesn't cost \nanything. It is scored at zero. I have a great partner in offering this \namendment, the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Wicker. So that is the \ncommunity development block grant amendment.\n  I wish to take a moment to also talk about the mortgage revenue \nbonds, which is part of the financing part of this bill. As my \ncolleagues know, this bill is basically made up of two different \nsections. One is a housing section and then one is a tax section. In \nthe tax section of this bill, one of the ways the Finance Committee \nwants to try to alleviate some of the problems around the country is to \nallow the issuance of some additional mortgage revenue bonds. We have \ndone this for years and years and years. Before I was a Senator, I was \nthe State treasurer. I used to issue these bonds in my State. They are \na very good tool to promote home ownership, which we believe in at home \nin Louisiana, and I am sure everyone else does as well. It gives \nopportunities to build affordable, low-income housing where there is a \nreal need throughout the country, particularly now in the gulf coast.\n  One of the things I am very concerned about--I don't know if the \nSenator from Alabama or the Senator from Utah, who is on the floor, \nexperienced this in their States, but we have a real shortage of \naffordable housing for seniors, as more people want to live \nindependently, but they don't necessarily want to live in a 2,000- or \n3,000-square-foot home by themselves. They would like to move somewhere \ncloser to maybe where their family is, and they would like an \naffordable rental unit. Some people would like to buy a condo, but to \npeople of a certain age bracket, a condo is not something they grew up \nwith, so an affordable rental is a more comfortable situation for them. \nWe can't find a lot of senior housing down in the gulf coast right now. \nMost everything we had was literally washed away or flooded or \ndestroyed.\n  So the great thing about this particular provision coming out of \nFinance is these revenue bonds could be used for this kind of building. \nAgain, the other amendment I have, No. 4404, does not have a score. \nActually, it has a minor score of $3 million. It is very minor compared \nto the other costs of this bill. It is de minimis, a $3 million cost. \nWhat it will do is it will allow us to be able to again use our bonding \nauthority--not anything more, not anything additional, but to use our \nbonding authority to address the problem we have with these properties.\n\n  I wish to show some pictures. This is a neighborhood--I am sorry I \ncan't identify where this is, and it was some time ago. Most of this \ndebris has been picked up throughout the gulf coast, but in many \nplaces, while the debris is gone, these structures remain as they are \nhere: abandoned and destroyed until property owners figure out what \nthey are going to do.\n  Here is another picture we have used. I am not sure, again, where \nthis is, but houses such as this are still throughout the gulf coast \narea; a lot of it has been cleaned up. Maybe this home has been gutted, \nbut it is basically down to its 2 by 4s, and it is basically sitting \nthere in neighborhood after neighborhood. This is actually a home in \nSt. Bernard Parish in a community called Chalmette.\n  I wish I had better pictures to show the blocks and blocks of \ndevastation that still exist. When I say devastation--it is cleaned up, \non many of the lots the grass is cut, but there are no homes there, \nthere is no neighborhood there. The library is not yet back, the Post \nOffice is not yet back, and people are still struggling to rebuild \ntheir neighborhoods.\n  So I am imploring the leadership handling this bill to please take a \nlook at amendment No. 4404. Please take a look at amendment No. 4447. \nThe cost in one case is nothing. The cost in the other is a de minimis \n$3 million, but it will help tremendously to make this bill, we hope \nwill pass, applicable to the situations in Alabama, Mississippi, \nLouisiana, and Texas, whose people are still struggling 2\\1/2\\ years \nafter this devastation.\n  Basically, that is the gist of my remarks. We have another amendment \npending relative to the tax credit, but I will hold my remarks on that. \nBut these two amendments we are hoping we can get included in any kind \nof modified package. Again, I have bipartisan support. It does not \nincrease the cost of the bill, and it would go a great way to make sure \nthis bill, if it does get passed--I know there is opposition in the \nHouse and I know the President is opposed to this bill, so this bill \nmay never see the light of day. I am very clear about that. But if it \ndoes, at least let the people of Louisiana and Mississippi use the \nmoney that is being allocated to us anyway for the problem we have--not \nthe problem everybody else has--because we simply have a different \nproblem. I hope my colleagues would recognize our situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, this afternoon in the Senate, I wish to \ntake a minute to commend the Senator from Louisiana for her work on \nthese amendments and her concern for her people. Senator Dodd and I \nhave talked to the Senator from Louisiana and others about our package. \nThe Presiding Officer is a member of the Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs Committee who knows we have done the best we can to craft a \nbill which is focused on bringing relief to those areas affected most \nby the growing rate of foreclosures. We realize this will not be a \npanacea, but it is a good first start. Because we were stalled, as the \nPresiding Officer knows, on the floor, and what we are trying to do is \nmake a breakthrough. The success of this effort we have been working on \nfor a second week now, I believe, will depend a great deal on whether \nthe funds made available in this bill make it to their intended \ndesignation. We can help to ensure a degree of success by keeping it \nfocused on the foreclosure market.\n  The Presiding Officer talked about that, as did the Senator from \nLouisiana. Chairman Dodd and I worked closely with Senator Reid and \nSenator McConnell, our respected leaders, to draft a targeted bill \ndesigned to address the problems caused by the recent turmoil in the \nnational housing markets. Our goal was to provide resources to deal \nwith the recent foreclosures and try to prevent additional \nforeclosures. In other words, this bill was put together in the context \nof the current conditions of the national housing market.\n  I recognize, as I said a minute ago, Senator Landrieu's concern and \nothers' concern regarding the housing issues, particularly hers in \nLouisiana. I believe we need to address those, some of them, outside \nthis particular legislation. I know the Presiding Officer right now is \nvery involved in the Banking and Housing Committee, and we are going to \ncontinue to address this problem. I think we have to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n\n          TESTIMONY OF GENERAL PETRAEUS AND AMBASSADOR CROCKER\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, a little over a year ago, I stood before \nthe Senate and recited the words of Thomas Paine--who in his essay \ntitled ``Chaos''--spoke about commitment and sacrifice to a noble cause \nwhen it appeared that all hope was lost. His words still resonate \ntoday:\n\n       These are the times that try men's souls. The summer \n     soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink \n     from the service of his country; but he that stands it now \n     deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.\n\n  Paine wrote those words when it seemed the American Revolution was \nlost. However, their effect was to rally what remained of the \nContinental Army and ensure the success of Washington's raids on \nTrenton and Princeton.\n  When I recited Paine's words, our Nation faced a dilemma. Despite the \ngreat heroism and noble sacrifice of our servicemembers, large portions \nof Iraq were under the control of al-Qaida. The mainstream media had \nconcluded that, at best, our forces were locked in a stalemate. Many \nadvocated that the only recourse was to bring the troops home and allow \nIraq to fall in the abyss of an implosion.\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\n  For some, including the senior Senator from Arizona and me, that was \nnever an option. The knowledge, experience and, hopefully, wisdom that \nI have accumulated over the years in this august body allowed me to \nmake only one conclusion: If we are not successful in this war the \nresult will be catastrophic for our Nation, the Western world, and the \nMiddle East. This enemy--and despite what some in the media would lead \nus to believe, our main adversary in Iraq is al-Qaida--will pursue us \nhome. Imagine the horrors that will follow if al-Qaida, with \nreinvigorated resources provided by Iraq's oil wealth, were to defeat \nus in Iraq.\n  However, one of the great historical truths of our Nation is that in \nour most dire hours, our military has continually provided us with \nleaders of great resolve and strategic brilliance. General David \nPetraeus amply fits that mold.\n  The new strategy that General Petraeus proposed--in which he has so \nably been assisted by Ambassador Crocker--is based on the classical \ncounterinsurgency tenet of providing security to the population of a \nnation under attack.\n  Why is this critical? By providing security to the Iraqi people, that \nNation's citizens will develop a vested interest in the creation of \ninstitutions that will ensure their security for the future. Simply \nput, only in a secure environment can the majority of Iraqis earn a \nliving, put food on the table, and provide a better life for their \nfamilies.\n  What once was theory is now becoming reality. The Iraqi people are \nseeing considerable results from General Petraeus's strategy and their \nactions and plans for the future increasingly reflect this new reality.\n  How do we know this? Since the beginning of 2007, well over 100,000 \nindividuals have joined the Iraqi Army and security forces. This means \nthat a total of 540,000 Iraqis now serve in that Nation's security \nforces. This includes the 91,641 individuals, who in little over a \nyear, have joined the Sons of Iraq, the coalition of citizens that are \ntasked with providing security to their local communities. One should \nremember that 80 percent of the Sons of Iraq are Sunni Muslims. In \naddition, it should be noted that al-Qaida receives most of its support \nfrom the Sunni. Frankly, this alone is a major triumph.\n  The Iraqi people are also providing us intelligence. One of the \nmethods by which we find weapons and explosive caches is through tips \nfrom the local population. In 2006, Coalition forces found and cleared \n2,660 such weapons caches. In 2007, after the Petraeus strategy was \nimplemented, that number increased to 6,963. What is even more \nimpressive is that though we have just entered the fourth month of this \nyear, Coalition forces have already seized more weapons caches than in \nall of 2006. Clearly, this increase in seizures would not be possible \nwithout greater support from the Iraqi population.\n  In the area of ethno-sectarian violence, we have seen a dramatic \nreduction in deaths. When our new strategy was first implemented, there \nwere more than 2,000 ethno-sectarian deaths a month in Iraq and over \n1,500 in Baghdad alone. Today, there are fewer than 250 ethno-sectarian \ndeaths a month in all of Iraq.\n  All of these events have occurred during the period of enhanced \nsecurity brought about by General Petraeus's strategy. For example, \nshortly after the implementation of this strategy, there were greater \nthen 1,400 weekly security incidents in Iraq. Today that number has \ndropped to less than half.\n  In addition, the number of high profile attacks, which include car \nbombs, suicide car bombs and suicide vests--the preferred means of \nmurder by al-Qaida--has also decreased by more than half from March \n2007 to the present day.\n  Enhanced security has strengthened the foundations of political \ninstitutions and economic ventures. This is evidenced by a poll \nconducted by the Center for International Private Enterprise which was \nsummarized by Ambassador Crocker in his testimony. That poll, which was \nconducted last month, concluded that 78 percent of Iraq's business \nowners ``expect the Iraqi economy to grow significantly in the next 2 \nyears.''\n  Equally as impressive is the International Monetary Fund estimate \nthat Iraq's gross domestic product will grow by 7 percent in real terms \nthis year--7 percent. That rate of growth will only be matched by some \nAsian tiger economies and it is a level that I wish that the United \nStates could enjoy.\n  This economic growth and strengthening of political institutions is \nalso evidenced by the fact that the United States will no longer fund \nmajor infrastructure projects. Ambassador Crocker reports the reason \nfor this fundamental shift is that Iraq's economy is now earning \nsufficient funds for the Iraqi Government to independently build their \nown infrastructure.\n  This does not mean that we should view this conflict through rose-\ncolored glasses. As evidenced by the events in Basra last week, there \nremain many challenges ahead. The fact is that the Iraqi operations in \nBasra were not properly planned. However, as General Petraeus said: ``. \n. . in the wake of recent operations, there were units and leaders \nfound wanting in some cases . . . Nonetheless, the performance of many \n[Iraqi] units was solid, especially once they got their footing and \ngained a degree of confidence, and certain Iraqi elements proved quite \ncapable . . .''\n  In addition, it should be noted that in previous years no one would \nhave dreamed that the Iraqi Government would have launched such an \noperation. Remember, the Prime Minister gave an order to the security \nforces. Those orders were executed. In Basra, the results were mixed. \nSome units did well; some did not. However, the fact that the \nGovernment thought they could execute this major operation \nindependently is a positive development. As General Petraeus testified \n``operations in Basra highlight improvements in the ability of the \nIraqi Security Forces to deploy substantial number of units, supplies \nand replacements on very short notice; they certainty could not have \ndeployed a division's worth of Army and Police units a year ago.''\n  Further progress is also being made by Iraq's political institutions. \nWhen our new strategy was first being implemented, there seemed to be \nan inextricable stalemate in Iraq's parliament. During my trip to Iraq \nin May 2007, Senator Smith and I spoke to senior members of the Iraqi \nParliament and strongly urged them to pass legislation vital to the \nreconstruction and the establishment of effective political \ninstitutions. As with any democratic political process, it has been \nslow going. However, the Iraqi Parliament has recently passed important \nlaws. These include a new pension law, de-Ba'athification reform, and a \nnew Provincial Powers Law, that sets elections for this fall and \ndefines the structure of power between the Iraqi Federal Government and \nits provinces. These are great strides forward, and all Americans \nshould recognize our accomplishments in Iraq.\n  I believe that Ambassador Crocker summed up the situation best when \nhe said yesterday:\n\n       Al-Qaida is in retreat in Iraq, but it is not yet defeated. \n     Al-Qaida's leaders are looking for every opportunity they can \n     to hang on. Osama bin Ladin has called Iraq ``the perfect \n     base,'' and it reminds us that a fundamental aim of al-Qaida \n     is to establish itself in the Arab world. It almost succeeded \n     in Iraq; we cannot allow it a second chance . . .\n       . . . the world ultimately will judge us far more on the \n     basis of what will happen than what has happened. In the end, \n     how we leave and what we leave behind will be more important \n     than how we came. Our current course is hard, but it is \n     working. Progress is real, although still fragile. We need to \n     stay with it.\n\n  Mr. President, the road has been long and hard. However, as I said 1 \nyear ago, the words of Thomas Paine remind us that great causes require \nsacrifice, that in any conflict there will be dark days, but if our \ncause is just and our will is strong, there is nothing that we cannot \naccomplish as a people. I suggest very strongly that our cause is just \nand our will is stronger than some in this body believe it to be.\n  Mr. President, our forces have accomplished much. It is now our \nresponsibility to sustain them until they achieve the victory which \nthey deserve, and for which they are fighting.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2792]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes in \nsupport of the Ensign-Cantwell amendment that I understand is to be \noffered to the pending legislation.\n  I have long maintained that targeted tax incentives are an essential \ncomponent of a new energy policy for our country. Accordingly, I look \nforward to voting for this amendment. Because of my longstanding \ncommitment to fiscal responsibility, I want to also point out my \ndisappointment that the amendment is not going to be paid for in this \nlegislation.\n  There is no denying that these incentives play a vital role in \npromoting clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency and, in turn, \nreducing our dependence on conventional fuels, promoting a more secure \nenergy supply, and combating global warming.\n  Secondarily, though also critically, these tax incentives create \nhigh-wage jobs and reduce consumer and business energy costs.\n  In the 110th Congress, we have already tried three times, \nunsuccessfully, to extend these tax provisions. We cannot afford to \nwait any longer. Business decisions are not made overnight, and \ncompanies that invest in these technologies need to plan with \ncertainty. But because of congressional inaction, companies are already \nputting on hold or canceling plans to create and expand investments \nthat currently benefit from these tax incentives.\n  It is because of this urgency that I plan to vote for the Cantwell-\nEnsign amendment. But because the extensions are not paid for, I will \ncast my vote with less than full enthusiasm. This amendment will add to \nour unsustainable budget deficits. Already we send 9 cents out of every \ndollar we collect to pay interest on our national debt. There is no \njustification, other than politics, not to offset the amendment.\n  My colleagues in the House have shown greater fiscal restraint than \nwe have in the Senate. Because they are less willing to break from the \npay-go rules that have been adopted in both Chambers, I doubt that the \nHouse will accept these extensions without some corresponding offsets. \nThis leaves the administration with a key role to play in developing a \ncompromise that will be acceptable to both Chambers and that will be \nsigned by the President.\n  President Bush has previously committed to support these tax \nincentives which were enacted by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. I can \nrecall when he visited my home State of New Mexico to sign that \nlegislation. The President praised the bill for recognizing ``that \nAmerica is the world's leader in technology and that we've got to use \ntechnology to be the world's leader in energy conservation.''\n  But while Congress has been working to ensure that America maintains \nthis leadership role, the administration has been absent. They have \nrebuffed our requests to identify any acceptable offsets. Most \nrecently, we were told by the Department of Treasury that the \nadministration will not support the use of sufficient revenue raisers \nlisted in its so-called blue book. Why? Because Treasury has reserved \nthose offsets to pay for other priorities.\n  I call upon the President and this administration to work with \nCongress in good faith to find a way to pay for these incentives. The \ntime is far overdue to send the President a package to extend these tax \nprovisions--a package that can pass the Congress and can be signed into \nlaw.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask I be allowed to speak in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments today to \ntalk about an important topic affecting individuals and families from \nall across the country, and that is the rising cost of health care. It \nis an issue that affects every individual, every family's pocketbook. \nIt is an issue that is affecting our small businesses across the \ncountry as they try to keep up with the rising cost of health care.\n  I thank my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Vitter, who last week \nspearheaded a discussion along with seven of my Senate colleagues on \nthe conservative principles of health care reform. This is a discussion \nwe plan to highlight over the next several weeks and which we will \ncontinue to focus on in the future.\n  I had the privilege of visiting a number of hospitals around South \nDakota over the March work period, to hear from providers on issues of \nconcern to them and to discuss health care reform. I was primarily \nfocused on small hospitals, critical access hospitals, providers that \ndeliver health care services in very rural and remote areas of this \ncountry.\n  My State of South Dakota has lots of land and not a big population \nbase. Yet people's expectation out there is they will have access to \nhigh-quality health care. As I visited these hospitals and health care \nproviders as I visited my State over the March work period, I heard \nlots of different messages, and one of them was we have to figure out a \nway to keep up with these rising costs. Fortunately, for many of the \nsmaller hospitals in the rural areas that are critical access \nhospitals, they are able to get cost-based reimbursement, and that is \nsomething I think has led to the survival of lots of health care \nproviders that otherwise would have had to close their doors.\n  It is important the American people hear the message of choice and \naffordability championed by many Republicans in the health care debate. \nUnfortunately, we are up against an opposing message, which is one of a \nquick fix or universal plan that Washington will decide for everyone. \nThis message too often sticks in the minds of the media, with health \ncare trade associations, and with many of our constituents.\n  The goal of universal coverage, or allowing every person in America \nthe opportunity to afford health care insurance, is an important goal. \nHow we work toward this goal is where the debate lies. That is where a \nClinton or Obama health care plan differs strikingly from that offered \nby our colleague from Arizona, Senator John McCain.\n  I would like to focus today on one of the most basic principles which \nshould guide all our health care reform proposals we debate in the \ncoming years and that is to reject this movement toward more \nGovernment-run health insurance. Instead, we ought to make long-lasting \nreforms to both our tax system and the insurance market to increase \naccess to privately owned health care coverage. That is private \ninsurance you, the individual, can choose and you can keep from job to \njob.\n  What we have today is already a mixture of Government-run insurance, \nincluding Medicare, which provides coverage to over 40 million seniors, \nand Medicaid, a program available to the poor and the disabled, and \nprivate insurance, usually offered through medium or large employers.\n  Only about 7 percent of the population in this country actually \npurchase their insurance on their own directly from an insurance \ncompany. In lots of ways, the way people access health insurance today \nis very limiting when you consider the Government or your employer does \nnot choose other important services in your life, such as the food you \neat or the car or the home you buy.\n  Rising health care costs are also a huge problem, not only for those \nwho have private insurance but also for our Government programs. The \nMedicare trustees now report that into the future, the trust funds have \nover $36 trillion in long-term unfunded obligations. By that I mean \nbenefits that are promised but not paid for, which amounts--if you can \nbelief this--to 2\\1/2\\ times the size of the entire U.S. economy. Let \nme repeat that, $36 trillion in long-term unfunded liabilities or 2\\1/\n2\\ times the entire U.S. economy.\n  This is money somebody has to pay, and it is an added burden on \nfuture\n\n[[Page S2793]]\n\ngenerations and on our economy. Left unchecked, the Federal Government \nwill be forced to cut benefits or substantially increase taxes. If \nthere is one thing that should be obvious to all of us, it is that a \nsystem such as traditional Medicare or Medicaid is not sustainable \nfinancially. There are no natural incentives under these programs to \ncontrol costs. It is not just the cost of these programs that presents \na problem. While over 40 million seniors have Medicare coverage, most \nbeneficiaries also have some form of supplemental coverage, or other \ninsurance, that wraps around because traditional Medicare is not \nenough.\n  In 2004, only 9.3 percent of Medicare beneficiaries relied solely on \nthe traditional fee-for-service program, and over 60 percent had some \nform of private supplemental coverage.\n  Also, for many providers in my State of South Dakota, Medicare's \nprices and regulations do not account for the challenges patients and \nproviders face in rural areas. Once again, one size fits all, \nGovernment-run health insurance is neither financially sustainable nor \nis it even sufficient for those it is meant to help. For the next \nseveral weeks, the Senator from Louisiana, myself, and Senators DeMint, \nBurr, Coburn, Martinez, Isakson, and Corker will be talking about the \nalternatives that are out there to our current rules and regulations \nand how we can achieve affordable coverage for all Americans through \nexpanding access to private insurance.\n  While some of my colleagues in this body would like to expand \nMedicare to cover everyone to achieve the goal of universal coverage, \nor to expand Medicaid and SCHIP to cover many more Americans, I \nstrongly oppose the expansion of Government insurance at the expense of \nchoice, quality, and affordability.\n  Frankly, I want much more for my constituents back home in South \nDakota and others across the country. I don't want the next President \nto push through a health care plan that will put more families on \nGovernment insurance, simply so we can say we have provided coverage.\n  As we were having the SCHIP debate last year, this point came up. \nExpanding SCHIP, which is essentially Medicaid in my State and in most \nother States, to families making as much as $80,000 per year, would \nhave made it harder to attract good physicians to South Dakota, \nsomething we struggle with constantly in rural States. At a time when \nas many as 50 percent of physicians nationwide are limiting or dropping \nMedicaid patients because it simply does not cover their costs, why \nwould we want to expand this program even further?\n  There is a better way. In my State, most of the uninsured are \nemployees of small businesses. These are individuals capable of owning \ntheir own insurance, but it is simply not affordable or is not offered \nthrough their place of employment. What Senator McCain has proposed--\nand even one Senator from the other party, Senator Wyden from Oregon--\nis to reform the tax incentives in place now that only benefit large \nemployers, CEOs and their employees, in purchasing health insurance, \nand level the playing field for everyone else. This can be accomplished \nby eliminating the tax benefit employers receive when offering \ninsurance to their employees, which equals more than $200 billion over \n1 year, and instead taking that money and offering it in the form of a \ntax credit or standard tax deduction to every American toward the \npurchase of health insurance.\n  With a tax credit proposal, we would be able to give every American a \ncredit--$2,000 for an individual or $4,500 or $5,000 for a family--\nwhich is advanceable and refundable toward the purchase of insurance.\n  You could still choose to get your insurance through your employer or \nkeep it, if that is the best option for you. But for anyone else, they \nwould also have a substantial tax benefit to be able to choose their \nown plan that fits their needs and which is not tied to their employer. \nThis would allow individuals and families to keep their insurance when \nmoving from job to job.\n  By giving all Americans the option of a tax credit, we would empower \nmillions of families who normally could not afford to buy insurance on \ntheir own to do so on the individual market, putting millions of \nconsumers in the driver's seat, demanding more personalized, \nconvenient, and affordable insurance plans. Right now, it is simply not \npossible for families or individuals in most States to afford their own \ninsurance plan. But by redirecting this tax incentive and creating a \nmore vibrant market, quality insurance plans will become more \naffordable and more accessible. This will drive down the cost of \ninsurance for everyone.\n  Finally, by giving individuals a tax credit toward the purchase of \ninsurance, we allow people to choose their own health insurance and the \ntype of plan they desire. They could choose the plan that fits their \nneeds, rather than having their employer do it for them. In many cases, \ntheir employer is only going to offer a very limited number of \noptions--perhaps doesn't know the health care needs from one person in \nthe plan to the next. More people will know what they are purchasing \nand will know what their premiums are going toward each and every \nsingle month, making us all better consumers of health care services.\n  Now, more than ever, words and phases such as Washington bureaucracy, \nGovernment-run health care, wage garnishment, and mandates describe the \ndirection many in this Congress wish to take. I believe that is the \nwrong direction, and I will continue to support health care reforms \nwhich expand choices and which give people more freedom to access the \nhealth care that is right for them.\n  This is a debate that needs to be joined in the days and weeks and \nmonths ahead. My hope is it will get underway this year. My expectation \nis anything done this year will probably be very incremental because I \nthink the big, bold decisions that need to be made regarding America's \nhealth care system will probably, regrettably, get punted into next \nyear, after the Presidential election. But the debate needs to begin.\n  What I and my colleagues I mentioned have decided is, we need to \nstart that dialog now. We need to get the American people engaged in \nthis debate in a way that allows them to see what the options are, what \nthe alternatives are, what their choices are. I believe a majority of \nconstituents in my State of South Dakota, and I would daresay across \nthis country, will chose a system that is based in the market, that \ngives them more choices, more alternatives, that creates competition--a \ncompetitive model, and, yes, that covers more Americans who, today, do \nnot have access to health insurance.\n  I believe that is a goal that is achievable. I believe the debate \nneeds to start now. I also believe that whoever the next President of \nthe United States is, needs to work together with this Congress, we \nneed to work together as Democrats and Republicans on a health care \nplan that is based on these very simple principles.\n  It is the principles that have served this country and this American \neconomy so well for so many years--freedom, choice, competition, \nquality--that ought to be the model for the health care of the future. \nI look forward to continuing this discussion throughout the coming \nmonths.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from South Dakota, \nSenator Thune, for his leadership this week and his remarks on this \nvital topic. As he said, a number of us have joined to forge and \npromote and advance this discussion; specifically, of course, Senator \nThune, Senator Burr of North Carolina, Senator DeMint of South \nCarolina, Senator Coburn of Oklahoma, Senator Isakson of Georgia, \nSenator Martinez of Florida, and myself.\n  As Senator Thune said, what we want to do is advance this debate and \nlay out the conservative model for dramatic, bold health care reform so \nwe advance this debate and move toward that sort of needed reform.\n  Senator Thune is right. There is huge consensus in America that our \nhealth care delivery system is broken. It needs dramatic action, \nemergency care, if you will. But for so long here in Washington, that \nwas only heard one way, that somehow we needed to react with a bigger \ngovernment program and a big government response.\n  I think now the American people are more aware that we have a \ncritical\n\n[[Page S2794]]\n\nchoice, and Senator Thune has helped lay out that choice today. Is it \nbig Government and a government program or is it more of a system \ndominated by private insurance, individual choice, empowering the \npatient, doctor-patient relationship, and that mantra Senator Thune \nmentioned?\n  Of course, I agree with him and thank him for advancing this debate. \nWe are going to continue this debate over the next several weeks. I \nknow in the very near future Senator Isakson will be taking the floor \nand going to other venues to begin talking about a closely related \nsubject, which is the choice between forced enrollment in certain \nprograms versus maximum individual choice.\n  I thank Senator Thune for his remarks and leadership and look forward \nto those further remarks of Senator Isakson and others as we advance \nthis critical debate toward dramatic, bold health care reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it looks as if we are getting to the end \nof this debate on housing, and it has been a good one.\n  I come to the floor before we move to the final stages of this debate \nto thank my colleagues for their extraordinary help in putting into \nthis bill, which is a major piece of legislation--attempting to help \ncommunities throughout the country deal with the added rate of \nforeclosures, the spiraling downward of so many neighborhoods due to a \nvariety of different circumstances--and I think it is important that \nthe Senate act today.\n  I particularly thank the chairman of this committee, Senator Dodd, \nfor his patience and his tenacity in getting us to this point and for \nputting in many good provisions into this bill that will be a help to \nhomeowners, to communities, in some instances to lenders, who got \nthemselves into difficulty because, again, our goal is to try to \nreinvigorate the housing markets, to stop the slide. Particularly, in \nthe case of Louisiana, we still have a significant housing crisis that \ndid not start with the foreclosure crisis but started when 250,000 \nhomes were destroyed by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  This Congress has been generous at times in helping us to try to come \nup with ways to deal with this unprecedented situation. I am very \ngrateful for the amendment that was adopted overwhelmingly last week by \na vote of over 70 Members of this body to say that our Road Home \ngrants, which is what they are called in Louisiana--they are called \nHomeowner Assistance Grants in Mississippi--but those grants that have \nbeen provided by this Congress to help people rebuild homes that were \ndestroyed when insurance proceeds were either not available or not \nenough. This is from small towns such as Waveland, MS, to very large \ncities such as New Orleans, LA; places such as Lake Charles, LA, to \nsmall little communities such Creole, LA, on the southwest side.\n  So it is affecting urban and rural places in my State. That amendment \nwe adopted last week will be a significant help to homeowners trying to \nuse those grants to get back into their homes. Until that amendment \npassed, this grant, if you will, was taxable. With the amendment we \nplaced on the floor of the Senate, those grants will be treated as \nnontaxable, basically.\n  I wish we could get this bill to the President's desk before April \n15. We are going to move it off the floor today. It has, of course, to \ngo to the House for negotiations and eventually get to the President.\n  I am very hopeful this bill--generally in its current form, with, \nhopefully, some improvements, as it continues to move through the \nprocess--can get to the President's desk quickly because our people on \nthe gulf coast--particularly in Louisiana, but on the gulf coast--who \nreceived help 2 years ago through community development block grants \nare feeling a real pinch right now because they are now paying $5,000, \n$10,000 or $20,000 in taxes on those grants at a time when they can \nleast afford it.\n  I cannot tell you how many people stop me when I go home and say: \nSenator, if you could do one thing for us, please tell them we cannot \npay tax on these grants we have received--which have been minimal, \nhelpful but minimal, in their efforts to rebuild hundreds of thousands \nof homes.\n  Let me say for the record--and I am very proud of Habitat for \nHumanity. I am the cochair of the Habitat for Humanity caucus here. I \nhave been on many builds throughout the country. Habitat for Humanity, \nwhich has not stopped working since the rain stopped--and I see the \nSenator from Connecticut on the Senate floor--and which has had \nthousands of volunteers every day coming to their sites in Louisiana, \nhas only completed 162 houses--162 houses--and they are the largest \nhomebuilder in New Orleans. We lost about 250,000 dwelling places \nthroughout the state of Louisiana. So I am here in an uphill battle.\n  I appreciate my colleagues bearing with this speech over and over \nagain, but I can only say, if your cities or your communities were as \ndevastated as the ones I am representing, you would be here, too, \ntrying every way you could to bring every little bit of help and big \nhelp to them.\n  So I am grateful that finally we got a housing bill to the floor \nafter 2\\1/2\\ years. Finally, we got a very significant addition to some \ntax relief. I will say that in further reading of this bill, I am \nencouraged--the Senator from Connecticut is here--that the $140 million \nto $150 million in extra mortgage revenue bonds that will come to our \nState will be a help. I think in further reading of the bill, the \nunderlying bill actually will work for us. So I am very pleased.\n  I think we will continue to work on the $95 million to $100 million \nthat will come to our State in the underlying bill to help land banks. \nWe are establishing and have established NORA in New Orleans and other \nland banks, perhaps in St. Bernard, Cameron, Lake Charles, perhaps in \nPlaquemines, perhaps in St. Tammany and Jefferson Parishes, which are \nthe hardest hit parishes. I think this bill allows for support of those \nland banks. So that is another $95 million to $100 million that may \ncome for that purpose, and we have been looking for some help in that \nregard.\n\n  So, overall, this bill will address many issues in Louisiana with the \nadditional help we have received through these amendments. I am very \npleased that we have made progress.\n  Again, I wish to thank the Senator. He has been more than generous \nwith his time. I know this has been difficult because there are 50 of \nus who are asking him for special help and attention. But he has been \ndown to our State. I am hoping he will come back and walk through some \nof these neighborhoods.\n  Finally, I will say that this is quite an interesting and wonderful--\nif you can say that--experiment going on in the United States of \nAmerica, because the question is, when a community of 60,000 people is \nwholly destroyed, which happened in St. Bernard Parish, the parish \nsouth of New Orleans, is it possible for the Government to rebuild it? \nIf so, how and how quickly and how well? There are nonprofits and there \nare universities, from Harvard University to Stanford to LSU to some of \nthe top social scientists in the country right there on the gulf coast, \nbecause in their minds, in this century, there has not been a \ndevastation like this in modern times.\n  So there are some interesting questions: How does a neighborhood come \nback? Do you build the churches first or the schools or the libraries? \nHow important is water and electricity relative to the scheme of things \nin terms of rebuilding neighborhoods? How do you do it with community \nplanning in a democracy where every neighbor's voice has to be treated \nthe same? So these are some exciting times. We are just making the best \nof a very desperate situation and trying to do the best we can to \nrebuild our communities.\n  I want to end with thanking all of the volunteers, all of the \nnonprofits, all of the businesses that have stepped up. I thank the \nSenate for acting on at least a very significant portion of this\n\n[[Page S2795]]\n\ntax relief for homeowners who are still putting the pieces of their \nlives and their fortunes back together--regardless of how modest some \nof those fortunes may be--neighborhood to neighborhood. But people are \nreally trying to put their homes and their lives back together. So I \nthank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  I understand we are going to move now to the managers' package. \nAgain, we have some significant portions taken care of in this bill. I \nam looking forward to being able to let the State know that another \n$140 million, $150 million worth of mortgage revenue bonds that I \npersonally hope will go to affordable, low-income housing, workforce \nhousing, and particularly for seniors who have been so devastated by \nthe loss of their homes, and again, the support that may come out of \nthis bill for our land banks as we think of new and innovative ways to \nget this property back on the private rolls, redeveloped in a way that \ncreates excitement and vibrancy in neighborhoods from New Orleans East \nto Lakeview to the Lower Ninth Ward, all the way to lower Packwood \nParish, which is about as far south as you can go in Louisiana.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Iraq Hearings\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we had a hearing yesterday in the Armed \nServices Committee, of which I am a member, in which General Petraeus \nand Ambassador Crocker made their reports back to the Congress, as they \npromised. They also testified yesterday afternoon before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, and today they are before the House \ncommittee. I think they had about a 30-minute break or less between the \ntestimony here and their testimony in the Foreign Relations Committee. \nI thought General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker did a marvelous job \nand were asked a lot of tough questions, which is the Congress's \nresponsibility, I don't dispute.\n  What I wish to share with my colleagues today relates to the \ntestimony of General Jack Keane, who testified this morning before the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  General Keane was former Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. He is \na paratrooper, a combat veteran, a student of the military for 37 \nyears, a four star general who has made four trips to Iraq in the last \nyear, and he has made a number of suggestions and continues to be, in \nmy opinion, one of the most respected observers of the Iraqi military \nsituation we have in our country today.\n  In fact, I happened to be on ``The Charlie Rose Show'' with him and \nSenator Jack Reed last night. Reference was made that he was an adviser \nto Presidential candidate and Senate Member Hillary Clinton. He said \nthat, in fact, he had provided advice to her, but he had provided \nadvice to all three of the leading candidates still in the race and \nthree of those who dropped out. His advice is widely sought. His \ncriticism was real over a year ago when he felt the policies we were \nexecuting in Iraq were not good policies and not effective. He believed \na change in policy was called for. To a significant degree, the surge, \nand even more importantly, the tactical changes that took place with \nthe surge were suggestions that he had made. Of course, General \nPetraeus also executed them, and it represented General Petraeus's \nview, but General Keane did make a valuable contribution in the new \npolicy we have undertaken.\n  Now, the American people are concerned about Iraq. They are rightly \nworried that we have a long-term commitment, and they wonder whether \nthere is a good and decent government at the end of that commitment, \nwhether it will be worth the effort we are putting forth, and whether \nwe have a realistic chance of success in Iraq.\n  I have asked General Petraeus each and every time he has testified \nbefore me: Do you believe we have a realistic chance of success? He \nsaid that when he first went over there, when things were going badly \nand he knew he had to make some changes, he said: Yes, Senator. If I \ndidn't believe I could be successful, I wouldn't go, I wouldn't take \nthe job. Since then, he has twice reported based on his time there that \nhe thinks we have a realistic chance of success.\n  What did General Keane say to us today? This very fine, highly \nrespected professional military officer said this:\n\n       The character of my visits to Iraq is to spend considerable \n     time with the Iraqi people, their Sheik and Tribal leaders, \n     as well as time with our U.S. military, Iraqi military, and \n     civilian leaders, and our troops.\n\n  That is a direct quote. I will continue to quote General Keane:\n\n       First and foremost, we have the most talented and capable \n     leadership team in Iraq represented by General Petraeus and \n     Ambassador Crocker. Nothing in my 40 plus years in national \n     security compares to this extraordinary team who provide the \n     very best of leadership to their marvelous teammates and \n     troops.\n\n  He talks about the dramatic turnaround:\n\n       The security turnaround in Iraq from the hell of 2006 and 3 \n     years of failed strategy is one of the most stunning \n     achievements in the annals of counterinsurgency practice. It \n     was achieved in a matter of months versus the years it \n     normally takes to turn around one of the most formidable \n     insurgencies the West has ever faced. Fundamental to that \n     success was the use of proven counterinsurgency practice to \n     protect the people with sufficient amounts of Iraq and U.S. \n     troops. This was a catalyst--\n\n  He says--\n\n     for the widespread Sunni awakening movement, which is truly \n     underappreciated here in the U.S. What really happened is the \n     Sheiks and Tribal leaders decided they could not achieve \n     their political objectives with al-Qaida Iraq in fighting the \n     United States and the government of Iraq. As such, the \n     overwhelming majority of Sunni leaders made four strategic \n     decisions to (1) stop the violence; (2) leverage the United \n     States leaders to influence the government of Iraq; (3) \n     reconcile with the government of Iraq; and (4) provide their \n     ``sons'' to work with us and the Iraqis to help defeat the \n     AQI--\n\n  al-Qaida Iraq--\n\n     and protect their own people.\n\n  Now, that is a remarkable development. It occurred in a matter of \nmonths, and I agree with him. I don't think even those of us in the \nCongress have fully understood the significance of what has happened. I \ndon't say everything is perfect and is going to be perfect and there \nare not dangers and problems ahead, but we need to listen to the report \nfrom this objective, respected general very carefully.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       These results are the very best one could expect in \n     fighting an insurgency; your opponent not only surrenders, \n     but comes to your side, to assist. The entire Arab Muslim \n     world are aware of the Sunni rejection of AQI, the first \n     major occurrence, ever, where the people have rejected the \n     AQI and their barbaric hold on them. Additionally, in a \n     recent poll over 90 percent of the Sunnis are expected to \n     participate in the political process in the 2008 provisional \n     elections and in the general election in 2009. What does that \n     tell us about reconciliation? Clearly, the Sunnis are \n     politically reconciling with the government of Iraq and the \n     government of Iraq is assisting.\n\n  That is a good report.\n  People all over the Arab world know that al-Qaida has a Sunni \nheritage, and that al-Qaida fed on the Sunni unhappiness over being \ndisplaced from power as part of the Saddam Hussein regime. Many of the \ndisplaced Sunnis were military people with military training and \ncapable in military conflicts and attacks. Now many Sunnis have \npartnered with the United States and the Government of Iraq and turned \nagainst al-Qaida and have basically driven them out of large portions \nof the country.\n  General Keane goes on to say this:\n\n       The implication of this is that the central region of Iraq \n     is relatively secure and now the U.S. and Iraqi forces are \n     focusing their efforts on the remaining presence of AQI in \n     the north.\n\n  Now, I hope my colleagues will listen to this next sentence:\n\n       In my view, the AQI are already operationally defeated and \n     the final campaign against AQI is underway as we speak. We \n     will complete the defeat of AQI in the months ahead in 2008.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, without the slightest doubt, this is his \nprofessional\n\n[[Page S2796]]\n\nmilitary opinion. It is not a political document, and it is consistent \nwith what we have been reading. If you read through what the media \nsaying that the people in Al Anbar, the Sunni region that had been the \nhaven of al-Qaida, have turned against al-Qaida, they have joined with \nthe U.S. military and the government of Iraq and have made Fallujah and \nRamadi now cities of relative safety. Just a few months ago they were \nexceedingly dangerous and violent cities. It is not perfect, but huge \nprogress was made.\n  General Keane went on to say this:\n\n       Make no mistake, this is genuine progress and has led to a \n     significant conclusion. We cannot lose militarily in Iraq, as \n     we were on the verge of doing in 2006. The AQI and remaining \n     hardliner Sunni insurgents cannot mount an offensive that \n     they could sustain, which would threaten the regime. Are we \n     finished? No, but we and the Iraqis have the momentum, we are \n     on the offense, and we can finally see that winning in Iraq \n     is now a likely outcome.\n\n  He talks about the problem with the Iranians. He doesn't minimize \nthat in any way. He goes on to talk about Prime Minister Maliki. We \nhave had people continually criticize Prime Minister Maliki, but it \nappears to me, based on the testimony I have heard, that he is growing \nin personal confidence and stature and is beginning to show some of the \nleadership we would like for him to show in the sovereign nation of \nIraq.\n  He talked about Maliki's decision to quickly send troops to the \nsouth, to Basra, where a militia group and special groups associated \nwith the Shia community were causing trouble to the central government. \nMaliki is a Shia, his government is dominated by Shia, and the majority \nof the country is Shia. A lot of the people who criticize the war at \nevery possible turn have said that the Shia government in Iraq is doing \nnothing to crack down on the Shia militia. Then when Maliki does it, \nthey promptly rise up and start saying he didn't do it wisely; he \nshould have done it differently.\n  Let's see what General Jack Keane said:\n\n       As impulsive as he was, and while the planning and \n     coordination [of this action to Basra] was inadequate, this \n     is the right course of action. We should not be quick to \n     judge the success of a campaign by the first few days of \n     action when we know this is the beginning of a campaign which \n     will last for months.\n\n  He is talking about a campaign against extremist Shia militia, \nparticularly in the south.\n\n       My view is, the campaign in the south will not be as \n     difficult as the fight against AQI and the Sunni insurgents. \n     Indeed, Maliki's political position has been considerably \n     enhanced because all the major political parties are \n     supporting Maliki against the Sadirists, who are now \n     isolated. In fact, this weekend Maliki announced that you \n     cannot participate in the upcoming elections if your \n     political party has a militia. This had thrown the Sadirists \n     into disarray.\n\n  So I think it is a noteworthy event that Maliki took the central army \nof Iraq, supported as best we could, and sent them off to the south--\nalmost a division--to confront these Shia militia and, as General Keane \nnoted, they can be successful in the long run. It has thrown the \nSadirists into disarray and it has been very popular with the Iraqi \npeople, who would like to see him standing up to these groups, many of \nwhom are associated with Iran. There is a nationalistic mood in the \ncountry of Iraq. They do not want to be dominated by Iran.\n  So General Keane goes on to say this:\n\n       All that said, it is critical to succeed. It is in the U.S. \n     national interests to defeat Iran in Iraq. To do so, we need \n     a U.S. national and regional strategy. . . .\n\n  Many of our colleagues and commentators continue to say, well, yes, \nwe have had some military progress, thank you, General Petraeus and \npeople like you. We congratulate you on your work, but still the \nGovernment of Iraq has shown no political progress. Without political \nprogress, ultimately, we cannot have peace and a progressive Iraq, so \nit is all doomed to failure. You have heard those arguments on \ntelevision all the time, and they are on the floor of the Senate, and \nthey were raised in committee. This is what General Keane said:\n\n       The surge or counter-offensive was always intended to buy \n     time so that the Iraqis could make political and economic \n     progress. This is happening and while there is much to be \n     done, the progress is definable. How can anyone conclude \n     there is no political progress when (1) the Sunnis are \n     reconciling with a Shia dominated government, stopped the \n     violence, and are providing 91,000 of their sons [Sons of \n     Iraq] to assist us? This, after all, was the intent of the \n     much-discussed national legislative benchmarks. (2) As to the \n     benchmarks, we, the United States Government [he was somewhat \n     critical of our Government] ``brow-beated'' the government of \n     Iraq into submitting to a legislative agenda. After we \n     achieved some basic security, the government of Iraq has made \n     impressive political progress--passing 12 of 18 benchmarks \n     and making progress on 5 others. Significantly, 4 out of 6 \n     legislative benchmarks, including deBaathification, amnesty, \n     semi-autonomous regions and provincial powers are passed. Why \n     is it so difficult to acknowledge that both these points, \n     Sunni reconciliation and major national legislation, \n     represent significant political progress?\n\n  I ask my colleagues, why are we in this body not willing to \nacknowledge this is progress? Is it because we are so invested in \npredicting a defeat of our own military that we refuse to acknowledge \nthat progress of unexpected depth and breadth has occurred? It is not \nover yet, I submit. This is a difficult, dangerous situation still. The \nviolence is still about in Iraq; I don't deny that. But it is a 60-\npercent, or more, reduction in less than a year. And huge sections of \nthe country have begun to reconcile, as we hoped and prayed would \noccur.\n\n  We had this talk through the last election. It was a good way to \narticulate it politically. Opponents of the war argued that the only \nthing they understand in the Iraqi Government and the only way they \nwill reconcile and work out their political differences is for us to \ntell them to do so, and if they don't do so, we threaten to pull out \nour troops, regardless of the consequences on the ground, and this will \nmake them more likely to reconcile and be nice to one another. We \nbasically rejected that and we signed on to a new strategy, a \ncounterinsurgency strategy, which we called a surge. What did General \nKeane say about that?\n\n       It is a myth to suggest by withdrawing rapidly, somehow, \n     that will force the Iraqis to make progress they would not \n     make by our presence. Anyone who truly knows the situation in \n     Iraq, and the Iraqi leaders, realizes that it is the American \n     presence that has aided the Iraqis to make the progress they \n     have made and will continue to make. Our encouragement, \n     tough-mindedness, and genuine assistance are major factors in \n     that success. To leave and abandon them forces them into \n     isolation, not reconciliation. It brings out their worst \n     fears, driven by their paranoia about the past, that the \n     Shias are on their own and their enemies are all around. What \n     is needed is our continued, but not open-ended, presence to \n     further our mutual objectives.\n\n  He talked about our force, our military. This is important. This man \nhas given his life to the service of his country. He said this:\n\n       One final point, about our ground forces; not only are they \n     magnificent but are performing to a standard not seen in any \n     previous conflict. They are not a broken force, or near \n     broken. Their discipline, morale, competence, behavior, and \n     courage is extraordinary, and it is so with the knowledge \n     that many of the American people do not support the war, but \n     do support them. Are they stressed, and their loved ones as \n     well, by the repeated deployments? Of course they are. But \n     this is a proud, resilient force that has no quit in it; they \n     have a dogged determination to succeed. We are fighting two \n     wars that are in our national interest [Iraq and Afghanistan] \n     and I have known since \n     9/11, our force, which I was a part of it, was committed to \n     protect the American people by staying on the offense against \n     our enemies. They want to win, and they will; they do not \n     want to be a party to choosing defeat, or to be part of an \n     Army or Marine Corps that suffers a humiliating defeat. That \n     stark reality will break the force. Fighting protracted wars \n     in our history has always stressed our forces. Doing what we \n     can to reduce the impact is critical, but choosing victory \n     is, hands-down, the best answer.\n\n  It was a remarkable bit of testimony, I think, and it came from a man \nwhose credentials are undisputed--a general who was prepared to \ncriticize our tactics when he believes they were in error. He invested \ntime by going there four times to visit this country. He has gone \nthroughout the entire country, and he is in a position to evaluate and \nanalyze whether our new tactics--the surge and counterinsurgency \ntactics General Petraeus has applied--were successful. He said it is \none of the most dramatic turnarounds in the history of warfare, \ncertainly in fighting against an insurgency.\n  We can all disagree about the war and whether we should have gone \nthere, and how we should draw down our troops. But let's not deny that \nwith\n\n[[Page S2797]]\n\nthe courage and fidelity of our military men and women in uniform, they \nhave made dramatic progress in recent months. That progress places us \nin a much better position to secure a very successful outcome in this \neffort.\n  As to those who have opinions about what we should do in Iraq, and \nthey think perhaps the President's ideas or others are not worthy of \nrespect, let me just say it this way: January, a year ago, General \nPetraeus went over to Iraq. Last summer, we funded by an overwhelming \nvote the surge giving General Petraeus additional troops and additional \nauthorities to lead in Iraq. We basically gave General Petraeus a \nchance because things had not been going well and people were very \nworried, and I was one of them.\n  General Petraeus was No. 1 in his class at Command and General Staff \nCollege, received a Ph.D. from Princeton University, commanded the \n101st Airborne Division in Mosul when the war began, and spent a year \nthere. I visited with him there. He came home for a period of time, I \nthink less than a year. He was asked to go back and train the Iraqi \nmilitary. I visited him in Baghdad when he was doing that. Following \nthat tour, he came home and he wrote the Defense Department manual on \nhow to confront and defeat an insurgency, and before the ink was dry on \nthat manual we asked him to go back and lead that effort.\n  I would say we have never had a better prepared general for the \ncomplex military and political situation such as we face in Iraq. There \nhas been a dramatic improvement under his leadership. That is \nindisputable.\n  General Petraeus testified yesterday, and this is basically what he \nsaid: I have drawn down the surge numbers. We will have those numbers \ncompletely drawn down by this summer. So our troop levels will be back \nto where they were before the surge occurred. I think, it is my best \nmilitary judgment--my best military judgment--that we ought to pause \nfor a while, and not immediately continue to draw down--and not for a \nyear, just for a matter of months--and make sure we don't go so fast in \nour withdrawal that we destabilize the progress we have made because \nmuch of the progress is fragile. It could fall back if we don't conduct \nourselves properly. That is what he asked us to do.\n  We have political generals, we have commentators on television who \nlike to talk, and on the radio, but I will tell you who has earned my \nrespect. General Petraeus. If he says, after all this effort and all \nthe commitment of this Nation, that he needs a few months of pause \nbefore we begin to draw down again, then I think we ought to give it to \nhim. Who is prepared to dispute that? If we don't support that, what we \nare saying is we think we know better than General Petraeus. General \nKeane says it is the finest military team he has ever seen assembled in \nhis 40 years in the military.\n  I made the mistake of saying that General Petraeus--because I visited \nhim over there, I knew this was his third tour in Iraq--that he had \nserved 3 years in the war on terror. A little later it came up again. \nHe said: Since 2001, I have been deployed 4\\1/2\\ years.\n  I remember when he went this time. He was asked to go. He believed he \ncould make a difference. He believed he owed it to his country to give \nit his best shot. I am sure he felt a burden--people said he was the \nbest person we had to lead our troops--to try to fulfill the request of \nhis country. He left his family again to place his life at risk and to \nserve our country in Iraq.\n  I think his advice has been proven correct repeatedly, and I believe \nwe ought to give him this chance to succeed. I agree with General Keane \nthat nothing would be more corrosive of a fabulous military than to \nhave all their sacrifice, all their efforts, the loss of life, the \ninjuries sustained among the brotherhood of the military, to have all \nthat thrown away by a precipitous political pullback. What will the \nmilitary think the next time we ask them to go somewhere?\n  I have to tell you, Mr. President, I think we were far too optimistic \nabout creating a government in a country that has never had a \nlegitimate government, that has no experience, and no history with it. \nWe thought it was far easier than it turned out to be. We thought and \ndid not fully comprehend, as General Keane indicated, the depth of the \nopposition that rose up after the initial successful invasion. Our \nmilitary was smaller than we needed. Now we know, and perhaps we should \nhave known earlier.\n  We have made some mistakes. It has not been a perfect operation, that \nis for sure. I respect people who disagree with what I have said. Good \npeople can disagree. I am not questioning their patriotism. However, \nlogic, common sense, and a commitment to the men and women who have \ngone out and served us so well, to me, makes it pretty easy to say we \nshould support General Petraeus's reasonable request that the continued \ndrawdown pause for a while before resuming, and we should support it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4429\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak \nagainst amendment No. 4429, which has been offered by my good friend, \nSenator Alexander from Tennessee. Senator Alexander's amendment would \nslash the wind tax credit in half and would curtail the wind energy \ndevelopment for the State of Colorado and for the Nation.\n  All across America, what we see today is great enthusiasm for the \npossibility of renewable energy. It is driven, in my view, in a very \ndifferent way, with a robust look at renewable energy as a way forward. \nIn the 1970s, Richard Nixon coined the term ``energy independence'' \nafter OPEC was formed. Then Jimmy Carter talked to the Nation about the \nimportance of energy independence that we needed to embrace with the \nmoral imperative of a war. Yet through the eighties, through the \nnineties, through the beginning of this century, we did not, frankly, \nlive up to their vision or to that promise of energy independence. In \nfact, we went the other way. And in going the other way, what has \nhappened is we have compromised our national security with our \naddiction to oil that we import from other countries to where in March \nof 2007 we imported 67 percent of our oil from foreign countries.\n  We compromise our environmental security as we see what is happening \naround our planet with the danger of global warming and the \nconsequences it will bring to this planet and to this generation and to \ngenerations to come. And we have lost our way forward in terms of \ncreating economic opportunities in America because what has happened is \nthe technology we developed in America, such as the technology from the \nNational Renewable Lab in Golden, CO, has, in fact, been taken by other \ncountries--Spain, Germany, and other countries--and they have developed \na very strong energy renewable economy.\n  When we talk about renewable energy, I agree very much with my \ncolleagues on both the Democratic and Republican sides who have said we \nneed to embrace the renewable energy future of America with an ethic \nthat is a sustainable ethic, with the sense that we are here to do \neverything we possibly can, and we cannot do this by fits and starts. \nWhen we look at wind energy, it seems to me we need to come together to \nsupport the future of wind energy in America.\n  In my State of Colorado, we are seeing a virtual revolution occurring \nin terms of what is happening with wind energy. In 2004, there was \nhardly any wind generation taking place in my State of Colorado. I \nremember going across the eastern plains during my campaign for the \nSenate and then following that time, my visit to all 64 counties in the \nState and talking about how renewable energy would open a whole new \nchapter in rural America, would help us in so many ways to address the \nfundamental issues of our time.\n  Since 2004, my State of Colorado has moved to the point where we are \nabout to produce 1,000 megawatts of electrical power a year in the \nState of Colorado--1,000 megawatts of electrical power--by harnessing \nthe power of the wind. It would take much longer than 3\n\n[[Page S2798]]\n\nyears to permit a coal-fired powerplant, and 1,000 megawatts represent \nthe energy that would be generated from three coal-fired powerplants.\n  I don't have anything against coal, as my friend from Pennsylvania \nknows. We need to have coal some way as part of our portfolio of \nenergies as we move forward, but we need to embrace the renewable \nenergies we know are now on the market and make these initiatives of \nrenewable energy sustainable over a long period of time.\n  Many projects are depending on our extension of the production tax \ncredit and the investment tax credit. These tax credits are very \nimportant. I will be supporting Senator Cantwell's and Senator Ensign's \namendment later on in the vote we will be having.\n  A recent study by Navigant Consulting indicates that failing to \nextend the investment tax credit could result in the withdrawal of \nnearly $19 billion in capital investment in solar and wind. That would \nresult in a loss of 116,000 jobs in 2009, including 10,600 jobs in the \nState of Colorado.\n  Over the last several weeks, the last 2 months on the floor of the \nSenate, we have talked about the economic situation in which we find \nourselves. We said what we have to do is stimulate the economy and do \nsome things that make sure the economy doesn't go further in the ditch. \nThere are some who say we are already in the ditch. Alan Greenspan said \nyesterday he thought we were already in a recession. We need to do what \nwe can to make sure that ditch is not too deep so we cannot find our \nway out.\n  One of those ways is making sure we are stimulating the economy in \nways that work. When we talk about production tax credits and \ninvestment tax credits, that essentially will make sure we have these \n116,000 jobs created in America. It is something we should very much \nsupport.\n  Congress has looked at the PTC and the ITC in fits and starts. It was \nfirst created to expire at the end of 1999, again in 2001, and again in \n2003. We need to stop those fits and starts, and we need to be more \npersistent than consistent with respect to these investments.\n  Currently, the wind production tax credit has a value of 2 cents per \nkilowatt hour. The credit is scheduled to expire in 2008. Senator \nAlexander's amendment would cut the credit for wind to just 1 cent per \nkilowatt hour. That, in my view, is headed in the wrong direction. \nSenator Alexander argues that the wind energy receives special \ntreatment and argues fossil energy has received some credit but that we \nshould back down on the credits we are giving to wind energy.\n  What this chart will show is that what we are doing in terms of tax \nincentives, as well as in research and development expenditures out of \nthe Federal Government, is not at all skewed toward renewable energies. \nIn fact, it is skewed to fossil fuels. You will see that in tax \nexpenditures, in the year 2007 in billions of dollars, fossil fuel \nreceived $13.7 billion of the expenditures that we were making through \nthe incentives we are creating for oil, gas, coal, and other fossil \nfuels. But we were putting $13.7 billion into fossil fuels to help us \nwith our energy independence, where we were only putting $2.8 billion \ninto renewables. That is a stark contrast as to where we should be \ngoing if we are to get to energy independence for national security and \nenvironmental reasons.\n\n  When you look at research and development, these are the figures from \nthe Department of Energy out of a General Accounting study which was \nrequested by Senator Alexander in 2007. We see that, in billions of \ndollars, the Department of Energy spent only $1.4 billion on \nrenewables, but at the same time the Department of Energy spent $3.1 \nbillion, three times as much, on fossil fuels, and $6.2 billion on \nnuclear.\n  So when we talk about harnessing the power of the wind, the power of \nthe Sun, the power of biofuels as we grow our way to energy \nindependence, in my view, we need to have some more balance. We need to \nput more into the renewable energy future of our country.\n  We have, as a Nation, starting over a century ago, made major \ninvestments in helping the fossil fuels industry. What this chart will \nshow is, beginning in 1916, we created this laundry list of tax \nincentives for exploration of oil and gas and for the production of oil \nand gas and coal. Also, beginning in 1957, we made major incentives for \nnuclear. Yet we see the very few incentives we have instituted with \nrespect to wind, which did not start until 1992. So this chart reflects \nthere is a lot of catching up to do if we are to do everything we can \nas a Nation to harness the energy of the wind.\n  I am hopeful, therefore, my colleagues will vote no on the Alexander \namendment because the wind energy future of our Nation is very \ndependent on our continuing to sustain a policy over a longer period of \ntime so we get the wind energy industry up and running in America. It \nis also, in my view, important we support the amendment of Senators \nCantwell and Ensign, with respect to energy tax credits, because we \nneed to make sure those do not expire, and right now they are on the \nverge of expiring.\n  I would hope, as we move forward in dealing with tax incentives and \nother issues in the Congress, we will be able to find a way to extend \nthem beyond the end of 2008.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Alexander amendment, and I \nurge my colleagues to vote yes on the Cantwell-Ensign amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and to call up amendment No. 4501.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, I am shocked, shocked to hear an objection from the \nSenator on this very reasonable request to call up an amendment so this \nbill, which is a fairly significant bill, could be voted on by the \nSenate in parts, because there are some parts of this bill which aren't \nthat good, and this amendment addresses one of those parts. \nSpecifically, this amendment says the net operating loss carry-forward \nprovisions, which cost $17 billion over the first 3 years of this bill, \nwould be eliminated. There are already in law net operating loss \nprovisions. What this bill does, however, regrettably, is expand those \nprovisions dramatically and benefits one small segment of our \ncommercial society, to the disadvantage of other segments of our \ncommercial society and to the distinct disadvantage of our children and \nour children's children who have to pay for all the money that is going \nto be spent in the area of a tax credit or deduction.\n  This $17 billion will go to benefit the same industry, or part of the \nindustry, which created the problem which this stimulus package is \ntrying to address. It is a lot like that story of the fellow who shot \nboth his parents and then threw himself on the court and asked for \nmercy because he was an orphan. What we have is the housing \nindustry requesting a $17 billion tax break specifically for them \nbecause they created an economic meltdown by speculatively building \nthousands of houses--thousands more than we needed--and then selling \nthose houses to people through the subprime mortgage process, which \nturned out to be a very poor idea for many people who bought houses \nwith a subprime mortgage.\n\n  At the time these housing construction industry companies did this, \nthey made a lot of money--a lot of money. Now they are losing money. \nAnd they are saying, with a straight face, in this bill: We need a $17 \nbillion tax break, which allows us to go back and eliminate the taxes \nwe paid on the profit we made during the good days of the housing \nbubble and get a tax rebate to reflect the fact that we are losing \nmoney today, which recovers the taxes we paid 3 and 4 years ago. How \noutrageous is that?\n  In addition, of course, housing contractors who were responsible--and \nwho during this period of the bubble did not overbill or did not overly \nutilize subprime mortgages but, rather, built in a reasonable manner \nand are still doing well and are still making money--are going to find \nthat their competitor down the street--who was potentially excessive, \nbuilding a lot of inventory that was not necessary, selling it through \nsubprime mortgages and then finding they are stuck with it today and \nthus losing money today--is going to get a tax benefit representing\n\n[[Page S2799]]\n\n$17 billion. So the contractor who actually has been responsible and \nhas run their business in probably a conservative and constructive way \nis going to have to compete with the profligate contractor, \npotentially, who is losing money but is suddenly going to get a huge \nwindfall as a result of this bill in the way of a tax rebate. Where is \nthe fairness in that?\n  In addition, of course, it undermines the whole concept of the free \nmarketplace. I mean, the marketplace says: If you take a risk and you \nmake an investment and you make a lot of money--which is what happened \nhere--and then that risk turns out to turn on you and you start to lose \nmoney, the Government shouldn't come in and say: Oh, that is okay, we \nare going to insure your losses with a tax break--which is essentially \nwhat is happening. We are going to insure them to the extent of $17 \nbillion over the next 2 years.\n  That is not a capitalist system. That is a French system. That is \nsort of modified socialism. It essentially says: You can't lose. You \ncan go out and make money, and if you start to lose money, we will give \nyou a tax credit. So the American taxpayers get to pay so you don't \nlose money.\n  Then who pays for all this? Who pays for this $17 billion? Well, \nthese folks sitting right down here--the pages--will pay for this. We \nare not going to pay for it this year. We are not offsetting this cost. \nThis goes on the national debt. Interest will accrue on it. When these \nyoung pages graduate from high school and then move on to college--and \nI know they are all going to go to college--and then they move out of \ncollege and start to get a job, you know what they will have to do? \nThey will have to pay taxes, and part of the taxes they are going to be \npaying 8, 9, 10 years from now is going to go to pay for this tax \ndeduction which we are passing today to benefit an industry which \ncreated the bubble, which created a recession. We are giving them this \ntype of insurance through this type of tax break. That is not fair.\n  It is not fair to the next generation to pass this bill on to them. \nIt is not fair to competitors who were conservative and managed their \nbusinesses well, that we are going to give this tax break to people who \nwere not so successful or were successful but today aren't doing well. \nIt doesn't make any sense. It is almost a bill of attainder. It should \nbe unconstitutional--the idea we are going to pass a tax that benefits \nthis one segment of the industry.\n  By the way, it is not going to stimulate the economy because most of \nthis benefit is going to probably come to fruition after the recession \nis pretty much over. Probably not before the third or fourth quarter of \nthis year and into next year will these dollars start to reflow into \nthese industries. So as a practical matter, most economists are saying \nthat to the extent we have a recession--and I happen to believe we have \none--it is going to be shallow and short, which means it will probably \nbe over. With all the Fed is doing, I think it will definitely be over \nby the end of this year, at the latest. So this makes no sense.\n  At the minimum, the Senate should at least have the right to vote on \nthis policy. I mean, why not at least have a vote on this policy? It is \na huge piece of policy, by the way. It seems to me we should have the \nright to have a vote on this policy. So all I have asked for is not \nthat we accept the ideas I have put on the table, which is that this \ntax benefit makes no sense economically, that it makes no sense from \nthe standpoint of a capitalist system, it makes no sense from the \nstandpoint of the debt to pass on to our children, and it makes no \nsense from the standpoint that the people who are benefitting from this \ntax benefit were the biggest beneficiaries from the runup of the \nspeculative market. I am not saying people have to accept those \narguments, although I find them logical, reasonable, and I hope most \npeople would accept them. I am saying let's vote on them. Let us have a \nvote on whether those arguments make more sense or the idea of putting \nthis tax benefit in this bill makes more sense.\n  So that is why I have asked, on a number of occasions, for a vote on \nthis item. I regret that there has been an objection, on occasion, to \nmy request for this amendment to be brought up. I am tempted to renew \nthat request at this time, but I sense somebody else might object--this \ntime probably from the audience, as the last objection came from staff. \nBut in any event, I can appreciate the fact that there would be an \nobjection, so I will not raise it again. I will simply reflect the fact \nthat I have made this point, and hopefully at some point there will be \na relenting on the other side of the aisle to having a vote on this \nitem.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           2008 Olympic Games\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern about the \nChinese Government's continued human rights violations and to urge \nPresident Bush not to attend the opening ceremonies at the Olympic \nGames in Beijing this summer.\n  The Chinese Government's unwillingness to acknowledge or address \ntheir record of human rights violations is in direct conflict to the \nspirit of the Olympic Games, and the United States should not accede to \nthe Chinese Government with our attendance.\n  The recent developments in Tibet, in which Buddhist monks and other \nethnic Tibetans were violently punished, and in some cases killed, for \nparticipating in protests, are disturbing and should be unacceptable to \nanyone who believes in basic human freedoms. Furthermore, these \ndevelopments also seem to confirm that the Chinese Government, which \nhas long disrespected the rights of its citizens, under the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, has failed to sufficiently improve its \nconduct when confronted with citizens who happen to voice a difference \nin opinion.\n  We believe--I think many of us believe--that the President's \nattendance at the opening ceremonies, rightly or not, would send the \nimplicit message to the world that the United States condones the \nintolerance that has been demonstrated by these actions of the Chinese \nGovernment.\n  The Chinese Government was awarded the Olympic Games on the \nunderstanding that it would work to significantly improve its human \nrights record. Clearly--clearly--it has not. In fact, its actions are \ncompletely contradictory to the Olympic spirit.\n  Let me highlight two specific points in the Olympic Charter's \nFundamental Principles of Olympism. It says:\n\n       The goal of Olympism is to place sport at the service of \n     the harmonious development of man, with a view to promoting a \n     peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human \n     dignity.\n\n  The other principle that is on point here:\n\n       Any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a \n     person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or \n     otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic \n     Movement.\n\n  ``Incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement.''\n  The Chinese Government blatantly violates both of these points.\n  Some have made the argument that the President's attendance at the \nopening ceremonies is more about support for the Games themselves than \nfor the host country. I believe it is all to the contrary. It would \nshow tremendous support and respect for the Games and the spirit they \nembody, and these principles that are part of the Olympic Charter, to \ntake a stand against a host nation that flagrantly disrespects that \nspirit.\n  We remind the President that the recent developments in Tibet are \nonly the latest chapter in a long history of Chinese human rights \nconcerns. Even in the midst of the latest atrocities against Tibetans, \nwe should not forget the Chinese Government's continued unwillingness \nto use all of its unique leverage--unique leverage--with the Sudanese \nregime to assist the international effort to bring an end to the \ngenocide in Darfur. This issue remains\n\n[[Page S2800]]\n\nof serious concern to us and many others who have not seen the \nimprovements in Darfur that we had hoped would have happened long ago.\n  If we were languishing in the camps in Darfur, as the world watches \ngenocide, if we see human rights violations in China against the \nTibetans, if we see prison camp labor, child labor, forced abortions, \nthe exiling of the Dalai Lama, and so, so much more, who among us, if \nwe were in their position, would be content with the counsels of \npatience and delay? Who among us would be content with the silence that \nexists in this respect? And who among us would not want to see a world \nleader, a leader of the free world, make a very powerful statement to \nensure that we move in a different direction?\n  If the Chinese Government is ever to treat its people with basic \nhuman rights, it must be sent a bold and clear message that its record \nof violence and suppression is completely unacceptable.\n  Few actions can speak louder than if the President of the United \nStates were to condemn the Chinese human rights record with the entire \nworld watching. It is at the moment of the opening ceremonies where the \nworld's attention is riveted on the Olympic Games--it is at the opening \nceremonies where the world's attention is riveted on the Olympic \nGames--and not attending, refusing to attend, the opening ceremonies \nwould accomplish exactly that: a clear condemnation of China's human \nrights record.\n  We hope the President will agree with us, that the Chinese \nGovernment's actions are unacceptable, and that we must send a bold \nmessage now while the world--while the world--is focused on China.\n  China wanted the Olympic Games. It got it with the understanding \nthat, in fact, it would dramatically improve its human rights record. \nIt has not. The world has seen its repressive nature. If we go on as if \nnothing had happened, we will send a message that impunity is, in fact, \nsomething that is tolerated by the rest of the world.\n  I do not believe Americans want to see that happen. I believe the \nprinciple of the Olympic Charter that clearly says, ``Any form of \ndiscrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of \n[their] race, religion, politics, gender . . . is incompatible with \nbelonging to the Olympic Movement'' is something worthy of sustaining, \nand this is an opportunity in time and history to make that principle \nring loudly and clearly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4419\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes on an \namendment I have offered with Senator Cantwell regarding renewable \nenergy. It is amendment No. 4419. I don't know whether it is going to \nbe voted on tonight or tomorrow. Either way, I wish to spend a few \nminutes on this particular amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some letters of \nsupport from various industries.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    April 3, 2008.\n       Dear Senator: As a coalition of businesses, environmental \n     organizations, investors, labor, nongovernmental \n     organizations, public health organizations, religious \n     organizations, states, trade associations and utilities, we \n     urge you to pass bipartisan legislation as soon as possible \n     that extends federal tax incentives for energy efficiency and \n     renewable energy technologies and consumer purchases of \n     energy efficient products. These critically important \n     incentives have expired or will expire at the end of this \n     year and must be extended immediately to avoid significant \n     harm to the developing clean energy industries in the United \n     States.\n       We urge extension of the renewable energy production tax \n     credit, clean renewable energy bonds, efficient commercial \n     buildings tax deduction, investment tax credit for solar \n     electric and fuel cell systems, tax credit for energy \n     efficiency upgrades to existing homes, tax credits for the \n     production of efficient home appliances, and tax credit for \n     construction of efficient new homes. These incentives play a \n     vital role in reducing global warming pollution, creating new \n     high-wage American jobs, spurring economic growth, promoting \n     consumer purchases of energy efficient products, and saving \n     consumers and businesses money on their energy bills.\n       It is essential for the development of clean technology \n     industries that extensions of the efficiency and renewable \n     energy tax incentives remain effective for multiple years. \n     Congress has historically extended the clean energy \n     incentives in one or two-year increments, which creates a \n     boom-bust cycle for the technologies covered by the \n     incentives. This cycle undermines the efficient development \n     of the clean energy technology industries into mature \n     industries.\n       It is critical for the sustained development of the clean \n     energy technology industries that efficiency and renewable \n     energy tax incentives be promptly extended. The delay in \n     extending these provisions is already discouraging investment \n     decisions today for clean energy projects that will be \n     completed in 2009 or later. According to a recent study by \n     Navigant Consulting, failure to promptly extend renewable \n     energy tax incentives places at risk 116,000 jobs in the wind \n     and solar industries and more than $19 billion in clean \n     energy investment. Similarly, more than 800 megawatts of \n     renewable biomass electrical generation in development has \n     been placed on hold because the renewable production tax \n     credit has not been extended according to biomass industry \n     estimates.\n       America is on the cusp of a new, clean energy economy. \n     Extending efficiency and renewable energy tax incentives is \n     critical to promoting the transition to this economy. They \n     will help get us started on solving the global warming \n     problem, reduce energy prices for consumers, and create new \n     high-wage jobs. We urge you to do everything you can to \n     ensure prompt passage of legislation with significant \n     bipartisan support that adopts long-term extensions of the \n     efficiency and renewable energy tax incentives and can be \n     enacted into law this spring.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE).\n       AES Wind Generation.\n       Airevolution Wind Energy Systems, LLC.\n       Akeena Solar.\n       Alaska Wind Power, LLC.\n       Alliance to Save Energy.\n       Alliant Energy Corporation.\n       Alternative Fuels Renewable Energies Council.\n       Ameren Corporation.\n       The American Agriculture Movement, Inc.\n       American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE).\n       The American Institute of Architects (AIA).\n       American Solar Energy Society.\n       American Wind Energy Association (AWEA).\n       Applied Materials.\n       Apricus Inc.\n       Arizona Public Service.\n       Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM).\n       Audubon.\n       Ausra, Inc.\n       AWS Truewind, LLC.\n       Babcock & Brown.\n       Ballard Power Systems.\n       Best Buy Co., Inc.\n       Bio-A.I.R.E., LLC.\n       BioEconomy Development Corporation.\n       BioEnergy Development, LLC.\n       Bloom Energy.\n       BOSCH.\n       BrightSource Energy, Inc.\n       Broadwind Energy, Inc.\n       Business Council for Sustainable Energy.\n       California Energy Commission.\n       Cardinal Fastener & Specialty.\n       CCIM Institute.\n       Center for Energy and Environmental Sustainability at James \n     Madison University.\n       Central Vermont Public Service.\n       CH Energy.\n       Chirag Bator.\n       Clipper Windpower, Inc.\n       Clyde Industrial, LLC.\n       Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life (COEJL).\n       Competitive Power Ventures, Inc.\n       Conergy.\n       Constellation Energy.\n       Converteam Inc.\n       Dakota Resource Council.\n       Dakota Rural Action.\n       D.H.

cusp of a new, clean energy economy. \n     Extending the efficiency and renewable energy tax incentives \n     is critical to promoting the transition to this clean energy \n     future. But these important incentives have expired or will \n     expire at the end of this year and must be extended \n     immediately to avoid significant harm to the developing clean \n     energy industries in the United States. These incentives play \n     a vital role in reducing global warming pollution, creating \n     new high-wage American jobs, spurring economic growth, \n     promoting consumer purchases of energy efficient products, \n     and saving consumers and businesses money on their energy \n     bills.\n       We, the undersigned, representing a broad coalition of \n     organizations and businesses, urge you to pass with \n     significant bi-partisan support the Clean Energy Tax Stimulus \n     Act introduced by Senators Cantwell and Ensign.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Please Support S. 2821, the Clean Energy Stimulus Act of 2008\n\n     Members of the United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC, April 4, 2008.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to urge you to cosponsor and \n     support passage of S. 2821, the Clean Energy Stimulus Act of \n     2008. This legislation extends vitally important federal tax \n     incentives for wind, geothermal, biomass, solar power, \n     qualified hydropower, and other renewable energy technologies \n     that expire this year. An immediate extension of renewable \n     energy tax incentives is critical for sustaining one of the \n     most rapidly expanding areas of the American economy.\n       The delay in extending renewable tax incentives is already \n     discouraging investment decisions today for clean energy \n     projects that will be completed in 2009 or later. According \n     to a recent study by Navigant Consulting, failure to promptly \n     extend renewable energy tax incentives places at risk 116,000 \n     jobs in the wind and solar industries and more than $19 \n     billion in clean energy investment.\n       Prompt action to extend renewable tax incentives is \n     critical to continuing the economic growth and high-wage jobs \n     associated with the rapid growth of wind and solar power, and \n     to helping reduce global warming pollution even as we meet \n     increasing electricity demand.\n       Please do all you can to support S. 2821.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alliant Energy.\n       American Wind Energy Association.\n       Alyra Renewable Energy Finance, LLC.\n       Babcock & Brown.\n       Bluewater Wind.\n       Broadwind.\n       CAB Inc.\n       Catamount Energy Corporation.\n       Clipper Windpower Development Company, Inc.\n       Columbia Energy Partners LLC.\n       Competitive Power Ventures, Inc.\n       D.H.

Ensign \n     to H.R. 3221, the ``Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008.''\n       The Chamber believes it is in the national interest to \n     promote the responsible use of all energy sources. To reach \n     this goal, government and business should support investment \n     in new technologies that expand alternative energy and enable \n     traditional sources of energy to be used more cleanly and \n     efficiently. Extension of the incentives in S. 2821 will go a \n     long way toward the development of the renewable and \n     alternative energy technologies essential to our nation's \n     energy future.\n       Congress must be mindful, however, not to merely stop at \n     renewables. Many of the incentives extended by S. 2821 were \n     included in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct), a \n     comprehensive energy policy bill largely overlooked scarcely \n     more than two years after its enactment. EPAct contains \n     nearly 70 provisions that require federal agencies to \n     undertake research, development and demonstration of new \n     technologies, to engage in public/private partnerships, or to \n     make available financial incentives to the private sector for \n     the development of these new technologies. Presently, a \n     significant number of the nearly 70 new energy technology and \n     efficiency directives are unfunded, under-funded, or simply \n     not implemented at all.\n       The Chamber supports Sen. Ensign's amendment, and urges \n     Congress not only to extend the incentives specified in that \n     bill, but to fully fund and implement all of the energy \n     technology and efficiency directives enacted by EPAct.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R.

Maria Cantwell,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Ensign,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Cantwell and Ensign: I write to thank you for \n     introducing the Clean Energy Tax Stimulus Act of 2008. This \n     bipartisan legislation seeks to extend federal tax incentives \n     for energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies and \n     consumer purchases of energy efficient products. These \n     critically important incentives have expired or will expire \n     at the end of this year and must be extended immediately to \n     maximize energy savings for consumers and businesses to help \n     reduce greenhouse gas emissions in communities across the \n     United States.\n       The Retail Industry Leaders Association, RILA, promotes \n     consumer choice and economic freedom through public policy \n     and industry operational excellence. Its members include the \n     largest and fastest growing companies in the retail \n     industry--retailers, product manufacturers, and service \n     suppliers--which together account for more than $1.5 trillion \n     in annual sales. RILA members provide millions of jobs and \n     operate more than 100,000 stores, manufacturing facilities \n     and distribution centers domestically and abroad.\n       RILA and our member companies are committed to \n     environmental sustainability. We applaud the bill's \n     particular provisions that extend tax incentives for \n     investments in solar technology; construction of ``green'' \n     commercial buildings; and consumer purchases of energy \n     efficient products to improve their homes.\n       We look forward to working with you to pass this \n     legislation on a strong bipartisan basis toward the path of \n     extending the efficiency and renewable energy tax incentives \n     for enactment into law this spring.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Faith A. Cristol,\n     Vice President, Workforce & Tax.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   The Real Estate Roundtable,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 2008.\n       To All United States Senators: The Real Estate Roundtable \n     urges your support for S. 2821, The Clean Tax Stimulus Act of \n     2008. Sponsored by Senators Cantwell and Ensign and \n     cosponsored by 31 other Senators, this narrowly tailored bill \n     extends essential energy tax provisions facing expiration.\n       This bill is being offered as Amendment #4419 to the \n     housing stimulus bill H.R. 3221. Passing this amendment will \n     encourage a dialogue between the Senate and the House \n     regarding the timely disposition of these important policies. \n     We urge you to cosponsor the bill and support the amendment.\n       The Roundtable particularly supports two provisions in the \n     bill: (1) a one year extension of the Section 179 deduction \n     for energy efficient commercial buildings and the \n     modification to increase the entire building deduction to \n     $2.25 per square foot and to $.75 per square foot for the \n     partial building deduction; and (2) an eight extension of the \n     30 percent business tax credit for solar energy and fuel \n     cells.\n       Ideally, a much longer extension of the Section 179 energy \n     efficient building deduction should be enacted given the long \n     lead time involved with the design, development and \n     construction of commercial buildings.\n       Increased investment in energy efficient technologies--\n     including building technologies--has special significance to \n     our industry. Roundtable members have been leaders in \n     advancing the state of the art as it relates to the \n     development and operation of energy efficient ``high \n     performance'' buildings. The energy efficient building \n     deduction and the solar and fuel cell credit are important \n     tools in allowing our members to continue this leadership \n     role.\n       Failure to enact these extensions would mean losing the \n     economic benefit provided by the alternative energy and \n     energy efficiency industries. Further, it would hinder the \n     development and deployment of energy efficient technologies \n     and alternative energy production. The economic and \n     environmental benefits spurred by these tax incentives would \n     provide a meaningful offset to the bill's revenue cost.\n       If you or your staff has any questions, please contact \n     Roundtable Senior Vice President and Counsel Steve Renna \n     (srenna@rer.org).\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Jeffrey D. DeBoer,\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, over the last several weeks Senator \nCantwell and I worked together in a bipartisan fashion to craft a \nrenewable energy package that would break the gridlock that has \nhappened here in the Senate. There have been several good faith \nattempts to pass a renewable energy bill, but frankly, several of us, \nincluding myself, have objected to some of what are called offsets, the \n``pay-fors'' in the bill.\n  I believe very strongly in renewable energy but also know that this \ncountry will be dependent on fossil fuels for the next 20 to 30 years. \nWe need more domestic supplies of fossil fuels and less reliance on \nforeign sources of fossil fuels.\n  In the package that was put before us, tax incentives were going to \nbe taken away from people who explore for domestic sources of fossil \nfuels. That was the reason I opposed the original renewable energy \npackage.\n  Senator Cantwell and I, along with our staffs, got together over the \nlast several weeks and came up with a compromising provision that has \nno offsets. We encourage the continued development of solar, wind, \ngeothermal, and biomass energies. There are several renewable energies \nout there and all kinds of new technologies that are coming on line. \nThe more private investment and innovation that we have, the more \nalternatives and renewable energies we will see come into the U.S. \nmarkets. This will insure that we are responsible to the environment \nand to our economy by creating innovative new jobs and less dependent \non foreign sources of energy. This is the reason\n\n[[Page S2803]]\n\nSenator Cantwell and I have come together in a bipartisan fashion to \nsay, ``Let's break this logjam in the Senate. Let's make sure we get \nthis bill passed so it can be signed into law.''\n  What we have today in front of us is a housing bill which will help \nstimulate the economy. Everyone knows the economy is being dragged down \nby the subprime mortgage market crisis we are facing in America. My \nState leads the Nation in foreclosure rates. It is dragging the rest of \nthe Nevada economy down in what appeared to be a recession-proof \neconomy. We need this housing bill. We need to do things that will help \nbring our economy out of the doldrums it is in.\n  This energy package we have put together is also stimulative. It will \npreserve the jobs that have already been created, as well as create \nmore jobs and help the economy.\n  I believe strongly, for many different reasons, that this amendment \nwill help the economy, it will help our environment, and it will help \nmake us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy. For those \nreasons, I would encourage my colleagues to support our amendment.\n  Senator Alexander is offering a second-degree amendment that I \nbelieve will gut our amendment and will break apart this bipartisan \ncoalition we have put together. It is his right to offer a second-\ndegree amendment and he will speak in defense of it. But, I am going to \nencourage our colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, if you want a \nrenewable energy bill, to oppose the Alexander amendment and to support \nthe Ensign-Cantwell amendment on renewable energy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his \ncomments, and I thank him for his effort. He and the Senator from \nWashington, Ms. Cantwell, are making a constructive effort to give \nFederal support for emerging renewable energy. Clean renewable energy \nis very important for our country. I have a chart here which lists the \nsources of renewable electricity qualified to receive the production \ntax credit. This production tax credit is the subject, in part, of the \nEnsign-Cantwell amendment No. 4419. But what Senator Kyl and I have is \na second-degree amendment No. 4429 that we will offer when the Ensign-\nCantwell amendment comes up, which is a way to improve that amendment.\n  Basically, what we have been hearing from entrepreneurs and those who \nare inventing new technologies, which would help reduce our dependence \non fossil fuels, is: We need some certainty in whatever support you \ngive us from the Federal Government. The Ensign-Cantwell amendment \nwould--the first part of it--would allocate about $3 billion to the \nproduction tax credit for 1 more year. It would extend the ability of \nrenewable electricity to qualify for the production tax credit. What we \nwould say is, let's do that for 2 more years. I will explain that in \njust a minute.\n  One might say: Well, how are you going to pay for that? The way we \nwould propose paying for it is to put wind in the same category as \nemerging renewable energies, make it also available for a 1-cent \nsubsidy per kilowatt hour, and that amount of money alone would make it \npossible for us to have a 2-year extension of the production tax credit \nat the same cost that Senator Ensign and Senator Cantwell propose in \ntheir amendment.\n  Now, let me explain what I mean by that. But first, our goal with the \nAlexander-Kyl amendment would be to extend the production tax credit \nfor 2 years, to focus it on emerging renewable electricity \ntechnologies, to focus it on those that have a capacity for supplying \nbaseload electricity; in other words, electricity production that we \ncan rely on all day and all night. If you want to turn your light on in \nthe middle of the night or operate your computer at 4 p.m., whether the \nsun is shining or the wind is blowing, you need reliable sources of \nbaseload electricity, and we would like to treat all of these energies \nfairly.\n\n  Here is what the law now does and has done since 1992. It pays the \nproducer of this kind of electricity, renewable electricity, 2 cents \nper kilowatt hour for the electricity it produces. Right now, the 2 \ncents is going to closed-loop biomass and to geothermal; that is heat \ncoming out of the ground and is being converted into clean electricity. \nIt used to go to solar, but that was removed in 2005, and it goes to \nwind today. So those three--closed-loop biomass, geothermal, and wind--\nall get 2 cents per kilowatt hour. These other emerging technologies on \nthis side of the chart just get 1 cent per kilowatt hour.\n  What we propose to do is move wind from the two-cent category to the \none-cent category. Wind would still get 1 cent per kilowatt hour. It \nwould end up getting more of the money than any of these others, but it \nwould focus more of the dollars in the Cantwell-Ensign bill on emerging \nbaseload energy by providing more time for these to be developed.\n  Now, that is not as complicated as it sounds. Let me try to say why \nit is necessary to do this. Most of the speeches we hear around here \nabout the production tax credit say: Oh, we need to have renewable \nenergy. We need to have everything. We need to have biomass. We need to \nhave small irrigation power. We need to have landfill gas. We need to \nhave trash combustion, qualified hydropower, and now wave and tidal. \nThat is new. That is when you put a turbine in the East River in New \nYork City and the water turns the turbines instead of the wind. It \nturns out there is more power in the water. In fact, it destroyed the \nturbines, so they are going to have to start over again. But these are \nemerging experimental technologies. So we say on the Senate floor that \nwe are going to have all of these renewable generating sources, but the \nfact is we don't do that.\n  We are now committed to $11.5 billion in tax expenditures, according \nto the Joint Tax Committee, on wind power alone over the next 10 \nyears--$11.5 billion on wind power alone. By adopting the Ensign-\nCantwell amendment, based on my best estimates, we would add another $3 \nbillion over the next 10 years to wind alone, and almost none of it \nwould go over here to these other renewable electricity technologies. \nNow, why would I say that? It is because a new report by the Energy \nInformation Administration, which I requested in May 2007 and received \nthis week, said that wind power accounted for 97 percent of the total \nrenewable electricity production tax credit in fiscal year 2007. Now, \nSenator Bingaman said earlier when we debated the Energy bill in June \n2007 that he relied on the figure that 75 percent of all of the \nproduction tax credit was being used for wind power. That was an \nestimate from last year from the Joint Committee on Taxation. But the \nEnergy Information Administration in this new report says that wind \nreceived 97 percent of the production tax credit in Fiscal Year 2007. I \nam not saying wind power is good or wind power is bad by saying this; I \nam saying if you are saying with the Ensign-Cantwell amendment that you \nare offering support for all of these different emerging technologies, \nthat is not going to be the case because according to the Energy \nInformation Administration, 97 percent of it went for wind.\n  Wind has another difference with all of these: the issue of supplying \nbaseload power. The problem with wind is the limitation on it. Each one \nof these has some limitation, but one of wind's limitations is you can \nonly use it when the wind blows. You don't store wind power; you use it \nwhen the wind blows. So if you are the city of Los Angeles or you are \nthe city of Little Rock or the city of Nashville and it is 4 o'clock in \nthe afternoon and you want to turn on your air-conditioners and operate \nyour computer and turn on your light when you hear a noise, you don't \nwant to first check to see whether the wind is blowing. So it is not a \nbaseload power, it is not a controllable power source. It has a severe \nlimitation.\n  Now, solar had much the same limitation when it was--insofar as the \ntechnology has developed so far. For solar, we generally buy panels and \nput them on the roof and we use the electricity that comes from the \npanels, and that can be very useful, just as wind mills have always \nbeen useful on farms for occasional power. But the solar industry \nrequested to be taken out of this production tax credit because it \nwasn't getting any of it. It was all going to wind.\n  Now there is another provision for an investment tax credit for \nsolar. Extending this investment tax credit is in\n\n[[Page S2804]]\n\nthe Ensign amendment. I fully support that. That would help, for \nexample, new solar thermal plants where you put a lot of mirrors out on \nthe ground, collect the Sun, create steam, put the steam in the ground, \nand then you can use it on a continuous basis, not just when the Sun \nshines. Pacific Gas and Electric has a commercial plant that they are \ngoing to build out West for that. Let's see if it works. If it does, it \nwill be a great thing for our country.\n  We only have a limited amount of money available to support emerging \nrenewable energy, so why would we spend virtually all of it--97 \npercent--for a proven technology--wind power--that we have been \nsubsidizing since 1992 and to which we have committed $11.5 billion \nover the next 10 years, if we don't do anything else, just the wind \npower. And, with the Ensign-Cantwell amendment, we are about to put in \nanother $3 billion for wind power over the next ten years, acting as if \nwe are also doing it for open-looped biomass, small irrigation power, \nlandfill gas, trash combustion, qualified hydropower, wave and tidal, \nand it won't get anything. It will all go to these big wind turbines.\n  Let me go to another chart and give an example of what this has \nproduced. We hear a lot of talk about Federal subsidies for oil and \nFederal subsidies for coal and Federal subsidies for this and that, and \nthe oil companies are called up and everybody gets excited because we \nare talking about $3.50, $4 for gasoline. We have a right to be excited \nabout that. We don't like to send our gas money overseas to people who \nare trying to kill us, so we are upset about that. But we are talking \nhere about Federal subsidies for electricity, not gasoline.\n  I asked the Energy Information Administration in May 2007 to please \ntell me what is the Federal taxpayer doing to support the different \nways we produce electricity in the country. The information came back \nthis week, and it is really pretty interesting. Coal. Coal is half of \nall of the electricity we use in the United States. We are not a desert \nisland. We use 25 percent of all of the energy in the world. If we are \ngoing to be realistic about it, we need to find a way to burn coal \ncleanly, which means we need to recapture the carbon if we care about \nclimate change. But right now, we subsidize coal to the tune of 44 \ncents per megawatt hour. We may not know what a megawatt hour is, but \nwe can compare it to what we do for others. Refined coal is a very \nsmall part of coal, and it gets a very high subsidy. That is very \ninteresting. I didn't know about that. That is a special subsidy which \nwas put in for refined coal, but almost all the coal we burn gets 44 \ncents.\n  Natural gas. Almost all the plants built to make new electricity in \nthe 1990s were natural gas and petroleum. That is oil and gas. We \nassume it gets a lot of subsidies. It only gets 25 cents for a megawatt \nhour. Nuclear power. Nuclear plants generate 19 percent of all our \nelectricity in America, but they are 70 percent of all our clean \nelectricity. If we want to have clean air and to deal with climate \nchange in this generation, nuclear power--other than conservation--is \nour best option because, with that, you have no nitrogen, no sulfur, \nand no mercury, which dirties the air, and you have no carbon. So 70 \npercent of our carbon-free electricity comes from nuclear power. How do \nwe subsidize nuclear power? EIA's report says $1.59 per megawatt hour \nin Fiscal Year 2007?\n  Biomass is a new renewable energy, which gets 89 cents. Geothermal. \nThey are interesting new technologies that drill way down into the \nground and out comes heat and you can heat your house from that. That \nis 92 cents per kilowatt hour.\n  Hydroelectric, which is water over the dams. It is about 7 percent of \nall the electricity in America. It is clean, but you and I know how \nmany new dams are going to be built. Not many more. Subsidizing that \nwill not solve the problem of clean electricity for a country that uses \n25 percent of all the electricity in the world.\n  Solar is misleading. We are subsidizing it at the rate of $24 per \nmegawatt hour, about 50 times that for coal. That is an infinitesimal \namount for electricity. We don't sell much solar electricity to the \ngrid today. It is from solar panels put on the roof.\n  Then we have wind. That $11.5 billion we are already committed to \nspend to help developers build wind turbines all over America in places \nwhere it blows or doesn't blow, we are subsidizing the electricity \nproduced by those wind turbines at the rate of $23 a megawatt hour in \nFiscal Year 2007, while coal is less than a half dollar. That is 50 \ntimes the subsidy for coal.\n  It is $1.59 for nuclear--70 percent of our clean energy--and wind is \n2 percent of our clean energy. If we were subsidizing nuclear power at \nthe same rate as wind, it would cost us $300 billion over the next 10 \nyears. We don't have that much money in the United States with which to \nsubsidize electricity. So go all the way down to the bottom, past \nlandfill gas and municipal solid waste, and I have talked about that \nbefore. In Johnson City, TN, a company is using the landfill there and \npaying Johnson City a million dollars a year for that purpose because \nit produces electricity, and Johnson City is keeping its property taxes \nlower. It is worth, perhaps, subsidizing that a while longer. We are \ndoing that at the rate of 13 cents per megawatt hour.\n  All renewables--and this is supposed to be a bill about encouraging \nrenewables--are being subsidized at $2.80 per megawatt hour. Yet the \nEnsign-Cantwell legislation would add $3 billion to wind power, which \nis already being subsidized at $24 per megawatt hour. That is not a \nwise stewardship of dollars. What Senator Kyl and I are seeking to do \nis improve the Ensign-Cantwell bill.\n  The objective there, if I can go back to the other chart, is this. \nThe objective is to identify some of these emerging renewable \ntechnologies that have the capacity to turn into base-load technologies \nand encourage them. They are more likely to be encouraged if we give \nthem a 2-year extension for the production tax credit instead of 1 \nyear. That is what we would do. They are more likely to get some of the \nmoney if we don't let wind gobble it all up, as it did last year. Why \ngive $3 billion more to a proven technology when our goal is to support \nemerging technology? That is what we are trying to do. If the Senate \nwould like to resolve the gridlock and spend $6 billion or $7 billion \nin support of helping us find ways to encourage new emerging base-load \ntechnologies, the way to do that would be to support Ensign-Cantwell as \namended by Alexander-Kyl. Wind is getting $11.5 billion over 10 years, \nplus many other subsidies. With the Alexander-Kyl amendment, wind would \nget 1 cent per kilowatt hour and most of the $3 billion we are talking \nabout over a longer, two-year period.\n  But some of these other emerging renewable energies would have a \nfighting chance to get some of the money because they would have more \ntime to plan and invest. I have been visited by a lot of people who \nwant to see some support for renewable energy. I want to see that too. \nI was the principal sponsor of the solar energy tax credit, increasing \nit in 2005. I would like to see solar thermal plants. I would like to \nsee support for open-loop biomass, and small irrigation power, landfill \ngas, trash combustion, qualified hydropower and wave and tidal. But the \nEnsign legislation would not do it by extending the production tax \ncredit for 1 year because wind will gobble it all up such as it did \nlast year. The others will have a fighting chance if we extend the \nproduction tax credit for 2 years and treat wind like all these other \nones, particularly now that it is proven. That is a wiser use of our \nmoney and puts us on a better path toward cleaner air and dealing with \nclimate change.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, Rhode Island currently has the highest \nforeclosure rate in New England. According to the most recent National \nDelinquency Survey from the Mortgage Bankers Association, 3.9 percent \nof all the loans being serviced in the State are in foreclosure. \nForeclosure initiations were up 11.8 percent from the previous quarter. \nAs far as subprime adjustable rate mortgage loans, ARMs, are concerned, \n8.2 percent of them are in foreclosure, which is up 18.8 percent from \nlast quarter. And we know that a majority of these ARMs have not yet \nreset and are scheduled to do so sometime during the next year.\n  Many families' homes are now worth less than their mortgages, giving \nthem no ability to refinance or sell their homes. With the cost of \nenergy, food, health care, education, and other needs at an all time \nhigh, they are trapped between a rock and a hard place.\n\n[[Page S2805]]\n\n  The legislation before us, the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, is \na start. I want to thank Senators Dodd and Shelby and their respective \nstaffs for all of their hard work in helping us move forward on this \nlegislation.\n  I am pleased that the bill contains the provision I authored, from my \nbill, S. 2153, to amend the Truth-in-Lending Act to improve home loan \ndisclosures. This provision will ensure that consumers are provided \nwith timely and meaningful disclosures in connection with not just home \npurchase mortgages, but also for loans that refinance a home or provide \na home equity line of credit.\n  The bill requires that disclosures be provided no later than 7 \nbusiness days prior to closing so borrowers can shop for another loan \nif not satisfied with the terms. If the terms of the loan change, the \nconsumer must be notified 3 days before closing of the changed terms.\n  If consumers apply for adjustable rate or variable payment loans \nthere will now be an explicit warning on the one page TILA form that \nthe payments will change, depending on the interest rate, and an \nestimate of how those payments will change under the terms of the \ncontract based on the current interest rate. The bill also requires a \nnew disclosure that informs borrowers of the maximum monthly payments \npossible under their loan.\n  The bill provides a right to waive the early disclosure or \nrequirements if the consumer has a bona fide financial emergency that \nrequires that they close on the loan quickly, and increases the range \nof statutory damages for TILA violations from the current $200 to \n$2,000 to $400 to $4,000.\n  Finally, it requires lenders to include a statement that the consumer \nis not obligated on the mortgage loan just because they have received \nthe disclosures. This will give consumers the opportunity to truly shop \naround for the best mortgage terms for the first time ever. They will \nbe able to compare the payments and costs associated with a certain \nloan product, and decide not to sign on the dotted line if they do not \nlike the basic terms of the loan.\n  I believe that giving consumers the information they need regarding \nthe maximum payments is critical. Borrowers need to better understand \nthe full financial impact of entering into a particular loan early in \nthe process, and before they actually consummate the loan. They also \nneed to have the chance of backing out of a loan with bad terms before \nthey get to the closing table. I am pleased that my Republican \ncolleagues agreed that improved disclosures are an important part of \nthe process moving forward.\n  Importantly, FHA modernization legislation has been included in the \nbill, which will provide more safe, fixed-rate mortgages, a particular \nhelp for families who would like to refinance out of more exotic \nmortgage products. This section of the bill also contains provisions I \nauthored to improve the HUD Post-Purchase Housing Counseling Program. \nThis amendment expands access to HUD-approved counseling programs by \nallowing any low- or moderate-income homeowner to be eligible for \nfinancial counseling services.\n  Since we know that millions of homeowners are facing resets of their \nmortgages during the upcoming year, this change, combined with the \nadditional funding that we are providing in this bill for housing \ncounseling, should help at least 250,000 families to get the advice or \nassistance they need to help keep their home. I believe we need more \nfunding for this, and I will keep advocating for these housing \ncounseling services.\n  Additionally, the bill contains language that allows $25 million in \nFHA savings every year to be used for the purpose of improving FHA's \ntechnology, processes, and program performance, and for providing \nappropriate staffing for the FHA mortgage insurance programs. This \nfunding is critical to ensuring the success of FHA modernization since \nit will allow FHA to access cutting-edge mortgage insurance industry \npractices and procedures.\n  The FHA section of the bill also contains some of the provisions that \nI coauthored with Senator Allard to improve the home equity conversion \nmortgages, HECM, for seniors.\n  Other noteworthy provisions include: $10 billion in Federal tax-\nexempt private activity bond authority that will provide for the \nrefinancing of subprime loans, mortgages for first-time homebuyers, and \nmultifamily rental housing: $4 billion in new community development \nblock grant, CDBG, funding to help communities impacted by foreclosures \nby allowing localities with high foreclosure rates to purchase \nforeclosed properties for rehabilitation, rent, or resale; assistance \nfor returning soldiers to avoid foreclosure by lengthening the time a \nlender must wait before starting foreclosure from three months to nine \nmonths after a soldier returns from service and providing returning \nsoldiers with one year relief from increases in mortgage interest \nrates; the requirement that the Department of Defense establish a \ncounseling program to ensure veterans and active service members can \naccess assistance if facing financial difficulties; and an increase in \nthe VA loan guarantee amount, so that veterans have additional \nhomeownership opportunities.\n  However, I think that this legislation has failed to deal with the \ncore issue at the center of this crisis--helping struggling families \nwhose homes are now worth less than their mortgage loan--the so-called \n``underwater mortgages.'' I think the Durbin amendment, which I \ncosponsored, would have helped substantially in this regard. To help \nfamilies save their homes, the Durbin amendment was strictly limited \nand would have only applied to families that could pass the strict \nmeans test in bankruptcy--and therefore could prove that they couldn't \nafford the current mortgage. It also would have limited the provisions \nto families that were currently struggling with nontraditional and \nsubprime loans.\n  Moreover, a judge's authority to change the terms of a mortgage was \nstrictly limited. Judges would have only been able to reduce interest \nrates to the prime interest rate plus a reasonable premium for risk and \ncould only have extended the life of the loan up to 30 years. In \naddition, if a family sold their home within 5 years of the court-\nsupervised mortgage change, any increase in the market value of the \nhome up to the original mortgage amount would have been given back to \nthe lender.\n\n  There is no credible evidence to support the claim that the mere \npossibility of a small subset of mortgages being changed in bankruptcy \nwould have somehow raised the cost of all mortgages by 1.5 to 2 \npercentage points, as some have claimed. In fact, a study released \nearlier this month concluded that allowing strip downs would have had \nno impact on the cost of credit at all.\n  The Senate should have had a straight up or down vote on this \namendment, so that we could start the process of helping the families \nwho want to honor their financial obligations get a court-ordered \npayment plan that will enable them to stay in their homes at no \nadditional cost to taxpayers. However, the minority did not allow that \nto happen. This was unfortunate, and I believe a mistake. We are going \nto have to figure out a way to help the housing market deal with all of \nthese underwater mortgages in an efficient and orderly manner.\n  As the housing crisis deepens, it is clear that its effects are \nreverberating throughout our entire economy. Indeed, employers shed \n80,000 jobs in March, the worst decline in 5 years. In addition, the \njobless rate jumped to 5.1 percent from 4.8 percent in February, the \nhighest since September 2005. Unfortunately, Rhode Island has been hit \nespecially hard in the current economic downturn as the unemployment \nrate has climbed to 5.8 percent. As I mentioned, families throughout \nRhode Island are coping with rising energy, food, health care, and \neducation costs, all while workers are losing their jobs and wages have \nremained stagnant. That is why I spearheaded a letter earlier this year \nurging the inclusion of an extension of unemployment insurance, UI, \nbenefits in the original stimulus package.\n  Given that this extension was not included in the package signed into \nlaw and the economic situation has since worsened, I believe Congress \nneeds to act now to ensure Americans who have played by the rules and \nworked hard all of their lives can make ends meet. It is critical that \nwe extend this important program. Doing so would not only\n\n[[Page S2806]]\n\nstimulate our economy, but help workers who have lost their jobs by \nproviding much-needed and temporary income support. Indeed, economists \nhave found that the extension of UI benefits provides a very high \nreturn on the investment, generating approximately $1.64 in gross \ndomestic product per dollar spent.\n  Although I support the Foreclosure Prevention Act, I hope that we can \nrevisit the Durbin amendment, look more closely at Senator Dodd's \nproposal to deal with underwater loans, and analyze other remedies that \nwill deal with the heart of this crisis--millions of families trapped \nin loans that cost more than the value of their homes. If we do not \nprovide an orderly unwinding to this problem, I fear our entire economy \nis going to be affected for quite some time.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, it is critical that the Senate extend \nrenewable tax credits now so that capital for next year's wind and \nsolar projects do not dry up.\n  Unfortunately my friends on the other side of the aisle have blocked \nevery previous attempt to extend these much-needed tax credits.\n  Why have they decided to block something as popular as renewable \nenergy tax credits? One can only wonder if it's because they prefer to \ndefend something as unpopular as record oil company profits over \nreducing record family energy costs.\n  Every single time we have attempted to fund a renewable energy tax \ncredit by rolling back completely unnecessary oil subsidies, the other \nside of the aisle has sided with Big Oil over the American people.\n  Well now it is time to try another strategy. We have been blocked \nfrom taking the financially responsible path of paying for the \nrenewable energy tax credits. But we simply cannot afford to stand by \nand do nothing as our economy continues to slump and energy prices \ncontinue to put more unnecessary financial stress on New Jersey \nfamilies. We must find a way forward.\n  Anyone who is not living under a rock understands three things:\n  Our economy is in serious trouble; the climate crisis is getting \nworse and we must act immediately to avert the worst affects of global \nwarming; and energy prices are rising through the roof.\n  The majority has repeatedly offered to extend the renewable energy \ntax credits which would go a long way toward fixing all three of these \nserious problems.\n  If we let the renewable energy tax credits expire we will set back \nthe tremendous growth in renewables at least a couple of years. This \nsetback would cost the U.S. economy the creation of roughly 100,000 \njobs and billions in economic development. In my home State of New \nJersey, letting these tax credits lapse would cost the State over 3000 \ngood, high paying jobs. We cannot let the economy suffer this kind of \nhit at this critical juncture.\n  Of course setting back renewables a couple of years will also be \ndevastating to our environment. In the face of global warming we simply \ndo not have 2 years to waste. We are in the midst of a climate crisis \nin which we must do everything we can to reduce our dependence on \ncarbon. Delays like this one simply do not make any sense.\n  One last economic point makes this an easy call in my view. \nElectricity prices are skyrocketing because the price of coal and \nnatural gas are skyrocketing. For every watt of energy we make from \nrenewables, demand is eased on our natural gas and coal markets. If we \nsuddenly pull the rug out from the renewable industry, wind and solar \nproduction will plummet, demand for coal and natural gas will spike and \nour families' electricity bills will get even higher.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting Senator Cantwell's and \nSenator Ensign's amendment to provide an extension of the renewable \nenergy tax credits and help deliver a stronger, greener economy for our \ncountry.\n  (Ms. CANTWELL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmorning business on Thursday, April 10, the Senate then resume \nconsideration of H.R. 3221, and the Senate proceed to vote in relation \nto the following amendments in the order listed, and if a point of \norder is raised against an amendment, then there be 2 minutes of debate \nprior to a vote on the motion to waive the point of order, equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form: Senator Alexander's second-\ndegree amendment No. 4429; Senator Ensign's amendment No. 4419, as \namended, if amended. I also ask unanimous consent that Senator \nAlexander and Senator Ensign be recognized for 5 minutes apiece in \nconsideration of their amendments; that all remaining pending \namendments be withdrawn, except the substitute, and that a managers' \namendment that has been cleared by the managers and the leaders also be \nin order; that the managers' package be considered and agreed to, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that upon disposition \nof the listed amendments, the substitute, as amended, be agreed to, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that upon disposition \nof the substitute amendment, the bill be read a third time, and the \nSenate vote on passage of the bill without further intervening action \nor debate; that upon passage, the title amendment, which is at the \ndesk, be agreed to, and that the cloture motion on the bill be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nin supporting the Firearms Information Use Act to repeal the most \nextreme provisions in the Tiahrt amendment and lift the veil of secrecy \nthat currently surrounds the flow of guns in our country. The act will \ngive law enforcement agencies the support they need to do their job, \nwhile protecting information about undercover officers, confidential \ninformants, ongoing investigations, and lawful firearms purchasers. It \nis a basic open-government measure that is critical for the public \nsafety of communities across America.\n  The Tiahrt amendment is an appropriations rider enacted in 2003 that \nrestricts public access to information gathered by the Justice \nDepartment's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. It \nprevents law enforcement organizations from sharing gun trace data with \neach other and from obtaining gun trace data outside their geographic \njurisdiction. It prohibits such information from being used as evidence \nin State license revocations, civil lawsuits, or any other \nadministrative proceedings, unless specifically filed by the Bureau. It \nalso prevents the Bureau from publishing reports that use gun trace \ndata to analyze the flow of guns at the national level.\n  Numerous mayors, law enforcement officers, and researchers have \nspoken out against these restrictions. Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a \nbipartisan coalition of over 250 mayors led by Mayor Tom Menino of \nBoston and Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City, is staunchly \nopposed to the Tiahrt amendment, and one of the coalition's top \npriorities is to have the amendment repealed. The International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police recently emphasized that we can reduce \ngun violence in our communities by making gun trace data publicly \navailable.\n  In a 2006 report, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence documented \nthe harmful consequences of the Tiahrt amendment. The Brady Center \nfound that the amendment ``had an immediate chilling effect on the \nBureau's activities,'' that ``academic researchers have already found \ntheir work stymied,'' and that the amendment has ``crippled'' efforts \nby law enforcement to investigate patterns of gun trafficking on a \nnationwide basis and to identify sources of guns used in crime. The \nreport unequivocally concludes that the ``Tiahrt Amendment is a \ntransparent attempt by the gun lobby . . . to shield the public, as \nwell as government and law enforcement agencies, from the truth about \nguns and crime.''\n  In spite of these criticisms, the amendment has been included in the \nJustice Department appropriations bill every year since 2003, and even \nmore restrictive versions of it have been proposed in recent months. By \nenacting the Firearms Information Use Act, Congress can restore sanity \nto our policy on gun trace data.

Madam President, one of the most pressing concerns of \nAmerican families and businesses these days is the skyrocketing cost of \nhealth care. Health costs are now the No. 1 cause of personal \nbankruptcy and many businesses are dropping coverage for their \nemployees because they can no longer afford it.\n  Required reading for anyone seeking to address the challenge of high \nhealth costs is an insightful article in this month's New England \nJournal of Medicine. It was authored by Dr. James Mongan, who is CEO of \nPartners HealthCare in Massachusetts, which includes Massachusetts \nGeneral and Brigham and Women's, two of the Nation's leading hospitals. \nHe is joined by Dr. Timothy Ferris and Dr. Thomas Lee.\n  The article states that there is no single answer to reducing health \ncosts. However, it identifies a number of initiatives that hold \nsignificant promise, including pay-for-performance programs, use of \nelectronic medical records and more.\n  I commend this compelling article to my colleagues and ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the New England Journal of Medicine, Apr. 3, 2008]\n\n          Options for Slowing the Growth of Health Care Costs\n\n(By James J. Mongan, M.D., Timothy G. Ferris, M.D., M.P.H., and Thomas \n                             H. Lee, M.D.)\n\n       Health care costs continue to be an important concern in \n     the United States, and they are already a central issue of \n     the 2008 presidential campaign. Numerous strategies for cost \n     containment are being proposed, but specific options are \n     usually presented in isolation, with little disciplined \n     discussion of their potential impact or the barriers they \n     face. In this article, we provide a survey of major options \n     for slowing the growth of health care spending. We also \n     provide a qualitative assessment of the likely effectiveness \n     of these options and our recommendation for a package that \n     could be collectively pursued.\n       Underlying our analysis are three basic assumptions. First, \n     health care spending has high intrinsic social value, and the \n     primary driver of cost increases is technical progress--for \n     example, new tests and therapies or new knowledge about the \n     benefits of\n\n[[Page S2812]]\n\n     existing ones. This perspective is supported by the \n     observation that health care costs are increasing throughout \n     the world, regardless of the system for financing health \n     care. The aging of the population and increasing numbers of \n     patients with chronic illnesses contribute to the problem, \n     but the increasing numbers of effective therapies for these \n     populations are major factors in cost trends.\n       Second, the value obtained for health care expenditures \n     must be enhanced. Unconstrained growth in medical spending is \n     threatening the incomes of individual patients, the cost \n     structures of employers, and the fiscal balance of \n     government. Third, the high social value of health care \n     limits policy options for containing health care spending.\n       In short, we want cost control, but we also want broad \n     access to health care and continued innovation in medical \n     science. Trade-offs among these goals are inevitable, and \n     they can be minimized only through thoughtful policies.\n       Table 1 lists 12 major options for reducing health care \n     spending, with comments regarding barriers to their \n     implementation. Rigorous experimental studies of the effect \n     of these options are scarce, and estimates of their \n     independent effects are not available. For example, estimates \n     of the savings that might be derived from the use of \n     electronic medical records include savings from other \n     options, including improved care for patients with chronic \n     conditions.\n       Nevertheless, the pressures to address increasing costs are \n     so intense that policy decisions cannot be delayed until \n     long-term studies are completed. We therefore classified \n     these options into three groups on the basis of a qualitative \n     assessment of their potential effect on costs. These \n     assessments were influenced by our judgment of the near-term \n     political viability of these options.\n       Our belief is that there is no single ``magic bullet'' \n     among these choices; our goal is to promote discussion \n     leading to effective policies that support several \n     approaches. We do not think responsible health care leaders \n     can be against all of these options; indeed, we think it is \n     insufficient for leaders to support only one or two. \n     Policymakers must identify an array of choices with \n     sufficient cost-savings potential to moderate financial \n     pressures on health care.\n\n\n                  greatest potential for cost savings\n\n       Several types of payment reform have been suggested and are \n     being tried throughout the country. All of them are \n     potentially disruptive to providers whose businesses are \n     based on fee-forservice payments. Nonetheless, improving \n     quality and efficiency in a pure fee-for-service environment \n     is so challenging that we believe the question is not whether \n     payment reform should be pursued, but how to pursue it \n     without precipitating major discontent or disruptions in \n     care.\n       The most potent version of payment reform is budget-based \n     capitation, in which providers receive a fixed amount of \n     money to cover all health care needs of a population of \n     patients. Experiments with capitation in commercially \n     insured populations demonstrate reductions in cost, but \n     they have often resulted in consumer and provider \n     dissatisfaction. Patients have rebelled against \n     limitations on their choices of providers, and providers \n     have rebelled against capped budgets and inadequate risk \n     adjustments to payments. Although capitation is \n     successfully used in some staff-model delivery systems, \n     efforts to extend this payment approach more broadly have \n     had limited success.\n\n          TABLE 1.--APPROACHES TO REDUCING MEDICAL EXPENDITURES\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 Proposal                             Comments\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHighest potential for cost savings:\n  Payment reform (e.g., capitation, case    Capitation limited by\n   rates, pay-for-performance programs).     patients' preference for\n                                             choice of providers and\n                                             public discomfort with\n                                             potential perverse\n                                             incentives for clinicians;\n                                             case rates applicable only\n                                             to a small percentage of\n                                             procedures (e.g., coronary-\n                                             artery-bypass grafting);\n                                             pay-for-performance\n                                             programs still evolving and\n                                             require organized providers\n                                             to adopt efficiency goals.\n  Effectiveness review for new drugs and    Important step to ensure\n   forms of technology before                value for future medical\n   reimbursement.                            advances; risk of limiting\n                                             innovation and delaying\n                                             arrival of products in the\n                                             market.\n  Electronic medical records..............

Despite the limited data on the \n     effect of such approaches, we cannot conceive of a meaningful \n     attempt to decrease the trend in costs that does not include \n     some form of payment reform. We also believe that payment \n     reform is likely to be most effective when providers are \n     organized into delivery systems that can accept \n     responsibility for cost-mitigation goals.\n       Another promising approach to cost containment is \n     strengthening effectiveness reviews for new drugs and forms \n     of technology. Some candidates and many policy experts \n     support a new national institute to conduct such analyses, \n     which could be required before decisions regarding \n     reimbursement are made. Concern about this approach comes \n     from members of industry, who worry about the possible \n     effects of such reviews on the time and costs associated with \n     getting products to market.\n       Health information systems that include electronic records \n     have significant potential for cost savings and enjoy strong \n     political support. Policymakers often focus on the personal \n     health record (e.g., a small data-storage device carrying key \n     clinical information), but we believe the greatest cost-\n     reducing effect of electronic records will result from \n     improved coordination among health care providers and from \n     decision support that improves clinicians' use of tests and \n     treatments. Such decision support has the potential to \n     decrease variation among physicians in the use of health care \n     services, thereby reducing both baseline costs and cost \n     trends.\n       This potential is largely unrealized to date, however. \n     Critical barriers include the requirements for capital \n     investment and standardization of administrative and clinical \n     data. Even more daunting is the need for cultural change \n     among physicians, who must be willing to use decision-support \n     systems if electronic records are to improve their care.\n       The improved care of patients with chronic conditions such \n     as diabetes mellitus or coronary artery disease is a \n     promising focus for cost reduction, because about 70% of \n     health care costs are generated by 10% of patients, most of \n     whom have one or more chronic diseases. Improved reliability \n     and coordination of the care of these patients could reduce \n     their need for hospitalization. This strategy has moderate \n     bipartisan support, reflecting awareness of the frequent \n     failure of our health care system to deliver interventions \n     that are likely to be beneficial to patients with these \n     conditions.\n       As is true with information technology, however, the \n     evidence that improvement in the care of patients with \n     chronic conditions reduces costs falls short of the apparent \n     opportunity. Numerous interventions are known to be cost-\n     effective--that is, they improve health at a reasonable \n     incremental cost. However, few interventions (e.g., disease-\n     management programs for patients with heart failure) have \n     been shown to actually save money while improving patients' \n     health.\n       Nevertheless, we believe that the cost-saving potential of \n     improvement in the care of patients with chronic conditions \n     may yet turn out to be meaningful. Effective care-improvement \n     programs generally require organized systems of care, as \n     compared with a fragmented system of independent \n     practitioners who often find these programs difficult to \n     maintain. Implementation of these programs will also require \n     some payment reform because institutions and practitioners \n     currently lose money by reducing preventable \n     hospitalizations, and proactive care-management services are \n     typically not covered.\n\n\n                Intermediate Potential for Cost Savings\n\n       The observation that health care costs are concentrated in \n     the period just before the patient's death raises concern \n     that our health system uses excessive resources to extend the \n     life of dying patients. Political candidates are \n     understandably wary of engaging in this discussion, but \n     health care providers are exploring the effect of greater use \n     of hospice and palliative care services and more complete \n     disclosure to patients of the risks and benefits of proposed \n     interventions.\n       Medicare data from Oregon indicate that the use of \n     hospitalization and intensive care units in the last months \n     of life can be decreased without compromising the care of \n     dying patients and their families. However, these data show \n     that any serious attempt to change end-of-life care requires \n     deep cultural change that extends well beyond the provider \n     community.\n       Two broader approaches to cost control have support from \n     opposite ends of the political spectrum. Political \n     conservatives have championed consumerism, expressed through \n     insurance products with high deductibles or copayments, \n     health savings accounts, and ``transparency.'' Transparency \n     means making available information about the cost and\n\n[[Page S2813]]\n\n     quality of health care services so that patients can become \n     informed consumers.\n       Although the impact of this approach is unknown, we believe \n     that cost savings are likely to be limited by the medical \n     needs of the 10% of people who account for 70% of costs. \n     These patients tend to exceed their financial liabilities \n     associated with these products quickly, and their ability and \n     willingness to behave like shoppers who can make trade-offs \n     in cost and quality are uncertain at best. In addition, these \n     insurance products have thus far proved unpopular with \n     employees despite their lower effect on their paychecks, and \n     enrollment to date has been low.\n       On the political left, advocates of the single-payer \n     approach argue that elimination of the employer-based \n     commercial insurance system would dramatically reduce \n     administrative costs. Despite the large savings that would \n     result, political support for this approach is currently \n     limited. The strongest resistance to the single-payer \n     approach comes from the commercial insurance industry, but \n     providers worry that this approach would extend the lower \n     reimbursement structure of Medicare and Medicaid to all \n     patients, and these payments would not increase fast enough \n     to cover increasing provider costs. Thus, for the time being \n     at least, the development of a broad coalition around a \n     single-payer system is unlikely. There is, however, \n     widespread interest in reducing administrative costs by \n     pursuing standardization of the claims-payment systems of \n     U.S. private insurers (e.g., through adoption of a universal \n     billing form).\n\n\n                   Lowest Potential for Cost Savings\n\n       Two familiar targets for cost reduction are malpractice and \n     drug-pricing reform, but the potential savings from these \n     approaches are probably small. Although the current \n     malpractice system is an inefficient way to protect patients \n     from negligent care, the direct costs of malpractice premiums \n     and estimated costs of ``defensive medicine'' are not major \n     factors in overall health care spending. In any case, \n     political support for malpractice reform is partisan and weak \n     because of the resistance to major changes on the part of \n     plaintiffs' lawyers.\n       Costs can be reduced through more restrictive drug \n     formularies and tougher price negotiations, but the savings \n     are modest because pharmaceuticals account for just 10 to 15% \n     of health care spending. The political appetite for tight \n     government control of drug pricing is also limited by \n     concerns about its effect on the development of new drugs.\n       Enhanced primary prevention efforts (e.g., programs to \n     reduce smoking, alcohol abuse, or obesity) have strong \n     bipartisan support, and they would lead to important general \n     health benefits. This approach makes particular sense for \n     employers, who can enhance the health of their workforce, and \n     also delay the onset of serious illness among their employees \n     by many years, at which point most costs would be absorbed by \n     Medicare.\n       However, candidates would be ill-advised to believe they \n     can fund broader access to health care through savings \n     derived from primary prevention. Prevention is more likely to \n     delay than to eliminate long-term societal costs, because \n     longer life spans mean more years of health care adding to \n     overall costs. Controversy persists regarding whether \n     improved care can lead to significant savings through a \n     ``compression of morbidity''--that is, longer and healthier \n     lives with a relatively quick, low-cost period of illness \n     just before death. Regardless of what the right answer is, \n     savings from increased primary prevention will not be \n     substantial in the near term.\n\n\n                           Rationing Options\n\n       Should other options fail to provide sufficient cost \n     reductions, policymakers may be forced to consider various \n     forms of rationing, including two types that have been \n     proposed from different ends of the political spectrum. From \n     the left comes the proposal for fixed, all-payer budget \n     ceilings for health expenditures, such as those that are used \n     in Canada and some European countries with multiple payers. \n     The U.S. experiment with this approach is the Medicare \n     funding policy that requires decreases in payments to \n     physicians when overall spending increases.\n       Although there would certainly be considerable savings from \n     this approach, inflation in health care spending in countries \n     that use it does not lag far behind ours because of the \n     constant political pressure to increase spending for \n     essential services. Administration of these budgets would \n     require a large government role, and such a strong government \n     regulatory role is not likely to gain consensus in the U.S. \n     culture.\n       From the right come proposals for indirect rationing by \n     limiting Medicare and Medicaid payment for new or \n     ``discretionary'' services. This approach would have \n     Medicare evolve to provide a defined contribution toward \n     the health care costs of the U.S. elderly instead of \n     defined benefits. Under this framework, patients who are \n     able to pay for the services that are not covered would do \n     so with their own money, and patients who are unable to \n     pay would go without. We think such a dramatic and visible \n     increase in the two-class nature of our health system is \n     too obviously inconsistent with our core values to be \n     politically viable.\n\n\n                               Discussion\n\n       We see three paths toward controlling health care costs. \n     First, we could allow the current situation to persist. \n     Consequences would almost certainly include increased \n     taxation and financial burdens on individual patients and \n     businesses, greater competition for scarce governmental \n     resources, and a continued increase in the number of \n     uninsured Americans. The alternative extreme would move our \n     country toward one of the indirect rationing methods \n     described above. This path would be practical only as a last \n     resort. The third path would be to assemble the most \n     reasonable package, short of rationing, using a combination \n     of the other ideas mentioned above, and to try to bend the \n     trend line in increasing health care costs.\n       While recognizing that the many stakeholders in health care \n     will have different preferences, we suggest the following. \n     First, modify reimbursement with the explicit goal of \n     rewarding the practice of evidence-based medicine, reductions \n     in variance among physicians in the use of services, and \n     improvement in the care of patients with chronic conditions. \n     We recommend consideration of blended arrangements including \n     pay-for-performance programs, case rates, and even adequately \n     funded and appropriately risk-adjusted capitation.\n       Second, invest in new effectiveness-review bodies. These \n     groups would inform decisions regarding the coverage for and \n     use of health care tests and treatments in the future.\n       Third, maximize support for electronic medical records with \n     computerized decision support, recognizing that this will \n     involve considerable national investment and cultural change. \n     Such support can come in the form of higher reimbursement for \n     physicians who have adopted electronic records or grants from \n     hospitals, payers, or government to provide support for their \n     implementation.\n       Fourth, enhance the standardization of health care \n     transactions in order to drive down administrative costs. \n     Fifth, provide support for regional efforts to improve the \n     quality of care at the end of life. Finally, provide support \n     for prevention programs, not because they save money, but \n     because they lead to a better quality of life and a more \n     productive workforce.\n       We recognize that many ideas for cost containment are not \n     addressed here and that there are many potential cost-\n     containment packages besides our approach. Our intent has \n     been to set out a framework for considering various \n     proposals. To deal successfully with this important issue, we \n     must move away from cliches that fit our own political \n     beliefs and grapple seriously with the true effectiveness and \n     the political reality of each of these ideas. We need a real \n     and honest dialogue on this issue--particularly in a \n     presidential election year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/09/senate-section/article/S2813-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL ALCOHOL AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, today I rise to recognize April as \nNational Alcohol Awareness Month. We must all remain aware that alcohol \nis a drug that can pose serious health and well-being risks if used \nimproperly. From underage drinking to drunk driving to alcohol \naddiction, this substance can have catastrophic and long-reaching \neffects on the lives of Americans.\n  I wish to take the opportunity in a month dedicated to alcohol \nawareness to promote awareness of a devastating alcohol-related \ncondition. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, FASD, is an umbrella term \ndescribing the varied range of alcohol-related birth defects that may \nresult from the use of alcohol during pregnancy. The effects of this \ndisorder may be mental, behavioral, and/or involve learning \ndisabilities. FASD is the leading known cause of preventable cognitive \nimpairment in America. It is estimated FASD effects 1 in 100 live \nbirths each year.\n  We must move past the stigma of this devastating disease to truly \nhelp those and their families who are affected by FASD get the health, \neducation, counseling and support services they need and deserve. We \nmust also address the tragedy of FASD at the source, by increasing \nawareness that any amount of alcohol during pregnancy can have \nheartbreaking, lifelong effects, and by ensuring this is understood by \nall women of child-bearing age and by providing treatment and \ncounseling services for these women.\n  Earlier this year, several of my colleagues and I reintroduced \nlegislation to address FASD issues within families, at schools, in \nhealth care centers, in our legal system, and at its source. In \naddition to supporting those living with FASD and their families, this \nbill works to educate our health practitioners, educators and members \nof our judicial system to recognize the special needs of these \nindividuals. While we increase awareness of the effects alcohol can \nhave on individuals and their families, increasing FASD awareness must \nalso be included to advance the fight against these damaging disorders.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/09/senate-section/article/S2814-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2814]]\n                    NATIONAL AUTISM AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

As many as 1 in 166 children is \ndiagnosed with autism spectrum disorders each year, yet the cause and \ncure remain unknown. Our commitment to finding answers and solving the \npuzzle of autism must continue.\n  While the diagnosis of autism is the beginning of a challenging road, \nit can also be the welcome end to a frustrating process for families. \nEarly detection is an important step towards obtaining appropriate \ntreatment to ensure children are able to grow to reach their full \npotential. As the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders continues to \ngrow, we must also ensure these treatment options are available in our \ncommunities and accessible to those who need them.\n  I also take this opportunity to recognize the parents, professionals, \nand advocates who work day after day to be a powerful voice for \nautistic individuals. They create an important network to share \ninformation, experiences and challenges, as well as to celebrate \naccomplishments. We must all join them in their efforts to pursue \nincreased funding for biomedical research and public health awareness \ncampaigns, education programs that reflect special needs, and expanded \ndiagnosis and treatment options.\n  I urge all citizens to support the search for the cause, cure and \nprevention of autism and support those individuals and families who \nlive with this challenging disorder on a daily basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/09/senate-section/article/S2814-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     IN MEMORY OF BRENT A.

I would \nlike to take a few moments to recognize his many important \naccomplishments and the impact he made as a leader in both his personal \nand professional life.\n  Firefighter Lovrien was a leader to his fellow firefighters and a \nhighly respected leader in his community. He has been called an \ninspiration by his superior officers and has been a mentor to his \nfellow firefighters. Firefighter Lovrien has also been recognized by \nresidents of Fire Station 95's local community for his efforts to \nprotect and improve their quality of life. Lovrien was an asset to his \ncommunity and his presence will truly be missed.\n  Firefighter Lovrien is survived by his father, mother, and brother--\nto whom I send my heartfelt condolences. He leaves a lasting legacy of \ncaring and compassion that serves as a model to us all. Firefighters \nare too often called upon to protect our communities while putting \nthemselves in grave danger. Despite this, they are the first to go into \nburning buildings, or similar dangerous situations, all to save lives \nand property. Firefighter Lovrien stepped forward and paid the ultimate \nprice for our protection.

Madam President, I am proud to honor a group of \n92 World War II veterans from the Acadiana region of Louisiana who are \ntraveling to Washington, DC, this weekend to visit the various \nmemorials and monuments that recognize the sacrifices of our nation's \ninvaluable service members.\n  Louisiana HonorAir, a group based in Lafayette, LA, is sponsoring \nthis Saturday's trip to the Nation's Capital. The organization is \nhonoring each surviving World War II Louisiana veteran by giving them \nan opportunity to see the memorials dedicated to their service. On this \ntrip, the veterans will visit the World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and Iwo \nJima memorials. They will also travel to Arlington National Cemetery to \nlay a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknowns.\n  This is the sixth flight Louisiana HonorAir has made to Washington, \nDC, and there will be three additional flights this spring.\n  World War II was one of America's greatest triumphs, but was also a \ndeadly conflict. More than 60 million people worldwide were killed, \nincluding 40 million civilians, and more than 400,000 American \nservicemembers were slain during the long war. The ultimate victory \nover enemies in the Pacific and in Europe is a testament to the valor \nof American soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. The years 1941 to 45 \nalso witnessed an unprecedented mobilization of domestic industry, \nwhich supplied our military on two distant fronts.\n  In Louisiana, there remain today more than 40,000 living WWII \nveterans, and each one has a heroic tale of achieving the noble victory \nof freedom over tyranny. Veterans in this HonorAir group began their \nservice in 1940 before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and served as late \nas 1950 in the European and Pacific theaters as well as stateside. They \nserved in various branches of the military--25 members in the Army, 24 \nin the Army Air Corps, 37 in the Navy, three in the Navy Air Corps, one \nin the Navy Reserve, two in the Marines, and one in the Merchant \nMarines. Several served during World War II and the Korean War, and one \nof our veterans spent 30 years in active service in the Army, serving \nthrough the Vietnam war.\n  One of our heroes served as a Control Tower Operator with the 104th \nAACS Squadron. Another was aboard the USS Proteus, alongside the USS \nMissouri, during the Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945. And yet \nanother hero went on 35 bombing missions over Europe between 1942 and \n1945. Some participated in the Battle of the Bulge and the D-Day \nInvasion of France at Utah Beach. Many fought in the South Pacific. \nSome served in the China-Burma-India Theater, and others in Africa.\n  Also traveling to Washington on Saturday's trip is an active member \nof the service. Army MAJ Robert Gutierrez of Lafayette finished a tour \nof duty in Iraq in February. I ask the Senate to recognize him for his \ncommitment to our country.\n  I also ask the Senate to join me in honoring these 89 men and three\n\n[[Page S2815]]\n\nwomen, all Louisiana heroes, that we welcome to Washington this weekend \nand Louisiana HonorAir for making these trips a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/09/senate-section/article/S2815-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE NATIONAL CRITTENTON FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join \nme today in commemorating the 125th anniversary of the National \nCrittenton Foundation and the Crittenton Family of Agencies.\n  For the last 113 years, Florence Crittenton Services Inc. in \nWheeling, WV has served thousands of teen mothers and their children as \nthe State's only maternity home--one that is nationally recognized for \nits unique gender-responsive program. In recognition of its continuing \ncontribution to the State, the State Journal recently named this \ninnovative agency one of the ``55 Good Things About West Virginia.'' \nThe honor is well deserved.\n  In 1895, Florence Crittenton Services Inc. first opened its doors to \nprovide shelter and support for ``wayward'' women in crisis. Over the \npast century, it has evolved from being a group home and adoption \nagency to a nationally-accredited and respected therapeutic residential \nprogram that serves abused, neglected, and behaviorally-challenged \ngirls.\n  Among its many forward-thinking programs is Wellspring Family \nServices, a comprehensive, community-based behavioral health, parenting \nsupport and education service provider. Cradles to Crayons, a child \ncare program for young mothers in care, provides a structured and safe \nenvironment for children while their parents complete their education \nand participate in therapeutic programming. This child care program \ncontinues today and serves the child care needs of Crittenton residents \nand community members.\n  Grounded in its original mission to help children and families in \nneed achieve self-sufficiency, all of the agency's programs pay close \nattention to the underlying challenges that keep young women from \nsucceeding, including addiction, domestic violence, and sexual abuse.\n  Throughout its history, Florence Crittenton Services, Inc. has \nmaintained a unique cooperative relationship with The National \nCrittenton Foundation. This partnership is based on founder Charles \nCrittenton's and Dr. Kate Waller Barrett's belief that the most \neffective way to address compelling national social issues was through \na network of affiliated independent, local organizations supported by a \nnational body.\n  More than a century after Charles Crittenton founded his first home, \nthe National Crittenton Foundation is re-emerging as an active force \nfor social change. The foundation and its agencies continue their work \nto break the cycles of intergenerational issues like teen pregnancy, \nviolence and substance abuse through a mix of strength-based gender and \nculturally-specific services tailored to meet the needs of young girls \nin local communities. For years, I have worked to improve services and \nsupport of needy children and families, and I have been proud to work \nwith the Florence Crittenton Society in Wheeling.\n  As the National Crittenton Foundation and West Virginia's Florence \nCrittenton Services, Inc. come to Capitol Hill to celebrate 125 years \nof service to young women at risk and their children, I ask you to help \nme congratulate them on their achievements and thank them for their \nprofound commitment to our children and our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/09/senate-section/article/S2815-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING BERRY, FOWLES & CO.\n\n Ms. SNOWE.

A bill to amend chapter 1 of title 9 of United States Code \nwith respect to arbitration; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today Senator Herb Kohl and I are \nintroducing the Fairness in Nursing Home Arbitration Act. In my State \nand many others, elderly Americans--as a condition of their being \nadmitted to a nursing home--are unfairly asked to agree to arbitrate \nany claims they may have against that nursing home before their claim \nactually occurs. This is not only unfair to those seeking residence, \nbut it is also unfair to their families, who often times have no choice \nbut to forfeit their loved one's legal rights in order to find them the \ncare they need.\n\n[[Page S2820]]\n\n  The basis for arbitration is accorded under the Federal Arbitration \nAct, FAA, which Congress enacted in 1925. The FAA was intended to allow \nparties an alternative forum to efficiently resolve business disputes. \nBut over time, the FAA has expanded into nonbusiness disputes, \nincluding those involving nursing homes.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is in keeping with the FAA's \noriginal intent by requiring that agreements to arbitrate nursing home \ndisputes be made after the dispute has arisen--not before prospective \nresidents move in. While this bill won't prevent arbitration from \noccurring, it will prevent nursing home corporations with greater \nbargaining power from forcing residents to enter into pre-dispute \narbitration through a non-negotiable contract.\n  The trend we are seeing at far too many nursing homes around the \ncountry is an unwarranted intrusion into a vulnerable population's \nright to access the civil justice system. This bill protects those who \nare otherwise unprotected, and helps to give their families peace of \nmind in knowing their loved ones are able to retain their full legal \nrights should they be abused or injured.\n  I applaud my colleague, Senator Kohl for recognizing the egregious \ninjustices happening in nursing homes around the Nation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this necessary bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Martinez to \nintroduce the Fairness in Nursing Home Arbitration Act of 2008. This \nlegislation is a narrowly targeted measure that protects nursing home \nresidents, one of our Nation's most vulnerable populations, from losing \nthe right to hold nursing homes accountable in court for negligent and \nabusive care.\n  The process of admission to a long-term care facility is traumatic \nfor the prospective resident and their family. Often these facilities \nare a last resort for families and residents, and many times these \ndecisions are arrived at under desperate, and sometimes emergency, \ncircumstances. Even admission to an assisted-living facility by a \nrelatively healthy senior citizen is a stressful and emotional event. \nAdding to the difficulty, many families face limited options in nursing \ncare when it comes to both geographic location and the level of care \nrequired for their loved one.\n  During the admissions process, prospective residents and their \nfamilies have little choice other than to accept the terms of the \nadmission agreement with no ability to negotiate. Many facilities now \nrequire residents, or their responsible family members, to sign \ncontracts that include predispute mandatory arbitration agreements. \nThis means that any dispute between the resident and the facility will \nautomatically be subject to arbitration. In other words, by agreeing to \nthe contract, and before a dispute ever arises, they are unwittingly \nsigning away their constitutional right to have their case heard by an \nimpartial judge or jury.\n  Unlike other uses of arbitration, arbitration in the nursing home \ncontext is usually related to health care and often involves cases of \nabuse and neglect that result in serious injuries or death. While civil \ncourt proceedings are generally open to the public, most arbitration \nrequires that all parts of the process be kept confidential. As a \nresult, long term care facilities are not held publicly accountable for \ntheir substandard care. Even worse, this potentially lifesaving \ninformation may be concealed from current and prospective residents, \nregulatory agencies, and the public.\n  Another troubling aspect of arbitration clauses in nursing home \nadmissions agreements is that they are often buried in long contracts \nand presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, without any opportunity \nto negotiate. While some facilities may attempt to explain the meaning \nof the arbitration clause and make it seem voluntary, the focus of the \nadmissions process is on the loved one in need of care and not on these \ntechnical legal aspects of the agreement. Family members of prospective \nresidents, whether or not they understand the arbitration provision, \nfeel compelled to sign it in order to ensure that their loved one will \nbe admitted and that their care will not be compromised by their \nrefusal.\n  One of many tragic examples we have learned about is the case of Ella \nNeedham. After being hospitalized with a urinary tract infection, she \nwas taken to a nursing home by her daughter. During the hasty \nadmissions process, her daughter signed a mandatory arbitration \nagreement. Both were unaware that they were signing away their \nconstitutional right to a jury trial. During Ella's stay, the nursing \nhome staff abused her, failed to adequately hydrate her, and did not \nadequately treat her illness. As a result of this negligence and abuse, \nMrs. Needham died. When her daughter sued the home, she discovered that \nshe was not allowed to go to court because of the arbitration \nagreement. After months of litigation challenging the agreement, the \nappeals court upheld the requirement to arbitrate. The daughter was \nforced to settle her claims of abuse and neglect in arbitration.\n  It is important to note that our bill does not preclude arbitration \nas an option for resolving disputes between nursing home residents and \nlong term care facilities. The legislation simply says that families \nand prospective residents cannot be forced into arbitration through a \nnonnegotiable contract prior to the dispute. This will ensure that \narbitration is a voluntary forum to resolve these unique disputes that \ncan have far reaching consequences.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/09/senate-section/article/S2820-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 507--SUPPORTING THE MISSION AND GOALS OF NATIONAL \nCRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS WEEK IN ORDER TO INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE \n RIGHTS, NEEDS, AND CONCERNS OF VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF CRIME IN THE \n                             UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 509\n\n       Whereas the week of April 7th, 2008, is National Public \n     Health Week, and the theme is ``Climate Change: Our Health in \n     the Balance'';\n       Whereas, since 1996, the American Public Health \n     Association, through its sponsorship of National Public \n     Health Week, has educated the public, policy-makers, and \n     public health professionals about issues important to \n     improving the public's health;\n       Whereas, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), \n     climate change is a significant and emerging threat to public \n     health and the WHO estimates that human-induced changes in \n     the Earth's climate lead to at least 5,000,000 cases of \n     illness and more than 150,000 deaths each year;\n       Whereas, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on \n     Climate Change (IPCC), climate change contributes to the \n     global burden of disease, premature death, and other adverse \n     health impacts due to extreme weather events and changes in \n     infectious disease patterns, air quality, quality and \n     quantity of water and food, ecosystem changes, and economic \n     impacts;\n       Whereas, according to the IPCC, the United States will be \n     challenged by increased heat waves, air pollution, and forest \n     fires during the course of the century, with potential risk \n     for adverse health impacts, such as heat stress and increases \n     in asthma, allergies, and chronic obstructive pulmonary \n     disease;\n       Whereas the Director of the United States Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Julie Gerberding, \n     testified in October 2007 that, ``Climate change is \n     anticipated to have a broad range of impacts on the health of \n     Americans and the nation's public health infrastructure'';\n       Whereas, according to the World Health Organization, the \n     negative public health impacts of climate change will likely \n     disproportionately impact communities that are already \n     vulnerable;\n       Whereas these communities include developing countries, \n     young children, the elderly, people with chronic illnesses or \n     otherwise compromised health, people in underserved \n     communities, communities of color, traditional societies, \n     subsistence farmers, and coastal populations;\n       Whereas it is estimated that more than 900,000,000 people \n     worldwide live in slum-like conditions and are particularly \n     vulnerable to the possible health impacts of climate change \n     due to a lack of access to health care, sanitation, and \n     vulnerability to displacement;\n       Whereas future vulnerability to the health impacts of \n     climate change will depend not only on the degree of climate \n     change the Earth experiences, but also on development and \n     adaptation measures; and\n       Whereas the public health system will be a first-line \n     responder to emergency conditions related to impacts of \n     climate change and plays a key role in informing, educating, \n     and empowering local communities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes ``National Public Health Week'';\n       (2) recognizes the efforts of public health professionals, \n     first responders, States, municipalities, and local \n     communities to incorporate measures to adapt health care \n     systems to address impacts of climate change;\n       (3) recognizes the role of adaptation in preventing impacts \n     of climate change on vulnerable communities, the potential \n     for improvement of health status and health equity through \n     efforts to address climate change, and the need to include \n     health policy in the development of climate responses;\n       (4) encourages further research, interdisciplinary \n     partnership, and collaboration between stakeholders to \n     understand and monitor the health impacts of climate change, \n     for preparedness activities and for improvement of health \n     care infrastructure; and\n       (5) encourages each and every American to learn about the \n     impacts of climate change on health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/09/senate-section/article/S2821-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2821-S2822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4518.

Res. 468\n\n       Whereas 9-1-1 is nationally recognized as the number to \n     call in an emergency to receive immediate help from police, \n     fire, emergency medical services, or other appropriate \n     emergency response entities;\n       Whereas, in 1967, the President's Commission on Law \n     Enforcement and Administration of Justice recommended that a \n     ``single number should be established'' nationwide for \n     reporting emergency situations, and other Federal Government \n     agencies and various governmental officials also supported \n     and encouraged the recommendation;\n       Whereas, in 1968, the American Telephone and Telegraph \n     Company (AT) announced that it would establish the digits \n     9-1-1 as the emergency code throughout the United States;\n       Whereas 9-1-1 was designated by Congress as the national \n     emergency call number under the Wireless Communications and \n     Public Safety Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-81; 113 Stat. \n     1286);\n       Whereas section 102 of the ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 (47 \n     U.S.C. 942 note) declared an enhanced 9-1-1 system to be ``a \n     high national priority'' and part of ``our Nation's homeland \n     security and public safety'';\n       Whereas it is important that policy makers at all levels of \n     government understand the importance of 9-1-1, how the system \n     works today, and the steps that are needed to modernize the \n     9-1-1 system;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is the connection between the eyes \n     and ears of the public and the emergency response system in \n     the United States and is often the first place emergencies of \n     all magnitudes are reported, making 9-1-1 a significant \n     homeland security asset;\n       Whereas more than 6,000 9-1-1 public safety answering \n     points serve more than 3,000 counties and parishes throughout \n     the United States;\n       Whereas dispatchers at public safety answering points \n     answer more than 200,000,000 9-1-1 calls each year in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas a growing number of 9-1-1 calls are made using \n     wireless and Internet Protocol-based communications services;\n       Whereas a growing segment of the population, including the \n     deaf, hard of hearing, and deaf-blind, and individuals with \n     speech disabilities, are increasingly communicating with \n     nontraditional text, video, and instant messaging \n     communications services and expect those services to be able \n     to connect directly to 9-1-1;\n       Whereas the growth and variety of means of communication, \n     including mobile and Internet Protocol-based systems, impose \n     challenges for accessing 9-1-1 and implementing an enhanced \n     9-1-1 system and require increased education and awareness \n     about the capabilities of different means of communication;\n       Whereas numerous other N-1-1 and 800 number services exist \n     for nonemergency situations, including 2-1-1, 3-1-1, 5-1-1, \n     7-1-1, 8-1-1, poison control centers, and mental\n\n[[Page S2826]]\n\n     health hotlines, and the public needs to be educated on when \n     to use those services in addition to or instead of 9-1-1;\n       Whereas international visitors and immigrants make up an \n     increasing percentage of the United States population each \n     year, and visitors and immigrants may have limited knowledge \n     of our emergency calling system;\n       Whereas people of all ages use 9-1-1 and it is critical to \n     educate those people on the proper use of 9-1-1;\n       Whereas senior citizens are at high risk for needing to \n     access to 9-1-1 and many senior citizens are learning to use \n     new technology;\n       Whereas thousands of 9-1-1 calls are made every year by \n     children properly trained in the use of 9-1-1, which saves \n     lives and underscores the critical importance of training \n     children early in life about 9-1-1;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is often misused, including by the \n     placement of prank and nonemergency calls;\n       Whereas misuse of the 9-1-1 system results in costly and \n     inefficient use of 9-1-1 and emergency response resources and \n     needs to be reduced;\n       Whereas parents, teachers, and all other caregivers need to \n     play an active role in 9-1-1 education for children, but will \n     do so only after being first educated themselves;\n       Whereas there are many avenues for 9-1-1 public education, \n     including safety fairs, school presentations, libraries, \n     churches, businesses, public safety answering point tours or \n     open houses, civic organizations, and senior citizen centers;\n       Whereas children, parents, teachers, and the National \n     Parent Teacher Association contribute importantly to the \n     education of children about the importance of 9-1-1 through \n     targeted outreach efforts to public and private school \n     systems;\n       Whereas we as a Nation should strive to host at least 1 \n     educational event regarding the proper use of 9-1-1 in every \n     school in the country every year;\n       Whereas programs to promote proper use of 9-1-1 during \n     National 9-1-1 Education Month could include--\n       (1) public awareness events, including conferences and \n     media outreach, training activities for parents, teachers, \n     school administrators, other caregivers and businesses;\n       (2) educational events in schools and other appropriate \n     venues; and\n       (3) production and distribution of information about the 9-\n     1-1 system designed to educate people of all ages on the \n     importance and proper use of 9-1-1; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States deserve the best \n     education regarding the use of 9-1-1: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2008 as ``National 9-1-1 Education \n     Month''; and\n       (2) urges Government officials, parents, teachers, school \n     administrators, caregivers, businesses, nonprofit \n     organizations, and the people of the United States to observe \n     the month with appropriate ceremonies, training events, and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/09/senate-section/article/S2826-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2826-S2827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONDEMNING THE VIOLENCE IN TIBET AND CALLING FOR RESTRAINT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee be discharged from further consideration of \nS. Res. 504, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 504) condemning the violence in Tibet \n     and calling for restraint by the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China and the people of Tibet.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of a \nresolution condemning the violence in Tibet and calling for restraint \nby the Government of the People's Republic of China and the people of \nTibet.\n  Cosponsoring this resolution with me is Senator Gordon Smith of \nOregon.\n  The measure is also cosponsored by Senator Joe Biden, the Chairman of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senators Klobuchar, Brown, \nCantwell, Dole, Obama, Snowe, Menendez, Voinovich, Schumer, Collins, \nByrd, Murray, Durbin, Lieberman, Stabenow, Sanders, Reed, Clinton and \nFeingold.\n  The resolution also calls for dialogue between the leadership of \nChina and His Holiness the Dalai Lama on meaningful religious and \ncultural autonomy for Tibet within China; the release of individuals \nwho protested in a peaceful manner; a cessation of China's efforts to \n``reeducate'' Tibetan Buddhist monks and nuns; China to open Tibet to \ninternational journalists, as it promised the international community \nit would do during the lead up to the Olympic games; and asks for a \nfull accounting of the protests in Tibet which began in March.\n  Starting on March 10, Tibetan Monks and other Tibetans began \nprotesting in Tibetan autonomous areas of Western China.\n  The protests, begun peacefully by monks who marched in their robes, \nwere an expression of these religious people's desire to practice their \nreligion freely and without government interference.\n  The protesters took this action at great personal risk. Many monks \nand marchers carried pictures of the Dalai Lama, the most revered \nfigure in Tibetan Buddhism. Possession of such a picture is considered \na crime in China.\n  Unfortunately and tragically, on March 14 protests in Lhasa, the \ncapital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, turned violent. Long suppressed \nanimosity boiled over. Innocent people were killed in the violence. \nHomes and businesses were burned in what appears to have been a riot.\n  Over the days and weeks that followed, the protests spread. Protests \nreportedly occurred in 42 separate Chinese counties. Most were \npeaceful, and in some case they were met with brute force by the \nChinese police.\n  This resolution condemns the violence on both sides.\n  The Chinese government has now begun the punishment process.\n  Thousands of paramilitary police and possibly the People's Liberation \nArmy are in Tibet rounding up protest participants.\n  International journalists and official representatives are still \nbeing kept out, making accurate information difficult to obtain.\n  But we know that dozens of people or more have died. And we know that \nmore than 1,000 people have been incarcerated. We know that the \nmonasteries have been surrounded by armed force.\n  On Monday I spoke about the underlying issues including a lack of \nreligious freedom and economic opportunity that have caused Tibetans to \ntake to the streets.\n  I also spoke about my long standing work to open the door between \nChina and San Francisco and about my sincere friendship with China and \nits leaders.\n  Most importantly, I discussed my efforts since 1991 to establish \ndialogue between the Chinese Leadership and the Dalai Lama.\n  I read from letters that I carried from the Dalai Lama to the \nPresident of China in 1992, 1997, and 1998.\n  In those letters, the Dalai Lama expressed that he does not seek \nIndependence as China's leaders assert.\n  In the Dalai Lama's 1998 letter, he wrote:\n       I would like to reiterate here that I am not seeking \n     independence for Tibet. My main concern is for the six \n     million Tibetan people . . . to be able to enjoy the \n     opportunity to fully preserve their civilisation and the \n     distinct Tibetan culture, religion, and language. I am \n     convinced that this could be achieved through genuine \n     autonomy or self-rule within the framework of the People's \n     Republic of China.\n\n  The Dalai Lama neither calls for independence nor supports the use of \nviolence. He has encouraged the Tibetan people to use restraint both in \nTibet and also in the cities, such as San Francisco, where the Olympic \ntorch visits.\n  On Sunday, The Dalai Lama reiterated his call. In a message to the \nTibetan people, he said:\n\n       I want to urge my fellow Tibetans who live in freedom \n     outside Tibet to be extra vigilant as they voice their \n     feelings on the developments in Tibet. We should not engage \n     in any action that could be even remotely interpreted as \n     violent. Even under the most provocative of situations we \n     must not allow our most precious and deeply held values to be \n     compromised. I firmly believe that we will achieve success \n     through our nonviolent path. We must be wise to understand \n     where the unprecedented affection and support for our cause \n     stems from.\n\n  I sincerely hope the people of San Francisco will heed the Dalai \nLama's call.\n  I would like to commend the people of my city for holding a peaceful \nrally and candlelight vigil at San Francisco's United Nations Plaza.\n  And I call on the people of San Francisco that plan to take to the \nstreets today to embrace the nonviolence advocated by the Dalai Lama.\n  As a friend of China and the Dalai Lama, I am saddened to see the \nsituation in Tibet deteriorate to this point.\n  Violence cannot solve this matter.\n  The United States must use its influence to bring the Government of \nChina and the people of Tibet together to\n\n[[Page S2827]]\n\nbegin the process of reconciliation and dialogue.\n  To bring this issue to a settlement, the leaders must be involved.\n  It is in the interest of both the Chinese government and the Tibetan \npeople for the leaders to sit down and negotiate how to bring about \nmeaningful cultural and religious autonomy for the Tibetan people and \nfaith.\n  For nearly three decades, I have worked to bring this about.\n  The events in Tibet over the past month have been tragic.\n  But they renew my commitment and belief.\n  China has an opportunity to negotiate with a moderate leader capable \nof quelling the anger within the new generation of Tibetans.\n  I hope that China's leaders will see this as an opportunity to open \nthe long overdue dialogue with the Dalai Lama.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 504\n\n       Whereas, beginning on March 10, 2008, Tibetans and Tibetan \n     Buddhist monks began demonstrations in Lhasa, the capital of \n     the Tibet Autonomous Region in the People's Republic of \n     China;\n       Whereas those protests spread to elsewhere in the Tibet \n     Autonomous Region and to Tibetan autonomous areas in the \n     Sichuan, Gansu, and Qinghan provinces of China;\n       Whereas long-suppressed resentment prompted violent clashes \n     between demonstrators and government forces in the streets of \n     Lhasa, resulting in innocent civilian casualties, the burning \n     of buildings, and extensive property damage;\n       Whereas Chinese and Tibetan sources report dozens of \n     fatalities and the arrest of more than 1,000 protesters in \n     the Tibet Autonomous Region and surrounding Tibetan areas of \n     China;\n       Whereas Tibet is the center of Tibetan Buddhism and the \n     Dalai Lama is the most revered figure in Tibetan Buddhism;\n       Whereas the Government of China continues to restrict the \n     rights of Tibetan Buddhists to practice their religion \n     freely;\n       Whereas the Dalai Lama has condemned the violence that \n     began on March 14, 2008, and announced his continuing support \n     for the Olympic Games to be held in Beijing, China;\n       Whereas the Dalai Lama has specifically stated that he does \n     not seek independence for Tibet from China and has called for \n     negotiations to bring about meaningful autonomy for Tibet \n     that allows Tibetans to maintain their distinctive identity \n     within China;\n       Whereas the Constitution of the People's Republic of China \n     guarantees freedom of religious belief for all citizens, but \n     the 2007 Annual Report on International Religious Freedom of \n     the Department of State states that ``[d]uring the period \n     covered by this report, the Government [of China]'s respect \n     for freedom of religion remained poor''; and\n       Whereas, following the demonstrations that began on March \n     10, 2008, the Government of China began severely restricting \n     access to journalists and diplomats and creating a shortage \n     of independent verification of the situation on the ground in \n     Tibet: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the violence in Tibet and calls for restraint \n     by the Government of the People's Republic of China and the \n     people of Tibet;\n       (2) calls for a dialogue between the leadership of the \n     Government of China and His Holiness the Dalai Lama on \n     meaningful religious and cultural autonomy for Tibet within \n     China and urges that these discussions take place with all \n     deliberate speed;\n       (3) calls for the release of individuals who protested in a \n     peaceful manner and for medical care for those injured and \n     wounded in the violence that followed the protests;\n       (4) calls on the Government of China to cease its efforts \n     to enter monasteries to `reeducate' monks and nuns, to \n     respect the right of the people of Tibet to speak of the \n     Dalai Lama and possess his photograph, and to respect and \n     protect basic human rights, as provided in the Constitution \n     of the People's Republic of China;\n       (5) calls on the Government of China to honor its \n     commitment to allow international journalists free access to \n     China from mid-2007 to October 17, 2008;\n       (6) calls on the Government of China to provide a full \n     accounting of the March 2008 protests in Tibet, the response \n     of the Government of China, and the manner and number of \n     detentions and deaths that occurred following the protests; \n     and\n       (7) both--\n       (A) calls on the United States Department of State to fully \n     implement the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 6901 \n     note), including the stipulation that the Secretary of State \n     seek ``to establish an office in Lhasa, Tibet, to monitor \n     political, economic, and cultural developments in Tibet'', \n     and also to provide consular protection and citizen services \n     in emergencies; and\n       (B) urges that the agreement to permit China to open \n     further diplomatic missions in the United States should be \n     contingent upon the establishment of a United States \n     Government office in Lhasa, Tibet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/09/senate-section/article/S2827-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2827-S2828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
