Mr. President, it is important that we commemorate \ntoday, the seventh anniversary of the terrorist attacks on September \n11, 2001. This Nation and the world should also remember that the first \nbattle of the war against terror started in the skies over this \ncountry, and it was started not by the military but by an average group \nof American citizens who, by fate, found themselves on Flight 93, which \nhad taken off from New Jersey, headed to San Francisco, CA. When they, \nas a group, figured out their plane had been taken over by terrorists \nwho planned to use that plane and the passengers in it as a weapon of \nmass destruction against the Capitol of the United States, they did an \nextraordinary thing: This group of average citizens made a battle plan \nand executed that plan against America's enemies. This exceptional \ngroup of Americans knew they were risking and sacrificing their lives \nto stop an attack on America, which, in fact, was on the White House or \nthis very building we are in today--this very building, the U.S. \nCapitol. The passengers of Flight 93 faced their enemies without \nhesitation and brought that plane to the ground in Shanksville, PA. \nThat action was the opening battle in the war against terror.\n  Today, people are gathering in New York City at Ground Zero, where \nthe World Trade Towers once stood so proudly. People will gather here \nin the Nation's Capital. This morning, the President observed a moment \nof silence on the White House lawn and then joined those gathering at \nthe Pentagon, at the site where Flight 77 crashed, to dedicate a \nmemorial to those who died in that building--a building that symbolizes \nthe American military, the greatest fighting force in the world.\n  This remembrance is not just taking place in New York and in our \nNation's Capital, it is taking place all across our Nation. Certainly, \nwe are not alone in mourning the 2,975 people--citizens from more than \n90 nations--who died in the terrorist attacks. So our allies and \nfriends mourn with us.\n  These attacks carried out on September 11 changed the way we view our \nworld. Many Americans, for the first time, felt vulnerable. While it \nwas not the first terrorist attack on America, it was the largest on \nour soil since Pearl Harbor. So it is critically important to note that \nthis attack wasn't an isolated incident but a carefully planned \noperation that was part of al-Qaida's war on America. Bin Laden had \nalready declared war on America publicly. It was, at its foundation, an \nattack based on a belief that America was corrupt, decadent, and lacked \nthe courage or the will to vigorously defend its very existence.\n  They were wrong. The attacks that led up to that day--I will just \nmake a note of them--the attacks that led up to that event were:\n  In 1983, there was an attack on the Marine barracks in Beirut, \nLebanon, that killed 241 American servicemen.\n  In 1985, the cruise ship Achille Lauro was hijacked by terrorists, \nand a 70-year-old American passenger was murdered and thrown overboard \nin his wheelchair.\n  In 1985, TWA Flight 847 was hijacked at Athens, and a U.S. Navy diver \ntrying to rescue fellow passengers was murdered.\n  In 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was bombed, leaving 270 dead.\n  In 1993, al-Qaida operatives attacked the World Trade Center and \nbombed it, killing 6 people and injuring 1,042. In June of 1996, 19 \nAmerican servicemembers were killed, with 372 wounded, in the Khobar \nTowers barracks attack in Saudi Arabia.\n  In 1998, the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed, \nkilling 223 and wounding thousands.\n  On October 12, 2000, while a warship of the United States of America, \nthe USS Cole, was harbored in the Yemeni port of Aden for a routine \nfuel stop, a small craft approached and detonated their payload, \nputting a 40-by-60-foot gash in the ship's port side, killing 17 \nAmerican sailors.\n  All of that occurred before the hijacking of those four planes on \nSeptember 11, 2001. Since that day, while there have been attacks on \nEngland, Spain, and around the world, there have been no further \nsuccessful attacks on the United States.\n  Even though we are in an election campaign, it is important for us \nnot to forget that the failure of al-Qaida to launch another attack on \nus is not due to the terrorist organization's relinquishing their \nobjective, renouncing their goal of killing Americans and disrupting \nour lives and economy, but it is a testament to the vigilance of our \nlaw enforcement and military officials and President Bush's bold \ndecision to stop sitting back, stop being on the defensive, and to \ntreat these attacks for what they were--part of a war against the \nUnited States. He firmly declared that we should go after these \nterrorists and any who harbor them and utilize deadly force where \nnecessary. This strategy has worked. No successful attacks have \noccurred since that time on our homeland. I don't think any of us would \nhave felt that was likely the case, or would be the case, on September \n11, 2001, even though I think all of us, as a nation, agreed it was \ntime to move on the offensive. That is the best way to defend our great \ncountry.\n  Since September 11, 2001, 19 attacks have been thwarted in various \nstages of preparation. This chart is difficult to read, but the red \nlines across it indicate some of the successful interventions and \ndefeats of terrorist plans. I will just mention those.\n  In December 2001, Richard Reid attempted to blow up an airplane \nheaded to Miami from Paris, using explosives in his shoe.\n  In May 2002, Jose Padilla, who was charged with conspiring with \nIslamic terrorist groups, planned to set off a dirty bomb in the United \nStates.\n  In September 2002, the Lackawanna Six from Buffalo, NY, were arrested \nand charged with conspiring with terrorist groups.\n  In May 2003, Lyman Faris, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Kashmir \nliving in Columbus, OH, was arrested for plotting the collapse of the \nBrooklyn Bridge.\n  In June 2003, a Virginia jihad network, involving 11 men from \nAlexandria, was arrested for conspiring to support terrorists.\n  In August 2004, members of a terrorist cell were arrested for \nplotting to attack financial institutions in the United States and \nother sites in England.\n  In August 2004, two men were arrested for plotting to bomb a subway \nstation near Madison Square Garden in New York.\n  In August 2004, two leaders of an Albany, NY, mosque were charged \nwith plotting to purchase a shoulder-fired grenade launcher to \nassassinate a Pakistani diplomat in New York.\n  In June 2005, a California father-son terrorist team was charged with \nsupporting terrorism.\n  In August 2005, four men in Los Angeles were accused of conspiring to \nattack National Guard facilities in Los Angeles and other targets in \nthe area.\n  In December 2005, Michael C. Reynolds was arrested by the FBI and \ncharged with being involved in a plot to blow up a Wyoming natural gas \nrefinery.\n  In February 2006, three men from Toledo, OH, were arrested and \ncharged with providing material support to a terrorist organization.\n  In April of 2006, Atlanta natives were accused of conspiring with \nterrorist organizations to attack targets in Washington, DC.\n  In June of 2006, seven men were arrested in Miami and Atlanta and \ncharged with plotting to blow up the Sears Tower in Chicago, as well as \nFBI offices and other buildings.\n  In July 2006, 10 people were arrested after the FBI discovered a plot \nto attack underground transit tunnels in New York.\n  In August of 2006, British authorities stopped a plot to load 10 \ncommercial airliners with liquid explosives and attack sites in New \nYork, Washington, and California. Fifteen men were charged.\n  In March 2007, a senior operative for Osama bin Laden already in \ncustody\n\n[[Page S8331]]\n\nconfesses to have planned September 11 attacks and said he also planned \nattacks on Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, and other sites.\n  In May of 2007, six men were arrested and charged with plotting to \nattack soldiers at Fort Dix, NJ.\n  In June of 2007, four men were charged with plotting to blow up jet \nfuel in a residential neighborhood near JFK Airport in New York.\n  It is quite clear that it is imperative this Nation continue to be \nvigilant and keep these terrorist groups off balance, to keep our \nhomeland and our allies secure.\n  I believe as the years go by, history will view the efforts of the \nU.S. Government favorably in keeping its citizens safe after the \nattacks on September 11, 2001.\n  President Bush made a bold decision. He took decisive action. A \nreorganized intelligence community that Senator Bond talked about was \nput in high gear and has dramatically improved our intelligence \nconcerning terrorist groups. We were not where we should have been. We \nare still not, but we are dramatically improved. The FBI has \ndramatically changed its mode of operation from mere investigation \nafter an attack to preventing further attacks. Unprecedented \ncooperation with and assistance from State and local law enforcement \nhas raised our defensive capabilities and our intelligence-gathering \nnetworks manyfold. It is tremendous the improved relations we have with \nState and local law enforcement, and there are many more of those \nofficers than there are Federal officers.\n  For 7 years, we may thank the Lord and the hard work of so many that \nthis Nation has remained free from terrorist attack. Will it continue? \nWe may all pray that it will, but we know we remain at risk. We know \nfor decades to come there will be some in this world who are willing to \neven give their lives to attack free nations around the world.\n  We must remain vigilant. We must not forget what we have done wrong \nin the past, how we refused to recognize the reality of the threat, as \nthe 9/11 Commission so clearly reported. But we must also not forget \nhow going on the offensive, destroying the bases of operation of the \nradical Islamic networks, of attacking their military infrastructure, \nof attacking their soldiers, of capturing thousands and killing \nthousands of their operatives has made us safe and have put the \nterrorists on the defensive.\n  Despite what some say, these efforts have gained worldwide support. \nThe terrorists are losing support throughout the world. Al-Qaida made \nIraq the central front against the United States and poured people into \nthat country. But they made a bad decision to challenge the \nmagnificent, courageous, and lethal U.S. military.\n  Recent reports have declared that al-Qaida in Iraq has been \ndecimated. There may still be some left, but the power of that network \nthat 2 or 3 years ago existed has been decimated today, most experts \nsay.\n  So let's remember what we have done right. Also, we must keep these \nefforts up because it may well take decades before we will be \nvictorious in this effort. If we remain firm, if this Nation continues \nto be smart, determined, and dedicated, their doom is sure. This group \ncannot defeat us. They may succeed with an attack here, they may \nsucceed with an attack there, but if we have the will, if we have the \ncourage, if we have the maturity, if we have the determination to \nremember those heroic people who started this war defending this very \nCapitol Building, who gave their lives in Pennsylvania for us--and we \nwill honor their memory and honor the memory of those in New York City \nand honor the memory of those in the Pentagon and on the ship, the USS \nCole--we will honor them by being firm, being faithful. We will be \nsuccessful.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 7 years ago today 19 people conspired to \nkill nearly 3,000 people in our country. It was by far, as we know, the \nmost deadly civilian attack ever carried out on American soil. The \nimages and sounds from that fateful morning continue to haunt us. As we \ncontinue to mourn those lost that day, today flags fly at half-staff in \ntheir honor. They were men, they were women, they were children, they \nwere people of various nationalities and faiths. They were firefighters \nand police officers and emergency medical services personnel. They were \ninvestment bankers and convenience store clerks. They were attendants \nand pilots.\n  Four of the victims were Ohioans: Wendy Faulkner from Mason; William \nDavid Moskal from Brecksville; Christina Ryook from Cleveland; LTC \nDavid Scales from Cleveland.\n  We should remember these names represent lives cut needlessly short. \nWe should remember the families who will forever miss them. We should \nremember the EMS personnel, the police officers and firefighters who \nresponded to the attack when these names represented perfect \nstrangers--perfect strangers whose circumstances met the simple \ncriteria first responders use to determine when to take action: Someone \nneeds help.\n  Hundreds of first responders risked and, in many cases, sacrificed \ntheir own lives to save others. So many of them died, so many of them \nwere injured, so many of them have suffered illnesses as a result of \ntheir actions.\n  First responders in Ohio and all across this country continue to \nstand at the ready every day, ready to protect our families, ready to \nprotect our communities at a moment's notice, and every day in this \ncountry they are there when buildings burn, when accident victims need \ntreatment, when expectant mothers go into labor unexpectedly, when \ncitizens need rescue. When other civilians are running away, they are \nrunning in.\n  It is nearly impossible to see today's date and not think back on the \nattacks of 7 years ago. But let's be sure to do more than to recount \nthe images, the sounds, and the conversations that define our own \npersonal experience of September 11.\n  Let's also remember and honor the heroic first responders, the \ninnocent victims, and the victims' families left behind. Let's never, \nMr. President, forget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning 7 years to the minute since \nthe terrorist attacks on the Nation, I attended the inauguration and \ndedication of the Pentagon Memorial. There have been countless personal \nmemorials over the years. The Pentagon Memorial is America's first \nnational memorial to those who died on that heartbreaking day. It is a \nbeautiful, peaceful patch of land on the very spot where American \nAirlines flight 77 smashed into the west wall of the Pentagon. In that \nquiet place, there are 184 stainless steel benches, one bench for each \nof the 184 innocent victims who died at the Pentagon and on that plane \nthat struck it 7 years ago today.\n  Thousands of people were at that ceremony this morning marking the \ndedication and opening of the Pentagon Memorial. They, of course, \nincluded the President and Vice President, the Cabinet, leaders in \nCongress, top military leaders, scores of Members of Congress, along \nwith the survivors of the Pentagon attack and rescue workers who were \nthe true heroes of the day. Most poignantly, we were joined by hundreds \nof husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, friends of the \nloved ones who perished at the Pentagon.\n  While 9/11 comes once a year, for 9/11 families, every day brings \npainful reminders of what and whom they have lost. Their pain is still \nheartbreaking.\n  It was the families of the Pentagon victims who spearheaded the \neffort to create the Pentagon Memorial. We all hope they can find some \nmeasure of peace and comfort in their fine work in the creation of this \nmemorial.\n  Yesterday afternoon I had a chance to visit in my office with a man \nwith a small company near Chicago, IL, who worked for over a year to \nfinish and polish the 184 stainless steel benches that make up the \nPentagon Memorial. He lives and works in Elk Grove Village in Arlington \nHeights, and his name is Abe Yousif.\n  Abe came to America 29 years ago from Iraq. Abe's beautiful wife \nAngela moved to America 27 years ago, also\n\n[[Page S8332]]\n\nfrom Iraq. The 23 employees of their little company, many of them are \nimmigrants, too, from Mexico, Bosnia, and many other countries.\n  For more than a year, they have worked for this day when there would \nbe an official opening of this Pentagon Memorial. Their job was to take \nthese raw metal benches, 184 of these benches, and polish them as \nsmooth as glass. Abe calculated for me the amount of time he and his \nemployees put into this work. They worked nearly 17,000 hours grinding \nand polishing these stainless steel benches, transforming them into \nperfectly uniform, flawlessly smooth memorials.\n  Abe and his workers hoped that by making each bench perfect, they \nmight be able to give something back to a country that has given them \nso much. They hope that the calm, clear lines of their work might bring \na sense of healing to a wounded nation and bring some beauty to a place \nscarred by tragedy.\n  Many people will look across this memorial. They will see these \nfinely polished stainless steel benches and assume somewhere there was \na machine that just churned them out. No, it was the hard work and \nsweat of Abe Yousif and his employees who took this on not just as \nanother project but as a project of love.\n  When I think of 9/11, I recall, as every American does, what I was \ndoing. I was just a few steps away from here in the Capitol Building in \na meeting of the Democratic leadership with Senator Tom Daschle. The \nmeeting had just started when we heard about the planes crashing into \nthe World Trade Center in New York.\n  As the meeting continued, Tom was handed a note that we were going to \nhave to evacuate the Capitol. We looked down The Mall toward the \nWashington Monument and saw black, billowing smoke coming from across \nthe river. We didn't know what happened. We thought perhaps a bomb had \nbeen detonated. In fact, it was American Airlines flight 77 that \ncrashed into the Pentagon causing so many deaths of so many innocent \npeople.\n  We evacuated and raced to the yard outside the Capitol, people \nmilling around not knowing where to turn. We heard the sonic booms from \njets that were being scrambled and wondered if there were detonation of \nbombs or something worse. We just didn't know.\n  One of the staffers I had at that time was Pat Sargent. Pat is an \nofficer in the U.S. Army. Occasionally, the Army will detail some of \nits professionals to work on Capitol Hill for a short time. Pat was \nterrific, one of our best employees. But he had a special interest in \nthe Pentagon that day because his wife Sherry, also in the U.S. Army, \nwas working there.\n  When Pat heard about the smoke and damage at the Pentagon, he raced \nout to catch the last commuter bus that runs between Capitol Hill and \nthe Pentagon, the last one to make it across the bridge. He was \ndesperate to find his wife.\n  He went there, and there was a sea of humanity, of people who \nevacuated the Pentagon lined up on the hills around it. He searched and \nsearched until he finally found her, and she was safe. That was the \ngood news of the day, along with the tragedy that so many of her fellow \nworkers had died.\n  Sherry had been in the room near the spot where that plane crashed. \nShe lingered for a moment to watch the scenes of New York on television \nwhile some of her fellow workers went back to their desks. Those \nworkers perished when the plane crashed into the Pentagon. She was \nspared.\n  Of course, they appreciate the heroism of those who responded, and \nall the memorials that were given to this country, but I want to give a \nspecial tribute to Pat and Sherry and their daughter Samantha for their \ndedication to this country. You see, when Pat left my office, he \ncontinued to serve in the U.S. Army. He is in Iraq today in a command \nposition with major responsibilities for the medical care of our troops \nand the people of Iraq. He is a true American hero, as is his wife. \nThey have given so much to this country.\n  I thank the Lord that they were spared that day; that they were able \nto continue in their service to the country, along with so many others, \nbut I do remember those who worked right alongside her who were not so \nfortunate. That is what our gathering was about today. Every year on \nSeptember 11 we remember the horror and shock of that day and the grief \nthat followed. But we remember something else. We remember the \ntremendous sense of unity that enveloped our Nation.\n  Buck O'Neill was a man who was legendary in the Negro League as a \nbaseball player. Of course, in those days, a Black man couldn't make it \nto the majors. He became a scout for the Chicago Cubs and signed, among \nother people, Hall of Famers Ernie Banks and Lou Brock. In 1962, he \nbecame the first African-American coach in Major League Baseball \nhistory. He wrote a newspaper column. He has passed away now, but he \nwrote a newspaper column about a year after the 9/11 attacks, and he \nsaid:\n\n       One thing about it is, the attacks brought us together. For \n     a little while there after September 11, it didn't matter if \n     you were Democrat or a Republican. It didn't matter if you \n     were white or black. Yeah. We were Americans. We gave blood. \n     We gave money. We cried. We all cried. That's the America we \n     can be. This is a wonderful country.\n\n  He remembered from his youth some hateful things that were done to \nhim because of his race. He said:\n\n       When I was a young man, I used to see the way hate ripped \n     this country apart. A man would hate me just for the color of \n     my skin. I didn't feel angry. I felt sorry for that man. I \n     wanted to say to him ``Don't you know how great America would \n     be if we could all just get along?'' That's what I saw after \n     September 11. We all got along. I wish we could hold on to \n     that feeling.\n\n  There were strong emotions today at the Pentagon, I am sure in New \nYork, in Pennsylvania, and across the Nation as we remembered the \nseventh anniversary of 9/11. But let us remember 9/12. Let's remember \nthis Nation when it did come together with its allies around the world, \nthe strength that we felt here at home, and the projected strength we \nfelt around the world. Those days can return, and they should return. \nIt is up to each and every one of us, whether we are elected officials \nor people going to work every day to raise a family, to do our best to \nmake that spirit of coming together after 9/11 return.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate those whom \nwe lost on September 11 of 2001, to remember how our Nation responded \nto the pain we felt that day with a towering display of heroism, and to \nurge us to rededicate ourselves to making sure we never have to \nexperience terror on our soil again.\n  That day, the families and friends of nearly 3,000 Americans got the \nworst news imaginable, and almost 700 of them were from my home State \nof New Jersey. They were from all walks of life. We lost mothers, \nfathers, and children. Brothers lost their sisters, neighbors lost \ntheir friends. Today in New Jersey, you can go from town to town--from \nEnglewood to West Windsor, Toms River, Mantua, and Hoboken--and you can \nsee a ceremony in each one. Families in those towns are laying flowers \non the gravestones and monuments and holding tightly one more time onto \nthe pictures of the ones they lost.\n  So many communities were affected in so many ways, not the least of \nwhich was the American community. It felt as if it was a day when there \nwere no borders between us. Terrorists tried to engulf us in the smoke \nof fear and hatred. For a moment, we felt like the whole world went \ndark. But the light of heroism burst through. Individuals rushed into \nburning buildings risking their lives to save others, strangers opened \ntheir homes to help people they didn't even know, and men and women all \nover the country rushed to give whatever they could to help those in \nneed.\n  It was a day when we learned the meaning of Oscar Wilde's words when \nhe said: ``Where there is sorrow, there is holy ground.'' It was a day \nwhen it didn't matter what part of the country you came from, what your \nfamily background was, or anything else. It was a day when we all stood \ntogether as Americans. People from all over the world said: We are \nAmericans today.\n  There was a time when the events of September 11, 2001, gripped us so \nstrongly that our minds couldn't focus on anything else. Yet 7 years \nlater, we\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\nhave to talk about the dangers of forgetting. We have to talk about the \ndangers of forgetting, because 7 years later our obligations have not \ngone away.\n  Our obligations have not gone away to those whom we lost, and to \ntheir families and those who survived the attacks but came away \ninjured. For them, it has been a long and heroic struggle to get by and \nfind some sense of normalcy. People who ran out of burning buildings, \nthe firefighters, EMTs, and other rescue workers who ran in, all \nbreathed thick air as they were saving lives. Today, they are reminded \nof what they have to face with literally every breath they take. We \nthink about them very deeply today, but those heroes triumph every day. \nTheir supply of courage has never run out, and we can never walk out on \nthem.\n  So not forgetting means caring for those whom we lost, and their \nfamilies, and remembering them. But it also means caring for those who \nwere made ill because of the attacks. Not forgetting means supporting \nall the heroes, paid and volunteer, who risked their lives to save \nothers. Not forgetting means securing our ports, chemical and nuclear \nplants, so we don't have to experience another horrendous tragedy in \nthe future, getting Federal grant money to our communities based on the \nrisks they face, getting firefighters the funding they need for new \nequipment and increased personnel, and making sure our first responders \ncan talk to each other during an emergency. And let's be very clear: \nNot forgetting means destroying the terrorist network that planned the \nattacks and bringing those responsible to justice.\n  Today, September 11 of 2008, we remember what has been lost, and we \nfind strength in what we still have. No amount of time can ultimately \nheal what has been seared into our hearts and minds since September 11, \n2001. But those wounds continue to drive us to make sure that no New \nJersyan, no American ever has to experience them again. If we come \ntogether now, as we did on one of the darkest days of our history, then \nI believe our future can be filled with security, prosperity, and hope. \nOn this day in which we remember that darkest day, we can see the light \nand our brightest days are yet to come.\n  Once again, my thoughts and prayers go out to the 700 New Jersyans \nwho were lost on that fateful day, for their families who live with \nthis for the rest of their lives and for which this day has an \nincredible resonance in their lives far beyond what anyone can imagine. \nBut for votes here in the Senate, I would be in New Jersey today, and I \nwanted to take to the floor to let them know that we are one with them \non this most sacred day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/11/senate-section/article/S8333-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we had an announcement yesterday by the \nSecretary of Defense on the procurement question for the tanker for the \nU.S. Air Force that is very disturbing and disappointing to me. \nBasically, the history of that was that the Secretary and the U.S. Air \nForce had evaluated the two competing bids and had selected the \nNorthrop team's bid as the best aircraft and best buy for the country.\n  The GAO, Government Accountability Office, reviewed that and said the \nAir Force had made errors. I did not think great errors, but they said \nthere were errors and they ought to review the process. The Secretary \nof Defense said he, in effect, was disappointed those errors had \noccurred and he personally would take the process under the Department \nof Defense's jurisdiction and he would direct individuals to evaluate \nthe two bids and to make a decision on what the best aircraft would be \nand the best buy for the American warfighter.\n  Remember that the Air Force had declared that replacing the 50-, 60-\nyear-old tanker fleet was their No. 1 priority in the entire U.S. Air \nForce. For those of us who know about the Air Force and know how much \nthey like fighters and those kinds of aircraft, for them to say that \nwas a significant thing. So we were proceeding along that path. \nSecretary Gates said he was going to do it fairly and objectively, and \nhe would do his best to complete the process by the end of the year. So \nhis announcement yesterday that they could not complete it at the end \nof the year, that there has been controversy about this, and that he \nwould, therefore, put it off and cancel the bid process and let the \nnext Congress and next President deal with it was a bad mistake. It was \ncontrary to what he had said in the country needed to be done a few \nmonths ago.\n  I think this is a matter he made a mistake on. I respect Secretary \nGates. I was pleased when he stood up and said: We need this tanker. We \nneed to get this done. We are going to get it done. I am personally \ngoing to be responsible to ensure it is done right and fair. Then, to \nwalk away from that, and to leave the impression the reason that \noccurred was because of a political brouhaha going on, and Members of \nCongress fussing here and there and making comments was doubly \ndisturbing.\n  My view has always been the Department of Defense ought to pick the \nbest aircraft, and I thought they had when they chose the plane they \ndid. I will note the aircraft Northrop Grumman/EADS had offered was 16 \nyears newer than the aircraft Boeing had submitted, it would have much \nmore capabilities, and was a better aircraft. That is what it was, and \nthat is how it was selected. The Northrop team submitted a very frugal \nbid, and even though it was an aircraft that had more capabilities, it \nwas very competitive or lower on price. So I thought we were heading in \nthe right direction.\n  I will note for the record I was involved in this early on. When \nSenator McCain questioned a lease agreement that was entered into with \nthe Boeing company, he felt something was not healthy there and he \nobjected. It was going to release 60 of these aircraft. They had not \nbeen bid. It was a sole-source contract. It did not go through the \nArmed Services Committee. But it was actually done through the \nAppropriations Committee without the\n\n[[Page S8334]]\n\nArmed Services Committee studying the issue or looking at it. After all \nthat happened--and it is unfortunate people went to jail over it in the \nAir Force, and others--we ordered, the Congress did, that a bid process \ntake place. There were two bidders. Only two entities could supply this \nkind of aircraft. The Air Force selected the one they thought was best.\n  Some people did not like that, and we had a big fuss, and now we are \nat a position where we could literally be looking at a delay of 2 or 3 \nmore years. It has already been delayed about 7 years. This is very \ndisturbing and very concerning to me ultimately because the Air Force \nis going to be further delayed, substantially, in a new aircraft being \nchosen and put into the fleet. It can save money in the long run \nbecause it will be newer, require less upkeep and maintenance, carry \nmore fuel, and it has more capability. It can do the work of three \nairplanes at once.\n  I know Senator Warner and others on our committee, when this issue \narose--Senator Levin and Senator McCain--felt that a bid was the right \nthing to do. We ordered that we pass legislation to do that. I am sorry \nthe Defense Department seems to have given up and punted it. Many are \nestimating this could result in a delay of 3 years before the matter \ncomes to a conclusion now.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, actually it was \na series of appropriations. The committee approved it in the House and \nthe Senate--the House Armed Services Committee. When it came to our \ncommittee--at that time I was the chairman--we decided this contract \nwas not right, and a lot of work subsequent to that has been done to \ntry to correct it. The Deputy Secretary of Defense contacted me \nyesterday. I look upon this latest development with some concern \nbecause this airplane is needed for the U.S. inventory.\n  But I thank the Senator for his support through the years. It was our \ncommittee that stopped that contract which we felt was faulty at that \ntime, and the rest is history.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I could not agree more, I say to Senator Warner. I \nthank the Senator for his leadership at that time. Basically, it did \npoint out, did it not, I ask Senator Warner, that the authorizing \ncommittee is a valuable committee and that those kinds of major \nprograms should be taken through the committee of authorization? Would \nthe Senator agree to that as a matter of historical perspective here in \nthe Senate?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I share the views of my distinguished good \nfriend.\n  Mr. President, I have been informed--and I will await the leadership \nto make the formal announcements--but I do believe we are going to move \nto some votes, hopefully, this afternoon on our bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

I ask unanimous consent to be recognized and speak for a \nmoment on this day, 9/11.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we just commemorated a moment of silence \nfor those who were lost on 9/11. Of course, for the husbands and wives, \nsons and daughters, fathers and mothers and friends, that moment of \nsilence, in a sense, lasts every day, every moment.\n  In New York, of course, we lost close to 3,000 people. Some people I \nknew--a person I played basketball with in high school; a firefighter I \nwas close to and worked with to encourage people to donate blood; a \nbusiness man who helped me on the way up; the range of people who were \nlost in every walk of life, every ethnic group, every profession, in \nevery way of thinking. The enormity still, 7 years later, is hard to \nhave it sink in. Furthermore, when one thinks of just the uselessness \nof this tragedy, it is even more confounding.\n  There are many things to say in the advent of 9/11 that would be \nrelevant on this floor, but today is not the day for that. Today we \njust think and remember and try to do everything we can to give solace \nto those we know who mourn and will mourn for the rest of their lives \nthe senselessness of this tragedy that took loved ones from them.\n  So I just wish to say to those who do walk around with holes in their \nhearts as a result of 9/11: We will never forget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may just for a moment echo the \ncomments of the Senator from New York, this morning I watched on \ntelevision the ceremony at the Pentagon. As I watched the calling of \nthe names, a photo flashed on the screen of each individual. What you \nsaw were young military men, you saw a lieutenant colonel, you saw the \nfaces of whole families wiped out, young people, older people, you saw \nevery race. In a sense, when you looked at the benches and the water \nflowing under the benches and the maples that will grow around them, as \nyou listened to the sad song of the pipers, you realized what a great \ncountry this is and how we respect every single human life and how \nimportant that is; also, how important it is that the message remain \ntrue, that the message remain full of heart but also full of vigilance \nthat this must never happen again in our homeland.\n  So I wish to join Senator Schumer and send our best wishes, our \nsympathy, our sorrow to these families 7 years later, and our thanks to \nthose who gave their lives in the Pentagon.\n  I had a chance to sit down with the family of a captain of the \nAmerican Airlines plane that flew into the Pentagon. It was very \nrevealing because at the time they were convinced it was the heroic \ngesture of this captain in turning the plane away from the U.S. Capitol \nthat played a role. I want them to know that I was thinking of them \nboth during the Pentagon ceremony and the ceremony in front of the \nCapitol.\n  So all those victims remain in our hearts and in our minds, and we \nconsecrate ourselves to work on their behalf.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \ninnocent Americans who were killed in the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001. I ask that we commemorate the emergency responders \nwho provided relief in the aftermath of the attacks. I also ask that we \nsalute our brave men and women in uniform who have volunteered to serve \ntheir country in this time of need. Not to be forgotten are the \nfamilies who support our troops and the families who lost loved ones on \nthis tragic day; to them we must also pay tribute.\n  We should continue to remember the family of Al Marchand from \nAlamogordo, NM, a flight attendant on United Airlines flight 175 and \none of the first casualties on that horrific day. He and his family \nremain in my thoughts and those of my fellow New Mexicans. Since that \nday, many New Mexicans have volunteered to serve their country by \nentering the ranks of our Armed Forces. Some of these brave men and \nwomen today live with the injuries and scars they received in this \nfight. Sadly, some lost their lives in\n\n[[Page S8335]]\n\nthis war to protect our way of life. I pay tribute to Army SSG Kevin C. \nRoberts of Farmington, NM, and Army SGT Gary D. Willett of Alamogordo, \nNM, the two most recent casualties from New Mexico in the ongoing \nglobal war on terror.\n  Seven years have passed since al-Qaida terrorists struck our \nhomeland. Yet even after 7 years, threats against our country still \nexist. We must continue on with vigilance and remain dedicated to the \nprotection and security of our great Nation. Even now, the images and \nshock of that day are still with me. And while I am, years later, still \nsaddened by our losses, I am also heartened by all the heroic acts of \nour citizens in what was the most shocking attack on our homeland. In \nthe months following the attacks, our brave men and women in uniform \ntoppled the regime in Afghanistan that provided a base of operations \nfor the terrorists who carried out the 2001 attacks. We helped that \ncountry establish a democratic government and are working with allies \nin NATO to bring peace and stability to a country that has spent much \nof its recent history in the mire of civil war. It is a dangerous \nmission that continues today.\n  One of the important lessons that political and military leaders \nlearned from the 2001 terrorist attacks was that America cannot stand \nby idly as threats to its security develop far from our shores. This \nrequired our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to work with \nfriends and allies around the world and with each other to gather \nactionable intelligence that would help us disrupt terrorist plots at \nhome and abroad. To help consolidate our domestic defense system, the \nCongress created the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of \nHomeland Security was organized to prevent attacks within the United \nStates, reduce America's vulnerability to terrorism, and to minimize \nthe damage and assist in the recovery from terrorists' attacks in \nAmerica. The Congress also followed the recommendations of the National \nCommission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States--the 9/11 \nCommission--and passed historic legislation that reformed the agencies \nthat make up our intelligence community. While these reforms were \nimportant and necessary, the disruption of a recent plot to hijack \nplanes flying from London to the United States, shows us that our \nenemies are still bent on bringing terror into our cities.\n  Many of my fellow citizens from the State of New Mexico have \ncontributed to strengthening our defenses in the global war on terror. \nAn urban rescue team traveled from New Mexico to Virginia to help \nrecover survivors from the ruins at the Pentagon. Sandia and Los Alamos \nNational Laboratories helped identify the strains of anthrax that were \nfound in government and office buildings shortly after the terrorist \nattacks. They helped develop a biological threat detection system that \nwas deployed at the 2002 Winter Olympics, the 2004 Summer Olympics, and \nin locations around our Nation's Capital. The National Labs have also \nbeen at the forefront in developing tools to detect and dispose of \nmaterials that can be made used as a ``dirty bomb'' or other weapon of \nmass destruction. Finally, the National Infrastructure and Analysis \nCenter, NISAC, is being used to develop response strategies for \ngovernment officials and first responders for large and complex crises.\n  Over the past 7 years, we have learned a good deal more about how the \nattack was planned and executed, and we have spent countless man hours \nand resources to make our Nation safer. We can be proud of the fact \nthat we have worked to implement most of the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations. We are more prepared as a nation for these types of \ndangers than we were prior to September 11, 2001, but this is a \nstruggle that will not end with the same clarity and decisiveness of \nbattles past. Therefore, even as we continue to adjust to a post-9/11 \nworld, we must remain vigilant in our efforts to prevent such a tragedy \nfrom occurring on American soil again. I hope all Americans take time \nto reflect on the events of September 11, 2001, honor those that have \nfallen, and rededicate themselves for the struggle ahead.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, 7 years ago, nearly 3,000 Americans \nperished in the worst terrorist attack on our soil. Today, let us \nremember the innocent lives lost in New York, Washington, and \nPennsylvania and continue to pray for healing for their families.\n  The stories of their heroism, compassion, and last words spoken to a \nloved one all serve to inspire and remind us of the pain of that tragic \nday.\n  This anniversary is a somber reminder of the serious threats we face. \nGenerations of Americans have fought for our country's freedom, and on \nthis day, we can take solace in knowing our nation remains committed to \npreserving that blessing.\n  Since 9/11, the United States has led a global campaign against \nterrorism. Our Nation is safer because of the sacrifices of those \nserving in the cause of freedom, including the men and women of our \nArmed Forces, our National Guard, and our intelligence communities.\n  Our effort has been enhanced by the cooperation of allied nations \nthat share our desire to see a world dominated by peace, freedom, and \nthe rule of law.\n  On this day, let us remember those Americans who lost their lives in \nthe attacks of 9/11, those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in \ndefense of our country, and those who continue to defend our Nation \ntoday. God bless these individuals and their families, and may God \nbless America.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, like any other day, Americans \nwill be busy getting to work, getting the kids off to school, and \ngetting dinner on the table. Despite all those demands, however, today \nAmericans will also pause to remember, with deep sadness, the terrible \nevents that occurred on September 11, 2001. We are united by that \nsadness, just as we are united by our conviction that we must do \neverything in our power to prevent another such tragedy.\n  Our common purpose today is to honor the memory of those who lost \ntheir lives on September 11, 2001; to remember a day that began like \nany other, but quickly descended into chaos, with fire and smoke that \nengulfed the World Trade Towers, billowed out of the Pentagon, and rose \nfrom an empty field near Shanksville, PA. But 7 years later, we not \nonly remember what was lost, but what rose from the ashes, because \nsince that day we have all learned a great deal about the strength of \nthe American people. September ll reminds us how resilient we are as a \nnation, and in a time when our Nation faces so many challenges at home \nand abroad, that reservoir of strength is invaluable.\n  It is with great pride in the American people, and deep gratitude to \npeople around the world who stood with us on that day, that I remember \nthat day, and its aftermath. I have so often thought, then and now, how \nsenseless those attacks were, and how people from all over the world \nperished alongside so many Americans. It is our great diversity of \nevery kind--of our people, our culture, our geography--that makes us \nsuch a strong and vibrant country. No act, however terrible, has ever \nchanged that, or ever will.\n  This is a difficult day for all of us, but especially for those who \nlost loved ones on that day. We share in their sorrow, even though we \ncannot imagine their pain. In a day that may otherwise seem ordinary, \nwe are all jolted back to the tragic events of that day in September \nwhich began with such calm, blue skies. It was a day unlike any we have \never known and unlike any we hope to see ever again. Seven years later, \nhowever, it is heartening to see how we have moved forward from that \ntragedy. More than ever, we are committed to our communities, to each \nother, and to this great Nation and its highest ideals. That is where \nour resilience lies, and, on this day of all days, that is what makes \nus stronger as a nation and as a people.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, on this day of commemoration, 7 years \nafter the attack here on American soil, I think it is very important \nand proper for all of us here in the Senate and all across America to \nstop and reflect on the great peace and security we have in America; \nthe fact that there are so many policemen and first responders and \nothers who make sure America remains safe.\n  And to be sure, today it is important for us to remember those who \ngave their lives on 9/11--those who died in the field in Pennsylvania, \nand those who died at the Pentagon and in New York City.\n\n[[Page S8336]]\n\n  It is also important, as we reflect on 9/11 and the events of, now, 7 \nyears ago, to recognize the more than half a million men and women who \nwear the uniform of a firefighter or a law enforcement officer in our \nNation. These men and women who are out there on the front lines of law \nenforcement really are the ones who keep America safe day and night, 24 \nhours a day, 7 days a week. We are able to live in the security of our \nhomes, our communities, and counties in large part because we have more \nthan half a million men and women who are out there every day making \nsure the laws of the Nation are upheld.\n  So today, as we commemorate that horrific tragedy of 7 years ago, it \nis important that we commemorate the lives of those who gave their \nlives that day and the lives of the families of those who died and were \nhurt that day. It also is important for us to recognize the great \nsacrifice and contribution of the men and women of law enforcement of \nAmerica as well as the firefighters and first responders of our great \ncountry.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today is a time for reflection and \nreview of a particular moment in American history that is not yet fully \nestablished in the manner I believe it should be. America changed more \non this day 7 years ago than perhaps at any other time in our history, \nsave those moments we were at war. But the effects that linger on are \nfar greater than those when we were engaged in wars or experienced \nnatural disasters.\n  Our world has changed so much since that day, September 11, 2001, \nbecause we are reminded every day at some point in time, sometimes \nseveral points in time, about what changed. Our freedoms were \nsubstantially chipped away. One can't go anyplace--and this affects all \nages, including our young friends who are pages this year--without \nhaving an ID card, without waiting in long lines, such as with \ntransportation at an airport, without seeing uniformed personnel all \nover, keeping an eye out for terrorists, unable to move with the same \nfreedom we knew before 9/11.\n  Though it is 7 years ago that this terrible catastrophe happened, the \nfact is, on this day, as with any other day, I stopped to have my car \nexamined. I had the dogs sniffing around to see if we were carrying \nanything that might represent a threat in our vehicles. Much of it \nstarted with 9/11.\n  Today we mark the seventh year since America experienced the worst \nterrorist attacks in our history. We as a nation honor the memories of \nthe Americans who died on that tragic day. We mourn with 3,000 \nfamilies, including 700 families from New Jersey who lost loved ones. \nOver the past 7 years, wives, sisters, husbands, and sons have worked \nto rebuild their lives, their families, and their futures. They came \nfrom every walk of life, from every economic background. They have \nforged ahead despite the uncertainty of what tomorrow would hold.\n  As one 30-year-old widow from Middletown, NJ, put it: There is no \nguidebook for how a mother of a toddler whose husband was killed by \nterrorists is supposed to carry on with her life.\n  There is no instruction that is satisfactory. There is no help that \nis fully accommodated. But these folks have carried on. Many have done \nit by joining together and giving each other hope. They came together \nto trade stories about their lives, about the men and women they lost, \nto drive each other to support groups, to pick up each other's kids \nfrom schools, to celebrate birthdays, and to fight for a shared cause. \nRemember, it was the families of the victims who regularly piled into \nthe minivans, came to Washington, pushed lawmakers to create the 9/11 \nCommission. Despite the shock they experienced and the sadness they \nstill felt, they were committed to the future, to try to make sure that \na tragedy such as this would never happen again to anyone.\n  That commitment led to crucial policy recommendations, such as \nimprovements in port security and sending Federal funds to cities and \ntowns based on the most vulnerable to terrorist attack. We had debate \non the Senate floor about whether port security funds would be \ndistributed on the basis of risk, as recommended by the 9/11 \nCommission, or distributed based on politics. We fought and made sure \nin the last couple of years to direct those funds to areas of most \nvulnerability.\n  I was once, before I came to the Senate, commissioner of the Port \nAuthority of New York and New Jersey. I worked in the World Trade \nCenter. I remember vividly traveling to my office on the 67th floor of \nthe Twin Towers and looking out at the views from those towers, \nthinking about how invincible those buildings were, built with steel, \nconcrete, a great design, a hundred stories high. Nothing, you \nbelieved, could ever happen there that would provide some insecurity \nfor those who were working in the building. I remind everybody that we \nhad a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center some years before 9/\n11, when people drove a truck loaded with explosives into the garage of \nthe building, and it was detonated with great damage. But the building \nstood firm. Nothing could shake the well-being of that structure. But \nthen we saw something different.\n  I got to know many port authority employees who perished when those \nmassive towers collapsed. The port authority lost 84 of its own that \nday, including 37 members of the police department who died as they \ntried to rescue others, people who ventured into the dust and the heat \nand the destruction of the building trying to help others. They gave \ntheir lives, knowing very well that the position they were taking was \none of great vulnerability, but they did it in any event.\n  Among the people lost was a very close friend of my daughter. Both of \nthem worked downtown in a financial firm. My daughter left to go to law \nschool, and her friend went to work for a company called Cantor \nFitzgerald. She had three children. Her husband searched far and wide, \nfrom hospitals to clinics, every information source available, because \nhe couldn't believe his wife was gone, that the mother of his children \nwould no longer be there. After 3 weeks, after visiting all of the \nfacilities searching for every bit of information he could find, he and \nhis three young children were forced to accept her death.\n  There was a young man I knew, very energetic young man. He tried life \nas a golf professional. He learned computer skills. His name was \nNicholas Lassman. He was still in his twenties. He described his \nenthusiasm to me one day about how he was looking forward to a new job \nthat he had at the Trade Center. He perished that day.\n  We will always remember those who died, the firefighters, computer \nprogrammers. The firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, lost 700 of its employees \nthat day. It is a firm I know very well. The President and CEO of that \ncompany, a very charitable, wonderful, still young fellow, whose \nlateness saved his life because he had to take his daughter to school, \nlost 700 others--700--including his brother and a lot of friends. This \nwas a fellow who believed in loyalty as a trait above all for people in \nhis organization. So he hired a lot of his friends from the place he \ngrew up. I believe it was Brooklyn. Thusly, not only did his brother \ndie, but lots of his friends perished during those same tragic moments.\n\n  The people who died left a loss that binds our Nation, and today, in \nNew Jersey and across this country, we are honoring them in many ways.\n  There are events in New Jersey, events we saw this morning at Ground \nZero. We had our moment of silence and our gathering together outside \nto hear some prayers and to listen to some music that reminds us of the \ngreatness of our country.\n  In the city of Bayonne, we remember them at a monument called the \nTear of Grief because Bayonne is one of those cities along the Hudson \nRiver from which lots of people commuted to the World Trade Center. The \nWorld Trade Center each day would see more than 50,000 people come \nthere. It was like whole cities across our country. That is how big \nthose buildings were. People would come--a lot by train, a lot by \nsubway, by all kinds of means--who would come from all around the area \nto go to work or to have meetings there. So these are communities that \nare along the river, such as Bayonne.\n  Hoboken I was there at the dedication of a little park along the \nwaterside that is called the Pier ``A'' Park. In Leonia--another town \nalong the way--we remember them with two\n\n[[Page S8337]]\n\ngranite towers that stand there as a reminder. In Jersey City there was \na memorial put there called the Grove of Remembrance in Liberty State \nPark, just under the shadow of the Statue of Liberty--historic places.\n  But the best monument to those who died that day is to learn from the \nexperience and to bring those perpetrators to justice and make our \ncountry safe. After that group of madmen destroyed the World Trade \nCenter and damaged the Pentagon, we vowed to search for those who \norchestrated these terrible acts and to make them pay for their \natrocious deeds. But we know they are still out there. In fact, 2,558 \ndays since 9/11, terrorism is on the rise, more threatening, perhaps \nmore obvious than at any time, more obvious than at any time predating \n9/11.\n  Terrorism is there challenging us in places around the world, \nespecially in our own country here. Al-Qaida is on the move. Osama bin \nLaden is still on the loose. What has happened? We have to continue the \npursuit of these perpetrators so we can say to the people who are \ninnocently living their lives that they need not be worried about a \nterrorist attack. But we have not done that yet. We still have to \ncontinue our obligation.\n  We have a ruthless enemy out there, one whose front line is our \nhomefront. The stretch from Port Newark, NJ, our harbor, to Newark \nLiberty International Airport is defined by the FBI as the most \ndangerous 2-mile stretch in the country that invites a terrorist \nattack. I say, again, we had to fight to get funding to protect to the \nfullest extent we could that area, that target that, if attacked, would \ninjure or kill as many as several million people. It is a highly \npopulated area, with a big chemical manufacturer there. We had to have \nassistance from the Federal Government to make sure we mounted as much \nprotection as we could.\n  On the anniversary of 9/11, we commemorate the memory of those who \nperished 7 years ago, and we stand with their families whose future is \nour cause. It is critical for their future, for their families, our \nfamilies, that we continue to protect the country the victims died for, \nthe loved ones they left behind, and the freedoms they hold dear.\n  I yield the floor with a thought as to the pictures I saw of what the \nreaction was from people around the world when they saw the attack on \nAmerica that day. One picture was taken in Israel, a very dear, vital \nfriend to America. In that little country, that tiny country, people \nwere weeping for America, crying giant tears--this small country for \nthe giant--to put things into perspective to understand how this attack \nmenaced everybody in the world no matter what their distance was from \nus, that they cried for America. We must not permit such an act of \nterrorism to happen again.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, on an otherwise beautiful September morning \n7 years ago today, our Nation experienced the greatest of tragedies. \nThe United States was brutally and deliberately attacked. Terrorists \ntook innocent American lives on sovereign American soil.\n  This tragedy was brought to our shores by those who seek to destroy \nthe American dream. The perpetrators declared war on the clearest \nsymbols of our way of life: The Twin Towers in Manhattan, the center of \nAmerican capitalism and prosperity; the Pentagon in Arlington, VA, a \nbuilding that represents the strongest guarantor of freedom in history. \nA third target, either the White House or the U.S. Capitol, was spared \nonly because of the brave and selfless passengers aboard United \nAirlines Flight 93, which crashed near Shanksville, PA.\n  The Civil War once tested the survivability of a nation founded on \nthe concept that every citizen is endowed with fundamental freedoms. In \nthe 7 years since September 11, we have tested America's devotion to \nthese founding principles, bringing to this body a debate over where to \ndraw the line between protecting liberties and preventing another \nattack. As a nation, I believe we have found a balanced solution to \nthis challenge. And when we remember and defend the truths our founding \nfathers knew to be self-evident, we strengthen them for the next \ngeneration. We have done this all the while defending this great nation \nfrom another attack. And that is an accomplishment worth noting.\n  I know that in this hyper political season, we sometimes fail to see \nbeyond daily politics and rhetoric. But it is my hope that as we \ncontinue to examine our freedoms in the context of fighting terrorism, \nwe will not lose sight of what they mean for us here at home. This \nmorning, President Bush dedicated the Pentagon Memorial in remembrance \nof 184 innocent Americans taken from us that morning. We do not \nidentify the fallen as old or young, man or woman, black or white, \nJewish or Protestant. We identify them as fellow Americans, all \ndeserving of the same inalienable rights.\n  I thank and pray for our troops overseas, fighting to keep us safe \nhere at home. I thank and pray for the survivors and families of those \nwho have fallen in the defense of this great Nation. And I thank and \npray for all those who remind us why this nation is worth defending. \nThe United States will indeed persevere and will continue to serve as \nthe finest example of a nation founded and dedicated to Liberty and \njustice for all.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, on this solemn occasion in our national \nlife, we pause with deep-seated reverence to remember and honor those \nwho perished in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and we do \nso profoundly mindful of those families and loved ones whose lives have \nbeen forever altered by the heinous events of 7 years ago.\n  At this time, we share in the grievous anguish that will always exact \nan unbearable toll on those convening to pay homage to family and loved \nones lost at Ground Zero in lower Manhattan, in Shanksville, PA, and in \nthe Pentagon, where today there will be a ceremony, marking the \nofficial dedication of the Pentagon Memorial which will pay tribute to \nthe 184 lives lost in the Pentagon and on American Airlines flight 77. \nAmid the arduous trial and pain that this date in our history evokes, \nwe find mutual solace in the revelation that none of us grieves alone \nthat, on this day, those whom we will never know are kept in our \nthoughts and prayers and that there are no strangers among us only \nAmericans.\n  While we will never escape the unspeakable horror and inconsolable \ndevastation that this anniversary represents to each and every one of \nus, at the same time, we cannot help but recall the countless \nremembrances of the indomitable spirit of the American people, who \nhave, time and again, demonstrated a collective resilience and resolve \nto battle back despite inexpressible sorrow, and who have displayed a \ncourageous summoning of purpose to move forward in the face of \nwrenching desolation. And so this year, as in times past, we face the \nindescribable inhumanity of those dark morning hours, but we are \nrenewed and buoyed by the unfolding story from 2001 to the present of a \nresurgent nation that will overcome any adversity, no matter how \nperilous or daunting.\n  And nowhere is that inspiration, heart, and character more prevalent \nthan in our recollection of the heroic sacrifice and noble devotion of \nfirefighters, police officers, and rescue workers. The fearless and \nselfless example of seemingly ordinary Americans performing \nextraordinary deeds in the service of others will serve through time \nimmemorial as an enduring and powerful testament that good will triumph \nover evil and that those benevolent forces that would seek to uplift \nhumankind will ultimately prevail over those treacherous elements that \nwould conspire to bring it down.\n  Time can never diminish the cavalcade of emotions we experience as we \nstrive to comprehend how such vicious savagery could exist in the world \nand could be perpetrated so ruthlessly against innocent people. And \nthose feelings only intensify when we put faces with names, and they \nbecome especially personal when we reflect upon Mainers whom we have \nlost--Anna Allison, Carol Flyzik, Robert Jalbert, Jacqueline Norton, \nRobert Norton, James Roux, Robert Schlegel, and Stephen Ward. Their \nlives were tragically cut short, but their memory is eternally etched \nupon our hearts.\n  As we confront once again these unforgivably grave and wicked \ninjustices, we are also gratefully sustained by the supreme service and \nunfailing contribution of our exceptional men and women in uniform who \nprotect and\n\n[[Page S8338]]\n\ndefend our way of life. Whether on shores or soil here at home or \naround the globe, their steadfast sense of duty and bravery are an \ninspiration to us all, their commitment steels our determination, and \ntheir valor and professionalism steady our hand in an uncertain world.\n  Like every American, I vividly remember every detail of the morning \nof September 11, 2001, and how the day began with such beautiful blue \nskies, only to end with a nation grief-stricken and stunned in utter \ndisbelief. In Washington, DC, I watched the images along with the rest \nof the world. Later, as the Sun set over the National Mall still capped \nby smoke billowing from the wound in the side of the Pentagon I joined \nmy colleagues in the House and Senate on the Capitol steps in singing, \n``God Bless America.''\n  We sang to send a message to the country and to the world that we \nwould never be deterred that freedom is forged by something far more \nresolute than any act of terror a conviction that has only strengthened \nwith each anniversary. While we extol those whom we have lost, we hold \nfast to the belief that the greatest memorial is to embrace all that we \nhave retained as a nation from our inception and that the principles of \nliberty and justice and the primacy of self-government cannot be \nextinguished that we as a people will endure as long as we persevere \nshoulder-to-shoulder as Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have had two ceremonies today: one at \nthe Pentagon and one on the west steps remembering what happened 7 \nyears ago. I think everyone remembers what they were doing at that time \n7 years ago. It happens that was the time I had the State chamber of \ncommerce from my State of Oklahoma in. I was speaking with them. I \nremember so well being on the ninth floor of the Hart Building where we \nhad a panoramic view. They were looking at me, and I saw all this smoke \ngoing up, not having any idea what it was. I actually witnessed what \nhappened at the Pentagon.\n  Today as we think back, most of us know someone or have a friend who \nwas killed on that fateful day in the greatest, most significant raid \non our land in our country's history. Seven years later, we continue to \nfight for the oppressed and, more importantly, help the oppressed to \nfight for themselves. With our coalition of partners and allies, we \ncontinue to take the fight to the enemy of our place of choosing, \nkeeping them there instead of here.\n  I had the privilege--and it really has been a privilege--to be in the \narea where the terrorists were, I think, more than any other Member. I \nhave made some 18 trips, maybe more than that, to Africa, the Horn of \nAfrica, Iraq, Afghanistan, and that area. We have taken away al-Qaida's \nbase of operations, freedom of movement, forcing them into the no-man's \nland between Pakistan and Afghanistan. We have trained the Afghan \nNational Army as they have grown to 65,000 troops. I am proud of this \naccomplishment. It was Oklahoma's 45th in charge of training the Afghan \nArmy. I was over there, and I saw the pride in the faces of the Afghans \nas they were learning to defend themselves, learning to fight, learning \nto fight with dignity. We have trained the Afghan National Army as they \nhave grown to 65,000 troops, and they are on track to meet their \nmandated strength of 82,000 by 2009.\n  We have defeated the Taliban in every encounter and have killed or \ncaptured over 60 of their senior leaders. We helped Afghanistan rebuild \nits infrastructure with over 1,000 bridges and 10,000 kilometers of \nroads. There are now more Afghan children in school than at any other \ntime in history.\n  That is something we seem to forget, turning to Iraq, what is \nhappening right now and the impact this is having in the Middle East \nwhere for the first time in the history of that country there are women \ngoing to school. They have been liberated from a tyrannical leader.\n  I was honored back in 1991 to be on what was called the first freedom \nflight. It was Democrats and Republicans. Tony Coelho was there and \nseveral others. But also the Ambassador from Kuwait to the United \nStates was there. This was in 1991 at the end of the first gulf war. It \nwas so close to the end of it that Iraq did not know it was over yet. \nThey were still burning the fields off.\n  The Ambassador and his daughter--he had a 7- or 8-year-old daughter--\nwanted to see what their mansion on the Persian Gulf looked like \nbecause they had not seen it during the war. When we got there, we \nfound it was used by Saddam Hussein for one of his headquarters. The \nlittle girl wanted to go to her bedroom and see her little animals. \nSaddam Hussein had used that bedroom for a torture chamber. There were \nbody parts there.\n  During that period after 1991, many of us had the opportunity to look \ninto the open graves, to see what a tyrannical person this was, hear \nthe stories from firsthand observers who said people were begging to be \ndropped into the vats of acid head first or into the grinders.\n  Weapons of mass destruction were used on the Kurds up north, and \nhundreds of thousands of people were killed. The way he killed them \nwith the type of gas, it was like burning yourself up from the inside. \nPeople described what the people went through.\n  Some on this floor and a lot of people on the campaign trail say no \nterrorists were in Iraq prior to the liberation. Evidence has shown the \ncontrary. I say this because, first of all, if there had never been \neven a discussion of weapons of mass destruction, just the things that \nthis guy had done to the hundreds of thousands of people was enough \njustification for going in. We, as a free nation, cannot allow that \ntype of thing to happen.\n  Now we find, yes, there were terrorist training camps there. Sargat \nwas an international training camp in northeastern Iraq near the \nIranian border. It was run by Ansar al-Islam, a known terrorist \norganization. Based on information from the U.S. Army Special Forces, \noperators who led the attack on Sargat said it is more than plausible \nthat al-Qaida members trained in that particular area. The Green Berets \ndiscovered among the dead in Sargat foreign ID cards, airline ticket \nreceipts, visas, and passports from Yemen, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, \nMorocco, and many other places.\n  Salman Pak was the name of another city there. That is where we found \nthe fuselage of a 707. That is where they were training people--all the \nevidence was there--to hijack airlines. That was a terrorist training \ncamp. That is in Iraq.\n  I don't think we will ever know whether the perpetrators of the \ntragedy 7 years ago today were trained in Salman Pak. I don't think \nthere is any way of ever knowing that. Certainly, that is what they \nwere doing at that time.\n  So in the aftermath of September 11 we have worked together to do \nthings to preclude this kind of attack from happening--the PATRIOT Act, \nwe created the Department of Homeland Security, the position of \nDirector of National Intelligence to try to coordinate.\n  One of the things I remember when I came to the Senate from the House \nin 1994 is my predecessor was David Boren who happened to have been the \nchairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He said: I am hoping you \nmay be able to do something I have never been able to do, and that is \nto get all these competing intelligence agencies--such as DIA and \nothers--to work together. That wasn't happening until 9/11. That shock \ntreatment is what it took to get people to work together. In doing so, \nwe know many potential attacks on our country have been prevented.\n  When we look at what we are commemorating today and the people we \nknow, the loved ones we lost, we recognize we have done some things we \nshould have done before probably. Those of us who have traveled to \nIsrael know they live from day to day not knowing if, when they are \nsitting in a coffee shop, it is going to blow up or when getting on a \nbus there are going to be bombs going off. They have learned to live \nwith it. We now have\n\n[[Page S8339]]\n\nlearned the lesson of 7 years ago. We have taken precautions. We have \nprevented attacks from happening. We have evidence of all kinds of \nthings--water systems that were going to be contaminated--and we think \nof the tragedy of 7 years ago today.\n  If we look at the potential tragedy of an incoming missile hitting a \nmajor city in America, we would be looking at maybe 300,000 people. \nThat is what it is all about now: making sure nothing of this dimension \nor anything else will happen again.\n  This is a very special day, and it is one that is very meaningful to \nmost of us--I think to all Americans. One thing we can do is remember, \nremember that terrorists are still out there. I was asked on a radio \nshow this morning: There are so many people out there saying, why don't \nyou just forget this thing? That was 7 years ago. Why keep bringing it \nup? Why keep stirring it up? Why can't we get beyond that?\n  My response was we cannot do that because of what happened to so many \npeople. But more importantly than that is this is a constant reminder. \nEvery year we need to be reminded that there are terrorists still out \nthere. They hate everybody who is in this building, and they hate this \nbuilding. You think about what could have happened 7 years ago if those \nvery brave people in Pennsylvania hadn't stopped what was happening. \nThis dome, most likely, would not be here. It was an easy target. That \nis the reminder.\n\n  The terrorists are still out there. They still want to kill us. They \nare still cowards. They still have no country and they have no cause, \nexcept to destroy us. So this reminder is here today, and I just, at \nthis time, want to pay homage once again to the families of all those \nwho lost their loved ones in the tragedy that took place.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the growing \nrate of suicide among Iraq and Afghanistan-era veterans. For all that \nis being done in this country to support our troops in battle, we must \nremember this truth: For many veterans, their battles do not end when \nthey return from the war. Instead, war returns home with them and \nwithin them. That is a truth. Instead, they face an enemy that is hard \nto understand and harder to defeat. Their wounds and their enemy are \nunseen, but the reality and sometimes the deadly consequences of these \ninvisible wounds cannot be ignored.\n  I am deeply troubled by the latest information we have received from \nVA. The number of veterans lost to the enemy of suicide is rising. \nSuicide among Iraq and Afghanistan-era veterans is at an alltime high. \nThe most recently recorded year--2006--saw 113 Iraq and Afghanistan-era \nveterans lost to suicide, almost as many as we lost in the years 2002 \nto 2005 combined. This is disturbing.\n  Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are not the only ones suffering from \nservice-related mental health injuries. Indeed, the number of veterans \nfound to have service-connected PTSD is not just rising, it is rising \nseveral times faster than service-connected disabilities overall. Nor \nare suicide and mental health only a matter of concern among discharged \nveterans. Recent news reports show that suicides among Active-Duty \nsoldiers are positioned to reach an alltime high, exceeding last year's \nrecord number.\n  Much is being done to protect and heal veterans with mental health \nissues. VA has expanded mental health outreach. The Vet Centers, run \nlargely for vets and by vets, offer a safe haven and readjustment \ncounseling. For those in desperate need, VA now operates a 24-hour \nsuicide hotline. In the 1 year it has been operating, they have \nreceived tens of thousands of calls and performed over a thousand \nrescues of veterans about to take their own lives.\n  Unfortunately, these efforts are not enough. Veterans are committing \nsuicide at a higher rate than their civilian counterparts. A recent \nRAND study found that nearly three out of four veterans in need of \nmental health care receive inadequate care or no care at all. This \ncannot be acceptable to a nation intent on protecting those who wear \nits uniform. More must be done in the days ahead, and not just by VA.\n  This Congress took an important step by passing the Joshua Omvig \nSuicide Prevention Act. But in the final weeks of this session, \ncomprehensive veterans mental health legislation is still waiting for a \nvote in the House. Through S. 2162, the Veterans' Mental Health Care \nImprovement Act, which passed the Senate with unanimous support, \nCongress can do more to prevent veteran suicide. Congress can \nstrengthen veterans' mental health care, outreach, support the \nhomeless, services for families, and leverage community resources. I \nhope this critical legislation will become law before this Congress \nends.\n  PTSD and other service-related invisible wounds are real injuries. \nThey are also an enemy to veterans, to the families who support them, \nand to all Americans. It is not enough to bring our troops home; we \nmust support them when the battle follows them home. It is unacceptable \nthat veterans who come home safely later lose their lives to the enemy \nof suicide. We must do more to support those who have served us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5413\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to amendment No. \n5413. I hope at some point to be able to call up that amendment and \nperhaps have it either included as part of the managers' package or \nhave it debated and voted upon. Let me explain a little bit about the \nhistory of this and why I think this is so important to our Nation's \nmilitary.\n  The Defense Department authorization bill we have before us is a \ncritical piece of legislation that we need as a Congress to deal with \nbefore Congress adjourns. We have done that for the past 42 years. It \nsets the policy and the framework and funding for matters that are \nimportant to our men and women in uniform and important to making \nAmerica safe and secure as we head into the future. I believe this \namendment fits right in with that overall objective. The amendment to \nwhich I speak today will advance innovative Air Force programs that are \nalready positively affecting the critically important and complex issue \nof energy policy. As I said, that is a national security issue as well.\n  Furthermore, this amendment will expand these valuable programs to \nother Department of Defense services.\n  As we all know, the issue of fuel prices has significant implications \nnot only for our economic security, but also for our military. In fact, \nthe Department of Defense is the largest single consumer of fuel in the \nUnited States.\n  Consider this: In the last 4 years, the Air Force fuel bill has \ntripled. Furthermore, the Air Force spent over $6 billion buying energy \nlast year, even though they used 10 percent less than the year before. \nThis is a substantial sum, and I can almost guarantee it will cost the \nAir Force more next year to buy the same amount of energy. As the lead \nparagraph in an article headlined ``Worries of Rising Fuel Costs Extend \nto DoD's Budget'' published in Defense News on May 19, 2008, noted:\n\n       The skyrocketing cost of fuel isn't just hitting U.S. \n     drivers in the pocketbook--it's blowing a bit of a hole in \n     the Pentagon's budget as well.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entirety of this Defense News \narticle be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THUNE. We are at a moment in our history when we must move toward \nmore secure, domestic energy sources.\n\n[[Page S8340]]\n\nOne need look no further than the embargos of the 1970s or the recent \noil price spikes or the Russian-Georgian conflict to see the negative \nimplications of relying on foreign sources for the preponderance of our \nenergy needs. Additionally, continuing to fund unfriendly foreign \nregimes grows increasingly untenable by the day, and we should look to \nproduce lower cost domestic alternatives that stop this capital flight.\n  It is well past time that we further the development of these lower \ncost domestic alternatives through responsible public policy.\n  Given this context, I am proud to report that the U.S. Air Force has \nalready become a model for Government leadership in these areas. We \nshould now expand these Air Force programs to the other Department of \nDefense services, as these valuable programs will undoubtedly pave the \nway for increased public-private cooperation.\n\n  One example of Air Force leadership in this area is evident in \nexisting programs to find alternatives to increasingly expensive \naviation fuel. Not only has the Air Force already flight tested the B-\n52, B-1, C-17, KC-135, F-15, and F-22s on a 50 percent synthetic fuel \nblend, it has plans to certify its entire inventory on this synthetic \nfuel blend by 2011. Moreover, the Air Force is dedicated to procuring \nat least half of its fuel needs from environmentally friendly, \ndomesticaly produced, synthetic fuel blends by 2016.\n  We should now call for the other services to do the same. We should \nseek to understand how the Department of the Army and the Department of \nthe Navy can also use these fuels and how the buying power of the \nentire Department of Defense can achieve efficiencies and decreased \ncosts due to large economies of scale.\n  Because they are the largest user of fuel in the Department of \nDefense, this amendment specifies that the Air Force continue to be on \nthe leading edge in finding lower cost, domestically produced \nalternatives to conventional aviation fuels. The amendment dictates \nthat the Air Force continue to certify its entire fleet on a synthetic \nfuel blend and to press forward in its efforts to acquire half of its \ndomestic fuel requirement by 2016 from a domestically sourced \nalternative fuel blend.\n  To protect the American taxpayer, it is important to note this \nacquisition would only occur if the price is less than or equal to the \nmarket prices for petroleum based fuels.\n  To protect the environment, the amendment specifies the fuel is \n``greener'' than conventional petroleum based fuels. On this second \npoint, it is important to note there has been recent uncertainty over \nsection 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The \nintent of this amendment is that the lifecycle emissions of these fuels \nwill be lower than pending Department of Energy and Environmental \nProtection Agency baselines for conventional petroleum fuels.\n\n  A binding authorization for the Air Force to acquire this fuel will \nhave a dramatic effect on the domestic aviation and fuels industries. \nWith the Air Force and the other services of the Department of Defense \nleading the way, it is likely commercial airlines and fuel producers \nwill see the increasing viability of these fuels and wish to build on \nthese efforts. To further civil-military cooperation, the amendment \nalso encourages the services to partner with the commercial aviation \nindustry to engage in further research and development.\n  To encourage feedstock diversity, the language in the amendment is \nnot specific regarding fuel source, and producers could use anything \nfrom cellulosic ethanol to biodiesel.\n  Ultimately, this amendment positively impacts energy policies in this \ncountry at no additional cost to the American taxpayer. Simply put, if \nthe alternative fuels cost more than conventional fuels, the Department \nof Defense doesn't have to buy them. In actuality, it is likely to \nactually lower the cost of these fuels by inducing market based \ncompetition among synthetic fuel producers.\n  Some may argue this amendment is a Government giveaway program or \nthat it is specially tailored to benefit a specific industry. This is \nsimply not true. This amendment does not specify a specific feedstock \nfrom which to make fuels, nor does it offer loan guarantees or tax \nincentives to any specific industry.\n  We are at the beginning of a long energy crisis which is already one \nof the defining issues of our time. If Government agencies are going to \nbe part of the solution, we need sound, responsible public policy that \nallows them to partner with industry and solve these important \nproblems. This amendment is exactly this type of policy.\n  I hope my colleagues will support it. I hope, before we complete \naction on the Defense authorization bill, that we will have an \nopportunity to call up some of these amendments, to have them debated, \nhave them voted on or, at a minimum, to have them accepted as part of a \nmanagers' package. But, in one way or another, I hope this very \nimportant issue of energy security can be addressed in the Defense \nauthorization bill through the acquisition of fuels our services use to \nsupply their energy needs and addressed in a way that not only helps \nAmerica's energy security with regard to lessening this addiction we \nhave to foreign sources of energy, but I also believe it will make our \ncountry safer because I think this is a national security issue that \nforces us to rely upon countries around the world that are hostile to \nour interests.\n  I believe that becoming energy independent means we have to lead by \nexample. Our Air Force has stepped up to that challenge. I hope the \nother services will follow.\n  As I said before, this amendment does not require any particular \nfeedstock. It is neutral with regard to the whole issue of whether that \ncomes from cellulosic or whether that comes from biodiesel or whether \nthat comes from coal to liquids.\n  At the end of the day, we need to adopt this amendment. It will be a \nsavings to our military services and a savings to the taxpayer. As I \nsaid before, there is a requirement in this amendment that, whatever \nthat source is, it be greener than petroleum-based fuels used today.\n  It has already been tested on a number of aircraft. The Air Force \nintends to move in the year 2016 to 50 percent, and I hope the other \nservices will follow. This amendment will see that happens. I hope my \ncolleagues will adopt it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   [From Defense News, May 19, 2008]\n\n          Worries of Rising Fuel Costs Extend to DoD's Budget\n\n                (By William H. McMichael and Rick Maze)\n\n       The skyrocketing cost of fuel isn't just hitting U.S. \n     drivers in the pocketbook--it's blowing a bit of a hole in \n     the Pentagon's budget as well.\n       DoD officials have asked Congress to appropriate another \n     $3.69 billion for all fuels--an increase of $2.2 billion from \n     their initial request--according to a revised request for \n     supplemental war funding for fiscal 2009, submitted May 2.\n       That, of course, looks far ahead and could still prove to \n     be inadequate. According to Pentagon budget documents, the \n     request would support a crude oil price of $97.19 per \n     barrel--and also assumes the military's overall fuel costs \n     will drop by 4.8 percent.\n       The current world price, however, has climbed to and is \n     hovering around $120 per barrel, and many analysts think \n     rising global demand and other factors will keep prices high.\n       And 2009 isn't the only concern; the Pentagon needs more \n     money for fuel to cover the remaining five months of this \n     fiscal year.\n       This would come by way of the $108 billion war supplemental \n     appropriation request, which has yet to be approved.\n       The Pentagon has asked for a total of $1.9 billion for \n     fuel, an increase of $281.4 million over its original \n     supplemental request.\n       All told, that's an additional $2.48 billion on top of the \n     amounts included in the Pentagon's 2008 and 2009 base \n     budgets--and Defense officials already acknowledge the 2009 \n     supplemental request won't cover that entire fiscal year.\n       That would buy the Air Force another 19 F-22 fighters, or \n     the Marine Corps 36 MV-22 Ospreys.\n       In the seven months ending in March, the Pentagon's average \n     monthly cost for its most-used jet fuel, JP-8, rose 34 \n     percent, from $2.34 to $3.13 per gallon, according to the \n     Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).\n       The cost of JP-5, used primarily by Navy jets operating \n     from the sea, increased from $2.22 to $2.94 per gallon.\n       Regular gasoline jumped from $2 to $2.79 per gallon, or 40 \n     percent, over the same period. Only diesel fuel's rise was \n     negligible, increasing just 5 cents per gallon.\n       The Pentagon's prices normally do not fluctuate much \n     because DLA's Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) buys in \n     bulk and sells fuel to the individual services at a \n     ``standard price'' based on market projections for the \n     ensuing year, according to DLA spokesman Jack Hooper.\n       In September 2007, for example, DESC set the standard price \n     of JP-8 at $2.31 per gallon.\n       In a less volatile market, that price might have been good \n     for the next 12 months. But the market forced a change and in \n     December, DESC raised its price for JP-8 to $3.04 per gallon.\n\n[[Page S8341]]\n\n       The House Armed Services subcommittee on readiness approved \n     legislation May 8 to require the secretary of Defense ``to \n     consider the full burdened cost of fuel and energy efficiency \n     in the requirements development and acquisition process,'' \n     said Rep. Randy Forbes of Virginia, the panel's ranking \n     Republican.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from North Carolina \nis recognized.\n\n\n         honoring fallen salisbury, north carolina firefighters\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today, \non this solemn anniversary, to pay my respects to all of the dedicated \nemergency responders who have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect \nour citizens. We all remember with great sadness the horrendous loss of \nlife at the Twin Towers and the Pentagon on that fateful morning, \nincluding the tragic loss of so many firefighters, police officers, and \nother first responders who heroically rushed into danger, risking their \nown lives to save the lives of others.\n  Nationwide, the men and women of our emergency response forces, like \nthe comrades in arms of those New York and Washington first responders, \nshare a common sense of purpose and dedication to defending their \ncommunities in times of peril.\n  Today, I would also like to honor the memories of two brave \nfirefighters from my hometown of Salisbury, NC who died in the line of \nduty this year.\n  In March, the Salisbury Fire Department lost two of its finest, \nJustin Monroe and Victor Isler, while they were battling a blaze that \nmay have been the worst in our town's history. Both men left behind \nmany heartbroken family members and friends--and a grieving community.\n  Our thoughts have also been with several other Salisbury firefighters \nwho suffered burns and other injuries while trying to rescue their \ncomrades and contain the fire. As they continue to heal from that \ntragic day, I hope they know that our thoughts and prayers are \ncontinuously with them.\n  As a young boy, Justin Monroe dreamed of fighting fires. While in \nhigh school, he enrolled in the Millers Ferry Volunteer Fire \nDepartment's junior firefighter program, and in June of 2007, he \naccepted his dream job at the Salisbury Fire Department. Justin was \nproud of his work and looked forward to each and every day at the \ndepartment. He was even studying for his fire technology degree at a \nlocal community college.\n  Justin's mother Lisa was working at Salisbury's Rowan Regional \nMedical Center when she learned that at least one firefighter had \nperished and that several others had been injured fighting the fire at \nSalisbury Millwork, a manufacturer of custom woodwork. Her greatest \nfear as a parent was realized when the body of her 19-year-old son, who \nhad been living with her at home, was brought into the hospital. One of \nLisa's colleagues summed up the emotion by saying, ``It's devastating \nwhen one of your coworkers loses a family member, but losing a child at \nsuch a young age is really heartbreaking. Children are not supposed to \ndie before their parents.''\n  Justin's fallen comrade, Victor Isler, joined the Salisbury Fire \nDepartment a few days after Justin came on board. Victor moved to North \nCarolina from New York, where he served as a medic with the New York \nCity Fire Department and helped save countless lives when our Nation \nwas attacked on September 11. At age 40, Victor decided to head south \nand join the Salisbury department. A devoted husband to his wife Tracy \nand the proud parent of two teenagers, he quickly became a father \nfigure to many of the department's younger firefighters.\n  Victor's childhood best friend, Chris Damato, also served in the \nSalisbury department. On the day after Victor gave his life, Chris' \nwife gave birth to a little boy, named Nicholas Victor as a tribute to \ntheir dear friend.\n  Our firefighters are always there in times of need. Very sadly, our \ncommunities sometimes lose some of their finest public servants like \nJustin Monroe and Victor Isler. Their sacrifice serves as a somber \nreminder of the dangers these men and women face each and every day. We \nowe all of our courageous firefighters and first responders a \ntremendous debt of gratitude for their selfless commitment to keeping \nus safe.\n  As we join together as a Nation to remember September 11, and the \ncourage and sacrifice demonstrated by countless Americans on that day, \nmy thoughts and prayers are also with Justin and Victor's loved ones \nand everyone who has been affected by these tragedies. I join with my \nneighbors and the entire Salisbury community in mourning their loss, \nand pray that they find solace in the knowledge that these men are \nremembered as heroes of the highest order, an inspiration to us all.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in the fiscal year 2009 Defense \nAuthorization Act, S. 3001 is section 256, Assessment of Standards for \nMission Critical Semiconductors Procured by the Department of Defense.\n  The objective of this provision is to provide the DOD with assurance \nof dependable, continuous, long-term access to trusted, mission \ncritical semiconductors from both foreign and domestic sources. In \norder to assure trust, the provision recommends the use of verification \ntools and techniques on commercially procured semiconductors.\n  The manufacture of semiconductors has continued to migrate to off-\nshore foundries, particularly to foundries in China. The few high end \nsemiconductor manufacturers in the U.S. are driven by commercial \ninterests and cannot be depended upon to supply the needs of the \nDeptartment of Defense for the long term. The U.S. military now \ncomprises only 1 percent of the overall market and therefore no longer \ndrives that market.\n  The DOD is currently depending on a single company, IBM, for high end \nsemiconductors through the DOD Trusted Foundry Program. This program \nwas put in place in 2004 as a stop-gap measure. The February 2005 \nreport by the Defense Science Board Task Force on High Performance \nMicrochip Supply stated that the Trusted Foundry Program is an interim \nsource of high performance ICs and a good start in addressing the \nimmediate needs for trusted sources of IC supply. The Trusted Foundry \nProgram does not address critical design software and design systems \nwhich are also subject to tampering. It is strongly recommended that \nthe Trusted Foundry Program continue to be a key part of the overall \nstrategy and the volume of parts that go through it increased. However, \nsince that report was written, the trend of migration of semiconductor \nmanufacturing overseas has continued, and it is now urgent to augment \nthe Trusted Foundry by a more comprehensive approach for the \nprocurement of trusted parts that includes acquisition of parts from \n``nontrusted'' sources.\n  There are several issues which need to be addressed and they are the \ndrivers for this legislative provision. First, the DOD must have \nassurance of dependable, continuous, long-term access to mission \ncritical semiconductors from both foreign and domestic sources for its \npotentially vulnerable defense systems. Such access needs to be \nindependent of the commercially driven decisions made by individual \ncompanies and foundries. DOD needs for integrated circuits include high \nend semiconductors, custom application specific integrated circuits, \nASICs, and field programmable gate arrays, FPGAs. Second, there must be \nassurance of trust of the semiconductors installed on systems procured \nthrough Defense contractors and subcontractors from ``nontrusted'' \nsources. Assurance of trust means assurance that the semiconductor has \nnot been tampered with or modified in any way, and performs the \nfunctions required--and no other functions. It also requires assurance \nthat the design and design systems, fabrication, packaging, final \nassembly, and test of semiconductors are free from tampering. The \nlegislative provision addresses each of the concerns stated above. It \nis recommended that the Department of Defense inventory and implement \nthe best methods currently available for assuring trust. It needs to \nput in place an overall policy and direction, as well as a plan for the \nprocurement of semiconductors that assures continuous access and trust \nas described above. It also needs to assure that there is sufficient \noversight in implementation of the plan for the acquisition of critical \nsemiconductors, employing new or improved techniques and approaches as \nthey become available through technological advances.\n\n[[Page S8342]]\n\nDeliverables from the DARPA trusted circuits project, supplemented by \nprocedures to assure trust in design, packaging and assembly need to be \nemployed. It should also be recognized that a comprehensive strategy \nneeds to include acquisition of mass-produced commercial parts which \nhave low risk of sabotage.\n  The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and \nLogistics is requested to be available to brief Congress on its \nassessment of methods and standards no later than December 31, 2009. \nThese need to be done in consultation with the intelligence community, \nprivate industry, and academia.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the right to vote is one of the most \ncherished civil rights, enshrined in the 15th, 17th, and 19th \namendments of the Constitution. It is the cornerstone of democratic \ngovernment, and it is what makes us a government ``of the people, by \nthe people, and for the people.''\n  Throughout our history, whenever we have seen people deprived of this \nright, whether by law or by practice, brave Americans have stood up to \nfight for their right to vote. Today there is a significant portion of \nour population that has been disenfranchised.\n  Today, the very men and women who have joined the military to defend \nour right to vote have been effectively cut out of the democratic \nprocess. Make no mistake; this is one of the most important civil \nrights issues we face today, and we cannot afford to delay action to \naddress it.\n  The Secretary of Defense has delegated the responsibility for \nsafeguarding the voting rights of our troops to an office called the \nFederal Voting Assistance Program. Unfortunately, as our troops serve \non far-away bases overseas and fight in foreign theaters of conflict, \nthe Department of Defense's Federal Voting Assistance Program has \nfailed to protect their most basic right as American citizens. This \nfailure is twofold.\n  First, the DOD's voting office has failed to adequately educate our \nmen and women in uniform about how to vote. Second, it has failed to \ntake adequate steps to put in place a system that provides our troops a \nreasonable opportunity to vote--one which ensures their votes are \ncounted.\n  Already, the DOD is required by law to provide troops with voting \nassistance, and information on how to get ballots, and how to cast \ntheir votes. But, its efforts have fallen woefully short. A recent \nsurvey found that less than 60 percent of troops knew where to obtain \nvoting information on base.\n  Of our overseas troops who did ask for mail-in ballots, less than \nhalf of their completed ballots actually arrived at the local election \noffice. What is worse, many of those arrived late, resulting in them \nbeing rejected and thus not counted at all.\n  It is absolutely shameful that so many of our troops and their \nfamilies have been cut out of the democratic process through \nbureaucratic inefficiency.\n  In order to prevent this disenfranchisement from happening again, I \nintroduced the Military Voting Protection Act, or MVP Act, to require \nthe DOD to collect our overseas troops' completed ballots and expedite \ntheir delivery through express shipping. Electronic tracking would be \nrequired as well, so our troops would have the peace of mind of knowing \ntheir ballots actually arrived at the election office. The MVP Act \nwould markedly improve the current system and help protect our troops' \nright to vote.\n  But yesterday, when I asked to bring this important, time-critical \nlegislation forward as an amendment to the DOD authorization bill, the \nmajority objected, saying they needed to hear from the Rules Committee \nfirst. My legislation would apply only to military servicemembers. We \nare working on the DOD authorization bill, so I am not sure why members \nof the Armed Services Committee need to wait and see what the Rules \nCommittee thinks of an amendment this important. I am left scratching \nmy head.\n  Rather than even considering this legislation, and debating how best \nto fix our broken military voting system, Democrats cited weak excuses \nfor blocking this amendment. With a national election looming, and a \ndisgraceful track record over the past two election cycles of our \nwidespread troop disenfranchisement, I am dumbfounded as to why my \ncolleagues would put off this civil rights issue and effectively cheat \nour troops out of a better, more reliable system for voting from \noverseas.\n  Last night, the Rules Committee offered me a counterproposal, which \nseeks to make the implementation of these important improvements to our \ntroops' voting system optional. In essence, by making the \nimplementation of this program optional, the Democrats are saying to \nour troops that their civil rights are not guaranteed but an option. \nThat is an outrage.\n  I am afraid this is going to be just another item on a long list of \ncritical issues the majority has put off, despite calls for action from \nthe American people. Another notable example is gas prices--we have \nbeen waiting for over 2 years to address gas prices, but still no \nmeaningful action from the majority leadership. Democrats have \nstonewalled and delayed qualified judicial nominees and have yet to \npass a single appropriations bill for the fiscal year that starts in \nless than 3 weeks.\n  The rights of our troops to vote cannot fall victim to politics. Our \nmilitary men and women stand vigilant in the defense of freedom and \nhelp safeguard the personal liberties of their fellow Americans. Now, \nwe must be every bit as vigilant in defense of their personal liberties \nand civil rights. They willingly step into harm's way to ensure the \nsafety of their fellow Americans at home, and they deserve better than \na broken voting system and a refusal by their elected leaders to fix \nit.\n  Mr. President, I subject the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 3406) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3406\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n         This Act may be cited as the ``ADA Amendments Act of \n     2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n         (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n         (1) in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990 (ADA), Congress intended that the Act ``provide a clear \n     and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of \n     discrimination against individuals with disabilities'' and \n     provide broad coverage;\n         (2) in enacting the ADA, Congress recognized that \n     physical and mental disabilities in no way diminish a \n     person's right to fully participate in all aspects of \n     society, but that people with physical or mental disabilities \n     are frequently precluded from doing so because of prejudice, \n     antiquated attitudes, or the failure to remove societal and \n     institutional barriers;\n         (3) while Congress expected that the definition of \n     disability under the ADA would be interpreted consistently \n     with how courts had applied the definition of a handicapped \n     individual under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that \n     expectation has not been fulfilled;\n         (4) the holdings of the Supreme Court in Sutton v. United \n     Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) and its companion cases \n     have narrowed the broad scope of protection intended to be \n     afforded by the ADA, thus eliminating protection for many \n     individuals whom Congress intended to protect;\n         (5) the holding of the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor \n     Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 \n     (2002) further narrowed the broad scope of protection \n     intended to be afforded by the ADA;\n         (6) as a result of these Supreme Court cases, lower \n     courts have incorrectly found in individual cases that people \n     with a range of substantially limiting impairments are not \n     people with disabilities;\n\n[[Page S8343]]\n\n         (7) in particular, the Supreme Court, in the case of \n     Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 \n     U.S. 184 (2002), interpreted the term ``substantially \n     limits'' to require a greater degree of limitation than was \n     intended by Congress; and\n         (8) Congress finds that the current Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission ADA regulations defining the term \n     ``substantially limits'' as ``significantly restricted'' are \n     inconsistent with congressional intent, by expressing too \n     high a standard.\n         (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n         (1) to carry out the ADA's objectives of providing ``a \n     clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination \n     of discrimination'' and ``clear, strong, consistent, \n     enforceable standards addressing discrimination'' by \n     reinstating a broad scope of protection to be available under \n     the ADA;\n         (2) to reject the requirement enunciated by the Supreme \n     Court in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 \n     (1999) and its companion cases that whether an impairment \n     substantially limits a major life activity is to be \n     determined with reference to the ameliorative effects of \n     mitigating measures;\n         (3) to reject the Supreme Court's reasoning in Sutton v. \n     United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) with regard to \n     coverage under the third prong of the definition of \n     disability and to reinstate the reasoning of the Supreme \n     Court in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. \n     273 (1987) which set forth a broad view of the third prong of \n     the definition of handicap under the Rehabilitation Act of \n     1973;\n         (4) to reject the standards enunciated by the Supreme \n     Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. \n     Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), that the terms \n     ``substantially'' and ``major'' in the definition of \n     disability under the ADA ``need to be interpreted strictly to \n     create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled,'' and \n     that to be substantially limited in performing a major life \n     activity under the ADA ``an individual must have an \n     impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual \n     from doing activities that are of central importance to most \n     people's daily lives'';\n         (5) to convey congressional intent that the standard \n     created by the Supreme Court in the case of Toyota Motor \n     Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 \n     (2002) for ``substantially limits'', and applied by lower \n     courts in numerous decisions, has created an inappropriately \n     high level of limitation necessary to obtain coverage under \n     the ADA, to convey that it is the intent of Congress that the \n     primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA \n     should be whether entities covered under the ADA have \n     complied with their obligations, and to convey that the \n     question of whether an individual's impairment is a \n     disability under the ADA should not demand extensive \n     analysis; and\n         (6) to express Congress' expectation that the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Commission will revise that portion of \n     its current regulations that defines the term ``substantially \n     limits'' as ``significantly restricted'' to be consistent \n     with this Act, including the amendments made by this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Statement \nof Managers to Accompany S. 3406, the Americans With Disabilities Act \nAmendments Act of 2008, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement of the Managers To Accompany S. 3406, The Americans With \n                Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008\n\n\n               I. Purpose and Summary of the Legislation\n\n       The purpose of S. 3406, the ``ADA Amendments Act of 2008'' \n     is to clarify the intention and enhance the protections of \n     the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, landmark civil \n     rights legislation that provided ``a clear and comprehensive \n     national mandate for the elimination of discrimination on the \n     basis of disability.'' In particular, the ADA Amendments Act \n     amends the definition of disability by providing \n     clarification and instruction about the terminology used in \n     the definition, by expanding the definition, and by rejecting \n     several opinions of the United States Supreme Court that have \n     had the effect of restricting the meaning and application of \n     the definition of disability.\n       S. 3406 is the product of an extensive bipartisan effort \n     that included many hours of meetings and negotiation by \n     legislative staff as well as by stakeholders including the \n     disability, business, and education communities. In addition, \n     two hearings were held in the Senate Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions Committee to explore the issues addressed \n     in this legislation. The goal has been to achieve the ADA's \n     legislative objectives in a way that maximizes bipartisan \n     consensus and minimizes unintended consequences.\n       This legislation amends the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     of 1990 by making the changes identified below.\n       Aligning the construction of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964, the bill amends Title I of the ADA to provide that no \n     covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified \n     individual ``on the basis of disability.''\n       The bill maintains the ADA's inherently functional \n     definition of disability as a physical or mental impairment \n     that substantially limits one or more life activities; a \n     record of such impairment; or being regarded as having such \n     an impairment. It clarifies and expands the definition's \n     meaning and application in the following ways.\n       First, the bill deletes two findings in the ADA which led \n     the Supreme Court to unduly restrict the meaning and \n     application of the definition of disability. These findings \n     are that there are ``some 43,000,000 Americans have one or \n     more physical or mental disabilities'' and that ``individuals \n     with disabilities are a discrete and insular minority.'' The \n     Court treated these findings as limitations on how it \n     construed other provisions of the ADA. This conclusion had \n     the effect of interfering with previous judicial precedents \n     holding that, like other civil rights statutes, the ADA must \n     be construed broadly to effectuate its remedial purpose. \n     Deleting these findings removes this barrier to construing \n     and applying the definition of disability more generously.\n       Second, the bill affirmatively provides that the definition \n     of disability ``shall be construed in favor of broad coverage \n     of individuals under this Act, to the maximum extent \n     permitted by the terms of this Act.'' It retains the term \n     ``substantially limits'' from the original ADA definition but \n     makes it clear that this is intended to be a less demanding \n     standard than that enunciated by the U.S. Supreme Court in \n     Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams. With \n     this rule of construction and relevant purpose language, the \n     bill rejects the Supreme Court's holding in Toyota v. \n     Williams that the terms ``substantially'' and ``major'' in \n     the definition of disability must be ``be interpreted \n     strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as \n     disabled,'' as well as the Court's interpretation that \n     ``substantially limits'' means ``prevents or severely \n     restricts.''\n       Third, the bill prohibits consideration of mitigating \n     measures such as medication, assistive technology, \n     accommodations, or modifications when determining whether an \n     impairment constitutes a disability. This provision and \n     relevant purpose language rejects the Supreme Court's \n     holdings in Sutton v. United Air Lines and its companion \n     cases that mitigating measures must be considered. The bill \n     also provides that impairments that are episodic or in \n     remission are to be assessed in an active state.\n       Fourth, the bill provides new instruction on what may \n     constitute ``major life activities.'' It provides a non-\n     exhaustive list of major life activities within the meaning \n     of the ADA. In addition, the bill expands the category of \n     major life activities to include the operation of major \n     bodily functions.\n       Fifth, the bill removes from the third ``regarded as'' \n     prong of the disability definition the requirement that an \n     individual demonstrate that he or she has, or is perceived to \n     have, an impairment that substantially limits a major life \n     activity. Under the bill, therefore, an individual can \n     establish coverage under the law by showing that he or she \n     has been subjected to an action prohibited under the Act \n     because of an actual or perceived physical or mental \n     impairment. Because the bill thus broadens application of \n     this third prong of the disability definition, entities \n     covered by the ADA will not be required to provide \n     accommodations or to modify policies and procedures for \n     individuals who fall solely under the third prong. Such \n     entities will, however, still be subject to discrimination \n     claims.\n       Finally, the bill clarifies that the agencies that \n     currently issue regulations under the ADA have regulatory \n     authority related to the definitions contained in Section 3. \n     Conforming amendments to Section 7 of the Rehabilitation Act \n     of 1973 are intended to ensure harmony between federal civil \n     rights laws.\n\n\n                II. Background and Need for Legislation\n\n       When Congress passed the ADA in 1990, it adopted the \n     functional definition of disability from the Section 504 of \n     the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, in part, because after 17 \n     years of development through case law the requirements of the \n     definition were well understood. Within this framework, with \n     its generous and inclusive definition of disability, courts \n     treated the determination of disability as a threshold issue \n     but focused primarily on whether unlawful discrimination had \n     occurred.\n\n[[Page S8345]]\n\n       More recent Supreme Court decisions imposing a stricter \n     standard for determining disability had the effect of \n     upsetting this balance. After the Court's decisions in Sutton \n     that impairments must be considered in their mitigated state \n     and in Toyota that there must be a demanding standard for \n     qualifying as disabled, lower courts more often found that an \n     individual's impairment did not constitute a disability. As a \n     result, in too many cases, courts would never reach the \n     question whether discrimination had occurred.\n       Thus, some 18 years later we are faced with a situation in \n     which physical or mental impairments that would previously \n     have been found to constitute disabilities are not considered \n     disabilities under the Supreme Court's narrower standard. \n     These can include individuals with impairments such as \n     amputation, intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, multiple \n     sclerosis, diabetes, muscular dystrophy, and cancer. The \n     resulting court decisions contribute to a legal environment \n     in which individuals must demonstrate an inappropriately high \n     degree of functional limitation in order to be protected from \n     discrimination under the ADA.\n       The ADA Amendments Act rejects the high burden required in \n     these cases and reiterates that Congress intends that the \n     scope of the Americans with Disabilities Act be broad and \n     inclusive. It is the intent of the legislation to establish a \n     degree of functional limitation required for an impairment to \n     constitute a disability that is consistent with what Congress \n     originally intended, a degree that is lower than what the \n     courts have construed it to be. In addition, the bill \n     provides for application of this standard to a wider range of \n     cases by expanding the category of major life activities. \n     These steps, resulting from extensive bipartisan negotiation \n     and discussion among legislators and stakeholders, are \n     intended to provide for more generous coverage and \n     application of the ADA's prohibition on discrimination \n     through a framework that is more predictable, consistent, and \n     workable for all entities subject to responsibilities under \n     the ADA.\n\n\n            III. Explanation of the Bill and Manager's Views\n\n     Overview\n       The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (``the ADA'') \n     is a landmark statute that has fundamentally changed the \n     lives of many millions of Americans with disabilities. The \n     managers of this legislation were proud to be leaders in that \n     effort that was accomplished in a deliberative careful manner \n     that allowed for the development of a strong bipartisan \n     coalition in both Houses of Congress and the Administration \n     of President George H. W. Bush and led to Senate passage with \n     a definitive vote of 91-6.\n       However, as discussed in more detail below, a series of \n     Court decisions have restricted the coverage and diminished \n     the civil rights protections of the ADA, especially in the \n     workplace, by narrowing its definition of disability. As a \n     result, lower court cases have too often turned solely on the \n     question of whether the plaintiff is an individual with a \n     disability rather than the merits of discrimination claims, \n     such as whether adverse decisions were impermissibly made by \n     the employer on the basis of disability, reasonable \n     accommodations were denied inappropriately, or qualification \n     standards were unlawfully discriminatory.\n       The managers have introduced the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 \n     to restore the proper balance and application of the ADA by \n     clarifying and broadening the definition of disability, and \n     to increase eligibility for the protections of the ADA. It is \n     our expectation that because this bill makes the definition \n     of disability more generous, some people who were not covered \n     before will now be covered. The strong bipartisan support for \n     this legislation once again demonstrates the continuing \n     bipartisan commitment to protecting the civil rights of \n     individuals with disabilities among members of the Senate \n     Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions and the \n     Senate as a whole.\n       The ADA Amendments Act renews our commitment to ensuring \n     that all Americans with disabilities, including a new \n     generation of disabled veterans who are just beginning to \n     grapple with the challenge of living to their full potential \n     despite the limitations imposed by their disabilities, are \n     able to participate to the fullest possible extent in all \n     facets of society, including the workplace. We acknowledge \n     and applaud the substantial improvements in medical science \n     and the courageous efforts of individuals with disabilities \n     to overcome the impact of those disabilities, but in no way \n     wish to exclude them thereby from protection under the ADA.\n       By retaining the essential elements of the definition of \n     disability including the key term ``substantially limits'' we \n     reaffirm that not every individual with a physical or mental \n     impairment is covered by the first prong of the definition of \n     disability in the ADA. An impairment that does not \n     substantially limit a major life activity is not a disability \n     under this prong. That will not change after enactment of the \n     ADA Amendments Act, nor will the necessity of making \n     this determination on an individual basis. What will \n     change is the standard required for making this \n     determination. This bill lowers the standard for \n     determining whether an impairment constitute a disability \n     and reaffirms the intent of Congress that the definition \n     of disability in the ADA is to be interpreted broadly and \n     inclusively.\n     Findings and Purposes\n       Given the importance the Court has placed upon findings and \n     purposes particularly in civil rights statutes like the ADA, \n     the ADA Amendments Act contains a detailed Findings and \n     Purposes section that the managers believe gives clear \n     guidance to the courts and that they intend to be applied \n     appropriately and consistently. As described above, the \n     legislation deletes two findings in the ADA that have been \n     interpreted by the Supreme Court to require a narrow \n     definition of disability. We continue to believe that \n     individuals with disabilities ``have been faced with \n     restrictions and limitations, subjected to a history of \n     purposeful unequal treatment, and relegated to a position of \n     political powerlessness in our society, based on \n     characteristics that are beyond the control of such \n     individuals and resulting from stereotypic assumptions not \n     truly indicative of the individual ability of such \n     individuals to participate in, and contribute to, society.''\n       In addition to deleting the findings forming the basis of \n     the Sutton and Toyota decisions, the bill states explicitly \n     its purpose to reject the holdings in those cases (and their \n     progeny), and to ensure broad coverage under the ADA. To be \n     clear, the purposes section conveys our intent to clarify not \n     only that ``substantially limits'' should be measured by a \n     lower standard than that used in Toyota, but also that the \n     definition of disability should not be unduly used as a tool \n     for excluding individuals from the ADA's protections.\n       The bill expresses the clear intent of Congress that the \n     EEOC will revise its regulations that similarly improperly \n     define the term ``substantially limits'' as ``significantly \n     restricted''; again, this sets too high a standard.\n       The bill's purposes also reject the Supreme Court's holding \n     that mitigating measures must be considered when determining \n     whether an impairment constitutes a disability. With the \n     exception of ordinary eyeglasses and contact lenses, \n     impairments must be examined in their unmitigated state.\n       These purposes are specifically incorporated into the \n     statute by the rule of construction providing that the term \n     ``substantially limits'' shall be construed consistently with \n     the findings and purposes of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. \n     This rule of construction, together with the rule of \n     construction providing that the definition of disability \n     shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals \n     sends a clear signal of our intent that the courts must \n     interpret the definition of disability broadly rather than \n     stringently.\n     Definition of Disability\n       In the ADA of 1990, Congress sought to protect anyone who \n     experiences discrimination because of a current, past, or \n     perceived disability. Under the ADA, there are three prongs \n     of the definition of disability, with respect to an \n     individual:\n       (1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially \n     limits one or more of the major life activities of such \n     individual;\n       (2) a record of such an impairment; or\n       (3) being regarded as having such an impairment.\n       This definition is of critical importance because as a \n     threshold issue it determines whether an individual is \n     covered by the ADA. The ADA Amendments Act retains the \n     definition of disability but further defines and clarifies \n     three critical terms within the existing definition \n     (``substantially limits,'' ``major life activities,'' \n     ``regarded as having such impairment'') and, under the rules \n     of construction for the definition, adds several standards \n     that must be applied when considering the definition of \n     disability.\n       Physical or Mental Impairment\n       The bill does not provide a definition for the terms \n     ``physical impairment'' or ``mental impairment.'' The \n     managers expect that the current regulatory definition of \n     these terms, as promulgated by agencies such as the U.S. \n     Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the \n     Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Education \n     Office of Civil Rights (DOE OCR) will not change.\n       Substantially Limits\n       We do not believe that the courts have correctly instituted \n     the level of coverage we intended to establish with the term \n     ``substantially limits'' in the ADA. In particular, we \n     believe that the level of limitation, and the intensity of \n     focus, applied by the Supreme Court in Toyota goes beyond \n     what we believe is the appropriate standard to create \n     coverage under this law.\n       We have extensively deliberated with regard to whether a \n     new term, other than the term ``substantially limits'' should \n     be used in this Act. For example, in its ADA Amendments Act, \n     H.R.3195, the House of Representatives attempted to \n     accomplish this goal by stating that the key phrase \n     ``substantially limits'' means ``materially restricts'' in \n     order to convey that Congress intended to depart from the \n     strict and demanding standard applied by the Supreme Court in \n     Sutton and Toyota.\n       We have concluded that adopting a new, undefined term that \n     is subject to widely disparate meanings is not the best way \n     to achieve the goal of ensuring consistent and appropriately \n     broad coverage under this Act. The resulting need for further \n     judicial scrutiny and construction will not help move the \n     focus from the threshold issue of disability to the primary \n     issue of discrimination.\n\n[[Page S8346]]\n\n       We believe that a better way is to express our disapproval \n     of Sutton and Toyota (along with the current EEOC regulation) \n     is to retain the words ``substantially limits,'' but clarify \n     that it is not meant to be a demanding standard. In addition, \n     we believe eliminating the source of the Supreme Court's \n     decisions narrowing the definition and providing more \n     appropriate findings and purposes for properly construing \n     that definition will accomplish our goal without introducing \n     novel statutory terms.\n       We believe that the manner in which we understood the \n     intended scope of ``substantially limits'' in 1990 continues \n     to capture our sense of the appropriate level of coverage \n     under this law for purposes of placing on employers and other \n     covered entities the obligation of providing reasonable \n     accommodations and modifications to individuals with \n     impairments. As we described this in our committee report to \n     the original ADA in 1989:\n\n       ``A person is considered an individual with a disability \n     for purposes of the first prong of the definition when [one \n     or more of] the individual's important life activities are \n     restricted as to the conditions, manner, or duration under \n     which they can be performed in comparison to most people. A \n     person who can walk for 10 miles continuously is not \n     substantially limited in walking merely because on the \n     eleventh mile, he or she begins to experience pain because \n     most people would not be able to walk eleven miles without \n     experiencing some discomfort. S. Rep. No 101-116, at 23 \n     (1989).''\n\n       We particularly believe that this test, which articulated \n     an analysis that considered whether a person's activities are \n     limited in condition, duration and manner, is a useful one. \n     We reiterate that using the correct standard--one that is \n     lower than the strict or demanding standard created by the \n     Supreme Court in Toyota--will make the disability \n     determination an appropriate threshold issue but not an \n     onerous burden for those seeking accommodations or \n     modifications. At the same time, plaintiffs should not be \n     constrained from offering evidence needed to establish that \n     their impairment is substantially limiting.\n       Thus, we believe that the term ``substantially limits'' as \n     construed consistently with the findings and purposes of this \n     legislation establishes an appropriate functionality test for \n     determining whether an individual has a disability.\n       Major Life Activities\n       The bill provides significant new guidance and \n     clarification on the subject of major life activities. First, \n     a rule of construction clarifies that that an impairment need \n     only substantially limit one major life activity to be \n     considered a disability under the ADA. This responds to and \n     corrects those courts that have required individuals to show \n     that an impairment substantially limits more than one life \n     activity. It is additionally intended to clarify that the \n     ability to perform one or more particular tasks within a \n     broad category of activities does not preclude coverage under \n     the ADA.\n       For purposes of clarity, the bill provides an illustrative \n     list of ``major life activities'' including activities such \n     as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, \n     hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, \n     bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, \n     concentrating, thinking, communicating and working. In \n     addition, for the first time, the category of ``major life \n     activities'' is defined to include the operation of major \n     bodily functions, thus better addressing chronic impairments \n     that can be substantially limiting. Major bodily functions \n     include functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, \n     digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, \n     circulatory, endocrine and reproductive functions.\n       Both the list of major life activities and major bodily \n     functions are illustrative and non-exhaustive, and the \n     absence of a particular life activity or bodily function from \n     the list does not create a negative implication as to whether \n     such activity or function constitutes a ``major life \n     activity'' under the statute.\n       Finally, we also want to illuminate one area which may be \n     easily misunderstood, with respect to individuals with \n     specific learning disabilities. When considering the \n     condition, manner, or duration in which an individual with a \n     specific learning disability performs a major life activity, \n     it is critical to reject the assumption that an individual \n     who has performed well academically cannot be substantially \n     limited in activities such as learning, reading, writing, \n     thinking, or speaking.\n       Rules of Construction on the Definition of Disability\n       The bill further clarifies the definition of disability \n     with a series of rules of construction. As discussed \n     elsewhere, the rules of construction specifically require \n     that the definition of disability be interpreted broadly and \n     that the term ``substantially limits'' be interpreted \n     consistent with this legislation. This construction is \n     also intended to reinforce the general rule that civil \n     rights statutes must be broadly construed to achieve their \n     remedial purpose. In addition, the rules of construction \n     provide that impairments that are episodic or in remission \n     be assessed in their active state for purposes of \n     determining coverage under the ADA.\n       Mitigating Measures\n       The bill also prohibits consideration of the ameliorative \n     effects of mitigating measures when determining whether an \n     individual's impairment substantially limits major life \n     activities, overturning the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Sutton and its companion cases. This provision is intended to \n     eliminate the situation created under current law in which \n     impairments that are mitigated do not constitute disabilities \n     but are the basis for discrimination. We expect that when \n     such mitigating measures are ignored, some individuals \n     previously found not disabled will now be able to claim the \n     ADA's protection against discrimination.\n       The legislation provides an illustrative but non-\n     comprehensive list of the types of mitigating measures that \n     are not to be considered. This list also includes low vision \n     devices, which are devices that magnify, enhance, or \n     otherwise augment a visual image, such as magnifiers, closed \n     circuit television, larger-print items, and instruments that \n     provide voice instructions. The absence of any particular \n     mitigating measure from this list should not convey a \n     negative implication as to whether the measure is a \n     mitigating measure under the ADA.\n       We also believe that an individual with an impairment that \n     substantially limits a major life activity should not be \n     penalized when seeking protection under the ADA simply \n     because he or she managed their own adaptive strategies or \n     received accommodations (including informal or undocumented \n     ones) that have the effect of lessening the deleterious \n     impacts of their disability.\n       The bill provides one exception to the rule on mitigating \n     measures, specifying that ordinary eyeglasses and contact \n     lenses are to be considered in determining whether a person \n     has a disability. The rationale behind this exception is that \n     the use of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses, without \n     more, is not significant enough to warrant protection under \n     the ADA. Nevertheless, if an applicant or employee is faced \n     with a qualification standard that requires uncorrected \n     vision (as the sisters in the Sutton case were), an employer \n     will be required to demonstrate that the qualification \n     standard is job-related and consistent with business \n     necessity.\n       Regarded As\n       Under this bill, the third prong of the disability \n     definition will apply to impairments, not only to \n     disabilities. As such, it does not require a functional test \n     to determine whether an impairment substantially limits a \n     major life activity.\n       This section of the definition of disability was meant to \n     express our understanding that unfounded concerns, mistaken \n     beliefs, fears, myths, or prejudice about disabilities are \n     often just as disabling as actual impairments, and our \n     corresponding desire to prohibit discrimination founded on \n     such perceptions. In 1990 we relied extensively on the \n     reasoning of School Board of Nassau County v. Arline that the \n     negative reactions of others are just as disabling as the \n     actual impact of an impairment. This legislation restates our \n     reliance on the broad views enunciated in that decision and \n     we believe that courts should continue to rely on this \n     standard.\n       We intend and believe that the fact that an individual was \n     discriminated against because of a perceived or actual \n     impairment is sufficient. Thus, the bill clarifies that \n     contrary to Sutton, an individual who is ``regarded as having \n     such an impairment'' is not subject to a functional test. If \n     an individual establishes that he or she was subjected to an \n     action prohibited by the ADA because of an actual or \n     perceived impairment--whether the person actually has the \n     impairment or whether the impairment constitutes a \n     disability--then the individual will qualify for protection \n     under the Act.\n       This provision is subject to two important limitations. \n     First, individuals with impairments that are transitory and \n     minor are excluded from eligibility for the protections of \n     the ADA under this prong of the definition, and second, the \n     bill relieves entities covered under the ADA from the \n     obligation and responsibility to provide reasonable \n     accommodations and reasonable modifications to an individual \n     who qualifies for coverage under the ADA solely by being \n     ``regarded as'' disabled.\n       Transitory and Minor\n       The bill contains an exception that clarifies that coverage \n     for individuals under the ``regarded as'' prong is not \n     available where an individual's impairment is both transitory \n     (six months or less) and minor. Providing this exception \n     responds to concerns raised by employer organizations and is \n     reasonable under the ``regarded as'' prong of the definition \n     because individuals seeking coverage under this prong need \n     not meet the functional limitation requirement contained in \n     the first two prongs of the definition. A similar exception \n     for the first two prongs of the definition is unnecessary as \n     the functional limitation requirement already excludes claims \n     by individuals with ailments that are minor and short term.\n       Accommodations\n       The bill establishes that entities covered under the ADA do \n     not need to provide reasonable accommodations under Title I \n     or modify policies, practices, or procedures under Titles II \n     or III when an individual qualifies for coverage under the \n     ADA solely by being ``regarded as'' having a disability under \n     the third prong of the definition of disability.\n       Under current law, a number of courts have required \n     employers to provide reasonable accommodations for \n     individuals who are\n\n[[Page S8347]]\n\n     covered solely under the ``regarded as'' prong. In each of \n     those cases, the plaintiffs were found not to be covered \n     under the first prong of the definition of disability \n     because of the overly stringent manner in which the courts \n     had been interpreting that prong. Because of our strong \n     belief that accommodating individuals with disabilities is \n     a key goal of the ADA, some members continue to have \n     reservations about this provision. However, we believe it \n     is an acceptable compromise given our strong expectation \n     that such individuals would now be covered under the first \n     prong of the definition, properly applied.\n     Discrimination on the Basis of Disability\n       The bill amends Section 102 of the ADA to mirror the \n     structure of nondiscrimination protection provision in Title \n     VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It changes the language \n     from prohibiting discrimination against a qualified \n     individual ``with a disability because of the disability of \n     such individual'' to prohibiting discrimination against a \n     qualified individual ``on the basis of disability.'' This \n     ensures that the emphasis in questions of disability \n     discrimination is properly on the critical inquiry of whether \n     a qualified person has been discriminated against on the \n     basis of disability, and not unduly focused on the \n     preliminary question of whether a particular person is a \n     ``person with a disability.''\n     Rules of Construction\n       Benefits Under State Worker's Compensation Laws\n       The bill provides that nothing in the Act alters the \n     standards for determining eligibility for benefits under \n     State worker's compensation laws or other Federal or State \n     disability benefit programs.\n     Fundamental Alteration\n       The bill reiterates that no changes are being made to the \n     underlying ADA provision that no accommodations or \n     modifications in policies are required when a covered entity \n     can demonstrate that making such modifications would \n     fundamentally alter the nature of the service being provided. \n     This provision was included at the request of the higher \n     education community and specifically includes ``academic \n     requirements in postsecondary education'' among the types of \n     policies, practices, and procedures that may be shown to be \n     fundamentally altered by the requested modification or \n     accommodation to reaffirm current law. It is included solely \n     to provide assurances that the bill does not alter current \n     law with regard to the obligations of academic institutions \n     under the ADA, which we believe is already demonstrated in \n     case law on this topic. Specifically, the reference to \n     academic standards in postsecondary education is unrelated to \n     the purpose of this legislation and should be given no \n     meaning in interpreting the definition of disability.\n       Claims of No Disability\n       The bill prohibits reverse discrimination claims by \n     disallowing claims based on the lack of disability, (e.g., a \n     claim by someone without a disability that someone with a \n     disability was treated more favorably by, for example, being \n     granted a reasonable accommodation or modification to \n     services or programs). Our intent is to clarify that a person \n     without a disability does not have the right under the Act to \n     bring an action against an entity on the grounds that he or \n     she was discriminated against ``on the basis of disability'' \n     (i.e., on the basis of not having a disability).\n       Regulatory Authority\n       In Sutton, the Supreme Court stated that ``[n]o agency . . \n     . has been given authority to issue regulations implementing \n     the generally applicable provisions of the ADA which fall \n     outside Titles I-V.'' The bill clarifies that the authority \n     to issue regulations is granted to the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission, the Attorney General, and the \n     Secretary of Transportation and specifically includes the \n     authority to issue regulations implementing the definition of \n     disability as amended and clarified by this legislation.\n       We anticipate that the agencies charged with regulatory \n     authority under the ADA will make any necessary modifications \n     to their regulations to reflect the changes and \n     clarifications embodied in the ADA Amendments Act, including \n     the addition of major bodily functions as major life \n     activities and the broadening of the ``regarded as'' prong. \n     We also expect that the Equal Employment Opportunity \n     Commission (EEOC) will revise the portion of its ADA \n     regulations that defines ``substantially limits'' as ``unable \n     to perform a major life activity. . . . or significantly \n     restricted as to . . . a particular major life activity . . . \n     .'' given the clear inconsistency of that portion of the \n     regulation with the intent of this legislation.\n     Conforming Amendment\n       The bill ensures that the definition of disability in \n     Section 7 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which shares the \n     same definition, is consistent with the ADA. The \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 preceded the ADA in providing \n     civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities, \n     and in drafting the definition of disability in the ADA, the \n     authors relied on the statute and implementing regulations of \n     the Rehabilitation Act. Maintaining uniform definitions in \n     the two federal statutes is important so that such entities \n     will generally operate under one consistent standard, and the \n     civil rights of individuals with disabilities will be \n     protected in all settings. The ADA, under Title II and Title \n     III, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provide \n     overlapping coverage for many entities, including public \n     schools, institutions of higher education, childcare \n     facilities, and other entities receiving federal funds.\n       We expect that the Secretary of Education will promulgate \n     new regulations related to the definition of disability to be \n     consistent with those issued by the Attorney General under \n     this Act. We believe that other current regulations issued by \n     the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights under \n     Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act are currently \n     harmonious with Congressional intent under both the ADA and \n     the Rehabilitation Act.\n     Conclusion\n       We intend that that the sum of these changes will make the \n     threshold definition of disability in the ADA--under which \n     individuals qualify for protection from discrimination more \n     generous, and will result in the coverage of some individuals \n     who were previously excluded from those protections.\n       We note that with the changes made by the ADA Amendments \n     Act, courts will have to address whether an impairment \n     constitutes a disability under the first and second, but not \n     the third, prong of the definition of disability. The \n     functional limitation imposed by an impairment is irrelevant \n     to the third ``regarded as'' prong.\n       In general, individuals may find it easier to establish \n     disability under this bill's more generous standard than \n     under the Supreme Court's demanding standard. To repeat, we \n     intend this bill to return the legal analysis to the balance \n     that existed before the Supreme Court's Sutton and Toyota \n     decisions. The determination of disability is a necessary \n     threshold issue in many cases, but an appropriately generous \n     standard on that issue will allow courts to focus primarily \n     on whether discrimination has occurred or accommodations \n     improperly refused.\n\n\n              IV. Legislative History and Committee Action\n\n       Prior to introduction of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 on \n     July 31, 2008 with 55 original cosponsors the following \n     actions occurred in the 110th Congress.\n       On July 26, 2007, Senator Tom Harkin introduced S. 1881, \n     the ADA Restoration Act of 2007 together with Senator Arlen \n     Specter. Senator Edward Kennedy, the Chairman of the Senate \n     Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee cosponsored \n     the legislation along with Senator Ted Stevens. The bill was \n     referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \n     Committee.\n       Similarly, on July 26, 2007, Representatives Steny H. Hoyer \n     (D-MD) and James F. Sensenbrenner (R-WI) introduced H.R. \n     3195, the ADA Restoration Act of 2007, with 144 original \n     cosponsors. The bill was referred to the House Committees on \n     Education and Labor, Judiciary, Transportation and \n     Infrastructure, and Energy and Commerce.\n       On October 4, 2007, the House Judiciary Committee held a \n     hearing on H.R. 3195. Six witnesses appeared before the \n     committee: Honorable Steny Hoyer (D-MD), House Majority \n     Leader; Cheryl Sensenbrenner, Chair of the Board, American \n     Association of People with Disabilities; Stephen Orr, \n     Pharmacist (Plaintiff in Orr v. Wal-Mart); Michael Collins, \n     Executive Director, National Council on Disability; Lawrence \n     Lorber, Attorney, on behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; \n     Chai Feldblum, Director, Federal Legislation Clinic and \n     Professor of Law, Georgetown Law Center.\n       On November 15, 2007, the Senate HELP Committee held a \n     hearing chaired by Senator Tom Harkin, ``Restoring \n     Congressional Intent and Protections under the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act'' Five witnesses appeared before the \n     committee: John D. Kemp, President, United States \n     International Council on Disabilities; Dick Thornburgh, \n     Former United States Attorney General and Counsel, \n     Kirkpatrick & Lockhart; Steven Orr, Pharmacist (Plaintiff in \n     Orr v. Wal-Mart), Camille Olson, Labor and Employment \n     Attorney, Seyfarth & Shaw; Chai Feldblum, Director, Federal \n     Legislation Clinic and Professor of Law, Georgetown Law \n     Center.\n       On January 29, 2008, the House Committee on Education and \n     Labor held a hearing on H.R. 3195. Five witnesses appeared \n     before the committee: Honorable Steny Hoyer (D-MD), House \n     Majority Leader; Andrew Imparato, President and CEO, American \n     Association of People with Disabilities; Carey McClure, \n     Electrician (Plaintiff in McClure v. General Motors); Robert \n     L. Burgdorf, Professor of Law, University of the District of \n     Columbia; David K. Fram, Director, ADA & EEO Services, \n     National Employment Law Institute.\n       On June 18, 2008, the House Committee on Education & Labor \n     held a markup to consider H.R. 3195. An amendment was offered \n     as a substitute to the original bill, and it was reported out \n     of the Committee by a vote of 43 to 1.\n       On June 18, 2008, the Committee on the Judiciary held a \n     markup to consider H.R. 3195. An amendment was offered as a \n     substitute to the original bill, and it was reported out of \n     the Committee by a vote of 27 to 0.\n       On June 25, 2008, the United States House of \n     Representatives held a vote on H.R. 3195 and passed the \n     legislation by a vote of 402-17.\n       On July 15, 2008, the Senate HELP Committee held a \n     Roundtable: ``H.R. 3195 and Determining the Proper Scope of \n     Coverage for the Americans with Disabilities Act'' Eight \n     individuals gave testimony before the committee: Samuel R. \n     Bagenstos, Professor of\n\n[[Page S8348]]\n\n     Law, Washington University School of Law; Carey McClure, \n     Electrician (Plaintiff in McClure v. General Motors); JoAnne \n     Simon, Disability Rights Attorney; Sue Gamm, Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Consultant; Terry Hartle, Senior Vice \n     President, American Council on Education; Chai Feldblum, \n     Professor, Federal Legislation Clinic, Georgetown University \n     Law Center, Washington, DC; Michael Eastman, Executive \n     Director of Labor Policy, U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Andrew \n     Grossman, Senior Legal Policy Analyst, Heritage Foundation.\n       On July 31, 2008, Senators Tom Harkin and Orrin Hatch \n     introduced S. 3406, The ADA Amendments Act of 2008. The bill \n     was placed on the Senate calendar (under general orders/\n     pursuant to Rule XVI?).\n\n\n          V. Application of the Law to the Legislative Branch\n\n       Section 102(b)(3) of Public Law 104-1, the Congressional \n     Accountability Act (CAA), requires a description of the \n     application of this bill to the legislative branch. S. 3604 \n     does not amend any act that applies to the legislative \n     branch.\n\n\n                    VI. Regulatory Impact Statement\n\n       The managers have determined that the bill may result in \n     some additional paperwork, time, and costs to the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Commission, which would be entrusted \n     with implementation and enforcement of the act. It is \n     difficult to estimate the volume of additional paperwork \n     necessity by the bill, but the committee does not believe it \n     will be significant. Pursuant to the requirements of \n     paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, the committee has determined that the bill will not \n     have a significant regulatory impact.\n\n\n                    VII. Section-By-Section Analysis\n\n       Sec. 1. Short Title. This Act may be cited as the `ADA \n     Amendments Act of 2008.'\n       Sec. 2. Findings and Purposes. Acknowledges Congressional \n     intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) \n     to ``provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for \n     the elimination of discrimination against individuals with \n     disabilities'' and to provide broad coverage, and that the \n     U.S. Supreme Court subsequently erroneously narrowed the \n     definition of disability in a series of cases. The purposes \n     of the Act are to reinstate a broad scope of protection to be \n     available under the ADA, to reject several Supreme Court \n     decisions, and to re-establish original Congressional intent \n     related to the definition of disability.\n       Sec. 3. Codified Findings. Amends one finding in the ADA to \n     acknowledge that many people with physical or mental \n     impairments have been subjected to discrimination, and \n     strikes one finding related to describing the population of \n     individuals with disabilities as ``a discrete and insular \n     minority.''\n       Sec. 4. Disability Defined and Rules of Construction. \n     Amends the definition of ``disability'' and provides rules of \n     construction for applying the definition. The term \n     ``disability'' is defined to mean, with respect to an \n     individual, a physical or mental impairment that \n     substantially limits one or more major life activities, a \n     record of such impairment, or being regarded as having such \n     an impairment; provides an illustrative list of `major life \n     activities' including major bodily functions; and defines \n     `regarded as having such an impairment' as protecting \n     individuals who have been subject to an action prohibited \n     under the ADA because of an actual or perceived impairment, \n     whether or not the impairment is perceived to limit a major \n     life activity. Requires the definition of disability to be \n     construed broadly and consistent with the findings and \n     purposes. Provides rules of construction regarding the \n     definition of disability, requiring that impairments need \n     only limit one major life activity; clarifying an impairment \n     that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would \n     substantially limit a major life activity when active; and \n     prohibiting the consideration of the ameliorative effects of \n     mitigating measures such as medication, learned behavioral \n     modifications, or auxiliary aids or services, in determining \n     whether an impairment is substantially limiting, while \n     excluding ordinary eyeglasses and contact lenses.\n       Sec. 5. Discrimination on the Basis of Disability. \n     Prohibits discrimination under Title I of the ADA `on the \n     basis of disability' rather than `against a qualified \n     individual with a disability because of the disability of \n     such individual.' Clarifies that covered entities that use \n     qualification standards based on uncorrected vision must show \n     that such a requirement is job-related and consistent with \n     business necessity.\n       Sec. 6. Rules of Construction. Provides that nothing in \n     this Act alters the standards for determining eligibility for \n     benefits under State worker's compensation laws or other \n     disability benefit programs. Prohibits reverse discrimination \n     claims by disallowing claims based on the lack of disability. \n     Provides that nothing in this Act alters the provision in \n     Title III that a modification of policies or practices is not \n     required if it fundamentally alters the nature of the service \n     being provided. Establishes that entities covered under all \n     three titles of the ADA are not required to provide \n     reasonable accommodations or modifications to an individual \n     who meets the definition of disability only as a person \n     `regarded as having such an impairment.' Authorizes the EEOC, \n     Attorney General, and the Secretary of Transportation to \n     promulgate regulations implementing the definition of \n     disability and rules of construction related to the \n     definition.\n       Sec. 7. Conforming Amendments. Amends Section 7 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to cross-reference the definition \n     of disability under the ADA.\n       Sec. 8. Effective Date. Amendments made by the Act take \n     effect January 1, 2009.\n       September 11, 2008.\n     Tom Harkin,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Orrin Hatch,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I am extremely proud to be the chief \nsponsor of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, along with the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Utah, Senator Orrin Hatch. This bipartisan \nlegislation will allow us to advance and fulfill the original promise \nof the Americans With Disabilities Act, which was signed into law 18 \nyears ago.\n  I am especially grateful to Senator Hatch for his leadership and for \nhis friendship through all these years in helping to craft and move \nthis bill here in the Senate. Senator Hatch was one of the key players \nin helping get through the original ADA back in 1989 and 1990 when we \npassed it. And in this effort we have here today, he has become a true \npartner. I deeply appreciate his willingness to take on this critical \nrole. I think it is safe to say that without the help and intense \ninterest of Senator Hatch on this issue, and especially on the whole \nADA process, the bill would not be here today. Again, I am so grateful \nto Senator Hatch for his friendship and his support through all of this \nlong process.\n  And it has been a long process. We are not here today because we just \nmet the other day to put this together. It has been a couple of years \nor more in the making, and at least over a year of very intense \nnegotiations with the business community, the disability community, and \nothers to get to where we are today.\n  This bill is similar to legislation that was introduced in the other \nbody by the majority leader, Steny Hoyer, and Congressman Jim \nSensenbrenner of Wisconsin. That bill passed by a 402-to-17 margin in \nJune, and of course the bill we have here today is going to pass \nunanimously.\n  I am also grateful that from the outset these bills have been \nconceived and crafted in a spirit of genuine bipartisanship, with \nMembers of both parties coming together to do the right thing for \nAmericans with disabilities. Today, we have nearly 80 Senators \ncosponsoring this bill. Of course, passage of the original ADA was also \na bipartisan effort.\n  As the chief sponsor of that bill in the Senate, I worked very \nclosely with a great number of people on both sides of the aisle, both \nhere and in the administration--Senator Bob Dole, of course, and others \non both sides of the aisle. We received invaluable support from then-\nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush and key members of his \nadministration, including White House counsel Boyden Gray, who worked \nso hard to get the original bill through; and Attorney General Richard \nThornburgh, who helped us craft the bill and made sure we did it in the \nright way. Dick Thornburgh was so instrumental in that initial passage, \nand ever since then, for the last 18 years, I have kept in contact with \nAttorney General Thornburgh periodically, talking about the ADA, what \nit was doing, how it was being implemented, and of course because of \nthe recent court decisions, discussing with him how we could get to \nthis point today and have a bill that would overturn those court \ndecisions. Former Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner was very \ninvolved in this also.\n  But I would be remiss if I didn't state forthrightly the one person \nthrough all these years who was the key mover of the Americans With \nDisabilities Act of 1990, without whose leadership we could not have \ngotten it done, and who enabled this Senator to be the chairman of the \nDisability Policy Subcommittee and to get this bill moved through both \nsubcommittee and committee. He was there from the very beginning to the \nend and has never let up in all his years on his interest in and \nsupport of legislation that would fully incorporate people with \ndisabilities in all aspects of American life. Of course I speak of \nSenator Ted Kennedy, the chairman of the HELP Committee, who can't be \nhere with us today. He is at home in Massachusetts recuperating and \ngetting better so he can be here with us next year when we take up\n\n[[Page S8349]]\n\nhealth care reform. But if Senator Kennedy is watching, I wish to say: \nTed, this one is for you. We finally got here. We finally got the bill \nup.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy for all of his help in the last 2 to 3 years \nin pulling everything together, and I am going to have more to say \nabout that at the end when I thank all those wonderful staff members \nwho helped. But Senator Kennedy has been there from the beginning, in \nthe 1980s, when we were doing this, and all through the 1990s, to now, \nand I am sorry he can't be here with us today. I know he is here with \nus in spirit, and that spirit has been strong to get us to this point \ntoday.\n  I also thank Senator Enzi. Prior to a couple of years ago, he was \nchairman of the HELP Committee and was also very interested in helping \nto move this legislation along. Since he has been ranking member, he \nhas also been involved, and his staff involved, in making sure we could \nget this bill here today.\n  The fact is that Americans from all walks of life take enormous pride \nin what we have done in the last 18 years since the passage of ADA. No \none wants to go backwards. The ADA was one of the landmark civil rights \nstatutes of the 20th century, a long overdue emancipation proclamation \nfor Americans with disabilities. Thanks to that law, we have removed \nmost physical barriers to movement and access for Americans with \ndisabilities. We required employers to provide reasonable \naccommodations so people with disabilities could have equal opportunity \nin the workplace. We have greatly advanced the four goals of the ADA: \nequality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and \neconomic self-sufficiency.\n  I think the triumph of the ADA revolution is all around us. I \nremember a couple of years ago attending a Washington convention of \nseveral hundred disability rights advocates, many with significant \ndisabilities. They arrived in Washington on trains and airplanes and \nbuses built to accommodate people with mobility impairments. They came \nto the hotel on Metro and on regular buses, all seamlessly accessible \nby wheelchair. They navigated the city streets equipped with curb cuts \nand ramps. The hotel where the convention took place was equipped in \ncountless ways to accommodate all manner of people with all kinds of \ndisabilities. There were sign language interpreters on the dais so the \npeople with hearing disabilities could be full participants. And the \nlist goes on and on. In other words, a kind of seamless approach to \nmaking sure that anyone could participate regardless of their \ndisability.\n  For many Americans, these many changes are kind of invisible. We kind \nof take them for granted. We take curb cuts for granted and ramps, and \nwidened doorways for granted. The fact is, every building--think about \nthis--every building being built in America today is fully accessible, \nwith a universal design. A universal design. Now, these changes may be \ninvisible to most people, but for people with disabilities, they are \ntransforming and liberating. The provisions in the ADA outlawed \ndiscrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in the \nworkplace, requiring employers to provide reasonable accommodations. \nAgain, these are liberating and transforming for people with \ndisabilities.\n  But despite all this progress over the last 18 years, we have a \nproblem. We have a big problem. And the problem arises because of a \nseries of Supreme Court decisions that have greatly narrowed the scope \nof who is protected by the ADA. As a consequence, people with \nconditions that common sense would tell us are disabilities are being \ntold by the courts that they are not in fact disabled and, therefore, \nnot eligible for the protections of the law. For example, in a ruling \nlast year, the 11th Circuit Court concluded that a person with an \nintellectual disability was not ``disabled'' under the ADA.\n  When I try to explain to people what the Supreme Court has done, they \nare shocked. Impairments that the Court says are not to be considered \ndisabilities under the law--at least in some cases--include amputation, \nintellectual disabilities, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, \nmuscular dystrophy, cancer, and others.\n  In three decisions on the same day in June of 1999--what we now know \nas the Sutton trilogy--the Supreme Court held that corrective and \nmitigating measures must be considered in determining whether an \nindividual has a disability under the ADA. This is in complete \ncontradiction to congressional intent as we expressed in our committee \nreports.\n  When we pass laws around here, we don't put every single little thing \nin the law; we would have huge bills. What we do is we have committee \nreports and findings to instruct the courts as to what our intent \nis. We expect the courts to follow them.\n\n  In the Senate committee report, here is what we said:\n\n       Whether a person has a disability should be assessed \n     without regard to the availability of mitigating measures, \n     such as reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids.\n\n  You cannot get much clearer than that. The House report said \nbasically the same thing. It said:\n\n       For example, a person who is hard of hearing is \n     substantially limited in the major life activity of hearing, \n     even though the loss may be corrected through the use of a \n     hearing aid. Likewise, persons with impairments, such as \n     epilepsy or diabetes, which substantially limit a major life \n     activity are covered under . . . the definition of \n     disability, even if the effects of the impairment are \n     controlled by medication.\n\n  That was in our report 18 years ago. The Supreme Court ignored that. \nThey ignored it.\n  In the Sutton case, Sutton v. United Airlines, the Supreme Court held \nthat for persons taking corrective measures to mitigate a physical or \nmental impairment, the effect of those measures must be taken into \naccount when judging whether a person is ``disabled''--and therefore \ncovered under the law.\n  That could include anything from visual aids to prostheses.\n  In Murphy v. the United Parcel Service, the Court applied the same \nanalysis to medication used to treat hypertension, and concluded an \nemployee who was fired because he had high blood pressure and \nhypertension was not covered because he took medication to alleviate \nthe symptoms. But, again, in our report, as we said before, that should \nnot be taken into account.\n  In the case of Albertsons v. Kirkingburg--we call it the Kirkingburg \ncase--the Supreme Court went further and declared mitigating measures \nto be considered in the determination of whether someone is disabled \nincluded not only artificial aids such as devices and medications but \nalso subconscious measures that an individual may use to compensate for \nhis or her impairment. What were they talking about? Kirkingburg was an \nindividual who was blind in one eye. Through experience and coping with \nit, he had been able to compensate for the fact he was blind in one \neye. The Court said subconsciously he was able to compensate for that, \ntherefore he must not be disabled. People hear this and they say how \ncould the Supreme Court have decided that?\n  Last, in another case, the Toyota case, the Court held there must be \na ``demanding standing for qualifying as disabled.'' Again, restricted; \na demanding standard. We have never said that in the ADA bill. We \ndidn't say that at all.\n  What has happened is that countless individuals have been excluded \nfrom ADA, even though the general rule of all civil rights laws is they \nshould be broadly construed to achieve their remedial purposes, and the \nADA is a civil rights statute.\n  Again, what does all this mean? What this means is the Supreme Court \ndecisions have led to a supreme absurdity, a Catch-22 situation that so \nmany people with disabilities find themselves in today. For example, \nthe more successful a person is at coping with a disability, the more \nlikely it is the Court will find that they are no longer disabled and \ntherefore no longer covered under the ADA. If they are not covered \nunder ADA, then any request that they might make for a reasonable \naccommodation can be denied. If they do not get the reasonable \naccommodation, they cannot do their job; and they can get fired and \nthey will not be covered by the ADA and they will not have any \nrecourse.\n  Let's look at it this way. If you are disabled and you take \nmedication or use an assistive device, then you will be able to do your \njob, right? If you take the medication, use the assistive device, now \nyou can do your job, but you will not be covered by the ADA.\n\n[[Page S8350]]\n\nTherefore, if you ask for a reasonable accommodation, the employer will \nsay: No, you can't do your job, you are fired and, guess what, you go \nto court and the court will say: You are not disabled, you use an \nassistive device, you take medication. On the other hand, if you do not \ntake the medication or you do not use an assistive device, you will not \nbe qualified to do the job.\n  So what is a person with a disability supposed to do? If I use \nmedication or use an assistive device, it enables me to become \neconomically self-sufficient, become independent, become fully \nintegrated in society. If I take medication or use my assistive device \nI can do that, I can get a job. But then I am no longer covered by ADA, \nand I can be fired or terminated. I will not get a reasonable \naccommodation.\n  You can see what this has done to so many millions of people with \ndisabilities. What am I to do? I want to get a job. But I want the \ncoverage of ADA. But I have to give that up if I use medication or use \nan assistive device--an absolute absurdity. This is not what I \nintended. It is not what anyone intended when we passed the ADA 18 \nyears ago.\n  It boggles the mind that any court would say that multiple sclerosis, \nmuscular dystrophy or epilepsy is not a disability covered by the ADA, \nbut that is where we are today. Think about the troops coming home from \nIraq, losing limbs, getting prostheses. The Court might find they are \nnot disabled. If they might need some reasonable accommodations to get \na decent job, the Court would find they are not covered by the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act.\n  As a result, we have to have this bill, and that is what this bill is \nall about. This bill is about restoring the Americans with Disabilities \nAct back to where we intended it to be 18 years ago and to give clear \ndirections to the courts about how they should decide these cases. This \nbill will overturn the so-called Sutton trilogy and Toyota v. Williams \nand will give clear direction to the courts on exactly what we mean. It \nwill restore the proper balance, it will clarify and broaden the \ndefinition of disability, it will increase eligibility for the \nprotections of the ADA.\n  People who are denied coverage under ADA will now be covered, and we \nwill get rid of that Catch-22 situation that confronts so many people \nright now with disabilities.\n  I tell you, this is extremely important in the employment context. \nAccording to most recent data, more than 60 percent of individuals with \ndisabilities are not employed. That is shameful, in our society, that \nwe have an unemployment rate among people with disabilities of 60 \npercent. These are people who want to work, who are capable of work. \nThey want to go out and become fully functioning members of society and \ncontribute to society. All they need is the opportunity.\n  I can tell you employers find people with disabilities are sometimes \nthe most exemplary of workers. All they need is the opportunity, a \nreasonable accommodation, and they can do their job. This bill before \nus today renews our promise to all Americans with disabilities. We \nbasically say we keep the basic language of the original bill, but we \nalso make sure the bill overturns the basis for the reasoning in the \nSupreme Court decisions--as I said, the Sutton trilogy and Toyota case \nthat has been so problematic.\n  We clearly state mitigating measures--such as the medication or \nassistive devices I talked about earlier--are not to be considered in \ndetermining whether someone is entitled to the protections of the ADA. \nNo longer is it report language. We put this in bill language so the \nSupreme Court can't skirt around it again.\n  The bill will make it easier for people with disabilities to be \ncovered. It expands the definition of disability to include many more \nlife activities, including a new category of major body functions. The \nlatter point is important for people with immune disorders or cancer or \nkidney disease or liver disease because they no longer need to \nshow what specific activity they are limited in, in order to meet the \nstatutory definition of disability. The bill rejects the current EEOC \nregulation which says that ``substantially limits'' means \n``significantly restricted'' as too high a standard. We indicate \nCongress's expectation that the regulation be rewritten in a less \nstringent way and we provide the authority in this bill to do so.\n\n  The bill also revives the ``regarded as'' prong of the definition of \ndisability. It makes it easier for those who suffer from discrimination \nbecause of a perceived disability to be able to seek relief if they \nhave been fired or subjected to another adverse action. We also say the \ndefinition of disability is to be interpreted broadly, to the maximum \nextent permitted by the ADA.\n  Again, this bill will give clear direction, of course, as to exactly \nwhat we intend: A broad definition, more people covered, and getting \nrid of that problem of having that Catch-22 situation.\n  Eighteen years ago, the Americans with Disabilities Act passed with \noverwhelming bipartisan support, and I am proud to say we have that \nsame level of support today in passing this unanimously. I am grateful \nfor the bipartisan spirit with which we have considered this bill. We \nhave an opportunity to come together to make an important difference \nfor millions of Americans with disabilities.\n  I might say the bill enjoys strong support in the country. I have a \nletter I will submit for the Record from over 250 business, faith, \ndisability, labor, and military organizations that support this bill \nand urge its passage.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of the statements of both mine and Senator \nHatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. The bill is supported by all the national disability \norganizations as well the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the Society for Human Resource \nManagement, and the Human Resources Policy Association.\n  The genesis of the legislation is a result of direct conversations \nbetween the disability and business communities that should serve as a \nmodel for other legislative efforts.\n  I wish to say, there were a lot of negotiations that went on between \ndisability groups, the Chamber of Commerce, the Human Resource Policy \nAssociation, National Association of Manufacturers, other business \ngroups. They were long. They were involved. They were tough \nnegotiations. There was a lot of give and take. I think that is the way \nwe have to do things.\n  To those who say we cannot get anything done around here, I point to \nthis bill. We can get things done around here as long as people of good \nwill are willing to work together. It may take a little time. Sometimes \ngood things take a little time. It takes a lot of negotiations, \nreaching across the aisle, reaching across to one another, and we can \nreach these kind of agreements. We can move this country forward, and \nwe can make American society more fair and just and accommodating for \nall.\n  I have two last things. I wish to take a moment to recognize our \nveterans with disabilities. This bill we have before us renews our \ncommitment to ensure that all Americans with disabilities, including a \nnew generation of disabled veterans who are just beginning to grapple \nwith the challenges of living to their full potential, despite any \nlimitations imposed by the disabilities, are able to participate to the \nfullest possible extent in all facets of society, including the \nworkplace. They deserve equality, access, and opportunity.\n  I would like to submit for the Record a letter from 23 veterans \ngroups supporting this legislation. I ask unanimous consent it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                 Veterans for ADA Restoration,\n\n                             Silver Spring, MD, September 9, 2008.\n     Re Support for new ADA Amendments Act of 2008. S. 3604\n\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Hatch: When a disabled veteran \n     recovers enough to return to the workforce, it's a slap in \n     the face to run into employment discrimination. That is why \n     we salute you for your leadership in sponsoring S. 3406 to \n     restore the protections of the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act (ADA) that have been eroded by the courts.\n       As leaders of organizations that represent men and women \n     who have served honorably\n\n[[Page S8351]]\n\n     in our nation's military, we are proud to support the Senate \n     version of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (S. 3406).\n       This revised ADA bill has broad bipartisan support and the \n     support of an unusual coalition of business, disabilities, \n     civil rights and veterans/military groups who are working \n     together to reverse narrow court interpretations of the ADA \n     that had deprived people with many kinds of disabilities from \n     ADA protection.\n       It confirms that veterans and other people with \n     disabilities should not lose their civil rights because their \n     conditions can be managed with mitigating measures such as \n     medication, prosthetics and therapy, and assistive \n     technology.\n       The honorable men and women who have become disabled in the \n     service of our country deserve our support in every way. \n     Often the best healing agent for both mind and body is to \n     return to the workforce with a decent job at a living wage. \n     This bill will help make sure they are protected from \n     unlawful discrimination.\n       Disabled veterans have already sacrificed so much. The very \n     least we owe our disabled veterans is to make sure they have \n     a remedy when they face discrimination in the workplace \n     because of their disability. It is the patriotic duty of all \n     Americans to protect these patriots against this indignity.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership in sponsoring the ADA \n     Amendments Act, S. 3406.\n           Sincerely,\n         Paul J.

I last would like to thank those who helped us get to \nthis day, including those who are no longer with us. My friend, Justin \nDart, who was so instrumental in helping us get the ADA passed. We are \nfortunate that his wife Yoshiko continues to carry on his legacy, day \nafter day, week after week, year after year. Ed Roberts, the father of \nthe Independent Living movement, whose work and vision live on.\n  And all the disability advocates and people with disabilities who \nhave been so dedicated to the goals of the ADA, without whose hard work \nand dedicated efforts today would not have been possible--people such \nas Jim Ward and his family, who dedicated almost 2 years of their lives \ntraveling on a bus around the country to every State, showing people \nabout the importance of restoring the protections of ADA. Bob Kafka of \nADAPT, who was so instrumental in passage of the ADA, and who has \ndedicated his life to fulfilling the goals of the ADA.\n  I wish to say a special thank-you to Jennifer Mathis of the Bazelon \nCenter for her practical and practiced advice; Sandy Finucane of the \nEpilepsy Foundation; of course to Andy Imparato of the American \nAssociation of People With Disabilities for always being there in that \nleadership position--for his level-headed leadership, for bringing \ndifferent groups together, and sometimes that is like herding cats to \nget all of us together. Andy did a great job in making sure we were \nalways there and making sure we had our conferences and negotiations \nand keeping us all headed in the same direction. So to Andy Imparato I \ngive my highest thanks and my deepest thanks for all of his \nhelpfulness.\n  Thanks to Nanzy Zirkin of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; \nand to Professor Chai Feldblum of the Georgetown Law Center for \ncreative and innovative thinking, for always being willing to testify \nbefore our committee.\n  Thanks to Randy Johnson and Mike Eastman of the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce; to Mike Peterson of the H.R. Policy Association; to Jeri \nGillespie of the National Association of Manufacturers; and to Mike \nAitken of the Society of Human Resource Management.\n  Thanks to our key staff members: Tom Jipping and Chris Campbell of \nSenator Hatch's staff--great to work with--and Lee Perselay, Beth \nStein, and Pam Smith of my own staff. Again, they have worked \ntirelessly on this day after day.\n  I wish to thank the House committee staff, Sharon Lewis and Heather \nSawyer, and Leader Hoyer's staff, Keith Abouchar and Michelle \nStockwell, as well as a wish for them to make quick work of passing \nthis bill when it gets over to the House.\n  Of course, I also thank the staff of the HELP Committee, the \nchairman's staff, Michael Myers, Connie Garner, and Charlotte Burrows, \nand Brian Hayes with Ranking Member Enzi.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have supported \nthis bill in overwhelming numbers and made it possible to pass the bill \nand hopefully get it signed into law and advance the original intent of \nthe original Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  You know, there may not be a lot of people here on the floor of the \nSenate today, but I can tell you, though, throughout the country there \nare millions of Americans with disabilities who know what we are doing \nhere. They have been told. They know what we have done over the last \ncouple or 3 years to overturn those Supreme Court decisions. They are \nwaiting anxiously for this bill to be passed, for the House to pass it, \nand for President Bush to sign it into law so that once again they can \ngo out with full knowledge that they are covered by this civil rights \nbill, that they can go out and seek employment, that they can travel, \nthat they can seek the accommodations that will make them fully \nfunctioning members of our society and knowing that they are covered by \nthe law. So there are millions of Americans with disabilities and their \nfamilies all over this country today who I know are expressing thanks \nto all the people who have been involved in getting this done. Again, \nso many are not here with us today. They know what we are doing, and \nthey are anxiously waiting for this to pass and to get it to the \nPresident, and hopefully we will get that done--hopefully by next week.\n  The last thing was--I thanked a lot of people, but I would be remiss \nif I did not thank the one person who more than any other set my feet \non this course many years ago, who taught me a lot about being \ndisabled, and who taught me a lot about discrimination against people \nwith disabilities. And, of course, I speak of my brother, Frank.\n  He was here when we passed the original ADA, but he has since passed \non. But it was my brother who first said to me many years ago when he \nwas sent to the Iowa School for the Deaf--they called it the Iowa \nSchool for the Deaf and Dumb--he said, ``I may be deaf, but I am not \ndumb.'' It was also my brother who one time said to me that the only \nthing deaf people cannot do is hear. He wanted to do a lot of things in \nhis life, but because of prejudices, because of discrimination, he was \nheld back and discriminated against. I saw it time after time after \ntime. He was able to persevere and carve out a life of independence and \ndignity for himself, but I often thought, why did he have to do that? I \nmean, why did it require an extraordinary effort on his part just to be \na contributing member of our society, just to enjoy a lot of things we \ntake for granted?\n  So I thought so much about that. I thought, you know, if I ever got \nin a position to do anything about it, I was going to do something. \nWell, as fortune would have it, I was elected to the House and then \nlater elected to the\n\n[[Page S8352]]\n\nSenate and found myself as chairman of the Disability Policy \nSubcommittee under the tutelage of Senator Kennedy. We were able to get \nthe first ADA act passed.\n  I have to tell you a story here, just talking about discrimination. I \nwas sworn into the Senate in January of 1985. I had my brother, Frank; \nhe along with my whole family was here sitting up there in the gallery \nright back here. I had provided for an interpreter to interpret for my \nbrother as he was watching the proceedings here on the floor of the \nSenate. Well, then a policeman came out. Actually, one of my brothers \nsaid: The policemen are up there and asked the interpreter to leave \nbecause she could not be there. I went up to the gallery. I am about to \nget sworn into the Senate.\n  I went up to find out what was going on.\n  The officer said: We cannot let people up in the gallery stand up and \ndo this interpreting.\n  I said: Why not?\n  He said: It is against the rules.\n  What rules?\n  Well, it is against the rules.\n  Well, I was furious. So I came down on the floor, and in 1985, you \nmight remember the Senate majority leader was Senator Bob Dole. So I \nwent right to Dole and I said: Senator Dole, here is my problem. I got \nmy brother up there, and they won't let an interpreter interpret.\n  He said: Really? Well, I will take care of that.\n  And he took care of it. He took care of it. So we got an interpreter. \nOf course, now we have closed captioning and all kinds of things now \nfor Senate activities. But, again, it is just that attitude people \nhave. This was in 1985. That would not happen today. Of course, we have \naccess for people who have mobility disabilities to come in, and we \nhave made the Capitol accessible for people with all kinds of \ndisabilities.\n  But I relate that story as a way of again thanking my brother, Frank, \nfor setting my feet on this path so many years ago. For me, it has been \na labor of love, not without its frustrations, not without saying--one \nday at the Supreme Court, with Bob Dole by my side, listening to the \nSupreme Court hand down one of these decisions, I said: What could they \npossibly be thinking? We went out and talked to the press after, \nSenator Dole and I did. So it has had its frustrations.\n  We are not to the promised land yet with 60 percent unemployment \namong people with disabilities. We have a long way to go. But this, the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, is the civil rights statute that says \nto people: You cannot discriminate. Just as we passed the civil rights \nbills that said: You cannot discriminate on the basis of race or sex or \nnational origin or religion, now you cannot discriminate on the basis \nof disability either, plus you have to take some other steps; we have \nto have reasonable accommodations. So this is the civil rights statute \nthat emancipates and frees people with disabilities so they can be \nfully contributing members of our society.\n  I close my remarks by thanking the President for her indulgence, the \nindulgence of other Senators for permitting me to speak for so long. As \nI said, this, for me, for all of my adult life, is a cause to which I \nhave committed myself, much of my staff, much of our time and effort. I \nam grateful to the leadership of the Senate, both on the Republican and \nDemocratic side, and again to my great friend and partner Senator Hatch \nfor making it possible for us to bring up this bill today and get it \npassed unanimously. Unanimously. That is even better than what we did \nwith the ADA. We only had six votes against it in 1990. This is \nunanimous. I think it sends a clear signal that whether you are \nRepublican or Democratic, it does not make any difference--it does not \nmake any difference, we are going to stand behind people with \ndisabilities. We are going to make sure the ADA takes its rightful \nplace once again as the umbrella civil rights statute for all Americans \nwith disabilities.\n  I thank all of my colleagues. I look forward to the passage of this \nbill in the House. I look forward to the President hopefully signing it \nas early as next week.\n                                                   August 21, 2008\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Re: The ADA Amendments Act of 2008\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: The undersigned groups, representing a \n     broad range of interests, write in support of the ADA \n     Amendments Act of 2008 (S. 3406). This bill introduced on \n     July 31, 2008, had 64 cosponsors as of August 1, with 55 of \n     those joining as original cosponsors.\n       S. 3406, the ADA Amendments Act, would revise the ADA, in a \n     manner designed to work for both people with disabilities and \n     for entities governed under the law. The bill is a result of \n     sustained efforts between Senators from both sides of the \n     aisle and intensive and thoughtful talks between \n     representatives of the disability community and entities \n     governed by the law. For that reason, we believe that S. 3406 \n     strikes a delicate balance between the needs of individuals \n     with disabilities and the realities experienced by entities \n     including employers and public accommodations, which are \n     covered under the law.\n       We urge your support in making enactment of S. 3406, the \n     ADA Amendments Act, a reality as soon as Congress returns to \n     work in September. We stand ready to work with you towards \n     that end.\n           Sincerely,\n         ABC Business Services, Illinois; Abilities in Motion, \n           Pennsylvania; ADA Watch/National Coalition for \n           Disability Rights;

Madam President, this is an important day in our ongoing \neffort to expand opportunities for individuals with disabilities to \nparticipate in the American dream.\n  Passage of the ADA Amendments Act establishes that the Americans with \nDisabilities Act will continue to help change lives. Nearly two decades \nago, Senator Harkin and I stood on this same Senate floor as partners \nin this cause. Of course, my good friend from Iowa, Tom Harkin, has \nbeen a great leader in this area, and others as well.\n  In 1990, we worked together to produce a compromise that passed the \nCongress overwhelmingly. We stand here again today to do the same \nthing.\n  Why did we need to do this? The Americans with Disabilities Act \ndefines a disability as an impairment that substantially limits a major \nlife activity. It prohibits discrimination on the basis of a present, \npast, or perceived disability.\n  As the ADA was put into practice and used in actual cases, the courts \nhad to construe and apply its meaning. In Sutton v. United Airlines, \nthe Supreme Court said that impairments must be examined in their \nmitigated state to determine whether they constitute a disability.\n  In Toyota v. Williams, the Court said the definition of \n``disability'' must be interpreted strictly to create a demanding \nstandard for qualifying as disabled.\n  These decisions had the effect of narrowing the ADA's coverage and \nthe protection it affords. Some explain these decisions by saying that \nthe Court ignored what Congress intended in the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. Others explained them by saying the Court had to \nreconcile everything Congress said in the ADA.\n  Either way, when it comes to legislation, when Congress does not like \nsomething, Congress can change it, and that is what we are doing today.\n  The authority over Federal disability policy remains right here with \nthe Congress, and it is our responsibility to establish, change, \nexpand, redirect, or amend it whenever and however we see fit. That is \nwhat we are doing today with this bill.\n  The bill we pass today is the third and final round of a long process \nthat started more than a year ago.\n  First came the introduction of the ADA Restoration Act, then passage \nof the House ADA Amendments Act--wonderful work done by our colleagues \nin the House--and now passage of the Senate ADA Amendments Act.\n  Stakeholders, including disability, business, and education groups \ncontributed to this process. House and Senate\n\n[[Page S8354]]\n\ncommittees held hearings, and staff participated in what no doubt \nseemed at times as endless rounds of negotiation.\n  The result is a true compromise that establishes more generous \ncoverage and protection under the ADA in a way that maximizes consensus \nand minimizes unintended consequences.\n  First, the bill removes what the Supreme Court said led it to \nnarrowly construe the ADA in the first place. Congress stated in the \nADA that there are 43 million Americans with disabilities. The Supreme \nCourt treated this as a cap and answered the questions regarding \nmitigating measures and the standard for applying the disability \ndefinition to fit under that cap.\n  Removing that finding removes the cap and allows the Court to \nconstrue and apply the definition more generously.\n  Secondly, the bill lowers the threshold for determining when an \nimpairment constitutes a disability without using new undefined terms.\n  Removing the finding that served to raise that threshold and using \nmore appropriate findings and purpose language to explain its meaning \nmade departing from the ADA's existing definitional language \nunnecessary.\n  Third, the bill directs that the definition of disability be \nconstrued in favor of broad coverage. This reflects what courts have \nheld about civil rights statutes in general and what courts held about \nthe ADA in particular before the Toyota decision; namely, that they \nshould be broadly construed to effect their remedial purpose.\n  I was not comfortable with the open-ended rule of broad construction \nin the House bill. The rule in our bill parallels a similar provision \nin the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, a bill I \nintroduced and the Senate unanimously passed in 2002.\n  Fourth, the bill does what the ADA did not by prohibiting \nconsideration of mitigating measures. The committee reports on the ADA \nsay mitigating measures should be ignored, but the ADA itself does not.\n  Courts consult committee reports to clarify ambiguous statutory \nlanguage but cannot use those reports as a substitute for nonexistent \nstatutory language. So we make it clear that with the exception of \neyeglasses and contacts impairments are to be considered in their \nunmitigated state when determining whether they are disabilities.\n  Fifth, the bill makes the current prohibition of discrimination on \nthe basis of being regarded as having a disability apply to the broader \ncategory of impairments. I have to say this is a significant step \nbecause individuals will no longer have to prove they have a disability \nor that their impairment limits them in any way.\n  The bill balances this by limiting the remedies available under this \nprovision. This is a good example of how we work to balance the impact \nof the bill and to accommodate the interests of the parties affected by \nit.\n  Finally, we tried to minimize the impact this bill would have in the \neducational arena. While the issues that made this legislation \nnecessary arose in the employment context, any change we make could \nimpact educators. So we affirmed in this bill what the courts have \nalready ruled, that institutions of higher education are not required \nto fundamentally alter educational standards when providing reasonable \naccommodations to students with disabilities.\n  This bill is supported by hundreds of groups on both the disability \nand business side and by dozens of veterans organizations.\n  We introduced this bill on July 31 with 55 original cosponsors, and \nas of today that number tops 70, more than the original ADA. More than \ntwo-thirds of the Democratic and Republican caucuses have cosponsored \nthis legislation, and I believe everyone else is for it as well.\n  This is a great achievement that continues the tradition of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 and the ADA in 1990 in removing barriers and \nincreasing opportunities for our fellow citizens with disabilities.\n  The work was long and hard. Many pieces had to be put in the right \nplace for this puzzle to become clear. But the picture that resulted is \nbeautiful indeed.\n  Our commitment, our obligation, our promise did not end with the ADA, \nand it will not end with today's passage of the ADA Amendments Act.\n  I want to particularly thank my friend and colleague, Senator Harkin, \nfor his continuing leadership, as well as Chairman Kennedy. He cannot \nbe here today mainly because he is mending up there in Massachusetts. I \njust chatted with him again yesterday. But he deserves a lot of credit \non this bill. Of course, also deserving great credit is the ranking \nmember of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator \nEnzi, for his support of this bill and for the facilitation of this \ndevelopment, and others as well. All the cosponsors deserve a great \ndeal of credit on this bill.\n  I want to particularly thank staff members who labored long and hard, \nincluding Tom Jipping on my staff, Chris Campbell on my staff, and \nMichael Madsen on my staff, and Lee Perselay, Pam Smith, and Beth Stein \non Senator Harkin's staff. This bill would not have come along as well \nas it has without these wonderful staff people who worked so long and \nprodigiously to help make this work.\n  There were times when people thought that divergent interests and \ndiverse viewpoints simply could not be reconciled, especially in this \narea. They thought the same thing back in 1990. Since we came together \nthen to produce the ADA, I knew we would ultimately come together now \nto produce the ADA Amendments Act, and we did.\n  I know this will make a real difference in the lives of real people, \nand for that I am humbled and grateful.\n  When we argued the original Americans With Disabilities Act on this \nfloor, I mentioned how I carried my brother-in-law, Raymon Hansen, in \nmy arms through the Los Angeles temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of \nLatter-Day Saints. He weighed very little. He had to go home to an iron \nlung every night. This young man, who was an athlete in both high \nschool and college, and a great athlete at that, got both types of \npolio, yet he finished his undergraduate degree in education and went \non and got a master's degree in engineering. He worked at Edgerton, \nGermeshausen & Greer, one of the great engineering firms, and he worked \nevery day, right up until the day he died.\n  I have to admit I have been in the presence of so many people who \nhave disabilities, major disabilities, who suffer long and hard, but \nwho have more courage, more ability, and more verve than a lot of us \nwho are not suffering from disabilities.\n  I know Senator Harkin mentioned his brother and others, and I am sure \nhe will do that again today. I have a great deal of affection for \nSenator Harkin, and I had it before this bill back in 1990, but I have \ncertainly had it even more greatly since. He is a good man, and he has \na great desire to do what is right in this area, and so do I.\n  There are millions and millions of people with disabilities who can \nbe very good, functioning members of our society and who will benefit \nfrom this bill, and I personally express my gratitude to all of the \ncosponsors, but especially to Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, and \nSenator Enzi. These are great people who are trying to do great things \nhere, and for a very bad election year, this is one of the greatest \nthings we will have done in this whole year. For that, I am truly \ngrateful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I strongly support the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008, and I commend Senator \nHarkin and Senator Hatch for their leadership on this important measure \nto restore the vitality of the Americans with Disabilities Act. As \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions, which has jurisdiction over this legislation, I know too well \nhow urgently this legislation is needed to protect the civil rights of \npersons with disabilities.\n  America's strength and success as a nation have been fueled by its \nfounding promise of equal justice for all. Yet for much of the Nation's \nhistory, persons with disabilities were treated as people who needed \ncharity, not opportunity. Out of ignorance, the Nation accepted \ndiscrimination for decades, and yielded to fear and prejudice.\n  In the 35 years since passage of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \nwhich outlawed discrimination against persons\n\n[[Page S8355]]\n\nwith disabilities in programs and activities receiving Federal funds, \nour Nation has made great progress toward making the promise of equal \njustice a reality for such persons. The Fair Housing Amendments Act of \n1988 continued this progress by extending housing protections to \npersons with disabilities, but it was the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 which opened wide the doors of opportunity by providing \nlong-overdue protections against job discrimination and greater access \nto public accommodations. The 1990 act was a giant step toward \nguaranteeing that persons with disabilities would be full participants \nin the American dream.\n  Unfortunately, however, in many job discrimination cases, the courts \nhave interpreted the act so narrowly that many of us who were original \nsponsors of the act barely recognize it today. Courts have ruled that \nmany of the very persons the act was designed to protect are not \ncovered by its provisions. These decisions have improperly shifted the \nemphasis in ADA cases away from the central question of whether \ndiscrimination occurred.\n  The bill we are considering today reaffirms Congress's intent that \nthe courts should interpret the ADA broadly to fulfill its important \npurpose. In deciding whether to grant relief under the act, courts \nshould respect the act's goal of expanding opportunities for persons \nwith disabilities.\n  In particular, courts have narrowed the first prong of the ADA's \ndefinition of disability, which defines a disability as a physical or \nmental impairment that ``substantially limits'' one or more life \nactivities. As explained in the statement of managers, the bill seeks \nto remedy this problem by clearly rejecting the reasoning of cases like \nToyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams in 2002, in \nwhich the Supreme Court held that this prong of the definition must be \n``be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying \nas disabled,'' and that ``substantially limits'' means ``prevents or \nseverely restricts.''\n  The bill also rejects the Supreme Court's earlier holding in Sutton \nv. United Air Lines, which also imposed too heavy a burden on \nplaintiffs seeking relief under the act.\n  Although the House of Representatives' consideration of the pending \nlegislation was of significant assistance to the Senate on this issue, \nin one important respect the Senate diverged from the reasoning \nexpressed in the reports of the committees of jurisdiction in the \nHouse. The House version of the bill defined ``substantially limits'' \nas ``materially restricts,'' and the House Committee reports explained \nthis term with reference to a spectrum or range of severity. The term \n``materially restricts'' in the House bill and these portions of the \nHouse reports set an inappropriately high standard for the \ndetermination of whether an individual is substantially limited in a \nmajor life activity and pose the risk of confusing the threshold \ndetermination of who is covered by the act. Fortunately, our Senate \nbill avoids this problem and provides the broader coverage needed to \ncorrect the excessively restrictive and unintended interpretation in \nthe litigation.\n  In addition, the bill's findings and purposes section states that \n``the question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability \nunder the ADA should not demand extensive analysis.'' This statement \nmakes clear that courts normally should not require an extensive \nexamination of an individual's disability in cases under the ADA. In \nsuch cases the main focus should be on whether discrimination has \noccurred, not on the threshold issue of whether an individual's \nimpairment qualifies as a disability. As the Senate Statement of \nManagers explains, courts should not interpret this statement to \nconstrain plaintiffs from offering evidence needed to establish that \ntheir impairment is substantially limiting. Of course, this statement \nin the bill does not impose any limitation on what evidence the party \nwith the burden of proof on the issue of disability may offer. Indeed, \nsuch a position would be inconsistent with clearly established \nevidentiary and procedural rules, and constitutional requirements as \nwell. The party with the burden of proving disability is free to \nintroduce all the evidence of disability that he or she believes is \nappropriate, consistent with evidentiary and procedural rules. As the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission has stated in a related \ncontext, the plaintiff's evidentiary burden is minimal.\n  Our goal in this bill is to greatly enhance the protections against \ndiscrimination for persons with disabilities, and I hope these \nclarifications will avoid further confusion in future litigation. I am \nproud to join with Senators Harkin and Hatch and the other sponsors in \nsupport of the act, and I strongly urge the Senate to approve \nit.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, this act has opened the door to \nhundreds of thousands of individuals to actively participate and \ncontribute to our great Nation. It has raised the conscience of our \nNation regarding disabilities and the impact they have on their lives. \nThe fair treatment of the citizens of the United States is paramount. \nEvery citizen, regardless of the obstacles in their lives, should have \nthe opportunity to work, live and fully participate in our society.\n  There are many individuals with disabilities who are exceptional \nphysicians and professionals. It is clear that situations will arise in \nwhich an individual desiring to become a licensed physician has a \nlegitimate disability and a reasonable accommodation can be made during \nstandardized testing.\n  Licensing boards have the responsibility to accurately measure an \napplicant's skills and abilities to practice in a professional field. \nThe purpose of standardized examinations is to create a set environment \nin which to carefully determine and ensure that applicants have the \nknowledge, skill, and ability to perform in the real world. Certain \nperformance measurements can only be evaluated under set parameters. It \nis vital that standardized testing organizations not be required to \nfundamentally alter key performance measurements when providing \nreasonable accommodations to students with disabilities.\n  As a doctor, I understand the need to ensure that future physicians \nhave the ability to safely and skillfully provide medical care. \nPatients should not have to worry about whether their treating \nphysician is qualified.\n  Public health and safety is based on the ability of these physicians \nto work under pressure, respond quickly, and do so in a manner that \nprotects the well-being of the patient. The real world requires a \nphysician to concentrate and think clearly, often within a very small \ntimeframe.\n  Licensed physicians throughout the country are required to take a \nstandardized test to meet the requirements expected of the profession. \nDetermining whether an accommodation is reasonable should be left to \nthe licensing board. When a testing organization or a licensing board \nhas made a decision in good faith about an appropriate accommodation, \nthe decision should be given great deference. This is particularly true \nin light of the important role these examinations play in the licensing \nprocess and the safety of the general public.\n  It is important that the integrity of standardized tests for the \nlicensing of professionals in the field of medicine is maintained. The \nlegislation does not require accommodations which would alter key \nperformance measurements. There is no record that this legislation \nwould require standardized testing organizations, such as the State \nBoards of Medicine, to fundamentally alter their examinations with \naccommodations that will undermine the essential purpose of their exam.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in passing the ADA Amendments Act of \n2008 on this day--September 11--the Senate has managed to recapture, at \nleast for a time, the sense of unity and purpose that sustained our \nnation on this day 7 years ago. This is not a Democratic or Republican \nvictory. This is a major victory for all Americans.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act is one of the major civil rights \nlaws in our nation's history, but recent court decisions have narrowed \nits scope and mistakenly excluded many people who should be protected.\n  The Supreme Court has created a cruel catch-22: If you can manage \nyour disability you might not be protected by the ADA. People end up \nwith terrible choices. Should I take the medication I need to stay \nhealthy and be denied the protections of the ADA? Or do\n\n[[Page S8356]]\n\nI stop taking my medication so that I can be protected from \ndiscrimination? That is not what Congress intended when it passed the \nADA.\n  By passing the ADA Amendments Act, the Senate is undoing the damage \ncaused by the Supreme Court and reaffirming the principle that America \nwill not tolerate discrimination based on real or perceived disability, \nfears and stereotypes.\n  America has made real progress since President George H.W. Bush \nsigned the ADA in 1990. Many of the physical changes the ADA has \nbrought about--like curb cuts--benefit all Americans, not just those \nwith disabilities. Because of the ADA and other disability rights laws \nmillions of Americans with disabilities have gained access to public \naccommodations, quality educations, and equal housing opportunities.\n  But too many people remained locked out of the workplace. Employment \nrates for men and women with disabilities have actually declined \nsteadily since the ADA became law. Today, more than 60 percent of \nworking-age Americans with disabilities are unemployed, and Americans \nwith disabilities who do work are almost three times more likely to \nlive in poverty than workers without disabilities. That is wrong, and \nit must end.\n  The march of progress in America can be marked by the expansion of \nfreedom. Slaves who were denied full citizenship under our Constitution \nwere given their rights with amendments after our Civil War and civil \nrights legislation almost a century later. Women denied the right to \nvote in America for generations finally won that right a century ago.\n  It is time indeed, it is past time--to expand our concept of freedom \nand acknowledge the rights of another group of Americans who have \nsuffered discrimination through history: people with disabilities. It \nis my hope and expectation that the House and Senate can work together \nto resolve minor differences between our two bills and send the \nPresident a bill that he can sign that will protect all Americans with \ndisabilities.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise to support wholeheartedly the ADA \nAmendments Act of 2008. Nearly 20 years ago Congress passed the \ngroundbreaking Americans with Disabilities Act. Because of its \nenactment and implementation, our country has made progress in \neliminating the historical stigma previously associated with disability \nand guaranteeing basic civil rights and liberties to people with \ndisabilities. I was a proud supporter of the ADA then, and I am a \nstrong supporter of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 now. In the years \nsince the ADA became law, the courts have inappropriately limited its \nscope, and many Americans with disabilities have been denied the rights \nthe law was intended to give them. This legislation will serve to \nensure that those rights are protected and that people with \ndisabilities are fully protected. It is my hope that this legislation \nwill also help America become more accepting of diversity.\n  I would like to take a moment to applaud Senator Harkin for his \nleadership on the ADA. Without his leadership neither the ADA, nor this \nlegislation, would have been possible. I also would like to praise my \ngood friends Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch, whose commitment to the \nissue made the passage of this legislation possible.\n  For decades, we have fought for the civil rights of people with \ndisabilities, combating the antiquated mindsets of segregation, \ndiscrimination, and ignorance. Our Nation has come from a time when the \nexclusion of people with disabilities was the norm. We have come from a \ntime when doctors told parents that their children with disabilities \nwere better left isolated in institutions. We have come from a time \nwhen individuals with disabilities were not considered contributing \nmembers of society. Those times have thankfully changed. The passage of \nthe ADA in 1990 provided the first step toward that change our country \nso desperately needed.\n  Although we have come along way in the past 18 years, the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act has not afforded the full protections that this \nantidiscrimination statute originally intended to provide. The law has \nbeen repeatedly misinterpreted by the courts that have used an \nextremely narrow definition of disability. This definition is so narrow \nthat many defendants with clear disabilities cannot even get their case \nheard in a courtroom because they do not qualify as having a \ndisability. People with disabilities excluded from protections under \nthe ADA include those with amputations, muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, \ndiabetes, multiple sclerosis, cancer, and intellectual disabilities.\n  Ultimately, a series of Supreme Court rulings established precedents \nthat leave many of our fellow citizens with disabilities little or no \nprotections under current law. These decisions created a platform for \nfuture courts to say that a person does not have a disability when they \nbenefit from mitigating measures such as medications, therapies, or \nother corrective devices. Ironically, this means that people with \ndisabilities who use measures such as assistive technology to help them \nlead more self-sufficient lives are ultimately not protected from \ndiscrimination related to their disability. The Supreme Court decisions \nfurther narrowed the definition of disability by imposing a strict and \ndemanding standard to the definition of disability--barring Americans \ncoping with intellectual disabilities from the law's protections.\n  Equal protection under the law in the United States of America is not \na privilege, but rather, it is a fundamental right due every citizen of \nour Nation, regardless of race, gender, national origin, religion, sex, \nage, or disability. It is unacceptable to deny any individual his or \nher right to those protections because of a misconstrued definition of \ndisability. Our country has an obligation to its citizens to ensure \nthat their fundamental rights are protected, and, if those rights are \nviolated, that the option of recourse is available.\n  This antidiscrimination legislation would move us forward as one \nNation in the direction that was intended 18 years ago. If this bill is \nsigned into law, it will provide much needed clarification on the \ndefinition of disability, covering those individuals that rightly need \nprotections under this law. The bill rejects the findings of the \nSupreme Court cases and specifies that mitigating measures are not to \nbe considered in disability determining and clarifies that the \ndefinition should be more broadly interpreted.\n  Fortunately, we are a changing society, and we have come a long way \nsince those times of segregation and stigma. Recognizing that our \nsociety needs to take yet another step to improve the civil rights of \nour fellow citizens, I urge my colleagues to join with us and pass the \nADA Amendments Act of 2008.\n  I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in bettering our country \nby passing the ADA Amendments Act. As we are a just society, I will \ncontinue to fight for the rights of my fellow Americans with \ndisabilities so that we all have an equal chance to achieve the \nAmerican dream. I urge my fellow colleagues to support this essential \npiece of legislation on behalf of the American people.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/11/senate-section/article/S8356-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8356-S8361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX POLICY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, today I wish to continue my \ndiscussions about one of the big choices facing voters this fall. That \nchoice is which of our colleagues, Senator McCain or Senator Obama, \nshould we follow in terms of future tax policy. I speak as ranking \nmember and former chairman of the Committee on Finance that has \njurisdiction over tax policy.\n  In recent weeks--when I say in recent weeks, I mean in July because \nwe weren't in session in August--I have talked about the history of \nparty control and the likelihood of broad-based tax increases. I will \nuse the tax increase thermometer--and that thermometer is up here--to \npoint out history. I have discussed the specific precedent of the 1992 \ncampaign with its promise of middle-class tax cuts and\n\n[[Page S8357]]\n\nthe 1998 world record tax increase that hit taxpayers above $20,000. I \nhave referred to a case of tax hike amnesia, and I put up my famous Rip \nVan Winkle chart. I have discussed the impact of the McCain and the \nObama plans, and in July I also talked about how the McCain and Obama \nplans would affect seniors and middle-income families. Today, I wish to \nfocus on small business and the effect on small business of the tax \npolicies of the respective Presidential candidates.\n  There has been a lot of controversy over the years about the effect \nof marginal tax rate increases on small business. It first arose back \nin 1993. At that time, President Clinton and the congressional majority \nDemocrats pushed through legislation that retroactively raised the top \nmarginal income tax rates. The rate was 31 percent. Under the 1993 \nbill, two new higher rates went into effect: the 36-percent rate and \nthe 39.6-percent rate, and that is where it was until the 2001 tax \nbill.\n  One of the criticisms of those higher marginal tax rates passed back \nin 1993 was that these rates would harm small business. Did they harm \nsmall business? Well, I am here to say they did, but I have to back up \nwhat I am saying.\n  In the year 2001, Chairman Baucus--now the Democratic chairman of the \ncommittee I used to chair--Chairman Baucus and I crafted a bipartisan \npackage of marginal rate reductions. The first part of 2001, I was \nchairman of that committee, and Chairman Baucus was the ranking member. \nSo in 2001, we had this bipartisan package of marginal tax rate \nreductions. Part of that package brought the top rate from that 39.6 \nsetup in 1993 down to 35 where it is now.\n  Another part of the package lowered the 36-percent rate to 33 \npercent. Although the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, in its \ndistribution analysis, concluded that the legislation improved the \nprogressivity of the Tax Code, the top marginal rate reductions were \ncontroversial.\n  Many of the liberal Members of this body and in the punditry decried \nthe marginal rate reductions as a tax cut for the wealthy. Many of the \npress echoed those criticisms. They focused on the top rate reductions \nand defined the bipartisan, broad-based tax relief as ``the Bush tax \ncuts for the rich.'' These critics and Members who shared their view \nfailed to examine the data on the whole bill, and if they had, they \nwould have come to a different conclusion.\n  The fact that the Democratic Presidential candidate this year is \nembracing most of the policy from the bipartisan deal should give these \nliberal critics some pause. Senator Obama's campaign tax plan confirms \nwhat I said many times over the last 7 years. It confirms that the bill \nChairman Baucus and I crafted in 2001 was a bipartisan plan that would \nstand the test of time.\n  Since the top rates of 35 percent and 33 percent were the source of \nconsiderable opposition back then in 2001, there was a lot of debate \nabout their merits. Aside from the general economic benefits of the \nincreased incentives for work and investment, Chairman Baucus and I \nfocused on the benefits to small business. On Monday, August 20, 2001, \nChairman Baucus and I released a statement on the Treasury Department's \nanalysis of that 2001 tax bill, and I will quote from part of that \npress release that Senator Baucus and I put out:\n\n       Owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships, S \n     corporations, and farms will receive 80 percent of the tax \n     relief associated with reducing the top income tax rate of 36 \n     percent to 33 percent and 39.6 percent down to 35 percent. \n     Senators Baucus and Grassley said most of the job growth over \n     the last decade has come from small business. Experts agree \n     that lower taxes increase a business's cash flow which helps \n     with liquidity constraints during an economic slowdown and \n     could increase the demand for investment and labor.\n\n  That is the end of the quote of Senator Baucus's and my press release \ncommentary on the 2001 tax bill impact on small business.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent at this point to have \nprinted in the Record a copy of that August 20, 2001, Baucus-Grassley \npress release.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Aug. 20, 2001.\n\n  Baucus, Grassley, New Analysis Shows Tax Cuts Help Small Businesses\n\n       Washington.--Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate \n     Finance Committee, and Sen. Chuck Grassley, ranking member, \n     today said a new U.S. Treasury Department analysis shows that \n     farms, small businesses and entrepreneurs will receive most \n     of the tax relief from cutting the top marginal tax rates.\n       ``I'm pleased this analysis shows the tax cut we passed \n     will provide relief for farmers and ranchers and our \n     agriculture community, as well as small businesses and \n     entrepreneurs throughout our country,'' Baucus said. ``My \n     State is an agriculture and small business State, and it's \n     heartening to know that this tax cut will put money back in \n     the economy and help create more jobs.''\n       Grassley said, ``One of the goals of our bipartisan tax cut \n     was reducing the tax burden for small businesses. ``That's \n     important because small businesses create most of the jobs in \n     this country. The new analysis shows that we succeeded in our \n     desire to re-kindle the fire fueling the small business \n     engine.''\n       At the Senators' request, the Treasury Department's Office \n     of Tax Analysis calculated that when the new tax relief law \n     is fully phased in, entrepreneurs and small businesses--\n     owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships, S corporations, \n     and farms--will receive 80 percent of the tax relief \n     associated with reducing the top income tax rates of 36 \n     percent to 33 percent and 39.6 percent to 35 percent. Such \n     business owners make up 62 percent (about 500,000) of the \n     800,000 tax returns that will benefit from the new 33 percent \n     and 35 percent rates, according to the analysis.\n       Baucus and Grassley said most of the job growth over the \n     past decade has come from small businesses, noting that 80 \n     percent of the 11.1 million new jobs created between 1994 and \n     1998 were from businesses with fewer than 20 employees, and \n     80 percent of American businesses have fewer than 20 \n     employees. Experts agree that lower taxes increase a \n     business' cash flow, which helps with liquidity constraints \n     during an economic slowdown and could increase the demand for \n     investment and labor, the senators said.\n       An October 2000 report by the National Bureau of Economic \n     Research, a well-regarded non-partisan organization, entitled \n     ``Personal Income Taxes and the Growth of Small Firms,'' says \n     plainly that when a sole proprietor's marginal tax rate goes \n     up, the rate of growth of his or her business enterprise goes \n     down, the senators said.\n       The bipartisan tax cut bill responded to the fact that \n     individual income tax collections were near an all-time high, \n     even higher than some levels imposed during World War II. \n     Baucus and Grassley said individual rate cuts are important \n     relief for small businesses because most small business \n     owners and farmers operate their businesses as sole \n     proprietorships, partnerships, Limited Liability, \n     Corporations or S corporations. The income of these types of \n     entities is reported directly on the individual tax returns \n     of the owners. A rate reduction for individuals reduces rates \n     for farms and small businesses.\n       Baucus and Grassley were instrumental in passing the \n     bipartisan tax cut legislation.\n\n                TABLE T08-0164.--DISTRIBUTION OF TAX UNITS WITH BUSINESS INCOME BY STATUTORY MARGINAL TAX RATE ASSUMING EXTENSION AND INDEXATION OF THE 2007 AMT PATCH, 2009 \\1\\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           All tax units                Tax units with business income \\2\\         Percent of tax units with business income \\3\\     Business\n                                                 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    income as\n       Statutory marginal income tax rate             Number        Percent of        Number        Percent of                     Greater than    Greater than    Greater than   percent of AGI\n                                                    (thousands)        total        (thousands)        total      Greater than 0    10% of AGI      25% of AGI      50% of AGI          \\3\\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNon-filers......................................          20,758            13.8             999             2.9             4.8             3.7             3.3             3.0             7.5\n0%..............................................          23,434            15.6           6,960            20.0            29.7            28.6            26.0            22.8            62.7\n10%.............................................          22,375            14.9           4,740            13.6            21.2            16.2            12.6             8.9            12.1\n15%.............................................          49,522            33.0          11,024            31.7            22.3            12.5             7.8             4.5             6.9\n25%.............................................          25,506            17.0           6,662            19.2            26.1            12.0             7.1             4.2             6.7\n26% (AMT).......................................           2,434             1.6           1,160             3.3            47.6            21.0            12.9             7.8            11.4\n28% (Regular)...................................           3,137             2.1           1,175             3.4            37.4            20.6            15.4            10.4            13.0\n28% (AMT).......................................           2,164             1.4           1,353             3.9            62.5            38.2            29.6            20.5            21.5\n33%.............................................             335             0.2             206             0.6            61.7            46.3            38.0            29.9            31.6\n35%.............................................             577             0.4             457             1.3            79.2            57.6            50.3            40.7            38.8\nAll.............................................         150,241           100.0          34,736           100.0            23.1            15.2            11.4             8.4            14.7\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center Microsimulation Model (version 0308-5).\n\\1\\ Calendar year.

I wish also to thank my friend, Chairman Baucus, and \nthose on the other side for sticking with me on these marginal rate \nreductions over the years. With a strong impulse to raise marginal \nrates in the Democratic caucus, I know these votes were not easy. I \nknow that small business folks in the State of Montana and other \nMembers who supported it are also very grateful because it has really \nhelped small business, besides giving parity between proprietorships \nand corporations which have a 35-percent rate, and there is no reason \nto tax businesses that are sole proprietorships more than big fat \ncorporations.\n  Today, now, 7 years later, we find ourselves in the same debate. The \ndata and implication of it are still very important in debating the \nmerits of the stated top rates of 35 percent and 33 percent. Senator \nMcCain's position is that we should not raise those rates, especially \nin a time of the economy slowing down. Senator Obama insists that we \nraise those top rates. This is a sharp tax policy difference between \nthe two potential Presidents.\n  As ranking member on the tax-writing Finance Committee, it is my duty \nto clarify this important debate. Our constituents have a right to be \ninformed in an intellectually honest manner on this very important \nquestion. So, Madam President, let's take a look at this small business \nissue.\n  The first question we need to consider is what is small business. The \nsecond question would be what role do these small businesses play in \nour overall national economy. After that, we need to get a handle on \nwhich small businesses are affected by the higher rates that Senator \nObama has proposed. Finally, we need to get a sense of how the small \nbusinesses are affected on the short term and long term. I am going to \ndeal with each one of these questions right now.\n  So the first question: What is a small business? It is not a precise \nanswer. In one way, some on the other side have said small businesses \nthat matter are only those with owners who earn less than $200,000 to \n$250,000. To those folks at the local hardware store, if one of the \nowners or the sole owner owns over $250,000, no matter how many folks \nit employs, it is the same as a Home Depot or a Lowe's. Those of us \nfrom the heartland know the definition of small business is not limited \nto those whose owners make $250,000 or under. For us, it depends on \nwhether the business is locally based. It depends on whether the \nbusiness finances its growth from its own earnings. Conversely, to \nfolks from small towns such as myself, big business is generally the \ncompanies that finance themselves through the stock market.\n  The reason the distinction is important for public policy issues such \nas the level of taxation is that we value local or regionally based \nbusinesses. The folks who own those businesses are drawn from the \ncommunity. They attend the local Rotary clubs. They support the local \nlittle leagues.\n  Small business, as I see it, is a stabilizing yet very dynamic social \nforce and just not an economic being. So when we talk about small \nbusiness, we should not use any artificially low levels of income. We \nshould use a commonsense definition of small business. There is too \nmuch at stake to demagog the definition.\n  It seems a good place to go for a definition of small business would \nbe the Small Business Administration, the SBA. For most Federal \npolicies, as a rule of thumb, the SBA would tell you it would be a \nprivately held business with 500 or fewer employees. When we are \nconsidering tax policy--specifically the tax rate applicable to \nbusiness--we have two categories. The first one is regular \ncorporations. Virtually all big businesses--that is, publicly traded \ncompanies--are taxed under the regular corporate rate schedule.\n  There are several Tax Code rules dealing with small business. In \ngeneral, the Tax Code treats those businesses that go to the capital \nmarket differently from those businesses that are financed by their \nowners. There are special rules for depreciation and there are special \npension rules. Most important, however, are the rules that allow small \nbusiness to avoid the double taxation that applies to corporate \nearnings. Owners of certain kinds of small business corporations, known \nas S corporations, can elect to be taxed as proprietorships or \npartnerships. That is, these corporate shareholders include the \nbusiness income on their personal income tax returns. In general, an S \ncorporation can have no more than 100 shareholders. In the case of \nfamilies or pension plan owners, the number of shareholders can, in \nfact, be larger.\n  So with respect to the first question, I think we are on pretty solid \nground in identifying any small business as a privately held business \nwith 500 or fewer employees and, of course, the vast majority of them \nprobably only a handful of employees, and maybe all within the family. \nYou won't find much controversy, I believe, over that definition \nbecause it is one that we use here a lot on a lot of tax policy when it \ncomes to SBA-type legislation.\n  Let's go to the second question, which is what is the economic impact \nof small business. No one disputes the fact that small business creates \nmost of the jobs in America. According to the Small Business \nAdministration's Office of Advocacy, small businesses generated 60 to \n80 percent of the net new jobs annually over the last decade. I think \nthat is important to think of. Again, over the last decade, small \nbusiness has generated 60 percent to 80 percent of the new jobs.\n  Where are tomorrow's jobs going to come from? The answer is the \nlargest share of future jobs is going to come from small business \nemployers. I recommend that my colleagues consult the Small Business \nAdministration's Office of Advocacy's ``frequently asked questions,'' \nwhich is available on the Internet at www.sba.gov/advo.\n  We should not be surprised that small businesses create the lion's \nshare of the new jobs. A lot of American economic might, a lot of know-\nhow and dynamism, resides in small business. According to the latest \nTreasury data, flow-through small business accounts for 93 percent of \nall businesses, 36 percent of business receipts, 34 percent of the \nwages paid, and 50 percent of all business income. I have a chart here \nthat shows the growth of these flow-through small businesses since the \nyear 1980. You can see it. The solid line, the number of businesses--\nthe large dashes are total receipts and the small dashes are net income \nless deficit.\n  While I have focused on the flow-through, keep in mind that many of \nthe other small businesses would be affected by the top marginal rates. \nLet's focus on the small business data. We have another chart here. The \nnon-flow-through small businesses are what we call C corporations. \nThese entities are taxed like conventional corporations but are not big \npublicly traded businesses. So the owners are paid through salary and \ndividends. These small businesses account, as you can see, for about 10 \npercent of the total receipts.\n  In terms of business receipts, then, the combination of flow-through \nand regular corporations accounts for about 46 percent, or almost half, \nof the Nation's private sector income. These regular small business \nentities account for 13 percent of the wages paid, and when combined \nwith flow-throughs, the small business sector accounts for 47 percent \nof wages paid. That is almost half of the wages paid in the private \nsector jobs. In terms of net income, these regular small business \nentities account for 2 percent of the net business income. But when \ncombined with the flow-throughs, the small business sector accounts for \n52 percent of net business income. So that is over half of the net \nbusiness income in our Nation. In other words, small businesses are a \nvery vital, important, and productive part of our economy.\n  We may use the adjective ``small'' to describe this part of the \nbusiness sector of our Nation, but the economic impact of these \nbusinesses, then, as you follow this chart, is not small. Like the \nanswer to the definition of small business, I don't think many on the \nother side would quarrel with the notion that small business is a key \npart of our economy.\n  We have answered the first two questions, the definition of small \nbusiness\n\n[[Page S8359]]\n\nand its economic impact. Now, we need to ask that very vital third \nquestion that is being dealt with or being affected in this campaign \nfor the Presidency. How are small businesses taxed? How should they be \ntaxed? And what is the impact of that tax?\n  First off, small business owners pay the tax. The individual tax \nrate, at the owner's level, is the rate paid by small business. These \nbusinesses are described as flow-throughs because the business income \nand the tax burden flows through to the business owner. I have a chart \nhere that shows how the small business owner is taxed. It may look a \nlittle complicated, but it is not as complicated as it looks. It shows \nthe business entity. It could be a partnership or an S corporation or a \nproprietorship. The business gets its cash from four sources. The first \nis sales. The second is debt. As a practical matter, a business may be \nable to access credit only if its owners are willing to guarantee the \ndebt. The third source is the owner's investment. The fourth is \nretained aftertax profit. That aftertax profit is a very important part \nof the economic viability of small business. I emphasize ``aftertax.'' \nThese are sources of cash for the business.\n  The business uses its cash to pay workers. It uses this cash to pay \nother expenses, such as utilities, rent, and supplies. A business \neither makes a profit or a business suffers a loss. If it makes a \nprofit, the profit is taxed at the owner's level; it flows through to \nthe owner. At that point, the Federal Government takes or gets its \nshare. The aftertax profit then, of course, is available to the owners. \nThat aftertax profit, I will say once again, is a very important \nfactor. That is where tax policy in this Presidential debate is very \nimportant.\n  Currently, the top two Federal tax rates are, since 2001, 33 percent \nand 35 percent. Senator McCain wants to keep the rates right there. \nSenator Obama wants to raise statutory rates to 36 percent and 39.6 \npercent, where they were set between 1993, under President Clinton, \nuntil 2001. In addition, Senator Obama also wants to restore kind of a \nhidden marginal rate increase; that was referred to until recently in \npart of the Tax Code, known as PEP and Pease. With these additional \nadd-ons of a hidden marginal tax rate, their real marginal tax rates \nactually go up above 39.6, to 40 percent and 41 percent respectively.\n  Senator Obama has also proposed to raise the Social Security tax on \nthe same group of small business owners by 2 percent to 4 percent. \nRecently, however, Senator Obama modified his tax plan to defer the \nSocial Security tax increase. If we set aside this future Social \nSecurity tax increase, the taxes owed by small business owners would \nrise by as much as 21 percent and 17 percent respectively. I have a \nchart that shows the difference between the current top rates, which \nSenator McCain would keep, and the increase in the rates proposed by \nSenator Obama. So the blue line is Senator Obama, and the red line is \nSenator McCain.\n\n  For that same group of taxpayers, Senator Obama proposes, in \naddition, to tax dividend income at 20 percent instead of 15 percent. \nThat is a 33-percent increase.\n  So for these regular non-flow-through small business owners, the \namount of tax owed on their business income would rise at a range of \nsomewhere between 17 percent to 33 percent.\n  As with the answers to the questions of definition and economic \nimpact of small business, I don't think folks on the other side would \ndispute what I have said about how small businesses are taxed.\n  Now we come to the fourth question. That question is: What is the \nrelationship between the top marginal tax rates and small business \nactivity? Put another way, how much small business activity will be \naffected by the increased rates Senator Obama proposes? Unlike the \nfirst three questions, the answers to this question have been very \ncontroversial.\n  Over the years, folks who are hostile to marginal rate reduction have \npointed to one statistic. They have referred to the percentage of small \nbusiness tax filers who fall in the top two rates. For instance, they \ncite a statistic from the Tax Policy Center that concludes that only \n1.9 percent of the filers with business income pay the top two marginal \nrates.\n  According to the Tax Policy Center analysis, that percentage is \nroughly three times the percentage of tax filers in the general \npopulation. They will state that the proportion of small business \nowners in the top two brackets is roughly similar to that of the \ngeneral taxpaying population. The opponents of marginal rate relief \nwill use this data to conclude the small business owners' tax profile \nis similar to the nonbusiness taxpayer profile. Since the tax profile \nis similar, the general redistribution argument applies. The bottom \nline is that opponents will argue that raising marginal tax rates on \nsmall business owners makes the tax system more progressive.\n  For the opponents of marginal rate relief, that is where the \ndiscussion ends. It comes down to the view of tax fairness from their \nperspective. Although the statistics show small business owners are \nthree times more likely to be in the top two brackets, that matters not \none whit to the opponents. The rates must go up and the revenue must be \nspent on expanding Government. For an example of this perspective, I \nrecommend that my colleagues consult the article ``Big Misconceptions \nAbout Small Businesses and Taxes'' from the Center on Budget Policy and \nPriorities, dated August 29, 2008, available on the Internet at \nwww.cbpp.org.\n  The political point of the opponents boils down pretty simply. This \nsmall group of filers is very well off. So other than them, who cares \nif the rates go up? That is good politics. When you are talking about 1 \npercent or 2 percent of the population versus the rest, your theory is \nredistribution. You are going to be making an easier political case. \nThat is where they leave it.\n  There is a huge assumption that makes this argument so very dangerous \nand has economic impacts in the end. The assumption is that since the \nnumber of filers is limited to roughly 2 percent, the business activity \nis likewise limited.\n  The assumption is extremely dangerous economic policy. Why? I will \ngive two reasons. One, the 2 percent understates the number of small \nbusinesses affected. Second, the assumption assumes any negative effect \nof removing resources from small business. You don't have a lot of \nroom, as the chart shows, to play with small business. They don't go to \nWall Street and sell their stuff. They have to accumulate their own \ncapital.\n  Let's go to that first dangerous assumption that I just proposed of \nunderstating the number of small businesses affected by that 2-percent \nfigure. Distribution tables are like any other estimate. Inside this \nbeltway, distribution tables are a fetish. Many on the left side of the \npolitical spectrum worship at the altar of distribution statistics. \nThey treat it as the only measure--the only measure--of whether a tax \npolicy proposal is good tax policy or bad tax policy. Economic \nconsequences, what do they matter? But distribution tables are an \nanalytical tool meant to inform a tax policy debate. Distribution \ntables are a snapshot. Like any other snapshot, the analysis is \nlimited.\n  Let's take a look at the oft-cited Tax Policy Center distribution \ntables. The table references a total of roughly 35 million business tax \nunits. That is a proxy for tax returns and households. About 30 percent \nof that total, roughly 8 million tax units, represent folks who pay no \nincome tax for that year. The footnote to the table states that all \nbusiness income is defined as the sum of ``gains or losses reported on \nSchedules C, E, and F.'' Those are where the flow-through income is \nreported on the owner's tax return.\n  When you look at small business gains and losses, it is quite \nrevealing. Small businesses are at the cutting edge of our capital \nsystem. With capitalism comes the viability of the business cycle. \nSmall businesses are more susceptible to the good and bad years that \ncome with business cycles. One year a small business may do very well; \nthe next year might be a year of loss.\n  As evidence of this volatility, I would like to refer to the SBA data \non small business survival rates. You will find this on the frequently \nasked questions document I referred to, and you have a citation. \nAccording to SBA, two-thirds of small businesses survive at least 2 \nyears; 44 percent of small businesses survive at least 4 years. What \nthis means is that over time many small businesses rise and some fall.\n\n[[Page S8360]]\n\n  By the way, mobility within income tax brackets is something that \noccurs to a great degree in the United States because of the dynamics \nof our society and our economy. So think about it. How many people in \ntheir midtwenties stay in the same bracket all the way through \nretirement? The mobility of income of small business is a subset of the \noverall income mobility in the U.S. population.\n  Treasury data clarifies the TPC snapshot, the Tax Policy Center \nsnapshot. I have another chart. This chart shows that when gain and \nloss is considered, the snapshot changes very dramatically. So pay \nattention to this chart as I go through it.\n  For all flow-through taxpayers, 8 percent fall in the top two \nbrackets. For taxpayers with active, positive flow-through income, the \npercentage is roughly the same, about 7 percent. For taxpayers with \nflow-through income that is greater than half their wage income, the \npercentage is the highest, at 9 percent.\n  So keep in mind we are dealing with a moving target when we talk \nabout the 2-percent figure. Some businesses will produce losses for \ntheir owners one year and income in another year. So the business \nowners caught in the snapshot may not be the same business owners in \nanother snapshot.\n  The second assumption about the 2-percent filer argument is even more \ndangerous. That assumption is, since a small percentage of tax filers \nare affected, the impact on small business activity is somehow trivial.\n  How will the higher marginal rates remove resources from small \nbusiness you might ask? It is a simple answer. Let's go back to the \nchart that shows how small business works. If the amount paid in taxes \nincreases somewhere, as I have said, between 17 percent to 33 percent, \nthe tax take of the business rises as well. It comes out here. Let's go \nthrough an example.\n  I am going to use another chart. This taxpayer filer jointly owns a \nsmall business and earns $500,000 of business income. For purposes of \nthis example, we will assume all of that taxpayer's income comes from \nthe small business. As an aside, this assumption favors the opponents \nof marginal rate relief. Why? Because most small business owners have \nincome from other members of the household and income from other \nsources. In that more likely scenario, the marginal rate hikes would \nbite even harder because more business income is pushed into the higher \nbrackets.\n  Under this example, the small business owner pays $146,700 under \ncurrent law. Senator McCain's plan leaves this level of taxation in \neffect. Under Senator Obama's proposal, the small business owner's \ntaxes would go up by $20,000. That is a tax increase on this small \nbusiness owner of roughly 13 percent.\n  The tax increase would present the small business owner with a \n$20,000 current problem. The small business owner's current problem is \nhow does he or she alter his or her business to make up the $20,000 he \nor she has lost to Senator Obama's higher tax rates? Can he or she grow \nenough sales to pay the extra tax? Maybe, but maybe not. Can he or she \nreplace a $20,000 machine? Maybe maybe not. Can he or she cut back on \nthe payroll? Maybe but maybe not.\n  How about the future? Any good business person has to project how \ntheir business is working. Any investment's value is predicated on how \nmuch income the investment is likely to produce in the future. If \nincome is projected to go down, then the value of the investment \ndeclines.\n  Higher taxes negatively affect the net income from an investment. \nSmall business owners have choice about where to put their capital. If \ntaxes press down on the projected net income, then the value of the \nsmall business investment declines. Everything else being equal, a \nsmall business owner is less likely to leave the after-tax profit in \nthe business. Likewise, the small business owner is less likely to make \nfuture investment in the business.\n  My point is, the tax increase Senator Obama is proposing has a very \nreal cost to small business owners. And my entire remarks have been \ndirected toward the tax policies on small business because they are the \nengine of employment and economic growth.\n  What are the businesses Senator Obama is proposing to hit with this \ntax increase; that is, which businesses are owned by taxpayers making \nover $250,000? How many employees do they have?\n  I have another chart. It is based on data from the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses, and we refer to that as the NFIB. \nIt is a national small business organization. The NFIB has 350,000 \ndues-paying members. They take surveys of their members and other small \nbusiness folks. I have the latest survey that deals with the finance \nquestions from the year 2007. This chart contains the results of \nquestion No. 12. The question identifies, as we can see from the chart, \ngroups of small business owners by household income with the size of \ntheir firm by the number of employees. Household income includes income \nfrom other adult members of the household. If you take a look at the \nresponses, you can compare firm size with income level of the owners.\n  Here we have $250,000 and above. Those are the folks who are targeted \nfor the tax increase, and that would raise the amount owed to the \nGovernment between 17 percent under one scenario and 33 percent under \nanother. The survey indicates that 6.4 percent of the business owners \nof firms with one to nine employees--so small business--one to nine \nemployees would be hit by Senator Obama's tax increase.\n  Now move a step over and you are going to find that about 21 percent \nof the owners of firms with 10 to 19 employees would be hit by the tax \nincrease. That is the 20.6-percent figure you see. Move one step to the \nright and we find 40 percent of the owners of firms with 20 to 249 \nemployees would be hit by the tax increase; 20 to 249 employees, 40 \npercent hit. Forty percent of the owners of the small business firms \nthen would have increases of 17 percent to 33 percent.\n  There seems to be armies of hard-working tax analysts in this town \nwho work for think tanks of the liberal variety. If you look at the \nanalyses of the tax data, the armies of the left clearly are far more \nnumerous than the armies of the right and the middle. And I give them \ncredit for their hard work and dedication. I am sure they are poring \nover all this data.\n  Since the redistribution dogma is what floats their boats, they will \nprobably take a hostile attitude toward the data I have just cited. \nAnticipating the attacks of green-eye-shaded armies of the left, I \nthink we can trust the survey statistics.\n  NFIB has been conducting these surveys for years. I cannot think of \nany reason why respondents to the NFIB survey would inflate or deflate \ntheir income statistics. So I think this 40-percent snapshot is a very \nsolid figure.\n  The data above relates to taxpayers of $250,000 and above. Since \nSenator Obama's advisers have said his current proposal would raise \ntaxes on single taxpayers above $200,000 on a rough basis, it is fair \nto look at those small business owners as well. If you do that \ncalculation, then on a combined basis, Senator Obama's proposed tax \nincrease would hit even more small business owners.\n  So let's go back to NFIB question No. 12. For small businesses that \nemploy one to nine workers, 12 percent would be hit by Senator Obama's \nhigher taxes. For small businesses with 10 to 19 workers about 27 \npercent would be hit by the higher taxes. For small business owners \nwith 20 to 249 workers, 50 percent--half of the small businesses--would \nbe hit by Senator Obama's tax plan.\n  I want to get to the scariest part. As the chart shows, the \npercentage of small business owners hit by Senator Obama's higher taxes \ngoes up as the number of employees goes up. So it is fair to say these \nfigures probably understate the impact of the higher marginal tax rates \non the remaining small businesses, meaning those between 250 and 500 \nemployees. Moreover, like the distribution tables, the survey obviously \nis a snapshot. With small businesses alternately running gains and \nlosses over time, then the higher rates will hit a larger number of \nsmall business owners.\n  With the conservative nature of this data in mind, let's take another \nlook at the economic profile of the small business owner Senator Obama \nhas targeted for a tax increase. Every year, the SBA prepares a report \nto the President on small business economy.\n\n[[Page S8361]]\n\n  The last report we have was submitted to President Bush in December \nof last year. It covers data for the previous year--2006. For 2006, the \nentire private sector workforce growth occurred in small businesses \nwith 500 or fewer employees. For 2006, over half of America's private \nsector employees worked in these firms--over half. For 2006, these \nsmall businesses accounted for over half of the Nation's private sector \ngross domestic product.\n  Drill down deeper into the data, and you will be worried even more. \nTwo-thirds of that small business payroll came from firms that employ \nbetween 20 and 500 workers. If we go back to the NFIB question, we will \nfind that the owners of these small businesses are the ones most \ntargeted by Senator Obama's tax increase proposal.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I don't want you to take my word for it. \nListen to what small business folks have said about the importance of \nlower marginal tax rates. Take a look at the chart I am now putting up. \nThe chart is a copy of a letter dated March 14, 2003, from three \nprincipal small business grassroots organizations: the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses, the Small Business Legislative \nCouncil, and the Small Business Survival Committee. I would like to \nread the second paragraph of that letter. It may be too small for you \nto see on the screen, but it sums up the reality of the effects of the \nmarginal tax rates on small business.\n\n       Approximately 85 percent of small businesses file their tax \n     returns as individuals. An increase in tax refunds means \n     small firms will have more resources and more capital to put \n     back into growing their businesses. A series of studies by \n     four top economists examined the effect of the tax rate cuts \n     on sole proprietors. Their results indicate that a 5 percent \n     point cut in rates would increase capital investment by 10 \n     percent. And they found that dropping the top tax rate from \n     39.6 to 33.2 percent would increase hiring by 12.1 percent.\n\n  That kind of tells you what a business force small business can be \nand how tax increases are negative or tax decreases are positive for \nsmall businesses to hire and to grow. What these small business groups \nsaid was that their tax policy priorities included a reduction in top \nmarginal rates. You see it there in the letter from small business \nadvocates.\n  Now, let's think about this. As the small business folks say in their \nletter, there is a link between tax relief, economic growth, and jobs. \nWe have seen the evidence of that linkage in the year past. Tax relief \nkicked in, the economy started growing, and jobs started coming back. \nWhy would we want to go in reverse gear?\n  Senator McCain and Senator Obama agree on the policy objectives of \ngrowing jobs. Why would you aim a 17-percent or 33-percent marginal tax \nrate increase at the businesses that grew all the jobs in the most \nrecently studied year? Senator McCain's plan recognizes this job-loss \nrisk. Senator Obama's plan goes in the opposite direction.\n  Let me conclude with a challenge to the proponents of raising \nmarginal rates on small business. When I say critics, I am referring to \npolitical leaders, pundits, and even some in the media. I think the \ndata I presented speaks for itself. If you disagree with the analysis \nbut hold the position that higher marginal tax rates won't affect small \nbusinesses, would you agree to exclude small businesses from the 17- to \n33-percent marginal rate increases that are being offered? I await your \nanswer.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum cal1 be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/11/senate-section/article/S8361-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8361-S8364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009--Continued\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think Senator Warner is just about to \nenter the Chamber. I would ask the indulgence of my friend from Vermont \nfor one more moment.\n  Even though there is not too much evidence, the fact is, we have made \nsome significant progress today in some significant areas on the \nDefense authorization bill. Now that Senator Warner is here, I always \nwelcome his good wisdom. This is where we are now, as I was saying. We \nmade some significant progress on the bill, even though it has not been \nthat obvious and apparent.\n  Today we have been able to make some important progress. We will be \nhere tomorrow. Senator Warner and I will be here tomorrow. We urge \nSenators to come over to see if we can debate their amendments, to \ndiscuss their amendments. We are going to work with them to get these \namendments offered tomorrow so they would be in line when voting time \ncomes.\n  We will be here, that is true, even though there are no votes \ntomorrow, we understand. We will be here tomorrow. The Senate is in \nsession. Senator Warner and I will be here. It is very important that \nSenators who have amendments they intend to offer come here, work with \nus to try to get them in line for a vote, to see if we can get them \noffered tomorrow. That will take unanimous consent, but we will make an \neffort.\n  But we need Senators to come Monday afternoon. We will be here Monday \nafternoon. We will be here Tuesday. There are no votes Monday, but we \nwill be here for the purpose of debating and discussing amendments, \ntrying to again have them offered.\n  So it is also, I am authorized to say, that there will be no further \nvotes today. Cloture will be filed tomorrow. I thank Senators who are \nworking with us. We have lots of amendments we can clear if we can get \nunanimous consent to clear a managers' package. The managers' package, \nwe are ready to go with that at any time. We are going to continue to \nadd amendments to that package. We will be working with Senators during \nthese next few days so we can, hopefully, get this bill passed and \nvoted on on Tuesday.\n  That is the situation we are currently in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the chairman has quite accurately stated \nthe work that has been done thus far, our willingness as the two \nmanagers to continue working with Senators. We will both be present \ntomorrow as well as Monday. It is hoped that other Senators can be in a \nposition to come forward with their amendments.\n  I might inquire, can the Presiding Officer advise us on the number of \namendments on file? An approximation is satisfactory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are over 220 amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  That presents clear evidence to colleagues of the magnitude of the \ntask before us. I guess we have said this many times, but this would be \nthe 43rd consecutive authorization bill for the men and women of the \nArmed Forces passed by the Senate. It is my hope that we can add No. \n43.\n  I commend the chairman for his efforts. I have worked with him \nthrough this day. I believe we have had some helpful discussions with \nstaff and colleagues on the means by which to make progress. We are \nhere. It is imperative that this bill pass.\n  I remind colleagues of the military construction section of our bill \nwhich is so vital for the current and future needs of the U.S. \nmilitary. This bill is the sole bill that can carry that important \npiece of annual legislation through and get it into a conference.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Of course.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I appreciate having the opportunity to discuss our \namendments. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside and that I be permitted to call up amendment No. 5405.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will object. We are more than willing to \ndiscuss this amendment tomorrow. We realize this is one of the \namendments that will have to be addressed if we are going to get to \nthis bill. So it is not as though we are expecting to complete action \non this bill without addressing the amendment of the Senator. However, \nthis is not something I can agree to at this time but would be happy to \ntomorrow or Monday.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the chairman yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S8362]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would it not be to the benefit of the two of us as \nmanagers, as we have had a great deal of discussion together today on \nit, to hear from our colleague so we have clearly in mind his goals?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The reason I am reluctant to agree to that is because the \nSenator from Vermont was dissuaded from addressing the Senate until we \nhad a few minutes to talk about plans for the future. I held up the \nSenator from Vermont for, now, 10 minutes when he was here and had a \nright to debate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is there any way we could accommodate both Senators?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I don't think I am able to tonight. But \nfor clarification, this amendment is two words and a number: Strike \nsection 1002. I hope we haven't come to the point in the Senate when a \nSenator would not be allowed one amendment on such an important bill \nthat is to strike a section. I can talk more about it later. I know we \nare being encouraged to bring up our amendments. This amendment has \nbeen filed for a few days. I think at least the staff is well aware of \nwhat it is. I will certainly not hold up the other Senator. I \nappreciate the chairman's commitment to giving me an opportunity for a \nvote on this amendment before it is all over.\n  I yield the floor and thank the ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from South Carolina \nwill be here tomorrow or on Monday? We may be able to discuss his \namendment. It may be three words, but they are mighty important words \nand have a huge impact, way beyond any description of a three-word \namendment. Nonetheless, in order to let the Senator from Vermont \nproceed, I am wondering whether it would be possible for the Senator to \nbe here tomorrow or Monday so we could discuss his amendment? I would \nbe happy to discuss it.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I will not be here tomorrow. Since we had understood that \nMonday was a no-vote day, I made other plans. But I can assure my \ncolleague I can deputize my staff to work out any agreement that would \nbe workable for the chairman and Senator Warner. It is not our intent \nto hold up this bill. There is a managers' package that we will not \nagree to until we have a commitment for this one vote. I want to \nexpedite this, as Senator Warner does, and the chairman. But if the \nSenator would like to work with us, I am sure we can work this out \ntomorrow or Monday without my being present.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator has the floor, so if I could ask him to yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. This is of such vital importance to the bill. While it is \njust a few words, it does have very significant ramifications. It deals \nwith the relationship of the legislative body; that is, the Congress, \nthe executive branch, and the fulfillment of our constitutional \nresponsibilities versus the ability of the executive branch to exercise \ncertain powers.\n  In the Armed Services Committee, this matter was brought up. I put \nforward an amendment in committee not unlike what the Senator from \nSouth Carolina has pending before the Senate. It was not accepted. It \nwas a 12-to-12 vote; therefore, a tie. It did not carry.\n  I understand the goals the Senator is seeking. But I point out, if we \ncould have a few minutes so colleagues have some idea of the \nsignificance of this and they can reflect on it. If the Senator is not \ngoing to be here tomorrow--he has heavy commitments, as do others--nor \nMonday, it would be only Tuesday morning before we could really begin \nto get other Members of the Senate more fully acquainted with the \ncomplexity of this issue.\n  Mr. DeMINT. If I may offer one clarification, this is not the same \namendment that was offered in committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand that.\n  Mr. DeMINT. What my amendment does is restore basically the format of \nthe Defense authorization bill to the same format it has always had. \nThe way it is set up now, the language that references the report \nlanguage and makes it, in effect, law is an unprecedented way to deal \nwith report language. What we would do with this amendment is make it \nlike every other Defense authorization bill that has ever been passed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is correct. But in the intervening \nperiod, there has been the issue of Executive order. Therefore, we \ncannot, as a legislative body, be unmindful of what the executive \nbranch has enunciated through Executive order. That Executive order \nwill carry forward after this administration concludes and be a part \nof the next administration. That clearly states that the President is \nnot going to observe the means by which the Congress, specifically the \nArmed Services Committee in the many years' pattern of doing much of \nits work, both in the report language as well as bill language.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. If the intent is to get around the Executive order, then \nobviously that is a matter for debate. It also gets around the many \nstatements made on this floor about the transparency of earmarks and to \ndisclose what we are doing.\n  Again, this is a very simple amendment. All I am asking for is an up-\nor-down vote. I am not asking for passage.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me just quickly say again, if the \nSenator from Virginia is also willing, could we let the Senator from \nVermont proceed? We could come back. I am happy to debate this \namendment tonight, if is the only time we can debate it. It has \nramifications way beyond what the Senator from South Carolina says. We \nmade a commitment to the Senator from Vermont that he would be \nrecognized next to speak. I was waiting for Senator Warner to come \nover. The Senator from Vermont was generous enough to hold off. I \nthought this would only be a few minutes laying out the path ahead. It \nis much more than that. I could come back and will be here tonight, if \nthe Senator from South Carolina will stay here. I would be happy to \ngive the position which is so terrifically different, very different.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the chairman. We will not abuse the time. I have \nthe floor, and I would like to yield for one question to Mr. Coburn. \nThen I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me say how much I appreciate the hard work done on \nthis bill. It is a hard bill. It is important. My question would be to \nboth the chairman and ranking member: How are we to be afforded an \nopportunity to amend earmarks if none of them are in the bill, yet they \ncarry the force of law as if being in the bill?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That can be done by amendment, like any other amendment. \nBut what this amendment does is to say that not just the earmark, the \nentire budget, including the President's budget, which is currently in \nthat committee report, which is incorporated by reference, that that no \nlonger carries the force of law. So the DeMint amendment goes exactly \nin the opposite direction of what Senator McCain and others were trying \nto do, which was to incorporate into law all of the earmarks and the \nPresident's budget. We want them in law. We want them to be in law. We \ngot a letter, however, from Senate legal counsel saying it cannot be \ndone technologically.\n  I am not able to argue with him. I would be perfectly happy, and I \nhope they can be made part of law. But the DeMint amendment goes in the \nopposite direction. Instead of making them part of law, it wipes out \ntheir legal status by saying they will only be part of a committee \nreport which is not incorporated by reference, and, because of the \nExecutive order, the agencies of the Government are directed to ignore \nthe committee report. Previously, the executive departments would \ncomply with committee reports. That is no longer true under the \nExecutive order.\n  So what this amounts to, the DeMint amendment, is an abdication of \nthe power of the purse totally, not just over earmarks but over the \nPresident's own budget which has been adopted by the Congress. This is \nthe opposite of what Senator McCain and others have urged, which is \nthat earmarks and other appropriations be incorporated into law. This \ngoes the other direction and says they have no force of law whatsoever.\n  We have to debate the DeMint amendment. I am more than willing to \ndebate the DeMint amendment. I would come back tonight to do it. But I \ndon't think, in fairness to the Senator from\n\n[[Page S8363]]\n\nVermont, that we should not allow him to proceed for his 10 or 15 \nminutes, whatever he wanted. I would be happy to come back.\n  Mr. COBURN. If I might through the Chair ask another question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is held by the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. COBURN. And he yielded to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Coburn is now recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I say to Senator Sanders, I will finish this very \nquickly.\n  My concern is, I have talked to the McCain folks. They are very \nunhappy with this provision. The reason they are unhappy is there is no \nway the Parliamentarian will allow me to amend report language on the \nfloor because it is not part of the bill we are discussing. I would be \nhappy to work in the background with both the chairman and ranking \nmember to move all of this to the bill so it is not a question.\n  That is what I would ask that you, please, try to accommodate us on \nbecause having the debate and amending things--and I will raise that \nout of the $5.9 billion worth of earmarks in this bill, the vast \nmajority are noncompetitive bid. In other words, there is no \ncompetition for value for the American taxpayers' dollar. They are \ndirect mandates that certain money will be spent with certain companies \nwith no estimation, no competitive bidding.\n  So I will not delay this any longer. I would ask that the chairman \nand ranking member--I think the Senators have done a great job on the \nbill. I do not think it is significantly different in terms of earmarks \nthan what it has been in the past. But if, in fact, we could figure out \na way to make them where we could have them at least discussed and have \nan opportunity to amend them, I would appreciate that deference.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Can the Senator visit with the two of us off the floor \nsuch that our colleague can proceed?\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nPresidential document to which I referred, dated February 1, 2008, be \nprinted in the Record as a part of the colloquy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Federal Register, Feb. 1, 2008]\n\n                         Presidential Documents\n\n\n                         Title 3--The President\n\n    Executive Order 13457 of January 29, 2008: Protecting American \n        Taxpayers From Government Spending on Wasteful Earmarks\n\n       By the authority vested in me as President by the \n     Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it \n     is hereby ordered as follows:\n       Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the Federal \n     Government to be judicious in the expenditure of taxpayer \n     dollars. To ensure the proper use of taxpayer funds that are \n     appropriated for Government programs and purposes, it is \n     necessary that the number and cost of earmarks be reduced, \n     that their origin and purposes be transparent, and that they \n     be included in the text of the bills voted upon by the \n     Congress and presented to the President. For appropriations \n     laws and other legislation enacted after the date of this \n     order, executive agencies should not commit, obligate, or \n     expend funds on the basis of earmarks included in any non-\n     statutory source, including requests in reports of committees \n     of the Congress or other congressional documents, or \n     communications from or on behalf of Members of Congress, or \n     any other non-statutory source, except when required by law \n     or when an agency has itself determined a project, program, \n     activity, grant, or other transaction to have merit under \n     statutory criteria or other merit-based decisionmaking.\n       Sec. 2. Duties of Agency Heads. (a) With respect to all \n     appropriations laws and other legislation enacted after the \n     date of this order, the head of each agency shall take all \n     necessary steps to ensure that:\n       (i) agency decisions to commit, obligate, or expend funds \n     for any earmark are based on the text of laws, and in \n     particular, are not based on language in any report of a \n     committee of Congress, joint explanatory statement of a \n     committee of conference of the Congress, statement of \n     managers concerning a bill in the Congress, or any other non-\n     statutory statement or indication of views of the Congress, \n     or a House, committee, Member, officer, or staff thereof;\n       (ii) agency decisions to commit, obligate, or expend funds \n     for any earmark are based on authorized, transparent, \n     statutory criteria and merit-based decision making, in the \n     manner set forth in section II of OMB Memorandum M-07-10, \n     dated February 15, 2007, to the extent consistent with \n     applicable law; and\n       (iii) no oral or written communications concerning earmarks \n     shall supersede statutory criteria, competitive awards, or \n     merit-based decisionmaking.\n       (b) An agency shall not consider the views of a House, \n     committee, Member, officer, or staff of the Congress with \n     respect to commitments, obligations, or expenditures to carry \n     out any earmark unless such views are in writing, to \n     facilitate consideration in accordance with section 2(a)(ii) \n     above. All written communications from the Congress, or a \n     House, committee, Member, officer, or staff thereof, \n     recommending that funds be committed, obligated, or expended \n     on any earmark shall be made publicly available on the \n     Internet by the receiving agency, not later than 30 days \n     after receipt of such communication, unless otherwise \n     specifically directed by the head of the agency, without \n     delegation, after consultation with the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget, to preserve appropriate \n     confidentiality between the executive and legislative \n     branches.\n       (c) Heads of agencies shall otherwise implement within \n     their respective agencies the policy set forth in section 1 \n     of this order, consistent with such instructions as the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget may \n     prescribe.\n       (d) The head of each agency shall upon request provide to \n     the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \n     information about earmarks and compliance with this order.\n       Sec. 3. Definitions. For purposes of this order:\n       (a) The term ``agency'' means an executive agency as \n     defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, and \n     the United States Postal Service and the Postal Regulatory \n     Commission, but shall exclude the Government Accountability \n     Office; and\n       (b) the term ``earmark'' means funds provided by the \n     Congress for projects, programs, or grants where the \n     purported congressional direction (whether in statutory text, \n     report language, or other communication) circumvents \n     otherwise applicable merit-based or competitive allocation \n     processes, or specifies the location or recipient, or \n     otherwise curtails the ability of the executive branch to \n     manage its statutory and constitutional responsibilities \n     pertaining to the funds allocation process.\n       Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall \n     be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n       (i) authority granted by law to an agency or the head \n     thereof; or\n       (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management \n     and Budget relating to budget, administrative, or legislative \n     proposals.\n       (b) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent \n     with applicable law and subject to the availability of \n     appropriations.\n       (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any \n     right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at \n     law or in equity, by any party against the United States, its \n     agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers, \n     employees, or agents, or any other person.\n                                                 George W. Bush.  \n                                The White House, January 29, 2008.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator \nfrom Vermont, and I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that also as a part \nof this colloquy be printed in the Record the letter from the U.S. \nSenate Office of the Legislative Counsel explaining why it is \ntechnologically impossible for him to incorporate at this time, with \ncurrent software, all the items into the law. That is the problem; \notherwise, I would be totally agreeable to having every single one of \nthese items--the President's items and the add-ons by Congress--made \npart of the law. That is not a problem for me. However, technologically \nit cannot be done at this time. We ought to try to make sure it can be \ndone promptly. I ask unanimous consent that the June 4, 2008, letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                            Office of the Legislative Counsel,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 2008.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I am writing in response to your letter \n     of May 22, 2008, inquiring as to whether the Office of the \n     Legislative Counsel has the ability to incorporate the \n     funding tables currently included in the committee report of \n     the defense authorization bill directly into the text of the \n     bill. In short, the Office at this time has neither the \n     technical capability nor the resources to convert the funding \n     tables into the necessary electronic format for direct \n     inclusion in the text of the defense authorization bill.\n       The Office of the Legislative Counsel uses highly \n     specialized and customized software to prepare legislation. \n     This software was developed by the staff of the Secretary of \n     the Senate, in cooperation with the staff of this\n\n[[Page S8364]]\n\n     Office and the Government Printing Office. The use of this \n     software serves 2 major purposes: First, it allows the Senate \n     Enrolling Clerk and the Government Printing Office to print \n     legislation directly from our electronic files, eliminating \n     the need to retype and proofread each file; and secondly, it \n     allows the Secretary of the Senate, the Library of Congress, \n     and the Government Printing Office to post legislation on the \n     Internet in an easily searchable format.\n       The current version of the software contains a table tool \n     that allows us to include tables in legislation if the tables \n     fit into one of the templates provided in the table tool. I \n     met this past week with the staffs of the Secretary of the \n     Senate and the Government Printing Office and they have \n     concluded that the table tool does not have templates that \n     can be used to prepare all of the funding tables contained in \n     the committee report. In fact, the Government Printing Office \n     currently scans the funding tables as camera copy in order to \n     print the committee report and does not convert the tables \n     into the electronic format that would be necessary to include \n     the tables in legislation. As a result, this Office is unable \n     to prepare or print legislation which includes those tables.\n       In addition, even if templates are developed for the table \n     tool, we will not be able to prepare the tables for inclusion \n     in legislation unless the data in the tables can be \n     electronically imported directly into the legislation we \n     prepare. The committee report for the next fiscal year \n     contains at least 180 pages of tables. Since the Office is \n     currently unable to directly import the data in the tables, \n     it would require our staff to spend hundreds of hours to \n     input the data from these tables, proofread the tables for \n     accuracy, and then make any necessary edits. We do not have \n     sufficient staff to do this while continuing to meet our \n     other responsibilities.\n       In my opinion, this is really more of an information \n     technology issue than a legislative drafting issue. If the \n     Senate decides to require the text of the funding tables to \n     be included in legislation, the Government Printing Office \n     would need to develop the necessary templates for the table \n     tool and the Committee staff or others preparing the tables \n     would have to conform to uniform standards for electronic \n     formatting of the tables to ensure that the data could be \n     imported directly into legislation,\n       Please let me know if I can provide you with any additional \n     information or if you have any further questions regarding \n     this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 James W. Fransen,\n                                              Legislative Counsel.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Now, Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Vermont the \nfollowing question: whether the Senator would be willing to proceed in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, a little while ago Senator Grassley of \nIowa was down on the floor critiquing Senator Obama's tax plan in some \ndetail. Right now, I am not prepared to refute what Senator Grassley \nsaid, although I strongly disagree with his conclusions. But I did wish \nto talk a little bit about some of the differences I perceive between \nSenator McCain and the proposals he is bringing forth in terms of what \nSenator Obama has been talking about.\n  I, also, most importantly, wish to make the point--and I think \nSenator McCain would be upfront in admitting--that if he is elected \nPresident, what we are going to be seeing is 4 more years of the \npolicies we have seen in this country for the last 8 years, which have \nbeen a disaster for the middle class and working families of this \ncountry. I wish to spend a few moments on that.\n  Since President Bush has been in office, nearly 6 million middle-\nclass Americans have slipped out of the middle class and are now in \npoverty. I can tell you that all over this country--in my State of \nVermont but all over this country--people who used to believe they were \nsecurely in the middle class, people who looked to the future with \noptimism, are now lining up in front of emergency food shelves because \nthe wages they are earning are simply not enough to sustain their \nfamilies. We are seeing a run on emergency food shelves all over \nAmerica from working families.\n  I can tell you that in Vermont and throughout the northern tier of \nthis country, people are frightened to death about the coming winter \nbecause in many instances they simply do not have the money to pay the \nfuel bills which will keep their homes warm this winter.\n  Since George W. Bush has been in office, median household income has \ndeclined by over $2,100 for working-age Americans. That is a huge drop.\n  Since President Bush has been in office, over 4 million Americans \nhave lost their pensions. People who have worked their entire lives at \na company with the expectation that when they retired there would be a \ndefined pension plan available to them--that has not happened in 4 \nmillion instances.\n  Since George W. Bush has been President, 7 million Americans have \nlost their health insurance and the cost of health care has soared and \nmore and more people are underinsured.\n  Since President Bush has been in office, more than 3 million \nmanufacturing jobs have been lost, as corporate America has thrown \npeople out on the street, moved to China, moved to Vietnam, moved to \nany country where they can pay people a few pennies an hour.\n  Since George W. Bush has been in office, nearly half a million jobs \nhave been lost over the last 6 months alone, and the unemployment rate \ntoday is over 6 percent.\n  I ask you: Do we need to continue these economic policies which have \nbeen such a disaster for the middle class and working families in our \ncountry? Do we need 4 more years of these disastrous economic policies?\n  Since George W. Bush has been President, total consumer debt has more \nthan doubled. Everybody knows that. Everybody we know almost is in \ndebt. We have a personal savings rate in this country today which is \nzero.\n  Since President Bush has been in office, home foreclosures are the \nhighest on record. There are huge numbers of foreclosures all over this \ncountry. In 2007, the typical American family paid over $1,700 more on \ntheir mortgage payments.\n  Is that a record, is that a series of policies that this country \nwants to continue for another 4 years? I think not--not for ordinary \npeople. If you are a millionaire or a billionaire, I could understand \nthat but certainly not for the average American family.\n  Since George W. Bush has been President, Americans are now paying \n$2,100 more for gasoline, $200 more for food, $1,500 more on childcare \nexpenses, $1,000 more for a college education, $350 more for health \ninsurance, $600 more for afterschool costs, and so forth.\n  The bottom line is, the Bush economic policies have been a disaster \nfor the middle class and for working families and the only people who \nhave benefited from these policies are the people on the top. I do not \nbelieve we need a President in Mr. McCain who is going to emulate these \neconomic policies to the detriment of tens of millions of working \nfamilies.\n  When Bill Clinton was in office--and I have to tell you, as an \nIndependent, I had strong disagreements with President Clinton on a \nnumber of issues, including his trade policies, but when President \nClinton was in office, 22.7 million new jobs were created over that 8-\nyear period. That is a strong record of job creation. Since President \nBush has been in office, we have created fewer than 6 million new jobs. \nMr. President, 22.7 million, fewer than 6 million, that is a real \ndifference.\n  Under President Clinton, 6 million Americans were lifted out of \npoverty. That is pretty good. Under President George W. Bush, over the \nsame period of time, 6 million Americans have slipped out of the middle \nclass and into poverty. Under President Clinton, 6 million people rise \nabove poverty; under President Bush, 6 million more Americans slip into \npoverty.\n  Are those the economic policies we want to continue for another 4 \nyears? We have a national debt right now which is an incredible \ndisgrace. It is a debt we are leaving to our kids and our \ngrandchildren. I always find it ironic that our Republican friends pose \nas the party of fiscal responsibility. Yes, they are staying up nights \nworrying about earmarks, worrying about everything.\n  Under President George W. Bush, the national debt has increased by $3 \ntrillion. We are closing in on $10 trillion. Under President Clinton, \nwe had recordbreaking surpluses as far as the eye could see.\n\n[[Page S8365]]\n\n  I think there is a real difference between the economic policies we \nhave seen under President Bush over the last 8 years and the economic \npolicies we saw under President Clinton the previous 8 years. The \ndifference is that under President Clinton, the middle class grew and \nexpanded, poverty went down. Under President Bush, the middle class \nshrunk, poverty went up.\n  But I have to be honest. Under President Bush, there have been people \nwho have done very well. While 90 percent of the American people have \nseen their incomes go down in the last 8 years, we do have to \nacknowledge that the people on top are not only doing well, they are \ndoing fantastically well. As an economic stratum among the top 1 \npercent, those folks are doing better than at any time since the 1920s. \nIn fact, the wealthiest 15,000 American families received a 57-percent \nincrease in income under President Bush.\n  We now have--and we do not talk about it too much--the absurd \nsituation that the top one-tenth of 1 percent earn more income than the \nbottom 50 percent. Now, I know a lot of folks get up here and they talk \nabout family values and they talk about morality. Let me go on record \nas saying I believe it is immoral that the top one-tenth of 1 percent \nearn more income than the bottom 50 percent.\n  While the middle class shrinks and poverty increases, the average \nincome of the top 400--top 400--American tax filers--and that \nrepresents 3 out of every 1 million taxpayers of this country--has more \nthan doubled under President George W. Bush, going from a mere $104 \nmillion in 2002--how do you get by on a mere $104 million? They were \nscraping by. But the good news is, by 2005, that $104 million went up \nto $214 million a year.\n  Adding insult to injury, the effective tax rate of the richest 400 \npeople, whose incomes are exploding, has nearly dropped in half, from \n30 percent in 1995 to only 18 percent in 2005, because of the Bush tax \ncuts for the rich.\n  It is not just income; it is wealth, also. The wealth--that is the \naccumulated income of the richest 400 Americans--has also soared under \nPresident Bush, going from a mere--now, we are talking about 400 \nfamilies. Mr. President, 400 families had an aggregate wealth of $290 \nbillion. When President Bush came in, their wealth was $290 billion, \nand it went to $1.5 trillion by the year 2006--$1.5 trillion for 400 \nAmericans, and in our country today, we have the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty of any country on Earth. We have 46 million Americans \nwithout any health insurance.\n  I raise these issues to talk about what is going on in our society \ntoday economically, to point out that the policies of President George \nW. Bush have very clearly worked if you are a millionaire or a \nbillionaire. They have been a disaster for you if you are in the middle \nclass or a working person. I commend Senator McCain for being pretty \nhonest and straightforward in saying he wants to continue those \npolicies: more tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, more tax \nbreaks for the largest corporations in our country, more efforts to \nprivatize Social Security, more efforts to cut back on programs \ndesperately needed by working families and low-income people.\n\n  So the thrust of what I wished to say this evening--and I was \ncompelled to come down here because I heard Senator Grassley speaking \nbefore; and Senator Grassley, as I indicated earlier, was very critical \nof Senator Obama's tax policies, and I disagree with Senator Grassley's \nconclusion. But I think if one is going to talk about Senator Obama's \ntax policies, it is important to talk about Senator McCain's overall \neconomic policies which are going to be 4 more years of Bush's \npolicies. This country--at least the middle class of this country, in \nmy view--cannot survive 4 more years of those policies. So that is \nabout all I wanted to say this evening.\n  I thank you, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier this evening, my colleague and \nfriend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, came to the floor and spoke about \nthe tax proposals of both Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate for \nPresident, and John McCain, the Republican candidate for President. I \nam happy he brought that debate to the floor. It is an important one. I \nthink it will be an important part of the decision process for most \nAmericans on November 4. But I, to no one's surprise, see it quite \ndifferently from my friend from Iowa.\n  As I see it, we have a clear choice in this election. We know what \nhas happened over the last 8 years. Under President George W. Bush, we \nhave followed the classic neoconservative Republican approach to the \neconomy and taxes. That approach started long ago and continued by \nPresident George W. Bush, who believes that we can, in fact, generate \nmore economic growth and prosperity in America by lowering the taxes on \nthe wealthiest people in our country. That is chapter and verse, that \nis the Bible, the economic Bible according to President Bush and his \nloyal followers. They have implemented that plan, creating tax breaks \nwhich have been historic and unusual; historic in that they have now \ndriven tax rates to the point where the wealthiest people have seen tax \nbreaks that are creating the largest deficits in the history of the \nUnited States of America. Last week, there were reports in Washington \nof a national deficit this year of $407 billion--the largest ever.\n  Remember: When George W. Bush took office from the Clinton \nadministration, he inherited a budget surplus. It was the first surplus \nin 30 years. It was a responsible budget process that actually paid off \ndebt. It gave longer life to Social Security. It meant less of a burden \non our children. But when President Bush took office, he changed all \nthat. He took that surplus and squandered it. He will now leave office \nwith the lowest approval rating in the history of the Presidency and \nwith the biggest deficit in the history of the Presidency. He managed \nthat because he did something no President has ever done in history. He \ncalled for cutting taxes in the midst of a war. No President has ever \ndone it because it makes no sense. A war is an added expense to a \nnation such as ours. We have our ordinary expenses for highways, \nprisons, medical research, education, and health care, and along comes \na war costing $10 billion a month, and President George W. Bush said: \nDon't worry. We won't pay for the war. We will add it to the deficit \nand, in fact, we will cut taxes. It made no sense. Because of this \ndesperate and poor economic and tax planning, we find ourselves with \nthe biggest deficit in the history of the United States of America.\n  I say that because John McCain, the Senator from Arizona and \nRepublican candidate for President, has endorsed President Bush's \neconomic and tax policies. He has said that if he is elected President, \nhe will continue the Bush economic policies which have driven our \neconomy into the ditch.\n  We know what is going on. Last weekend, the Secretary of the \nTreasury, Henry Paulson, called me in Illinois and said: Well, I want \nto let you know it has reached the point where the taxpayers have to \ntake over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those are two government-\nsponsored agencies responsible for half of the mortgages in America and \nthey were about to go bust. So Secretary Paulson moved in and said we \nhave to take them over. I don't quarrel with his conclusion. The \nalternatives were bleak. If those two agencies failed, we could see our \neconomy fall deep into a recession and a global recession following it. \nI really believe that. He did what he had to do. But we had to do it \nbecause the Bush economic policies have failed so miserably.\n  Sadly, they have taken the view that Government should not be \nresponsible for oversight of the major elements of our economy. They \nhave failed to keep their eye on the middle class of America, which is \nthe strength of our economy. They have given tax breaks to the \nwealthiest people, and John McCain promises more of the same. Let me \ncorrect that. John McCain promises to do even more than Bush did. In \nfact, his proposals for tax cuts for corporations would literally mean \nmultibillion\n\n[[Page S8366]]\n\ndollar tax cuts--additional tax cuts--for the oil companies in America. \nCan you think of a more deserving taxpayer than ExxonMobil? Is there \nany case you can think of more compelling when it comes to compassion \nthan to give a tax break to ExxonMobil? Those poor people reporting \nrecord-breaking historic profits need a tax break.\n  Have you heard any suggestion from my colleagues on the Republican \nside or John McCain to give tax breaks to those who are struggling in \nAmerica? We know who they are: middle-income taxpayers. They are the \nones paying for gas and groceries. They are the ones who are worried \nabout college education expenses. They are the ones worried about \nhealth care expenses. They are the ones who are being shunned and \nignored by the McCain-Bush approach to taxes.\n  Senator Grassley comes to the floor and says: Oh, this Barack Obama, \nhis tax plans are going to hurt small business. Well, I can stand here \nand tell my colleagues he is wrong--and I believe he is--but I may not \nbe as credible as a nonpartisan group such as the Annenberg Public \nPolicy Center. They took an analysis of the McCain tax policy, which is \nBush tax policies all over again, and they took a look at Senator \nObama's proposal, and this is what they say:\n\n       Senator McCain has repeatedly claimed that Obama would \n     raise taxes for 23 million small business owners.\n\n  That is from the Annenberg Policy Center. Their response:\n\n       It's a false and preposterously inflated figure.\n\n  They say:\n\n       We find that the overwhelming majority of those small \n     business owners would see no increase because they earn too \n     little to be affected. Obama's tax proposal would raise the \n     rates only on couples making more than $250,000 or singles \n     earning more than $200,000.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       McCain argues that Obama's proposed increase is a job \n     killer. He has a point. It's true that increasing taxes on \n     those at the top would leave them less money for other \n     purposes, including investment and hiring in the case of \n     business owners. But the number of business owners who would \n     see their rates go up would only be a small fraction of what \n     McCain says. Many would see their taxes go down.\n\n  That false claim about a new burden on small businesses was repeated \non the floor today by my friend and colleague from Iowa. It won't work.\n  At the same time they are calling for tax cuts for the wealthiest \npeople and the most profitable corporations in America, John McCain, \ninspired by George W. Bush, is not providing the kind of tax relief \nwhich Senator Obama is talking about for those in middle-income \ncategories across America.\n  That is the real difference. At a time when Americans are struggling \nwith soaring costs, John McCain will provide more tax breaks to \ncorporations that ship American jobs overseas, and John McCain would \nprovide no direct tax relief at all for more than 100 million middle-\nclass families. Those are the focus of the Obama tax relief plan--those \nfamilies.\n  John McCain doesn't have a plan to insure every American, and under \nhis plan you would pay taxes on health care for the first time ever. \nJohn McCain wants to change the way we get health insurance in America. \nIt gets back to the President Bush ownership society, and do we \nremember the motto of the Bush ownership society? ``Just remember, we \nare all in this alone.'' Well, Senator McCain, inspired by this \nconcept, believes we ought to get away from group insurance through our \nemployment and be given a little check and let's all go out in the \nmarket and do our best. Well, you know what that means. If you happen \nto have a family with a sick child or you happen to have a history of \nillness in your family, watch out. What you are going to have to pay is \ndramatically more. You are no longer in a pool with the risks shared; \nyou are on your own. So John McCain would say if your employer then is \ngoing to provide you with health insurance, we are going to tax it. We \nare going to tax that as income. That is a first, and that isn't going \nto help. It certainly isn't going to extend health care coverage to \nmore families--something we desperately need.\n  Now, what Barack Obama would do as President is simplify and reform \nour Tax Code, and it is long overdue. In George Bush's billion-dollar \ngiveaways to big corporations and the wealthiest in our society, the \nObama plan will reform our Tax Code so that it is simple, fair, and \nadvances opportunity, not the agenda of some lobbyist or oil company. \nHe will shut down the loopholes in tax havens and he will use the money \nto help pay for middle-class tax cuts that will provide $1,000 in tax \nrelief to 95 percent of workers and their families across America. The \nObama plan will make oil companies such as Exxon pay a tax on their \nwindfall profits and he will use the money to help families pay for \nskyrocketing energy costs and other bills.\n  He would eliminate income taxes for retirees making less than $50,000 \na year because he believes that every senior deserves to live out their \nlife in dignity and respect.\n  It just amazes me that John McCain could promise to bring us 4 more \nyears of these awful Bush economic and tax policies, when we know what \nthey have resulted in. Yet he is a loyal soldier. No maverick, no, sir; \nhe is a loyalist. When it comes to the Bush economic and tax policies, \nJohn McCain is no maverick. He is an acolyte of the high priest of \nRepublican tax policy, President George W. Bush. He promises more of \nthe same--4 more years. Can America stand it? Can we take it? I don't \nthink so.\n  Middle-income families and working families deserve a Tax Code that \ncares for them and gives them a fighting chance, not a Tax Code \ndesigned to help the wealthiest. The Halls of Congress out here are \nfilled with lobbyists, pretty well dressed, pretty well heeled, and \nliving a nice life. Their job is to protect that Tax Code George W. \nBush wrote. John McCain is their best friend. He promises that when he \nbecomes President, the George W. Bush Tax Code is going to be even more \ngenerous to the wealthiest businesses and individuals. That is \ncompletely wrong.\n  The strength of this country is when middle-income families have a \nfighting chance to succeed. Do you know what they feel. They feel, as I \ndo, that this country has been moving in the wrong direction for too \nlong. We need a real change and in a lot of different areas but \ncertainly when it comes to America's Tax Code.\n  For my friend from Iowa to come here and give us tales of doom and \ngloom about what might happen if we had real change in Washington, I \nsay to him, what do you think of the current mess? Do you agree with \nJohn McCain that the fundamentals of this economy are so strong today? \nIf you believe that, then you have not spent much time talking to real \nAmericans.\n  During this last break in August, I went back and toured my State \nfrom top to bottom. It is a big, wonderful State. I spent some time in \nsmall towns and sat down for a get-together after work in El Paso, IL. \nEl Paso is a little town just north of Bloomington; it is the \nbirthplace of Bishop Fulton J. Sheen. There is a tavern we went to \nafter work and had a beer, and we talked to some families about what \nthey are up against. I wish John McCain could hear those stories. I \nwish my colleagues could. I wish they could understand what this \neconomy has done to these good, hard-working people. These are folks \nwho are scared to death that the Mitsubishi plant in Bloomington is \ngoing to ship out more jobs. They don't want any more trade agreements \nthat ship jobs overseas. They are scared to death that we are going to \nhave a Tax Code like the one we have today, which rewards companies for \nsending jobs overseas, a provision in that code that John McCain agrees \nwith and Senator Obama disagrees with. These people are concerned about \ntheir kids' college education. One fellow said: My son just finished 2 \nyears at a private college in Peoria, and he decided to come back home. \nHe is going to try his luck at the community college to get on track. \nHe said that he has $60,000 in student loans. He is a sophomore, he \nhasn't even reached the point where he has a degree, but he has what \namounts to a mortgage debt in student loans.\n  Those are the realities of life out there in real America. When I \nhear John McCain say he wants to continue these economic policies and \ntax policies of George W. Bush, I wonder, when is the last time he sat \ndown with some of these families? He owes it to himself, if he wants to \nbe a good candidate for President, to sit down with some of these \nstruggling families.\n\n[[Page S8367]]\n\n  I think we need a new approach. We need change in this town. What \nSenator Obama is proposing is a change in the Tax Code to give that \nfamily and others a fighting chance. That is all we can offer them. \nThere is no guaranteed success, but we can offer them just an \nopportunity, a fighting chance at success. It is a chance most of our \nfamilies have capitalized on and did a pretty good job for their kids. \nWe owe that to the next generation as well.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I take this opportunity to recognize \nOctober as Domestic Violence Awareness Month, DVAM, and to recognize \nthe fine work of STAND! Against Domestic Violence.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the bill to designate \nOctober as ``National Domestic Violence Awareness Month.'' I strongly \nsupport the motivation behind DVAM and I have worked to end domestic \nviolence as long as I have been a Member of Congress. I authored the \nViolence Against Women Act, VAWA, while in the House of \nRepresentatives, and helped get it passed and signed into law after \nbeing elected to the Senate. VAWA toughened laws against perpetrators \nand continues to provide funding for campus safety, battered women's \nshelters, and training programs for law enforcement to identify and \nbetter understand cases of domestic violence. I am also proud to have \nintroduced the Domestic Violence Identification and Referral Act to \nprovide funding to schools for health professionals who work to prevent \ndomestic violence.\n  Domestic violence can strike anyone, regardless of race, age, sexual \norientation, religion, socioeconomic status or education level. \nParticularly tragic is the impact domestic violence has on children--\nphysically, emotionally, and mentally. This violence witnessed in the \nhome is often acted out in schools and communities. This negative cycle \nof violence has far-reaching impacts and I believe we must work \ntogether to prevent such violence from occurring in the first place.\n  I commend the tireless efforts of those who work everyday to end this \nviolence. For over 30 years, STAND! has provided domestic violence \nservices to families and individuals throughout Contra Costa County. \nThrough their work, STAND! strives to end domestic violence by raising \nawareness through education so that individuals will become advocates, \nand by providing support services to those survivors of domestic \nviolence.\n  As we prepare to enter Domestic Violence Awareness Month, I ask my \ncolleagues to join me and STAND! in remembering the victims of domestic \nviolence. I am inspired by those women who have survived domestic \nviolence. And I mourn those who have not survived. In their memory, I \nwill fight against domestic violence and work to empower women as long \nas I am in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/11/senate-section/article/S8367-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SEA OTTER AWARENESS WEEK 2008\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize Sea \nOtter Awareness Week 2008.\n  Established in 2003 by the national nonprofit organization Defenders \nof Wildlife, Sea Otter Awareness Week is an annual event that aims to \nteach the public about the vital role that sea otters play in our \nmarine ecosystem. Acknowledged each year by numerous nonprofit \norganizations, educational institutions, and local, State, and Federal \nelected officials, Sea Otter Awareness Week helps to protect this \nsentinel species and its habitat.\n  Historically, sea otters once numbered in the hundreds of thousands \nand thrived along the 6,000 miles of Pacific coastline from northern \nJapan, through the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, down the coast of \nCalifornia, and into Baja California in Mexico. Sadly, because of their \nthick fur, sea otters were hunted to the point of near extinction \nthroughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Thanks to an international ban \non hunting, conservation efforts, and reintroduction programs, the sea \notter population is on its way to recovery, though it has been a slow \nprocess.\n  The health and well-being of our sea otter population is indicative \nof the overall health and well-being of the Pacific Coast marine \necosystems as a whole. We must do all we can to protect our coastal \necosystem and foster the survival of sentinel species such as the sea \notter. To ensure a healthy coast and ocean, I am proud to have \nreintroduced my National Oceans Protection Act, which provides a \ncomprehensive approach to ocean management and protection, ensuring \nthat Americans can enjoy the beauty and majesty of our oceans for \ngenerations to come.\n  I commend Defenders of Wildlife and all those involved in Sea Otter \nAwareness Week for their dedication to raising awareness about the \ntremendously important role that sea otters have in our coastal \necosystem. I am inspired by their work and I applaud them for their \nperseverance in protecting the health of our oceans and marine life. \nTheir commitment means a brighter future for us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/11/senate-section/article/S8367-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8367-S8369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate.gov to the Congressional \nRecord. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve \nto be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet \neveryday expenses but also have suggestions and recommendations as to \nwhat Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that \nlast beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am writing this letter out of somewhat desperation with \n     the costs of energy lately. We live about 35 miles south of \n     Lewiston on property that my grandfather purchased in the \n     early 1940s. I have been disabled and am on Social Security \n     Disability after working over 25 years in the utility and \n     communication industry. My wife has been working in the \n     health care insurance business for over 20 years and drives \n     back and forth every day to work. We were budgeting and \n     spending about $200-$250 per month for gas. In the last two \n     months, it has increased to $425 per month! I know a little \n     about all the oil reserves in Montana, North Dakota as well \n     as other places even offshore and the untapped areas in \n     Alaska for drilling and several capped oil/propane wells that \n     have already been drilled. I am familiar about the open pit \n     mining in Centralia, Washington; Montana and Wyoming. I was \n     working when they moth-balled the nuclear plants at WASOP. I \n     use these areas as examples in the Northwest because this is \n     where I live and I am more familiar with them. We have taken \n     several conservation measures to cut our energy costs at our \n     home, but you can only do so much! I hardly ever even leave \n     the house anymore because I cannot afford to drive my (small) \n     Ford Ranger F150 pickup, just only to doctor appointments.\n       What can you do to start helping other Americans like us \n     here in Idaho and the Northwest? Congress should put our \n     families first, ahead of the environmentalists! These people \n     are driving up costs at an alarming rate! I believe in \n     treating our resources properly and our environment \n     respectfully, but come on, use our heads! These \n     environmentalists are making it impossible to survive \n     anymore. We need to decide if American people are going to \n     survive or is it going to be a small snail, a kind of fish or \n     a spotted owl, which, by the way ruined the lumber industry \n     in the Northwest. After research, they found out it was a \n     bigger owl killing the smaller ones! How much money did that \n     cost the people and industry brought on by environmentalists? \n     It is survival time, folks . . . let us start using our \n     heads. We need to start using our own resources now, not \n     later, and stop depending on other countries because you see \n     where that has positioned us. Open up the reserves, uncap oil \n     wells, less restrictions on open pit coal mines, put more \n     nuclear plants on line. Stop using wheat and corn for bio-\n     fuels because it is killing us at\n\n[[Page S8368]]\n\n     the grocery stores, better yet, stop wasting money on bio-\n     fuels because it is not cost effective. There are more \n     actions that need to be taken, but the ``most important'' \n     thing is that we need Congress to start acting Now to help us \n     survive before it is too late. Please!\n       Sincerely and with respect,\n     Barney and Patti, Winchester.\n                                  ____\n\n       I guess I have to admit that you are probably representing \n     the views of the majority of the people in Idaho. Sadly, that \n     is a very short-sighted viewpoint.\n       My story is that I am trying to walk more and ride my \n     bicycle when I can. Generally, I am trying to be more energy \n     conscious. The bottom line is that we Americans are missing \n     the point. For three reasons, we have to change our way of \n     thinking. The first is for our own health. Frankly, we do not \n     get enough exercise because we have become so dependent upon \n     the automobile. Take a look at your local high school parking \n     lot sometime. We are actually educating kids not to walk or \n     ride bikes. Take a look at the country as a whole, and you \n     will see a serious obesity problem. Take a look at our cities \n     and ask the question, ``How safe is it for a family to ride a \n     bicycle to the store or to the park? How safe is it for \n     children to ride to school on a bike? How safe is for a \n     mother to take her child to the grocery store on a bike? \n     Sadly, the basic answer seems to be: ``Who cares?'' Frankly, \n     you should!\n       The second reason is also related to health. When Idaho's \n     cities grow, with the corresponding dependence upon gasoline, \n     the wonderful clean air that people brag about deteriorates. \n     The Rathdrum Prairie and the Spokane Valley are set up very \n     much like the Los Angeles basin. It is only a matter of time \n     before we restrict woodburning stoves in the winter and \n     increase emission standards on vehicles.\n       The third reason is for the health of the planet. The hole \n     in the ozone layer and the problems caused by global warming \n     may not be entirely caused by the internal combustion engine, \n     but they have played a significant role. Just think for a \n     minute of what this world is going to look like if we \n     continue down this path, and China, Africa, India and the \n     rest of the world drive cars the way we do. Our children and \n     grandchildren will have a difficult time breathing, and that \n     will be just the beginning of the problems they will face. \n     Capitalism certainly has its strengths as an economic tool. \n     But somebody has to control it, or it will lead us to our own \n     destruction. It is a system designed to create profit for \n     people who answer needs.\n       Fifty years ago or more, our system began ``creating \n     needs'', like a MacDonald's hamburger, a Corvette Stingray, \n     or a piece of waterfront property all to myself. Originally, \n     these seemed like simple enough requests, but look at what we \n     have become. Our religions tell us wealth does not make us \n     happy, but we do not really hear that. We flatter men and \n     institutions who treat nature like their own possession. \n     Sadly, I would bet that very few people in Idaho are writing \n     you letters like this. I wish you had the wisdom and the \n     courage to begin to turn the thinking of the people of this \n     state around. My question to you is simply, ``If we keep \n     going this way, what do you think Idaho and this country will \n     look like in 50 more years. I predict your children and \n     grandchildren will be saying, ``Wow, we did not know that \n     would happen!'' Just as much as we are saying now that we \n     wish the miners of the 19th and 20th centuries had said, \n     ``Maybe we should have more concern for our lakes and \n     rivers''. Just as I would say now, ``Why did not our \n     forefathers have the wisdom to see that turning the shoreline \n     of our lake over to private property owners is a serious \n     mistake.'' The waters of Idaho just as the ocean around the \n     islands of Hawaii should have remained public property. \n     ``Those who refuse to learn from history are destined to \n     repeat it.'' We are there! Good luck with your programs. I \n     know you are a good and thoughtful man, and you cannot \n     singlehandedly turn this state or this country around, but I \n     hope you will begin to open your eyes and your mind to some \n     other possibilities. We need that from you.\n     Richard.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the email telling us of your position on the \n     energy crunch. I heartily support tapping the petroleum \n     resources we have here in the United States and, from all \n     that I have heard, we have the technology to do it in an \n     environmentally-friendly manner. I understand that \n     Congressman Chris Cannon of Utah is making efforts to develop \n     oil shale fields that are located under Utah, Colorado and \n     Wyoming. I support this and hope that you will uphold these \n     efforts if corresponding bills reach the Senate. Also, please \n     do whatever you can to support the development of \n     technologies that will allow us to tap these resources in \n     more efficient and environmentally conscientious ways.\n       I also support expanding our use of nuclear energy. My \n     understanding is that the popular fears of nuclear power \n     plants are largely based on myth. And most of the ``waste'' \n     produced is either relatively benign, or can be recycled or \n     reused. If federal regulations were changed so that all \n     radioactive byproducts did not have to be shipped to a \n     nuclear waste repository, we would have plenty of space in \n     places like Yucca Mountain for the 2 percent of nuclear \n     ``waste'' that actually should be there. France produces 80 \n     percent of its electricity from nuclear power. What in the \n     world is holding the U.S. back from building more nuclear \n     power plants?\n       I am all in favor of expanding our refinery capacity and in \n     developing alternative energy sources, such as biodiesel. \n     Please do whatever you can to bring about changes at the \n     federal level so that the private sector can go to work \n     developing technologies and resources and solve these growing \n     problems. I pray that your fellow legislators will take the \n     extreme environmentalist lobby with a grain of salt. I agree \n     that we are ``too dependent on petroleum,'' and that we are \n     ``far too dependent on foreign sources of that petroleum.'' \n     We need to move forward in tapping the resources we have. We \n     need to do so in an environmentally conscientious manner, but \n     we need to move forward.\n     Blake, Hamer.\n                                  ____\n\n       What would really help is if this information could be put \n     into the hands (and heads!) of the other Senators, \n     Representatives and President Bush.\n       I am sure you are looking for sad stories of starving \n     babies and missed vacations due to the price of energy \n     lately. My story is quite different. I have taken the issue \n     of high gas prices as an opportunity to change my lifestyle. \n     I ride my bicycle more instead of driving everywhere, I have \n     started enjoying activities that occur in my own backyard \n     instead of ``going somewhere'' to have a good time. I have \n     actually enjoyed the peace and quiet this gives me. Its funny \n     how our ``on the go'' American lifestyle in search of ``a \n     good time'' can be solved by NOT being on the go! :)\n       Now I am sure there are people (many people) who are \n     severely hurt from change in energy prices, BUT ignoring the \n     issue and waiting for someone to bail them out is NOT the \n     right solution. I have learned to live within my financial \n     budget and not spend more than I make (something my \n     grandfather taught me).

We live at least \n     50 miles roundtrip from the doctor's offices, bank, grocery \n     stores, etc. Our gas bill averages around $400 a month since \n     January '08. Our heat/energy bill averages $400 a month. We \n     have tried to make our trips to town count as we would stock \n     up and shop for necessities a few times a month. However, \n     that has also changed as we cannot afford to stock up as \n     grocery prices have skyrocketed. We now do without. Our extra \n     money is being eaten up by fuel, energy costs and groceries \n     and we are not living high on the hog!! We cannot afford the \n     fresh food that does not last a week in the refrigerator and \n     cannot afford to go 50 miles for fresh stuff weekly.\n       We have tried to help our only daughter who lives 80 miles \n     away and can barely cover rent and student loans (who, by the \n     way, did not qualify for a stimulus check when she has worked \n     and went to college, her income was $6,000.)\n       To top it off, we do have credit card debt and perfect \n     credit, which we've worked hard to achieve!!

Many have a strong desire to obtain employment and \n     earn a gainful wage, but with gas prices at $4/gallon, they \n     simply cannot afford to go to work. There is not a reliable \n     bus system, no train system to be utilized, and so they \n     decide to sit at home. The nearest areas offering the best \n     employment options are 20 miles away in either direction. Not \n     a bad commute as the traffic is relatively minimal, but an \n     $8, $9, $10/hour job simply does not offset the cost of fuel. \n     I live five minutes from my office, and I find myself \n     wondering how I will pay for the fuel. I laugh when I see the \n     oil representatives say they pay the same amount for gas as \n     the rest of us.

My husband and I budget. We save. We avoid \n     debt. Our home is modest, much of it built with our own \n     hands. We each drive a ten-year-old car. We rarely eat out. \n     We will also earn nearly $86,000 this year, far above the \n     median Idaho household income. Yet, I am feeling the burden \n     of increased energy costs.\n       How can that be? Our story really began with 9-11, or the \n     economic downturn that immediately followed it. Downsizing, \n     and then more downsizing meant layoffs for my husband, a new \n     college graduate at that time. Jobs were scarce for new \n     grads, and we depleted our savings, eventually turning to \n     credit cards in order to feed and insure our young family.\n       The economy picked up and he found consistent work. Then, I \n     graduated from college and we began attacking our credit \n     cards with added fervor. The future began looking brighter. \n     We set debt payoff goals and looked for ways to reduce the \n     number of my hours away from home so that I could focus on \n     our young boys. This December I was going to work one less \n     day per pay period. It was going to be our Christmas present \n     to our family.\n       Now that dream does not seem likely.\n       Increases in energy have led to price hikes around the \n     board. Wheat costs have skyrocketed, fresh produce too, and, \n     let us not even talk about milk and gasoline. The increases \n     mean that, in order for us to pay off our debt and continue \n     saving, I will have to continue working my regular schedule. \n     If we want any extras, like a date out, an occasional \n     vacation, or to finish projects around the house, I have to \n     work extra shifts to cover those. I do not see how I will be \n     able to reduce the number of hours at my job.\n       You ask what priorities I think Congress should set to \n     solve this crisis? My answers may seem a little strange, but \n     I am a believer in capitalism, fiscal responsibility and hard \n     work. They really do work! I would like to see our leaders:\n       Increase domestic oil production & alternative energy \n     production. Remember the South? Many say that they lost the \n     war because they did not have infrastructure. We need to \n     remember past mistakes so they do not revisit our future. Our \n     refineries are aging. We import more than we export. \n     Regulations make it nearly impossible to build new refineries \n     and expensive for new drill sites. We need to find a balance \n     with responsible environmental practices that allow new \n     refineries to be built and natural resources to be extracted.\n       Do not set price caps. If oil and gas become too expensive, \n     there will be incentive for alternative fuels & for Americans \n     to conserve!\n       Look at ways to decrease our tax load. Americans work very \n     hard for every penny we earn. Find ways to be more fiscally \n     responsible so that our tax burden can be lightened to help \n     offset our increasing energy expenses.\n       Do not forget the younger generation. My generation is \n     paying thousands in to social security & other programs that \n     will be bankrupt before we ever get to use them. We feel the \n     added strain of paying now, while trying to find ways to be \n     self sufficient because we expect to have a bankrupt country \n     by the time we get to retirement age. We need to invest in \n     our future. And please do not forget our little children. \n     What legacy will we be leaving them?\n       Quit labeling the Oil Companies as the bad guys. Our \n     current conundrum is nothing more than the classic supply \n     versus demand. If demand goes up and supply cannot meet it, \n     the cost will go up. This concept is taught in economics \n     classes around the country. Why should we expense the oil \n     companies to work for nothing? These companies provide many \n     Americans with good jobs.

OF BARRE, VERMONT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the innovation \nand achievements of SBE, Inc. in Barre, VT.\n  For decades, SBE has demonstrated an exceptional ability to adapt to \nthe demands of a changing marketplace. The company started as Sprague \nElectric in 1945, but today SBE is using cutting-edge technology to \ndevelop capacitors for use in green cars, alternative energies, Taser \nstun guns, and advanced military equipment. These innovative products \nhave created dozens of quality Vermont jobs that reflect our state's \ncommitment towards moving to alternative energy sources.\n  I commend Ed Sawyer, president and CEO of SBE, and all of the hard-\nworking employees in Barre for their foresight and innovation. I ask \nunanimous consent that a September 1, 2008, Burlington Free Press \narticle about the company be printed in the Record so all Senators can \nread about the success and commendable business practices of this \nsustainable Vermont company.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Sept. 1, 2008]\n\n Barre Firm Adapts Products to Survive: Capacitor Company Moves Focus \n               From TV and Stereos to Tasers and Hybrids\n\n                            (By Dan McLean)\n\n       Barre.--SBE Inc., built on 20th century capacitor \n     technology, has survived by continuing to adapt, taking a \n     Vermont-made product and carving a national market.\n       SBE has branched off from its trademarked orange colored \n     capacitors, known worldwide as the ``orange drop,'' and is \n     pursuing ``power ring'' technology for hybrid vehicles, \n     alternative energy producers and military applications.\n       ``This is sustainable manufacturing. It's a different \n     product mix,'' said Ed Sawyer, president and CEO of the SBE \n     Inc.\n       SBE has landed two rounds of U.S. Department of Energy \n     grants to pursue capacitor technology for the burgeoning \n     hybrid vehicle industry. The money is helping to bankroll \n     research and development that are creating jobs. ``We applied \n     for the grant in a competitive process along with \n     approximately 2,000 other firms across the U.S,'' Sawyer \n     said.\n       By continuing to innovate, the manufacturer has been able \n     to save itself from becoming obsolete.\n       Over a billion capacitors have been made by the Barre-based \n     manufacturer during the past six decades, Sawyer said. A \n     capacitor is an electronic device that can store energy.\n\n\n                            Keys to survival\n\n       Boom times continued into the late 1960s and early 1970s \n     for the capacitor manufacturer. During that time, about 900 \n     employees built capacitors for companies such as AC Delco, \n     Magnavox, RCA and Zenith.\n       The industry has changed a lot since Sprague Electric \n     entered into a subcontracting agreement with the Rock of Ages \n     Corp. to manufacture capacitors on their behalf in 1945. SBE \n     Inc. is the successor to Sprague Electric Co.\n       SBE has retooled. The company has translated a mid-20th \n     century technology into a modern application for green cars, \n     alternative energies, Taser stun guns and military equipment. \n     As the decades passed, foreign competitors--mostly in China, \n     Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines--began making capacitors \n     for one-quarter to one-third the price, Sawyer said. Aside \n     from the hefty price competition, work was lost because the \n     manufacturing of many electronic devices that use capacitors \n     moved from the U.S. to Asia.\n       When Sprague Electric sold the company to SBE in 1986, it \n     was down to 19 employees, Sawyer said. SBE now has about 50 \n     employees and is hiring five more engineers to work on \n     capacitors for hybrid cars.\n       The company survived, Sawyer said, because of its \n     longstanding philosophy: ``new products need to be developed \n     to keep the company viable.''\n       SBE Inc.--which leases 30,000 square feet of the 110,000 \n     square feet the manufacturer owned a few decades ago--was \n     created from the shell that Sprague Electric was leaving \n     behind after being decimated by foreign competition, Sawyer \n     said. The management team banded together to buy the \n     operation, forming SBE, he said.\n       ``If they didn't have the motivation, it would have been \n     just one more `closed business' story,'' Sawyer said.\n       Since becoming president in 2002, Sawyer promoted the \n     development of patents. Three patents have been issued on \n     high-voltage, pulse technologies, and six more are pending, \n     he said.\n       Unlike a semiconductor, which requires power be applied to \n     it, a capacitor has the ability to hold a charge and can \n     change direct current to alternating current, which is used \n     to power an electric motor.\n\n\n                             Job potential\n\n       Job growth, particularly skilled manufacturing positions, \n     should continue at SBE.\n       If the capacitor technology SBE is developing for hybrid \n     vehicles is embraced by General Motors, as Sawyer hopes, \n     employment could grow by another 100 people. ``It would be \n     huge job growth for the state,'' he said.\n       Rob Peterson, a GM spokesman, said suppliers for the Chevy \n     Volt hybrid vehicle have\n\n[[Page S8370]]\n\n     not been established yet. ``We have made some decisions on \n     suppliers, but we are very, very early on in the process.''\n       The Chevy Volt is set to hit markets in November 2010, \n     Peterson said. The car is designed to travel 40 miles on an \n     electric charge before tapping into electricity generated by \n     a gas-fueled engine.\n       The bulk of SBE's sales remain in standard capacitors used \n     in industrial lighting, welding equipment and supplies for \n     cell phone towers.\n       ``This is still what's paying the bills,'' he said.\n       SBE added to its product lineup when it became the \n     exclusive provider for capacitors for Taser International \n     Inc. in 2002, Sawyer said. SBE has sold about a million \n     capacitors for the stun guns carried by police departments \n     across the country, he said.\n       SBE landed Taser as a client because of the Barre company's \n     history as an industry leader. ``They actually approached us, \n     basically on our reputation in the industry,'' he said.\n       In 2007, SBE's revenue was $3 million to $5 million. Sawyer \n     expects those figures to be 20 to 25 percent higher this \n     year. Despite the sales, earnings are lackluster.\n       SBE, a privately held company, is not turning a profit, but \n     that's because profits are being rolled back into the \n     research and development budget, Sawyer said.\n\n\n                            Funding sources\n\n       Department of Energy grants are helpful, but they don't \n     offset the losses, he said.\n       SBE received $850,000 from the Energy Department to perfect \n     hybrid vehicle capacitor technology. The technology could \n     make lighter, smaller capacitors and slice a few hundred \n     dollars from the price of a hybrid vehicle, Sawyer said.\n       Grant money isn't the only source powering new endeavors at \n     SBE. The company's eye toward innovation, and reliable \n     revenue stream, caught the interest of ``angel'' investors, \n     Sawyer said. Such investors have poured in more than $2 \n     million in the last four years, he said.\n       The work for Taser helped SBE get traction with the \n     investment community and the existing capacitor business \n     added a sense of security.\n       ``There is less risk than two guys in a garage. We are an \n     existing entity that is paying the bills,'' Sawyer said.\n       The military is interested in the power ring technology to \n     shoot ``a high energy laser'' from a vehicle,'' Sawyer said.\n       The technology of the capacitors is similar. It's the sizes \n     of the pieces that vary. Capacitors for the hybrid cars are 6 \n     inches in diameter, substantially larger than the standard \n     capacitors, which are \\1/2\\-inch to 1-inch wide.\n       Capacitors being used by solar and wind energy producers to \n     store and filter electricity are about 12 inches in diameter, \n     he said.\n       York Capacitor--a similar operation in Winooski--closed in \n     2005 after being purchased by a South Carolina company that \n     moved manufacturing to Mexico. York Capacitor failed to \n     adapt, Sawyer said. ``They never changed.''\n       ``I don't think we'd be in business today . . . if we \n     didn't make the choices we made to target the markets we are \n     now,'' he said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/11/senate-section/article/S8370-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LARRY THORNTON\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I want to share a story with \nmy colleagues about the accomplishments of one of my constituents. It \nbegins with a feature story in Landscape Superintendent and Maintenance \nProfessional magazine and ends with selection as the Air Force \nAssociation's 2008 Department of Veterans Affairs Employee of the Year \nAward. The link between the two is a fine veteran and fellow Hawaii \nresident, Mr. Larry L. Thornton.\n  In June of last year, Landscape Superintendent and Maintenance \nProfessional magazine featured an article entitled ``Maintaining \nHonor,'' on the quality of the grounds-keeping at the National Memorial \nCemetery of the Pacific. The national cemetery, located on the island \nof Oahu and known to Hawaii locals as ``Punchbowl,'' is a crown jewel \nof America's memorials, and the last resting place of thousands who so \nvaliantly served their Nation. Millions visit Punchbowl annually, to \nwalk the grounds, to stand silently in its beauty, and to pay tribute \nto those laid to rest there.\n  The article featured pictures of the groundskeepers, each identified \nby first and last name. Unbeknownst to the readers, these hard working \nstewards are injured veterans, some with disabilities for which others \nmay have written them off as unable to contribute a day's labor. But \nthanks in large part to one man, one of their fellow veterans, they \nsucceed beyond such expectations, one day at a time. That man, their \nsupervisor for VA's Compensated Work Therapy Program for disabled \nveterans, managed to escape the feature photos. That man is Punchbowl's \nCemetery caretaker foreman, Larry Thornton.\n  Fortunately, Mr. Thornton could not escape the limelight when he \nfinally received just recognition for his work with disabled veterans \nand for his dedicated labor to maintain a national shrine. This year \nhis work was recognized and earned him the Air Force Association's \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Employee of the Year Award for 2008. I \njoin the Air Force Association in commending this fine veteran, Mr. \nThornton, for his service to his fellow veterans and our Nation. His \nservice began long before this award, and I am sure that it will \ncontinue long after it. I am doubly proud of him, as a Senator from \nHawaii and as the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/11/senate-section/article/S8370-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO STUART POLLAK\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to pay \ntribute to Stuart Pollack for his many years of service to the Hebrew \nFree Loan Association based in San Francisco, CA.\n  Stuart graduated as valedictorian from Lowell High School in San \nFrancisco in 1955. He went on to attend Stanford University for his \nundergraduate degree and graduated from Harvard Law School magna cum \nlaude in 1962. In his first year out of law school, Stuart would serve \nas a law clerk to Chief Justice Earl Warren and to Justices Stanley \nReed and Harold Burton. Following his work as a law clerk, Stuart moved \non to the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division; Special \nAssistant to Assistant Attorney General.\n  After finishing his position with the Department of Justice, Stuart \nwent into private practice at Howard Rice Nemerovski Canady & Pollak \nwhere he served as partner for 14 years before becoming a judge on the \nSan Francisco Superior Court, a position he held through 2002. \nContinuing with a long list of legal accomplishments, Stuart currently \nserves as an associate justice on the California Court of Appeals, \nDivision Three. Even with his demanding schedule as an associate \njustice, Stuart has consistently made time for Hebrew Free Loan \nAssociation and other organizations in which he has a leadership role: \nJewish Community Relations Council, the Jewish Community Federation, \nNew Israel Fund, America-Israel Friendship League and Congregation \nSherith Israel.\n  I commend the mission of Hebrew Free Loan Association and am thrilled \nby the positive impact it has on the lives of those who receive its \nassistance. Over the last 110 years, Hebrew Free Loan Association has \nprovided interest-free loans to people in need; assistance in the form \nof a loan rather than a hand out. Stuart's many years of dedicated \ninvolvement with Hebrew Free Loan Association, including his 2 years as \npresident, has allowed many from the San Francisco Bay Area Jewish \ncommunity to realize their dreams.\n  After nearly 30 years of continuing service to Hebrew Free Loan \nAssociation, I remain in admiration of Stuart's strong sense of civic \nduty. Along with hundreds of his friends and admirers throughout the \nSan Francisco Bay area, I wish him many more years of continued \ncommunity involvement and leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/11/senate-section/article/S8370-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8370-S8371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT PAUL STARZYK\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of a dedicated law enforcement officer, Sergeant \nPaul Starzyk of the city of Martinez Police Department. For the past 12 \nyears, Sergeant Starzyk worked tirelessly to provide the citizens of \nMartinez with safety and service. On September 6, 2008, Sergeant \nStarzyk was tragically killed in the line of duty.\n  Sergeant Starzyk, an Antioch resident, worked as a banker and at a \nlocal soup kitchen before he became active in law enforcement. He was \nhired by the city of Martinez Police Department as a reserve officer in \n1992 and became a police office in December 1994. After a brief period \nwith the Pleasant Hill Police Department, Sergeant Starzyk came back to \nthe Martinez Police Department in April 1997 and was promoted to \nsergeant in December 2007.\n  A member of the Central Contra Costa Narcotics Enforcement Team\n\n[[Page S8371]]\n\nand a former SWAT team leader, Sergeant Starzyk was renowned for his \nleadership skills among fellow officers. Throughout his career, \nSergeant Starzyk demonstrated a passion for law enforcement and \ncommitment to helping others, qualities that enabled him to become a \nrespected and model member of the Martinez Police Department.

Mr. President, it is an honor for me to recognize \nthe remarkable achievement of a group of Idaho citizen soldiers, the \n938th Engineer Detachment from Driggs. The 938th was recently awarded \nthe Meritorious Unit Commendation, one of the U.S. Army's highest \nhonors. According to BG Alan Gayhart, an Idaho unit has not won this \naward since the days of World War II, over 60 years ago. The 938th \nEngineer Battalion participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom from \nFebruary 2003 to March 2004. The unit operated in the capacity of fire \nprevention and combat aircraft protection for the 101st Airborne \nDivision in northern Iraq. This was a difficult mission, and one that \nthey executed with professionalism, skill, and excellence. The \nfirefighters worked tirelessly in their protection and prevention \nefforts in defense of freedom, and I am happy for their safe return to \nfamily and friends. I also keep the families and friends of those who \nmade the ultimate sacrifice in prayer as they continue on without their \nloved ones.\n  Idaho has a proud history of military service. Her sons and daughters \nhave been serving our Nation in uniform far from home since the days of \nthe Spanish American War in the early 20th century. The Meritorious \nUnit Commendation which the 938th Engineer Battalion received is \nawarded to military commands that display exceptionally meritorious \nconduct in the performance of outstanding service, heroic deed or \nvalorous actions. The unit was recommended for the award by the U.S. \nArmy's higher headquarters and was selected by the Pentagon for the \ncommendations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/11/senate-section/article/S8371-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SONY HAWAII AND SONY ELECTRONICS\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Sony Hawaii and \nSony Electronics (collectively ``Sony'') for their Electronics Take \nBack and Recycle Program. Sony Hawaii, part of the larger Sony \nElectronics Inc., is based in Honolulu and just celebrated its 40th \nanniversary as a Hawaii-based company. Seventy-five percent of Sony \nHawaii's business comes from selling discounted Sony products directly \nto U.S. military personnel around the world.\n  Sony has long been an industry leader in the environmentally friendly \ndesign of its consumer electronics and information technology products. \nLast year, Sony announced its Take Back and Recycle Program to \nencourage consumers to recycle and dispose of electronic devices in an \nenvironmentally sound manner. The program provides customers free \nrecycling of their unwanted Sony products, everything from a game \nconsole to a mobile phone to a DVD. Under its program, Sony takes full \nmanufacturer responsibility for all products that bear its brand and \nwill recycle those products at no cost to the consumer. Its recycling \nlocations will also accept and recycle non-Sony consumer electronics \nand information technology products for a small fee.\n  Sony has partnered with Waste Management Recycle America to utilize \n138 drop-off centers throughout the country, with the goal of having \n150 permanent locations and at least one recycling location in every \nState by September 2008. Sony's longer term goal is to have a \ncollection location within 20 miles of 95 percent of the U.S. \npopulation at which consumers, retailers, and municipalities can have \nany product from any consumer electronic manufacturer recycled.\n  All products which are collected through the program must be recycled \nusing the strictest environmental standards. Waste Management will \nstore, track inventory and dismantle the products into the form of \ncommon raw materials that can be bought and sold on the global market. \nIn some cases, it is likely that recycled plastics will be purchased \nfor reforming into a new current model electronics product. Sony seeks \nat least 95 percent recycling rates, with less than 5 percent of \nmaterials going to landfills. In addition, Sony provides full public \naccountability of how and where the material goes and prohibits the \nexportation of hazardous waste to developing countries.\n  In addition to setting up permanent collection centers, Sony is \nholding numerous, highly publicized electronics recycling events, \nthroughout the United States, including some in the State of Hawaii. \nSony also offers consumers credit toward the future purchase of a \nsimilar product if they send in their old product for recycling.\n  Sony has stated that its goal in implementing the Take Back and \nRecycle Program is to make recycling as easy for consumers as it is for \nthem to purchase a Sony product. I commend Sony for its electronics \nrecycling efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/11/senate-section/article/S8371-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8371-S8372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        100TH ANNIVERSARY OF OUR LADY OF SORROWS CATHOLIC CHURCH\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to extend my \ncongratulations to Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church in Grand Rapids, \nMI, as they celebrate their 100th anniversary. Since its inaugural mass \non September 20, 1908, Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church has been \ndevoted to serving the many diverse needs within the Grand Rapids \ncommunity, and I am pleased to join in celebrating this important \nmilestone.\n  In the late 1800s, as the Italian-American population in Grand Rapids \ncontinued to grow, there began an earnest search within this immigrant \ncommunity for a place to worship that would respond to their specific \nneeds. Led by Father Salvatore Cianci and without a formal structure in \nwhich to conduct mass, the congregation was established and gathered in \nthe basement of St. Andrew's Cathedral in Grand Rapids in 1908 to \ncelebrate its first mass. With this mass, the congregation of Our Lady \nof Sorrows began their spiritual journey by seeking to minister to the \nroughly 75 families that lived in the area at the time.\n  During the early part of the 20th century, Our Lady of Sorrows \nCatholic Church continued to grow and to establish a presence in the \ncommunity. Throughout both the Great Depression and World War II, they \nworked diligently to create a permanent residence for their church \ncommunity. The church initiated fundraising efforts to help support the \npurchase of a permanent location, as well as to support their many \ncommunity outreach efforts. After nearly 40 years in temporary \nlocations, their determination and persistence was rewarded with the \ndedication of the new church structure on April 14, 1957.\n  Through the many challenges and changes the church and the larger \ncommunity endured, Our Lady of Sorrows has remained committed to its \nchurch family. The Grand Rapids parish is presently home to more than \n250 families of diverse backgrounds, including a growing Hispanic \npopulation. During their distinguished 100-year history, they \nestablished an elementary school; constructed a new convent, rectory, \nand church; and established a local scholarship for anyone living \nwithin the boundaries of the parish. Today, the church serves as an \nexample of an inclusive community and has reached out to people of \ndiverse backgrounds, facilitating an appreciation for different \ncultures.\n  Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church is truly an important part of the \nrich history of Grand Rapids. Their influence and service to the \ncommunity is apparent to the many that have benefitted from the \nchurch's spiritual and\n\n[[Page S8372]]\n\noutreach efforts. I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Our \nLady of Sorrows Catholic Church on 100 years of dedicated service to \nthe Grand Rapids community, and I wish them much success as they embark \non another 100-year journey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/11/senate-section/article/S8372-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING FIREFLY RESTORATIONS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize Firefly \nRestorations of Hope, ME, a company whose tribute to the fallen \nfirefighters of September 11 stands as a symbol of our Nation's resolve \nand exemplifies the selfless spirit of Maine's small businesses.\n  Firefly Restorations is one of a small number of businesses that \nrestore and rebuild antique fire apparatus. Firefly's owner, Andy \nSwift, is a Mainer with a life-long love of firefighting and fire \nengines. Mr. Swift, a firefighter of over fourteen years, has been \nrestoring fire engines for two decades. In his words he has been: ``. . \n. immersed in this world of fire.''\n  On September 11, 2001, Mr. Swift watched from his television as his \nbrethren entered the Twin Towers and sacrificed their lives so that \nthose trapped inside might live. It was at that moment that Mr. Swift \nresolved to do something, anything, to assist or to commemorate the \nevents of that tragic day. At first, Mr. Swift felt a visceral pull to \nGround Zero. As he said, ``When you're a fireman, you have a \nfirefighter's heart.'' But instead, he found a different and unique way \nto show his gratitude for the sacrifices of the fallen firefighters of \nthe New York City Fire Department.\n  Mr. Swift made an offer to the New York City Fire Department. He \nsaid, provide me with a fire engine, any fire engine, and I will \nrestore it for free. Shortly after the offer was made, the New York \nCity Fire Department asked him to restore a nineteenth century hose \nwagon, and Mr. Swift was more than happy to oblige.\n  Restoring fire engines is a costly and time consuming task. Firefly \nRestorations typically takes 2 years to refurbish an engine, but with \nMaine firefighters raising $3,500 for materials and Mr. Swift and his \nemployees donating over 2,500 hours of free labor, the hose wagon was \ncompleted within 6 months.\n  On October 12, 2002, 1 year, 1 month, and 1 day after September 11, \nthe fire hose Firefly Restorations refurbished made its debut at the \nfallen firefighter's memorial service in Madison Square Garden. Amidst \nthe tributes and memorial services the antique hose wagon stood as a \nsilent reminder of the links between generations of brave men and women \nwho rush into buildings when others rush out. In his own way, Mr. Swift \nput the ceremony into perspective when he said, ``It was probably one \nof the most moving things that I've been involved with. I think it was \na healing process, and I think it was important for me to go through . \n. . I was brokenhearted like many, many other people were, and I just \nthought it was part of the stage of healing.''\n  Seven years after September 11 Mr. Swift and his business are still \nin Maine and continue to restore fire engines. After the October 2002 \nmemorial service, the hose wagon returned to Maine, and, today, it can \nbe found at the Owls Head Transportation Museum in Owls Head, Maine. On \nthe seventh anniversary of September 11, we take this day to grieve and \ncommemorate the extraordinary acts preformed by ordinary Americans like \nAndy Swift and his employees at Firefly Restorations.\n  I thank Andy Swift and Firefly Restorations for this gift to our \ncountry, our Nation's firefighters, and to those brave heroes who gave \ntheir lives on September 11.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/11/senate-section/article/S8372-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8372-S8373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPROPOSED AGREEMENT FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED \nSTATES OF AMERICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA CONCERNING PEACEFUL USES \n    OF NUCLEAR ENERGY, RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON \n                       SEPTEMBER 10, 2008--PM 63\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to section 123 of \nthe Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153) (AEA), the \ntext of a proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the Government of \nthe United States of America and the Government of India Concerning \nPeaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy. I am also pleased to transmit my \nwritten determination concerning the Agreement, including my approval \nof the Agreement and my authorization to execute the Agreement, and an \nunclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) \nconcerning the Agreement. (In accordance with section 123 of the AEA, \nas amended by title XII of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring \nAct of 1998 (Public Law 105-277), a classified annex to the NPAS, \nprepared by the Secretary of State in consultation with the Director of \nNational Intelligence, summarizing relevant classified information, \nwill be submitted to the Congress separately.) The joint memorandum \nsubmitted to me by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy \nand a letter from the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nstating the views of the Commission are also enclosed.\n  The proposed Agreement has been negotiated in accordance with the AEA \nand other applicable law. In my judgment, it meets all applicable \nstatutory requirements except for section 123a.(2) of the AEA, from \nwhich I have exempted it as described below.\n  The proposed Agreement provides a comprehensive framework for U.S. \npeaceful nuclear cooperation with India. It permits the transfer of \ninformation, non-nuclear material, nuclear material, equipment \n(including reactors) and components for nuclear research and nuclear \npower production. It does not permit transfers of any restricted data. \nSensitive nuclear technology, heavy-water production technology and \nproduction facilities, sensitive nuclear facilities, and major critical \ncomponents of such facilities may not be transferred under the \nAgreement unless the Agreement is amended. The Agreement permits the \nenrichment of uranium subject to it up to 20 percent in the isotope \n235. It permits reprocessing and other alterations in form or content \nof nuclear material subject to it; however, in the case of such \nactivities in India, these rights will not come into effect until India \nestablishes a new national reprocessing facility dedicated to \nreprocessing under IAEA safeguards and both parties agree on \narrangements and procedures under which the reprocessing or other \nalteration in form or content will take place.\n  In Article 5(6) the Agreement records certain political commitments \nconcerning reliable supply of nuclear fuel given to India by the United \nStates in March 2006. The text of the Agreement does not, however, \ntransform these political commitments into legally binding commitments \nbecause the Agreement, like other U.S. agreements of its type, is \nintended as a framework agreement.\n  The Agreement will remain in force for a period of 40 years and will \ncontinue in force thereafter for additional periods of 10 years each \nunless either party gives notice to terminate it 6 months before the \nend of a period. Moreover, either party has the right to terminate the \nAgreement prior to its expiration on 1 year's written notice to the \nother party. A party seeking early termination of the Agreement has the \nright immediately to cease cooperation under the Agreement, prior to \ntermination, if it determines that a mutually acceptable resolution of \noutstanding issues cannot be achieved through consultations. In any \ncase the Agreement, as noted, is a framework or enabling agreement that \ndoes not compel any specific nuclear cooperative activity. In the event \nof termination of the Agreement, key nonproliferation conditions and \ncontrols would continue with respect to material and equipment subject \nto the Agreement.\n\n  An extensive discussion of India's civil nuclear program, military \nnuclear program, and nuclear nonproliferation policies and practices is \nprovided in the Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) and \nin a classified annex to the NPAS submitted to the Congress separately.\n\n[[Page S8373]]\n\n  The AEA establishes the requirements for agreements for nuclear \ncooperation, some of which apply only to non-nuclear-weapon states (see \nAEA, section 123a.). The AEA incorporates the definition of ``nuclear-\nweapon state'' from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons (NPT), which defines it to mean a state that has manufactured \nand exploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device prior \nto January 1, 1967. Therefore India is a non-nuclear-weapon state for \nNPT and AEA purposes, even though it possesses nuclear weapons. The \nAgreement satisfies all requirements set forth in section 123a. of the \nAEA except the requirement of section 123a.(2) that, as a condition of \ncontinued U.S. nuclear supply under the Agreement, IAEA safeguards be \nmaintained in India with respect to all nuclear materials in all \npeaceful nuclear activities within its territory, under its \njurisdiction, or carried out under its control anywhere (i.e., ``full-\nscope'' or ``comprehensive'' safeguards).\n  The Henry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy \nCooperation Act of 2006 (the ``Hyde Act'') established authority to \nexempt the Agreement from the full-scope safeguards requirement of \nsection 123a.(2) of the AEA, as well as certain other provisions of the \nAEA relating to supply under such an agreement, provided that the \nPresident makes certain determinations and transmits them to the \nCongress together with a report detailing the basis for the \ndeterminations. I have made those determinations, and I am submitting \nthem together with the required report as an enclosure to this \ntransmittal.\n  Approval of the Agreement, followed by its signature and entry into \nforce, will permit the United States and India to move forward on the \nU.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Initiative, which Indian Prime \nMinister Manmohan Singh and I announced on July 18, 2005, and \nreaffirmed on March 2, 2006. Civil nuclear cooperation between the \nUnited States and India pursuant to the Agreement will offer major \nstrategic and economic benefits to both countries, including enhanced \nenergy security, an ability to rely more extensively on an \nenvironmentally friendly energy source, greater economic opportunities, \nand more robust nonproliferation efforts.\n  The Agreement will reinforce the growing bilateral relationship \nbetween two vibrant democracies. The United States is committed to a \nstrategic partnership with India, the Agreement promises to be a major \nmilestone in achieving and sustaining that goal.\n  In reviewing the proposed Agreement I have considered the views and \nrecommendations of interested agencies. I have determined that its \nperformance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk \nto, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved it \nand I urge that the Congress also approve it this year.\n\n                                                      George W.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 3472. A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act \nof\n\n[[Page S8387]]\n\n2002 to further the adoption of technologies developed by the \nDepartment of Agriculture, to encourage small business partnerships in \nthe development of energy through biorefineries, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Energy and \nTechnology Advancement, ETA, Act of 2008. At its heart, this bill will \nincrease partnerships between the Federal Government and businesses to \nhelp spur the commercialization of energy, forestry, and other \ntechnologies--in other words, to increase the ETA, or estimated time of \narrival, for bringing new technologies to market.\n  This bill is among the bills I have introduced this week as part of \nmy E4 Initiative, dubbed E4 because of its focus on Economy, \nEmployment, Education, and Energy.\n  Particularly in the area of energy, we must do more to make new \nenergy solutions, like next generation biofuels, a reality. My bill \nwill help make the Federal Government a better business partner for the \nmany businesses that are researching and developing innovative \ntechnology solutions our country needs. We are squandering the Federal \ninvestment of billions into research and development by not doing \nenough to prevent new technologies from sitting on the shelf or being \nshipped to another country. Helping these new energy technologies get \noff the ground is not only a promising way to develop the next \ngeneration of energy technology that will help break our addiction to \noil, it will also help to spur job creation and enhance rural \ndevelopment.\n  One obstacle identified by the Forest Service's Wisconsin-based \nForest Products Lab which conducts forestry and energy technology \nresearch with businesses and others, is lack of Federal support for \nmoving technologies from the research and development phase to \ncommercialization. My bill will bridge this gap by authorizing the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, USDA, which includes the Forest Service, to \nwork with businesses and provide access to resources to assist with \ngetting technologies to market.\n  By encouraging the USDA to act as a ``business incubator,'' we can \nincrease the rate of success and reduce the length of time for bringing \ntechnologies to the market. By providing a bridge to move new \ntechnologies beyond the research and development phase to \ncommercialization, the Federal Government will accelerate the \ndevelopment of new technologies and create increased opportunities for \nsmall businesses, local and State government, and others.\n  All energy, forestry, and other technologies will benefit from my ETA \nAct because it will help new technologies come to the market. It does \nso by promoting the Federal Government as a better business incubator, \nencouraging the USDA to provide business support services, and \nauthorizing USDA employees and private-sector employees to work \ntogether in Federal or private experimental or product facilities. My \nbill will also increase cooperation between the Federal Government and \ninnovative businesses by encouraging the USDA to allow rental of \nFederal equipment and property for the development-of new technology. \nThe cost of the legislation is fully offset so as to not increase the \nFederal deficit.\n  Lastly, a specific partnership encouraged by my Energy and Technology \nAdvancement Act will spur the commercialization of biofuels. My bill \nrequires the USDA to pursue a biorefinery pilot plant that will allow \nbusinesses to partner with the Federal Government to test various \nbiofuels technologies derived from a variety of feedstocks, including \nwoody and agriculture waste.\n  Certainly one of today's greatest challenges--energy--is also one of \ntomorrow's greatest opportunities. Today, the transportation sector \naccounts for 70 percent of our oil consumption. However, there are \npromising efforts to significantly lessen our dependence on oil by \nreducing fuel consumption through increased efficiency and by \naggressively pursuing renewable fuels, or biofuels. The \ncommercialization of biofuels will also create job opportunities, \nsupport rural development and industries such as forestry, and develop \nthe next generation of fuels that are sustainable and from diverse \nsources.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3472\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to resolve water rights claims of the White Mountain \nApache Tribe in the State of Arizona, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the White \nMountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of 2008. This \nlegislation would authorize, confirm, and ratify the White Mountain \nApache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Agreement and authorize \nfunding for a key drinking water project on the tribe's reservation. \nThe White Mountain Apache Tribe and the water users and providers of \nArizona have waited a long time for this day. In fact, the legislation \nI am introducing today is the product of nearly 3 years of negotiation \nand the tremendous work of the settlement parties.\n  On behalf of the tribe, the U.S. filed substantial claims to water in \nthe Gila River and Little Colorado River General Stream adjudications \nin Arizona. Absent a settlement, resolution of these claims would take \nmany years,\n\n[[Page S8388]]\n\nentail great expense, prolong uncertainty concerning the availability \nof water supplies, and seriously impair the long-term economic well-\nbeing of all of the parties to the settlement. Specifically, without a \nsettlement, the tribe's claims could impact water users in the Salt \nRiver system, a major water source within the State of Arizona.\n  Within the last few days, the representatives of the non-federal \nwater settlement parties have indicated that a settlement is nearly \nfinalized. The parties' representatives have expressed their written \nsupport for the settlement and have indicated that they will be \nsubmitting the settlement to their respective governing bodies for \nreview and action.\n  Under the settlement agreement, the tribe would have a right to a \ntotal annual diversion water right of 99,000 acre-feet per year through \na combination of surface water and Central Arizona Project water \nsources. The legislation would confirm, authorize, and ratify the \nparties' settlement and provide federal funding for a desperately \nneeded drinking water project on the tribe's reservation--the Miner \nFlat Project.\n  Currently, a relatively small well field serves the drinking water \nneeds of the majority of the residents on the reservation, but \nproduction from the wells has declined significantly over the last few \nyears. As a result, the tribe has experienced summer drinking water \nshortages. The tribe is planning to construct a small Rural Development \nfunded diversion project on the North Fork of the White River on its \nreservation this year. It indicates that when the project is completed \nit will replace most of the lost production from the existing well \nfield, but will not produce enough water to meet the demand of the \ntribe's growing population. The Miner Flat Project would provide a \nlongterm solution for the tribe's drinking water shortages.\n  Consequently, not only would the legislation I have introduced today \nprovide certainty to water users in the State of Arizona regarding \ntheir future water supplies, it would provide the tribe with a long-\nterm reliable source of drinking water. Therefore, I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                      Central Arizona Project,\n\n                                   Phoenix, AZ, September 4, 2008.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: I am writing as counsel for the Central \n     Arizona Water Conservation District regarding legislation to \n     authorize a settlement of the water rights claims of the \n     White Mountain Apache Tribe. As you know, my staff and I have \n     been personally involved in the negotiations to settle the \n     water rights claims of the Tribe. My staff and I have had the \n     opportunity to review the most recent drafts of the \n     authorizing legislation and the settlement agreement and we \n     intend to recommend approval of the settlement to our \n     governing Board. In our judgment, the proposed settlement is \n     consistent with the Arizona Water Settlements Act and \n     represents an important step forward in Arizona's efforts to \n     resolve outstanding Indian water rights claims. We look \n     forward to continuing to work with you and the other members \n     of the Arizona congressional delegation in bringing this \n     important settlement to fruition.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Douglas K. Miller,\n     General Counsel, CAWCD.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  August 29, 2008.\n     Senator Jon Kyl,\n     East Camelback Road,\n     Phoenix, AZ.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: We the undersigned representatives of \n     parties to the White Mountain Apache Tribe Quantification \n     Agreement have reviewed the attached Quantification \n     Agreement, Exhibits, and accompanying draft legislation \n     (``Settlement Documents''). Based upon our participation in \n     the negotiations and/or our review of the attached Settlement \n     Documents, we, at this time, intend to express our support \n     for the Settlement Documents and plan to submit them for our \n     governing bodies' review and action. As of the date of this \n     letter, we are not aware of any reason why our governing \n     bodies would not support the Settlement Documents. The \n     governing bodies, however, must conduct a final review of the \n     Settlement Documents and make a decision.\n       The Settlement Documents may be revised as agreed upon by \n     the parties. We understand that authorizations for \n     appropriations included within the draft legislation are \n     still subject to agreement between you and the White Mountain \n     Apache Tribe.\n       Signed by 17 representatives of parties to the White \n     Mountain Apache Tribe Quantification Agreement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARPER (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 3474. A bill to amend title 44, United States Code, to enhance \ninformation security of the Federal Government, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nLieberman to introduce the Federal Information Security Management Act \nof 2008.\n  Although the name of the bill may not sound very exciting, let me \nassure you that this piece of legislation could be one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation Congress passes this session.\n  Every day, massive amounts of information is transmitted across the \nglobal information infrastructure. Some of this information is routine \ne-mail between co-workers making lunch plans or a couple making plans \nfor who will pick up the kids at school. Much of it, however consists \nof highly sensitive military and commercial secrets. As everyone can \nattest to, increasing global interconnectivity has greatly increased \nour productivity and ability to communicate. However, it has also \nincreased our responsibility to make sure this information is \nprotected.\n  The Federal Government stores within its databases some of our \nNation's most critical military, economic, and commercial secrets. \nGreat harm could be caused if it were to fall into the wrong hands. \nKnowing this, nation-states and criminal groups are spending a good \ndeal of money and time trying to access it.\n  According to a report released back in March by the Department of \nDefense, the U.S. Government and our allies around the world have come \nunder attack in the past year on a number of occasions by hackers from \naddresses that appear to originate from within the Chinese government. \nThese hackers were able to compromise information systems at government \nagencies, defense-related think tanks, contractors, and financial \ninstitutions. Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the German Office \nfor the Protection of the Constitution, has accused China of sponsoring \nthese attacks ``almost daily'' in an attempt to ``intensively gather \npolitical, military, corporate-strategic and scientific information in \norder to bridge their technological gaps as quickly as possible.''\n  The threat of a nation-state cyber attack is very real. Last year in \nEstonia, an attack by Russian hackers was coordinated through online \nchat rooms and Web sites. This ``Cyber War,'' as the media called it, \nshut down Web sites of a number of Estonian organizations, including \nthe Estonian parliament, banks, ministries, newspapers, and \nbroadcasters.\n  But we don't have to look overseas to find threats to our information \nsecurity. Sometimes, we only have to look in our own backyards. Just \nlast year, the Veterans Affairs Department had an external hard drive \nstolen, exposing sensitive personal information on nearly 2 million \nindividuals. But this isn't the only example. Not by a long shot. The \nDepartments of Defense, Transportation, Commerce, Health and Human \nServices, Homeland Security, Education, Agriculture, and State have all \nhad sensitive information compromised by current or former employees. \nThese incidents are simply unacceptable.\n  The original Federal Information Security Management Act, or FISMA, \ncame out of a recognition a few years ago of the critical importance of \nprotecting our information systems. Since then, agencies have made \nextraordinary progress in implementing crucial information security \nmeasures. They should be acknowledged and congratulated for their \nefforts. However, I am concerned that, 5 years after the passage of \nFISMA, agencies may have fallen into the trap of complacency and are \njust checking boxes to show compliance with requirements written into a \nbill.\n  The bill Senator Lieberman and I have put forward today will help \naddress this issue. Our bill empowers Chief Information Security \nOfficers to deny access to the agency network if proper security \npolicies are not being\n\n[[Page S8389]]\n\nfollowed. If we are going to hold these hardworking individuals \naccountable in Congress for information security, then we should give \nthem the authority to do so.\n  Our bill requires that individuals hired to be Chief Information \nSecurity Officers be qualified to monitor, detect, and respond to cyber \nintrusions rather than someone who spends much of their time checking \nboxes and filling out paperwork.\n  Our bill will increase collaboration and teamwork and ensure that \nChief Information Security Officers continue to keep up to date on the \nlatest technologies and security threats by establishing a Chief \nInformation Security Officers Council. The council will be an open \nforum where senior officials can be open and honest about security \nbreaches and work together to solve them. This council will be chaired \nby the National Cyber Security Center Director and will break down the \nartificial boundaries that have previously existed in cyberspace.\n  Our bill will also require the Department of Homeland Security to \nconduct an annual operational evaluation of agency networks. This \nevaluation will test whether those who want to cause mischief or do us \nharm can access our sensitive information, much like we test whether \nterrorists can enter our nuclear facilities or military bases. This \nevaluation will provide agency leadership and Congress with a better \npicture of where our weaknesses are and where we need to focus our \nattention and resources.\n  Most importantly, our bill will strengthen information security \nrequirements in contracts when agencies purchase services or products \nfrom private vendors. No longer should agencies and Congress have to \nclean up a security mess after an incident has already happened. \nInstead, we need to start focusing on purchasing more secure services \nand products that will help prevent these intrusions from happening in \nthe first place.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to get these important \nand necessary reforms enacted before it is too late. I think everyone \ncan agree that computers, the Internet, and cutting-edge technology \nhave greatly benefited our government and our society. But we also need \nto recognize that it has greatly increased the threats we face on a \ndaily basis.\n  In times like these we need to accept our responsibility to protect \nsensitive information and be held accountable when we fail.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3474\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Information Security \n     Management Act of 2008'' or the ``FISMA Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       Section 3542(b) of title 44, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) The term `adequate security' means security \n     commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm resulting \n     from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or \n     modification of information.\n       ``(5) The term `incident' means an occurrence that actually \n     or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or \n     availability of an information system or the information the \n     system processes, stores, or transmits or that constitutes a \n     violation or imminent threat of violation of security \n     policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.\n       ``(6) The term `information infrastructure' means the \n     underlying framework that information systems and assets rely \n     on in processing, transmitting, receiving, or storing \n     information electronically.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 44, United States Code, to authorize \ngrants for Presidential Centers of Historical Excellence; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nSenator Webb to help encourage the preservation of, and public access \nto, historical documents and records of former United States \nPresidents. Congressman Goodlatte is joining us in this effort and has \nintroduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  The preservation of historical documents is critical to the future of \nany nation. Current and future generations can look upon the examples \nof those that came before and learn from their accomplishments, as well \nas their mistakes. Our Founding Fathers understood the need to preserve \nimportant documents for future generations. Thomas Jefferson once said \nthat ``a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always \nvaluable.'' In addition, he considered it ``the duty of every good \ncitizen to use all the opportunities, which occur to him, for \npreserving documents relating to the history of our country.''\n  Today, we have federally supported presidential libraries from \nPresident Hoover onward, but, generally, we do not have federally \nsupported libraries for Presidents prior to President Hoover. The \ndocuments and records of these Presidents are scattered throughout \nAmerica. In our view, the Federal Government should be taking an active \nrole in encouraging the preservation of these documents.\n  In Virginia, we have an organization that has been leading the way in \npreserving the records of President Woodrow Wilson. To date, the \nWoodrow Wilson Presidential Library has preserved several thousand \ndocuments. Last year alone, the library received more than one million \nWilson-related documents, and it is in the process of preserving these \ndocuments and will make them freely available on the Internet. \nThousands of people visit the library each year to see documents that \nhave never been seen before in public. In my view, libraries like the \nWoodrow Wilson Presidential Library are critical to our Nation's \nhistory, and we should be encouraging more organizations to engage in \nthis important endeavor.\n  The legislation I introduce today will help encourage these and other \nefforts to preserve, and provide public access to, these historical \ndocuments by authorizing the National Archives and Records \nAdministration to provide grants to certain organizations to support \ntheir efforts in preserving the historical records of past Presidents.\n  I want to thank the National Archives for their assistance in \ndrafting this important legislation. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the Senate to see this legislation signed into law.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation with my colleague, Senator Warner, which will authorize the \nNational Archives and Records Administration to make grants for the \npreservation of records and other historical documents of American \nPresidents. Grants will be available to entities seeking to preserve \nthe records and other historical documents of Presidents who do not \nhave a presidential library managed and maintained by the Federal \nGovernment. This legislation represents the hard work and dedication of \nnumerous stakeholders who are working to preserve these historical \ndocuments for present and future generations to enjoy.\n  The Presidential Historical Records Preservation Act builds upon \nexisting efforts by the National Historical Publications and Records \nCommission to promote the preservation and use of America's documentary \nheritage by making grants available to non-profit entities, states and \nlocal communities that are seeking to preserve the records and \nhistorical documents of American Presidents. This legislation \ncompliments the mission of the National Historical Publications and \nRecords Commission by helping the American public understand our \ndemocracy, history, and culture. Our country will be better off for \nhaving an\n\n[[Page S8392]]\n\nimproved, more complete understanding of American Presidents and their \nlegacies.\n  I would like to especially thank the Woodrow Wilson Presidential \nLibrary Foundation for its efforts to bring this issue to Congress' \nattention. For the last seventy years, the Woodrow Wilson Presidential \nLibrary Foundation in Staunton, Virginia has admirably served as \ncaretaker of President Woodrow Wilson's papers and artifacts, \ndedicating itself to the preservation of Wilson's legacy. But it has \ndone so without the resources afforded to other presidential libraries \nin the Federal system.\n  This legislation, if enacted, will help the Woodrow Wilson \nPresidential Library Foundation, and other non-profit entities like it, \npreserve and make available to the public the historical records and \ndocuments of American Presidents. The Woodrow Wilson Presidential \nLibrary serves as the center for education and study of Woodrow \nWilson's life and legacies, and the passage of this legislation will \nenable people from this country and abroad to learn more about the life \nand work of our nation's 28th President.\n  I would also like to thank the Archivist of the United States, Dr. \nAllen Weinstein, and his staff for their dedication and service to our \nnation. Their efforts in assisting Senator Warner and me as we crafted \nthis legislation represent the very best in good government and \ncommitment to serving the American public.\n  I am hopeful that the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs will consider this legislation expeditiously and that we can \nenact it during the remainder of this congressional session.\n  I ask that my full statement be printed in the Record where the bill \nappears. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 3478. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives for the production of energy, to provide transportation and \ndomestic fuel security, and to provide incentives for energy \nconservation and energy efficiency, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, I join with my colleague Chuck \nGrassley, the Finance Committee's ranking Republican member, to \nintroduce the Energy Independence and Innovation Act of 2008.\n  This bill will create jobs. It will help consumers with high energy \ncosts. It will contribute to energy security. It will help secure \nAmerica's place as a world leader in clean energy technology. It will \nhelp to prepare this country to address global warming.\n  For more than a year, we have been trying to pass meaningful energy \ntax legislation.\n  In June of last year, the Finance Committee passed a roughly $30 \nbillion energy-tax package. It received a resounding bipartisan \ncommittee vote. The bill proposed the largest-ever series of clean \nenergy tax incentives. It was largely offset with reductions in tax \nbreaks for oil and gas companies.\n  That package's clean energy incentives included a long-term extension \nof tax credits for wind and solar power, long-term extensions of \ncredits for building efficiency, and extensions and modifications of \ncredits for clean coal technology.\n  The June 2007 bill also included innovative new items. It included a \ncredit for consumers for plug-in hybrids. It included a new credit to \npromote capture and storage of carbon dioxide. And it included \nincentives to transform our electricity grid, so that far-flung sources \nof renewable power--like wind and solar--can be brought to market.\n  But many on the other side objected to the bill, because it included \nreductions in oil and gas tax breaks. We needed 60 votes to pass the \nSenate. But our bill got 57, and died on the floor.\n  We tried again in December of last year. We scaled back our oil and \ngas offsets. And we wrote a smaller, roughly $20 billion package of \nclean-energy incentives.\n  But Senators--again, generally from the other side of the aisle--\ncontinued to object to provisions cutting tax breaks for oil and gas \ncompanies. That bill failed as well, by just one vote.\n  In response to those concerns, this year, I wrote an energy tax \npackage without oil and gas offsets. That bill, S. 3335, was paid for \nby closing tax loopholes and by delaying a tax benefit for \nmultinational corporations that has yet to take effect.\n  That bill included about $18 billion in energy-tax provisions, \nincluding scaled-down versions of the original Finance Committee bill. \nThis ``extenders'' bill also included billions in non-energy extenders. \nThese tax incentives are vital to supporting a range of activities, \nfrom research and development to higher education.\n  Unfortunately, S. 3335 has been objected to, as well. It has not \ncleared the Senate.\n  But now energy prices are sky-high. And we have learned that many \nSenators from the other side of the aisle have come to agree that it \nmakes sense to scale back oil and gas tax breaks.\n  Accordingly, Senator Grassley and I have worked together to rewrite \nour original Finance Committee product. And that is largely what is \nrepresented in the bill that we are introducing today.\n  Our bill invests about $26 billion in renewable energy. It pays for \nit largely by repealing tax breaks for oil and gas firms. These are \nlargely the same tax offsets that we included in our original bill. For \nexample, the bill would deny a tax benefit that was enacted in 2004, \nwhen oil traded at about $50 per barrel.\n  Oil trades at more than $100 per barrel now. Recently it reached \nnearly $150 per barrel. I am pleased that my colleagues have come to \nagree that with energy prices this high, these oil and gas tax \nincentives are not needed.\n  What do we get for repealing those oil and gas tax breaks? We get \nlong-term extensions of vital clean energy incentives, like the credit \nfor wind and solar electricity. With passage of tax credits for wind \npower in 2005 and 2006, the American wind energy industry has installed \ncapacity in the last 2 years that equals the capacity it installed in \nthe last 2\\1/2\\ decades.\n  The solar industry is also booming. It accounts for a growing number \nof high-paying jobs in America's clean tech sector. This bill includes \nan 8-year extension of the credit for solar power. And that extension \nwill fuel this already impressive job growth.\n  Let's consider what happens if we do not extend these credits. \nAccording to a February 2008 study, failure to extend the wind and \nsolar credits would result in the loss of 114,000 jobs. Renewable \nenergy is simply not yet cost-competitive with fossil-based power. It \nneeds the incentives in this bill.\n  Absent broader mandates on renewable power, we need to continue tax \nsupport for renewable electricity production. With those tax \nincentives, the private sector will continue to invest in this worthy \ncause.\n  This bill also contains many other important provisions. It contains \nextensions of efficiency incentives for buildings, which account for \nabout 40 percent of American energy use. It contains the new plug-in \nhybrid credit for consumers, at a higher level than last year's bill--\nup to $7,500. As did last year's package, the bill we introduce today \nincludes a provision to promote what folks call ``smart meters,'' which \nprovide real-time feedback on electricity usage. These smart meters \nhave been shown to cut consumer energy costs and carbon emissions, as \nwell.\n  Finally, the bill includes a new production credit for carbon \ndioxide, providing an incentive for capturing and storing harmful \ncarbon dioxide. This provision was also part of last year's Finance \nCommittee bill. I am pleased that it is part of this bill as well.\n  This bill does not do everything that I want. If I had my druthers, \nwe would extend and possibly modify--many of these credits for a longer \nperiod. And the bill includes some items that I am not overly thrilled \nabout. But those compromises are part of the legislative process. That \nprocess will continue after today's introduction.\n  Meanwhile, I am again pleased that consensus may well be building to \nredirect tax incentives and invest in the clean technology this country \ndesperately needs.\n  For the sake of American jobs, for the sake of our Nation's security, \nand for the sake of our planet's environment, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S8393]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3478\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the National and Community Service Act of \n1990 to establish a Semester of Service grant program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Semester of Service \nAct--a bill which would offer young people the opportunity to spend a \nsemester serving their communities during their junior or senior year \nof high school. I want to thank Senators Cochran and Kennedy for \njoining me in introducing this legislation.\n  Throughout the U.S., there are mounting problems and unmet needs.\n  We have millions of families losing their homes. We have 14 million \nchildren that have no supervised place to go after school. We have a \nhealth care system that is barely able to hold itself together. And we \nhave veterans and seniors who have given so much to our country unable \nto get the treatment they were promised and retire with the dignity \nthey have earned.\n  We can debate how best to solve these problems and others. Some \nsuggest the market can do the job. Others believe the government has an \nappropriate role to play.\n  But one thing upon which we can all agree is that when we provide \nservice to our communities, we can tackle so many of our toughest \nchallenges. Service that draws upon our collective imaginations, ideas, \nand resolve. No one is better equipped to take part in that effort, Mr. \nPresident, than our Nation's young people.\n\n[[Page S8415]]\n\n  As the father of two young daughters, every day I bear witness to the \nenergy, enthusiasm and imagination children bring to every single thing \nthey do. And if the online communities of today teach us anything, it \nis that young people yearn for shared experiences--for experiences that \ntake them out of their comfort zones to introduce them to new people, \nput them in new situations and teach them things they might never \notherwise learn.\n  As a young man serving in the Peace Corps, I learned for myself how \nmuch we can grow and learn and, more importantly, the difference we can \nmake when we serve. Today, what children need from us is the impetus \nand leadership to redirect that boundless energy of theirs toward the \nbetterment of our communities. Unlocking the remarkable potential in \nour young people is what this legislation is all about.\n  With a semester of service, they can help tutor elementary-school \nstudents. They can assist those living in our veterans' hospitals or in \nhospice. Or they can help clean up neighborhoods and the environment. \nThose are just a few of the opportunities the Semester of Service Act \noffers. The difference service makes to our younger generation is as \nclear as the need for it.\n  We talk so much about ways to improve academic performance in our \nschools. Well, when community service is integrated into our students' \ncurricula at school, we know that young people make gains on \nachievement tests. Service-learning results in grade point averages \ngoing up and more positive feelings about high school.\n  The benefits of service-learning go well beyond the classroom. When \nyoung people participate in community service activities they feel \nbetter able to control their own lives in a positive way. They are less \nprone to engage in risky behavior, more likely to engage in their own \neducation, and far more aware of the career opportunities before them.\n  Indeed, research shows that for every dollar we spend on a service-\nlearning project, $4 worth of service is provided to the community \ninvolved. That means by authorizing $200 million for fiscal year 2009, \nas this legislation does, our country will save more than half a \nbillion dollars in service performed.\n  This legislation works by creating a competitive grant program that \nprovides school districts, or nonprofits working in partnership with \nlocal school districts, the opportunity to have students participate in \na semester of service in their junior or senior year for academic \ncredit. These students are required to perform a minimum of 70 hours of \nservice learning activities over 12 weeks, with at least 24 of those \nhours spent participating in field-based activities--outside of the \nclassroom.\n  By engaging both the public and private sector, Semester of Service \nteaches civic participation skills and helps young people see \nthemselves not merely as residents in their communities--but resources \nto them.\n  Ultimately, that is what this legislation is about. As with our \nlegislation to strengthen and expand AmeriCorps and increase senior \ninvolvement in national service, this bill is about maximizing our \nresources. It's about increasing participation, engaging our young \npeople, and lifting up our communities. That is why communities from \nall across this Nation have endorsed this Semester of Service \nlegislation.\n  If we ask all Americans to take responsibility for the future of our \ncountry as we do with this legislation, I believe our best days can be \nahead of us--not in the memories of the past, but in the world of our \nchildren. We can move forward as a Nation, lead the world and create a \nbetter, brighter tomorrow for all of us.\n  Let us start that journey today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 3480. A bill to amend the National and Community Service Act of \n1990 to establish Encore Service Programs, Encore Fellowship Programs, \nand Silver Scholarship Programs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Encore Service Act \nof 2008--legislation which would offer Americans 55 years of age and \nolder the chance to serve their communities and use their expertise and \nlife lessons to give back to the country that has given them so much. I \nwant to thank Senators Cochran and Kennedy for joining me in \nintroducing this legislation.\n  As we have discussed time and time again, the challenges facing \nAmerica are mounting--from an aging population to a broken health care \nsystem to challenges in our schools that put our children's futures at \nrisk.\n  These are problems that countless Americans have lived and struggled \nwith--that we here in this institution have debated for years, decades \neven. We can disagree amongst ourselves about how to solve them--and we \ncertainly have. But what we can all agree on is the impact citizens can \nmake when it comes to facing some of our biggest challenges.\n  We know the extraordinary things ordinary citizens can accomplish for \nour communities when given the opportunity--the difference they can \nmake in our schools and nursing homes, in veterans' hospitals and in \nhelping those living on fixed incomes.\n  We know the character of our people in our darkest moments. Indeed, \nwhile September 11 may have showed us that our world had changed--it \nwas September 12 that reminded us: Americans had not. The community \nblood drives, the heroic work of our Nation's firefighters, the floods \nof donations--all were a powerful reminder that Americans are always \nready to give back when their country calls.\n  I will never forget the Mayor of Pass Christian Mississippi telling \nme about an elderly Connecticut couple who drove all the way to the \nGulf Coast in the wake of Katrina for no other reason than to help \ntheir fellow countrymen and women. Contrary to what some suggest, I \nbelieve the American people are starved for opportunities to serve--and \nstand at the ready not just in times of crisis, but every day. \nAmericans are simply waiting to be asked. I am introducing this \nlegislation today because, it is time they were.\n  The truth is, no one is more ready or more poised to make a \ndifference--in our communities and throughout our country--than older \nAmericans.\n  We have all heard about the aging Baby Boomer generation--in the next \ndecade alone, the number of Americans 55 years and older is expected to \ngrow by another 22 percent. But for all the well-publicized challenges \nthat growth presents, it's time we also recognize something else: The \nopportunities it offers--if we seize them.\n  Studies tell us that more than half of those considered a part of the \nBaby Boomer generation are interested in providing meaningful service \nto their communities. Countless older men and women who have given so \nmuch to their country throughout their lives want to continue to serve \ntheir communities as they enter their later years.\n  Why wouldn't they? After a lifetime of hard work, raising a family, \nand paying taxes, Americans look forward to retirement--to enjoying \ntheir golden years with the security and dignity they have earned. They \nare living longer, healthier lives than any generation in history. And \nthey recognize something elemental:\n  Life doesn't end at retirement. For many, it is only beginning--\nleading perhaps to a second career in the public or nonprofit sector. \nThere can be no greater gift passed on to future generations than the \nlessons of the past. But the truth is, we too often fail to draw upon \nthe experience, knowledge and ideas of previous generations. What is \nmissing is the opportunity.\n  Providing older Americans those opportunities is what the Encore \nService Act is all about. It creates an Encore Service Program that \nprovides Americans 55 years and older with opportunities to serve \ncommunities with the greatest need--to volunteer in our Nation's \nschools, to help keep our neighborhoods clean, safe and vibrant, and so \nmuch more. In return for their service, which may include extensive \ntraining and a significant commitment of time, they can receive a \nstipend and education award, much like AmeriCorps does for younger \ngenerations.\n  Best of all, that stipend can be transferred to children or \ngrandchildren. Imagine what that means for a grandmother or a \ngrandfather who could literally put thousands of dollars into their \nnewborn grandchild's college savings fund as a result of this program--\nfunds that can only be used after the\n\n[[Page S8416]]\n\nchild turns 18 and can be kept for up to 20 years. Of all the new ideas \nin this legislation, perhaps this one is the most exciting.\n  This legislation also creates an Encore Fellows program that places \nolder Americans in one-year management or leadership positions in \npublic or private not-for-profits. These year-long fellowships not only \nincrease the capacity of public service organizations already doing \ntremendous work in our communities, they also promote those who have \nalready had full, successful careers, perhaps in the private sector, to \nlend their expertise and experience to the cause of community or public \nservice.\n  The Encore Service Act also creates a Silver Scholars program that \nawards older Americans with an education scholarship of up to $1,000 in \nexchange for volunteering with public agencies or private nonprofits \nbetween 250 and 500 hours a year. As with the Encore Service Program, \nthey can use these awards for themselves or transfer them to children, \ngrandchildren or other qualified designees.\n  Lastly, this legislation expands the capacity and builds on the \nsuccess of current Senior Programs by raising the authorization funding \nlevels for the Foster Grandparent, Senior Corps and RSVP programs. We \nall know that seniors and these programs have already made a remarkable \ndifference in our communities. That is why our legislation raises \nprogram eligibility levels from 125 to 200 percent above poverty and \nensures that all programs will be open to any individual 55 years and \nolder.\n  The Encore Service Act authorizes $326.7 million in new funding for \nfiscal year 2009, and such sums as necessary for subsequent years. \nUltimately, this bill is about unlocking the remarkable potential in \nolder Americans. It is about creating ample opportunities for them to \nuse their skills and talents to give back to their communities--to \nelementary schools, retirement homes, soup kitchens operating out of \nlocal churches, libraries, and other centers of our communities.\n  It is about harnessing the power of experience. We all know that when \ncalled upon, every generation of Americans has risen to the challenge, \noften beating great odds to pass on a stronger, safer, more prosperous \nworld to its children and grandchildren.\n  Americans are ready once again for leadership that marshals the same \nunity, purpose and generosity that so defined our country in the wake \nof 9/11, and has so defined our Nation so many times before. That is \nwhat the Encore Service Act of 2008 is about. I am honored to introduce \nit today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN:\n  S. 3482. A bill to designate a portion of the Rappahannock River in \nthe Commonwealth of Virginia as the ``John W. Warner Rapids''; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ndesignate a portion of the Rappahannock River in Virginia as the ``John \nW. Warner Rapids''.\n  These man-made rapids are a testament to Senator Warner's long-\nstanding commitment to protect and preserve the environment, as they \nare the remains of the Embrey Dam, whose removal he championed.\n  The Rappahannock River in Virginia flows over 180 miles from the Blue \nRidge Mountains to the Chesapeake Bay. At historic Fredericksburg, \nfounded in 1728 along the river's fall line, the Rappahannock was \nblocked by a wooden crib dam built in 1853 and a 22-foot high concrete \ndam built in 1910.\n  Until the 1960s, the dam was used to generate hydroelectric power, \nand until 2000 it was used to divert water into a canal as a raw water \nsource for the city. In the 1990s, the city began to develop a new \nregional water supply; and it was determined that the water facility \nconnected to the dam could be closed.\n  Funding to remove the dam was a significant hurdle. The City sought \nsupport from the Federal government and found a strong advocate in \nSenator John W. Warner. In the mid 1990s, the local river conservation \ngroup, Friends of the Rappahannock, invited Senator Warner to a \ndiscussion about the removal of the dam. After discussion and a paddle \nto the site, Senator Warner pledged that if the group could demonstrate \ncommunity consensus regarding the dam's removal, he would personally \nsupport the effort.\n  On February 23, 2004, on Senator Warner's signal, 600 pounds of \nexplosives set by the Army and Air Force Reserves opened a 130-foot \nbreach in Embrey Dam, setting the Rappahannock River to flow free for \nthe first time since 1853. By reopening the Rappahannock River, more \nthan 1,300 river and stream miles immediately became available to \nmigratory fish in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\n  On July 30, 2005, the Friends of the Rappahannock and the City of \nFredericksburg honored Senator Warner in a ``Rappahannock River Running \nFree'' celebration. The American Canoe Association, established in 1880 \nand the nation's oldest and largest canoe, kayak, and rafting \norganization, stated: ``For over 150 years the Rappahannock River has \nbeen holding its breath behind a wall of iron, concrete, and wood. U.S. \nSenator John W. Warner's efforts have allowed the Rappahannock River to \nbreathe free once again. In appreciation of his efforts, the community \nof paddlers and river users has bestowed upon him their highest honor. \nSo, let it be known, on behalf of the City of Fredericksburg, the \nFriends of the Rappahannock, the American Canoe Association, and the \ncommunity of paddlers, that the new rapids formed at the removal of the \ndam be known, now and forever, and recorded on all maps, as `John W. \nWarner Rapids' and may all your travels through be smooth.''\n  On 1 November 2008, Senator Warner will be presented with a bronze \nplaque that will be affixed to a permanent monument along the banks of \nthe Rappahannock River at the rapids formed by the remnants of the dam.\n  The actions that I have described are a shining example of the \ncommitment Senator Warner has shown to the environment during his 30 \nyears in this body. He recognizes the importance of protecting and \npreserving natural treasures for the enjoyment of this and future \ngenerations.\n  It has been a pleasure and a privilege to be able to work so closely \nwith him in this regard. For many years, Senator Warner and I have \nserved together on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks. At the start of this Congress, I became the chairman of that \ncommittee's global warming subcommittee. I was honored and delighted \nwhen Senator Warner became, at his request, the ranking minority member \nof that subcommittee. In February of last year, the two of us held a \nsubcommittee hearing on the impacts of global warming on wildlife. \nSenator Warner spoke with conviction and eloquence about his commitment \nto wildlife conservation, and about his particular love for rivers and \nstreams.\n  In an example of the courage and statesmanship for which he is \nrightly known, Senator Warner joined with me to write a bill to reduce \nthe man-made greenhouse-gas emissions that are disrupting wildlife, \nthreatening our national security, and imperiling our economy. Last \nOctober, we introduced our Climate Security Act, and the next month \nboth our subcommittee and the full Environment and Public Works \nCommittee reported the bill favorably. That had never happened before \nwith a climate bill in the U.S. Congress, and it would not have \nhappened without the leadership, credibility, patience, and wisdom of \nSenator Warner. I join many, many others in looking up to him, and I am \nprivileged to call him my friend.\n  The bill that I introduce today is a fitting tribute to the legacy \nthat Senator Warner leaves behind as he retires. I encourage my \ncolleagues to honor him by passing this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/11/senate-section/article/S8416-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8416-S8417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 655--TO IMPROVE CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT OF THE \n              INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Whitehouse) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues and all Americans in \nsolemn observance of the loss of 3,000 American lives on September 11, \n2001, truly the greatest tragedy on American soil in our recent \nhistory. Our thoughts and prayers are with these victims and their \nfamilies.\n  We all know that al-Qaida terrorists declared war on the United \nStates 7 years ago today. These vicious attacks claimed American lives \nand brought great concern and destruction across our country. While \nAmerica has remained safe from another attack on our soil since 9/11/\n2001, it is by no accident.\n  It is fitting that as we observe the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 \nal-Qaida attacks, al-Qaida has been dealt a significant defeat in Iraq, \nboth tactically and most certainly morally. It has been handed such a \ndefeat in what its own leaders claim was the central front in the war \nagainst the United States. This victory was achieved at the hands of \nour brave troops and the people of Iraq.\n  As the result of new leadership under General Petraeus, his \ncounterinsurgency strategy, and the surge, we are seeing our troops \ncome home on success, including my son Sam, a marine who served two \ntours in Iraq. I heard about the success from the troops on the ground \nin my visits to Iraq, and our military leaders testified about this \nsuccess before Congress, but now even the New York Times and Washington \nPost are writing about our return on success.\n  Look at some of the facts:\n  Anbar Province, once considered lost, has now been reclaimed by the \nIraqi people. Not just in Anbar, but across the country, the Iraqis are \nleading operations to seek out al-Qaida--from Mosul to the Diyala \nProvince. Across Iraq, violence is at its lowest point since the spring \nof 2004, and civilian deaths, sectarian killings, and suicide bombings \nare all down. For the Iraqi people, life is returning to normal. \nMarkets are open and thriving, students are going to school--including \ngirls, for the first time--and professionals are returning to work in \nIraq. This win in Iraq is not only critical to the Middle East, but it \nis critical to our own Nation's security.\n  Defeat in Iraq would have given the terrorists who launched the 9/11 \nattacks a safe haven to exploit terror worldwide. It is fitting that on \nthis day we honor the memory of the victims of 9/11 and their families, \nthat we take a moment to thank our troops fighting the al-Qaida \nterrorists in Iraq.\n  Our troops fought in Iraq so that future generations of Americans \nwill not have to fight them on our own soil. I am proud of these brave \nmen and women who sacrificed so much in defense of freedom and security \nhere at home. We owe them a debt that can never be repaid.\n  Our troops are also fighting the terrorists in Afghanistan. Troop \nincreases are now making a difference. But it will also take smart \npower, a careful blend of kinetic and nonkinetic power of the United \nStates and its allies to defeat the terrorists in Afghanistan and \nelsewhere; efforts to build institutions in education, rule of law, \ninfrastructure development, roads and power; efforts such as our \nMissouri National Guards's agriculture development teams. These teams \nare training the Afghanis in sustainable agriculture methods and \ntechniques that will help them build a more secure and stable society.\n  It is critical that Pakistan continue to partner with the United \nStates in defeating the terrorists who plague Afghanistan. The Taliban \nand other terror fighters hide in Pakistan's remote borders. We all \nhope that the country's newly elected democratic leaders will seek out \nand destroy these terrorists, not only for the security of their \ncountry but to prevent the terrorists from gaining a haven to plot and \ncarry out attacks on America and our allies.\n  As we thank our troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, killing the \nterrorists before they can attack the homeland, we also thank the many \npatriots who fight unseen and unheard to keep our Nation safe. As the \nvice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I know all too well \nthe dangers facing us.\n  I also know that in addition to our troops, our intelligence \noperators are on the front lines of the war on terror. Our intelligence \nofficers and law enforcement efforts work tirelessly to stop attacks \nbefore they happen. We all owe the brave Americans who work to keep us \nsafe, and the firefighters and first responders who come to our aid \nwhen disaster strikes.\n  In Congress, it is our job to ensure the intelligence community has \nthe tools it needs to detect, disrupt, and prevent attacks on America, \nour troops, and our allies, which is why it is important that here in \nCongress we never forget the critical lessons of September 11--that our \nintelligence proved inadequate to stop the mass murder of innocent \nAmericans on our own soil.\n  As we honor these lives lost, we must continue to work to improve our \nintelligence capabilities to keep a similar tragedy from ever happening \nagain. Since 9/11 we have strived to strengthen our intelligence. My \nproudest accomplishment in 22 years in the Senate was the passage of \nthe bipartisan Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--our Nation's \nearly warning system to alert us of attacks. It was a long fight, but \nwe now have a terrorist surveillance law that allows our intelligence \noperators to listen in on foreign terrorists.\n  We have also made other important changes in our laws and priorities \nrelated to the threat of international terrorism, such as the USA \nPATRIOT Act, intelligence reform measures, and implementing \nrecommendations of the\n9/11 Commission Act. But Congress has not done enough.\n  On the seventh anniversary of 9/11, it is noteworthy that there \nremains one unaddressed 9/11 commission recommendation, and that is to \nreform the legislative branch's oversight of intelligence and terrorism \nactivities which the commission rightly described as ``dysfunctional.''\n  The 9/11 Commission stated:\n\n       Of all of our recommendations, strengthening congressional \n     oversight may be among the most difficult and important.\n\n  Yet here we are 7 years after 9/11 and 4 years past the issuance of \nthe 9/11 commission report, and that most significant recommendation \nfor change remains unaddressed. The Senate tinkered around the edges by \nadding term\n\n[[Page S8419]]\n\nlimits for Intelligence Committee members, but it has not addressed the \nfundamental structural dysfunction regarding the fiscal oversight of \nthe intelligence.\n  The 9/11 commission made two bold recommendations to fix the problem: \neither consolidate authorization and appropriation functions into a \nsingle committee in both Houses or create a bicameral intelligence \ncommittee. Both of these approaches were considered and rejected by the \nSenate during consideration of S. Res. 445 in October of 2004. But many \nof us believe there is a better, less disruptive way to achieve reform \nthrough a carefully constructive intelligence appropriations \nsubcommittee.\n  This approach was endorsed earlier this year by all but 1 of 15 \nmembers of the Intelligence Committee in a letter sent to the majority \nand minority leaders along with an endorsement from the chairman and \nranking member of the Homeland and Government Affairs Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record at \nthis time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                             Select Committee on Intelligence,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: This letter sets \n     forth our recommendations for change within the Senate to \n     improve congressional oversight for intelligence. Section 603 \n     of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission \n     Act (Public Law 110-53) required the Senate Select Committee \n     on Intelligence (SSCI) and the Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) to undertake a review \n     of the 9/11 Commission's Final Report with regard to \n     intelligence reform and congressional intelligence oversight \n     reform. It also required the Committees to submit to the \n     Senate recommendations for reform of congressional oversight \n     of intelligence. The recommendations in this letter match \n     those proposed to you in a letter sent by the Chairman and \n     Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental \n     Affairs Committee.\n       On November 13, 2007, the SSCI conducted a public hearing \n     to receive testimony from members of the 9/11 Commission, as \n     well as from experts from the Library of Congress and the \n     private sector. On February 27, 2008, the SSCI met to \n     formulate conclusions on the matter. The Committee concluded \n     that the Senate should enact either one of two options to \n     implement the necessary changes embodied by the comments and \n     recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n       The first option is to implement the 9/11 Commission \n     recommendation with regard to fiscal oversight of \n     intelligence by consolidating authorization and \n     appropriations authority in the SSCI. This option would \n     implement directly the 9/11 Commission recommendation. We \n     understand that this approach was considered and rejected by \n     the Senate during consideration of S. Res. 445 in October \n     2004. We note, however, that Senators Burr, Bayh, Feingold, \n     Hagel, McCain, Snowe and Sununu have reintroduced this \n     measure in the 110th Congress with S. Res. 375.\n       The second option embodies the spirit of the 9/11 \n     Commission recommendation yet poses less structural change to \n     the Senate and could be accomplished during this Congress \n     simply by amending and implementing part of S. Res. 445. \n     Section 402 of S. Res. 445 called for the creation of a \n     Subcommittee on Intelligence within the Appropriations \n     Committee. To date, this subcommittee has not been created. \n     We recommend, as the second option, to amend and implement \n     Section 402 of S. Res. 445 with the following necessary \n     changes:\n       The Subcommittee on Intelligence shall be an additional \n     appropriations subcommittee and therefore require no \n     reorganization of the Appropriations Committee.\n       The Subcommittee on Intelligence shall appropriate all \n     funds for the National Intelligence Program (NIP) (as opposed \n     to the current situation where appropriations for the NIP are \n     fragmented among several subcommittees within the \n     Appropriations Committee).\n       There will be a mechanism allowing for the allocation of \n     the intelligence budget to the Subcommittee through the \n     congressional budget process.\n       The annual appropriations bill for the NIP reported by the \n     Subcommittee on Intelligence shall pass from the Subcommittee \n     to the full Appropriations Committee without intervening \n     review by any other subcommittee; it shall then be reported \n     to the Senate like any other appropriations measure.\n       Appropriations Committee members who are members of the \n     SSCI shall have automatic membership on the Subcommittee on \n     Intelligence as shall the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \n     Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations.\n       The Chairman and Ranking member of the Subcommittee on \n     Intelligence shall be selected from among those members who \n     are both Appropriations Committee and SSCI members.\n       Assignment to and role on the Subcommittee on Intelligence \n     shall not count against other subcommittee roles and \n     assignments of any member of the Appropriations Committee.\n       The Chairman and Ranking member of the Subcommittee on \n     Intelligence of the Appropriations Committee shall select, \n     designate or hire staff with appropriate clearances for the \n     Subcommittee on Intelligence.\n       If either, or both, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the \n     SSCI are not appropriations cross-over members to the SSCI, \n     then either, or both, shall serve as ex officio members of \n     the Subcommittee on Intelligence.\n       The effective date of these changes shall be the date upon \n     which the Senate adopts these amendments to S. Res. 445.\n       The Senate has already voted overwhelmingly to create a \n     Subcommittee on Intelligence of the Appropriations Committee. \n     We believe constituting this subcommittee with the necessary \n     stipulations above will provide the closest approximation to \n     the 9/11 Commission recommendation for consolidation and \n     consistency of oversight, while at the same time imposing the \n     least alteration to Senate organization and tradition. After \n     consulting with you on these options we plan to sponsor the \n     appropriate Senate resolution to address this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n         John D. Rockefeller IV, Chairman; Christopher S. Bond, \n           Vice Chairman; Dianne Feinstein; John Warner; Ron \n           Wyden; Chuck Hagel; Evan Bayh; Saxby Chambliss; Barbara \n           A. Mikulski; Orrin Hatch; Olympia J. Snowe; Bill \n           Nelson; Richard Burr; Sheldon Whitehouse.\n\n  Mr. BOND. This approach embodies the spirit of the 9/11 commission \nrecommendation, yet poses less structural change to the Senate and \ncould be accomplished easily during this Congress simply by creating a \ncarefully designed subcommittee on intelligence within the \nAppropriations Committee. The necessary parameters of this new \ncommittee are contained in the Senate resolution that I will submit \nmomentarily. We believe these stipulations in this resolution would \neffect the change sought by the 9/11 commission and enable us to bring \nintelligence spending under effective oversight.\n  Now, some of my colleagues may ask themselves why I decided to file \nthis Senate resolution today. The answer is simple. Here we are on the \nseventh anniversary of the 9/11 attacks and more than 4 years after the \n9/11 commission's final report was issued, and we still haven't \naddressed the recommendation that they considered most important. \nFurthermore, I have tried to work within the system for 5 years now to \nbring about adequate change to no avail.\n  I believe we should no longer delay the implementation of this \ncrucial recommendation. Congress has insisted that others reform, but \nwe have not yet adopted any meaningful reform ourselves. The hypocrisy \nhas not gone unnoticed by members of the 9/11 commission or by the \nfamilies of the victims whom we honor today. The time has come for us \nto put our House in order, and I believe a carefully designed \nappropriations subcommittee on intelligence is the proper way to \nimplement the spirit of the 9/11 congressional oversight \nrecommendations.\n  I am concerned about wasteful spending, not just in the billions of \ndollars, but in the dozens of billions of dollars, that the public does \nnot know about because it is all classified. I am concerned about \ntechnology programs that consume billions of dollars for a number of \nyears and never get off the ground. Our current Director of National \nIntelligence boasted publicly about killing one such program early last \nyear. But that was a program that our defense and intelligence leaders \ntrumpeted for years as a silver bullet before finally throwing in the \ntowel because it did not work. The intelligence acquisition system is \nhard to change, and the DNI and the intelligence community need \nCongress's oversight and accountability.\n  As for Congress, when the Intelligence Committee looks at an issue of \ngreat import for several years, and when the Armed Services Committee \ndoes the same and agrees in its assessment, yet the appropriations \nprocess is so disconnected from them that billions of dollars come to \nnaught because the executive branch is not having its feet held to the \nfire, then the American taxpayers are ill served, and billions of\n\n[[Page S8420]]\n\ndollars that could have been used elsewhere are wasted.\n  Another example of disjointed oversight happened again yesterday in \nthe Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee markup. After years of \nbillions of dollars having been wasted by the intelligence community \nand the National Reconnaissance Office I proposed a much cheaper, \nmultifunctional approach to sustain our satellite constellation.\n  This approach is advocated by outside experts and scientists and \nofficials within the intelligence agencies. It also was adopted 2 years \nin a row by the Intelligence Committee and by the Armed Services \nCommittee in its bill that is on the floor before us today.\n  Yet, in the Defense Appropriations markup yesterday, even though \nmultiple Senators who have been studying this issue on other committees \nfor years spoke in strong support of it, the old system kicked in and \nthe measure was shut out; that is a structural deficiency the 9/11 \nCommission pointed out.\n  In a classified session I can give examples upon examples from other \nservices.\n  Those who have the time and mandate to study the issue extensively \nneed to be the ones whose discernment is brought to bear on those \nmatters--this is case in point of what the 9/11 Commission said must \nhappen in this specific area of national security, with intelligence. \nIt is in this one area, in our front line of defense against terror, \nwhere this has to take place.\n  Having tried to work within the system and failed, I cannot remain \nsilent about this sort of thing any longer.\n  We hear a lot today about needed change and reform coming to \nWashington. Let us prove to the American people that we do not need to \nwait for an election to start that process.\n  At this point, lest anyone get the wrong idea about the problems I am \naddressing here, I must say something about the leadership of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee. The American people all know about \nour war hero from the Senate, John McCain, who is running for \nPresident, but I want to draw attention to another one of our war \nheroes who served 2 wars before Senator McCain did in Vietnam, and that \nis Senator Dan Inouye from Hawaii, chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee.\n\n  Senator Inouye is a true American hero whom I have the utmost \nadmiration for, and I greatly commend him for the manner in which he \nhas led, and is leading, the Defense Subcommittee. He ensures that \nAmerica's priorities on defense are put in the right place.\n  I also commend my good friend Senator Stevens, another true American \npatriot and veteran. His leadership has been invaluable on this \nsubcommittee for over two decades. And I commend my good friend Senator \nCochran also, who has recently been sitting in for Senator Stevens as \nranking member on the subcommittee and has always listened patiently to \nmy concerns over the years.\n  I cannot say enough about these three men who are true leaders; they \nhave acted with wisdom and discernment in how they have led the \nsubcommittee. They are good friends, they are esteemed colleagues, and \nI am honored to serve under their leadership. So let me make it very \nclear, that the problem I am addressing today is not the people; these \nmen lead with dignity and discernment in putting together the most \ncomplicated funding bill in the Congress.\n  The problem rather that I am addressing is structure. With a nearly \n$500 billion Defense appropriations bill, of which less than 10 percent \nis for intelligence, and with only a handful of committee staff on hand \nto look at intelligence matters and barely enough time for just a few \nhearings on intelligence squeezed between all the defense hearings and \nbriefings throughout the year, there is simply no way they can pay \nadequate attention to intelligence, it is just not possible.\n  They are rightly consumed with the other 90 percent of their budget \nthat focuses on defense matters. On the Intelligence Committee, \nhowever, we spend several days each week poring over intelligence \nmatters and receiving briefs on all aspects of the intelligence \ncommunity, and with a cadre of 50 professional staff at our disposal we \nare able to dig real deep into a number of disciplines.\n  We know that change is needed, and I appreciate the leadership that \nChairman Rockefeller and the rest of my colleagues on the Intelligence \nCommittee have shown on this issue. I am also grateful for the support \nexpressed by other Members of the Senate who recognize the importance \nof this issue to our esteemed body.\n  I recognize that we are quickly running short on legislative days to \nget this done. However, I would ask my colleagues to give serious \nconsideration to this Senate resolution. I stand ready to discuss its \ndetails and debate its merits. If we are not able to act in this \nCongress, then I expect to address this issue again first thing in the \nnew Congress.\n  As we reflect on the horrible events of the September 11 terrorist \nattacks, I suggest to my colleagues that we all ask ourselves whether \nwe can do more to improve congressional oversight of intelligence. I \nthink we would all agree that the answer to that question must be an \nemphatic ``yes.''\n  If we agree that we can do more, then why don't we?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/11/senate-section/article/S8420-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8420-S8421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5446.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Wartime Treatment Study \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 1702. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States Government \n     deemed as ``enemy aliens'' more than 600,000 Italian-born and \n     300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and their \n     families and required them to carry Certificates of \n     Identification and limited their travel and personal property \n     rights. At that time, these groups were the 2 largest \n     foreign-born groups in the United States.\n       (2) During World War II, the United States Government \n     arrested, interned, or otherwise detained thousands of \n     European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after \n     cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, \n     exchanged, or deported European Americans, including \n     American-born children, to European Axis nations, many to be \n     exchanged for Americans held in those nations.\n       (3) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States \n     with Latin American nations, many European Latin Americans, \n     including German and Austrian Jews, were arrested, brought to \n     the United States, and interned. Many were later expatriated, \n     repatriated, or deported to European Axis nations during \n     World War II, many to be exchanged for Americans and Latin \n     Americans held in those nations.\n       (4) Millions of European Americans served in the armed \n     forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the \n     United States.\n       (5) The wartime policies of the United States Government \n     were devastating to the Italian American and German American \n     communities, individuals, and their families. The detrimental \n     effects are still being experienced.\n       (6) Prior to and during World War II, the United States \n     restricted the entry of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \n     persecution or genocide and sought safety in the United \n     States. During the 1930's and 1940's, the quota system, \n     immigration regulations, visa requirements, and the time \n     required to process visa applications affected the number of \n     Jewish refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, \n     who could gain admittance to the United States.\n       (7) The United States Government should conduct an \n     independent review to fully assess and acknowledge these \n     actions. Congress has previously reviewed the United States \n     Government's wartime treatment of Japanese Americans through \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians. An independent review of the treatment of German \n     Americans and Italian Americans and of Jewish refugees \n     fleeing persecution and genocide has not yet been undertaken.\n       (8) Time is of the essence for the establishment of \n     commissions, because of the increasing danger of destruction \n     and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential \n     witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those \n     affected by the United States Government's policies. Many who \n     suffered have already passed away and will never know of this \n     effort.\n\n     SEC. 1703.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Free Speech Protection Act \n     of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The freedom of speech and the press is enshrined in the \n     first amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (2) Free speech, the free exchange of information, and the \n     free expression of ideas and opinions are essential to the \n     functioning of representative democracy in the United States.\n       (3) The free expression and publication by journalists, \n     academics, commentators, experts, and others of the \n     information they uncover and develop through research and \n     study is essential to the formation of sound public policy \n     and thus to the security of the people of the United States.\n       (4) The first amendment jurisprudence of the Supreme Court \n     of the United States, articulated in such precedents as New \n     York Times v. Sullivan (376 U.S. 254 (1964)), and its \n     progeny, reflects the fundamental value that the people of \n     the United States place on promoting the free exchange of \n     ideas and information, requiring in cases involving public \n     figures a demonstration of actual malice, that is, that \n     allegedly defamatory, libelous, or slanderous statements \n     about public figures are not merely false but made with \n     knowledge of that falsity or with reckless disregard of their \n     truth or falsity.\n       (5) Some persons are obstructing the free expression rights \n     of United States persons, and the vital interest of the \n     people of the United States in receiving information on \n     matters of public importance, by first seeking out foreign \n     jurisdictions that do not provide the full extent of free-\n     speech protection that is fundamental in the United States \n     and then suing United States persons in such jurisdictions in \n     defamation actions based on speech uttered or published in \n     the United States, speech that is fully protected under first \n     amendment jurisprudence in the United States and the laws of \n     the several States and the District of Columbia.\n       (6) Some of these actions are intended not only to suppress \n     the free speech rights of journalists, academics, \n     commentators, experts, and other individuals but to \n     intimidate publishers and other organizations that might \n     otherwise disseminate or support the work of those \n     individuals with the threat of prohibitive foreign lawsuits, \n     litigation expenses, and judgments that provide for money \n     damages and other speech-suppressing relief.\n       (7) The governments and courts of some foreign countries \n     have failed to curtail this practice, permitting lawsuits \n     filed by persons who are often not citizens of those \n     countries, under circumstances where there is often little or \n     no basis for jurisdiction over the United States persons \n     against whom such suits are brought.\n       (8) Some of the plaintiffs bringing such suits are \n     intentionally and strategically refraining from filing their \n     suits in the United States, even though the speech at issue \n     was published in the United States, in order to avoid the \n     Supreme Court's first amendment jurisprudence and frustrate \n     the protections it affords United States persons.\n       (9) The United States persons against whom such suits are \n     brought must consequently endure the prohibitive expense, \n     inconvenience, and anxiety attendant to being sued in foreign \n     courts for conduct that is protected under the first \n     amendment, or decline to answer such suits and risk the entry \n     of costly default judgments that may be executed in countries \n     other than the United States where those individuals travel \n     or own property.\n       (10) Journalists, academics, commentators, experts, and \n     others subjected to such suits are suffering concrete and \n     profound financial and professional damage for engaging in \n     conduct that is protected under the Constitution of the \n     United States and essential to informing the people of the \n     United States, their representatives, and other policymakers.\n       (11) In turn, the people of the United States are suffering \n     concrete and profound harm because they, their \n     representatives, and other government policymakers rely on \n     the free expression of information, ideas, and opinions \n     developed by responsible journalists, academics, \n     commentators, experts, and others for the formulation of \n     sound public policy, including national security policy.\n       (12) The United States respects the sovereign right of \n     other countries to enact their own laws regarding speech, and \n     seeks only to protect the first amendment rights of the \n     people of the United States in connection with speech that \n     occurs, in whole or in part, in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 03. FEDERAL CAUSE OF ACTION.\n\n       (a) Cause of Action.--Any United States person against whom \n     a lawsuit is brought in a foreign country for defamation on \n     the basis of the content of any writing, utterance, or other \n     speech by that person that has been\n\n[[Page S8431]]\n\n     published, uttered, or otherwise disseminated in the United \n     States may bring an action in a United States district court \n     specified in subsection (f) against any person who, or entity \n     which, serves or causes to be served, in the United States, \n     any documents in connection with such foreign lawsuit, if the \n     writing, utterance, or other speech at issue in the foreign \n     lawsuit does not constitute defamation under United States \n     law.\n       (b) Jurisdiction.--It shall be sufficient to establish \n     jurisdiction over the person or entity serving or causing to \n     be served documents in connection with the foreign lawsuit \n     described in subsection (a) that--\n       (1) such person or entity has served or caused to be \n     served, any documents in connection with the foreign lawsuit \n     described in subsection (a) on a United States person in the \n     United States; and\n       (2) such United States person has assets in the United \n     States against which the claimant in the foreign lawsuit \n     could execute if a judgment in the foreign lawsuit were \n     awarded.\n       (c) Remedies.--\n       (1) Order to bar enforcement and other injunctive relief.--\n     In a cause of action described in subsection (a), if the \n     court determines that the applicable writing, utterance, or \n     other speech at issue in the underlying foreign lawsuit does \n     not constitute defamation under United States law, the court \n     shall order that any foreign judgment in the foreign lawsuit \n     in question may not be enforced in the United States, \n     including by any Federal, State, or local court, and may \n     order such other injunctive relief that the court considers \n     appropriate to protect the right to free speech under the \n     first amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (2) Damages.--In addition to the remedy under paragraph \n     (1), damages may be awarded to the United States person \n     bringing the action under subsection (a), based on the \n     following:\n       (A) The amount of any foreign judgment in the underlying \n     foreign lawsuit.\n       (B) The costs, including reasonable legal fees, \n     attributable to the underlying foreign lawsuit that have been \n     borne by the United States person.\n       (C) The harm caused to the United States person due to \n     decreased opportunities to publish, conduct research, or \n     generate funding.\n       (d) Treble Damages.--If, in an action brought under \n     subsection (a), the court or, if applicable, the jury \n     determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the person \n     or entity bringing the foreign lawsuit which gave rise to the \n     cause of action intentionally engaged in a scheme to suppress \n     rights under the first amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States by discouraging publishers or other media from \n     publishing, or discouraging employers, contractors, donors, \n     sponsors, or similar financial supporters from employing, \n     retaining, or supporting, the research, writing, or other \n     speech of a journalist, academic, commentator, expert, or \n     other individual, the court may award treble damages.\n       (e) Expedited Discovery.--Upon the filing of an action \n     under subsection (a), the court may order expedited discovery \n     if the court determines, based on the allegations in the \n     complaint, that the speech at issue in the underlying foreign \n     lawsuit is protected under the first amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States.\n       (f) Venue.--An action under subsection (a) may be brought \n     by a United States person only in a United States district \n     court in which the United States person is domiciled, does \n     business, or owns real property that could be executed \n     against in satisfaction of a judgment in the underlying \n     foreign lawsuit which gave rise to the action.\n       (g) Timing of Action; Statute of Limitations.--\n       (1) Timing.--An action under subsection (a) may be \n     commenced after the filing of the foreign lawsuit in a \n     foreign country on which the action is based.\n       (2) Statute of limitations.--For purposes of section \n     1658(a) of title 28, United States Code, the cause of action \n     under subsection (a) accrues on the first date on which \n     papers in connection with the foreign lawsuit described in \n     section (a), on which the cause of action is based, are \n     served on a United States person in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 04. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       This title applies with respect to any foreign lawsuit that \n     is described in section 3(a) in connection with papers that \n     were served before, on, or after the date of the enactment of \n     this title.\n\n     SEC. 05. CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this title limits the right of foreign litigants \n     who bring good faith defamation actions to prevail against \n     journalists, academics, commentators, and others who have \n     failed to adhere to standards of professionalism by \n     publishing false information maliciously or recklessly.\n\n     SEC. 06.

or\n       (B) 12 months after the Secretary of Commerce designates \n     the country as a Destination of Possible Diversion Concern \n     under subsection (a)(1), that the country has failed--\n       (i) to cooperate with the government-to-government \n     activities initiated by the United States under subsection \n     (a)(2); or\n       (ii) based on the criteria described in subsection (a)(1), \n     to adequately strengthen the export control systems of the \n     country.\n       (2) Licensing controls with respect to destinations of \n     diversion concern.--\n       (A) Report on suspect items.--\n       (i) In general.--Not later than 45 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce, in \n     consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, the \n     Secretary of State, and the Secretary of the Treasury, shall \n     submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     containing a list of items that, if the items were \n     transshipped, reexported, or diverted to Iran, could \n     contribute to--\n\n       (I) Iran obtaining nuclear, biological, or chemical \n     weapons, defense technologies, components for improvised \n     explosive devices, or other defense items;

GAO REVIEW OF ROLE OF IMPORTS IN DEFENSE \n                   INDUSTRIAL BASE.\n\n       (a) Review Required.--The Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall conduct a thorough review of the application of \n     provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 \n     U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.) and the Defense Production Act (50 \n     U.S.C.

Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Hagel) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 3001, to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal year 2009 for military activities of the \nDepartment of Defense, for military construction, and for defense \nactivities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. COUNTERTERRORISM STATUS REPORTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Success in Countering Al Qaeda Reporting Requirements Act \n     of 2008''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Al Qaeda and its related affiliates attacked the United \n     States on September 11, 2001 in New York, New York, \n     Arlington, Virginia, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, murdering \n     almost 3000 innocent civilians.\n       (2) Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri remain \n     at large.\n\n[[Page S8449]]\n\n       (3) In testimony to the Select Committee on Intelligence of \n     the Senate on February 5, 2008, Director of National \n     Intelligence J. Michael McConnell stated, ``Al-Qa'ida has \n     been able to retain a safehaven in Pakistan's Federally \n     Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) that provides the \n     organization many of the advantages it once derived from its \n     base across the border in Afghanistan''.\n       (4) The July 2007 National Intelligence Estimate states, \n     ``Al Qaeda is and will remain the most serious terrorist \n     threat to the Homeland''.\n       (5) In testimony to the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives on February 7, \n     2008, Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell \n     stated, ``Al-Qa'ida and its terrorist affiliates continue to \n     pose significant threats to the United States at home and \n     abroad, and al-Qa'ida's central leadership based in the \n     border area of Pakistan is its most dangerous component.''.\n       (6) The ``National Strategy for Combating Terrorism'', \n     issued in September 2006, affirmed that long-term efforts are \n     needed to win the battle of ideas against the root causes of \n     the violent extremist ideology that sustains Al Qaeda and its \n     affiliates. The United States has obligated resources to \n     support democratic reforms and human development to undercut \n     support for violent extremism, including in the Federally \n     Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan and the Sahel region of \n     Africa. However, 2 reports released by the Government \n     Accountability Office in 2008 (``Combating Terrorism: The \n     United States Lacks Comprehensive Plan to Destroy the \n     Terrorist Threat and Close the Safe Haven in Pakistan's \n     Federally Administered Tribal Areas'' (GAO-08-622, April 17, \n     2008) and ``Combating Terrorism: Actions Needed to Enhance \n     Implementation of Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership'' \n     (GAO-08-860, July 31, 2008)) found that ``no comprehensive \n     plan for meeting U.S. national security goals in the FATA \n     have been developed,'' and ``no comprehensive integrated \n     strategy has been developed to guide the [Sahel] program's \n     implementation''.\n       (7) Such efforts to combat violent extremism and radicalism \n     must be undertaken using all elements of national power, \n     including military tools, intelligence assets, law \n     enforcement resources, diplomacy, paramilitary activities, \n     financial measures, development assistance, strategic \n     communications, and public diplomacy.\n       (8) In the report entitled ``Suggested Areas for Oversight \n     for the 110th Congress'' (GAO-08-235R, November 17, 2006), \n     the Government Accountability Office urged greater \n     congressional oversight in assessing the effectiveness and \n     coordination of United States international programs focused \n     on combating and preventing the growth of terrorism and its \n     underlying causes.\n       (9) Section 140(a) of the Foreign Relations Authorization \n     Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (22 U.S.C. 2656f(a)) requires \n     that the Secretary of State submit annual reports to Congress \n     that detail key developments on terrorism on a country-by-\n     country basis. These Country Reports on Terrorism provide \n     information on acts of terrorism in countries, major \n     developments in bilateral and multilateral counterterrorism \n     cooperation, and the extent of state support for terrorist \n     groups responsible for the death, kidnaping, or injury of \n     Americans, but do not assess the scope and efficacy of United \n     States counterterrorism efforts against Al Qaeda and its \n     related affiliates.\n       (10) The Executive Branch submits regular reports to \n     Congress that detail the status of United States combat \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, including a breakdown of \n     budgetary allocations, key milestones achieved, and measures \n     of political, economic, and military progress.\n       (11) The Department of Defense compiles a report of the \n     monthly and cumulative incremental obligations incurred to \n     support the Global War on Terrorism in a monthly Supplemental \n     and Cost of War Execution Report.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) 7 years after the attacks on September 11, 2001, Al \n     Qaeda and its related affiliates remain the most serious \n     national security threat to the United States, with alarming \n     signs that Al Qaeda and its related affiliates recently \n     reconstituted their strength and ability to generate new \n     attacks throughout the world, including against the United \n     States;\n       (2) there remains insufficient information on current \n     counterterrorism efforts undertaken by the Federal Government \n     and the level of success achieved by specific initiatives;\n       (3) Congress and the American people can benefit from more \n     specific data and metrics that can provide the basis for \n     objective external assessments of the progress being made in \n     the overall war being waged against violent extremism;\n       (4) the absence of a comparable timely assessment of the \n     ongoing status and progress of United States counterterrorism \n     efforts against Al Qaeda and its related affiliates in the \n     overall Global War on Terrorism hampers the ability of \n     Congress and the American people to independently determine \n     whether the United States is making significant progress in \n     this defining struggle of our time; and\n       (5) the Executive Branch should submit a comprehensive \n     report to Congress, updated on an annual basis, which \n     provides a more strategic perspective regarding--\n       (A) the United States' highest global counterterrorism \n     priorities;\n       (B) the United States' efforts to combat and defeat Al \n     Qaeda and its related affiliates;\n       (C) the United States' efforts to undercut long-term \n     support for the violent extremism that sustains Al Qaeda and \n     its related affiliates;\n       (D) the progress made by the United States as a result of \n     such efforts;\n       (E) the efficacy and efficiency of the United States \n     resource allocations; and\n       (F) whether the existing activities and operations of the \n     United States are actually diminishing the national security \n     threat posed by Al Qaeda and its related affiliates.\n       (d) Annual Counterterrorism Status Reports.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than July 31, 2009, and every \n     July 31 thereafter, the President shall submit a report, to \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, the \n     Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, \n     the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the House of Representatives, the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives, the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, and the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives, which contains, for the most recent 12-month \n     period, a review of the counterterrorism strategy of the \n     United States Government, including--\n       (A) a detailed assessment of the scope, status, and \n     progress of United States counterterrorism efforts in \n     fighting Al Qaeda and its related affiliates and undermining \n     long-term support for violent extremism;\n       (B) a judgment on the geographical region in which Al Qaeda \n     and its related affiliates pose the greatest threat to the \n     national security of the United States;\n       (C) an evaluation of the extent to which the \n     counterterrorism efforts of the United States correspond to \n     the plans developed by the National Counterterrorism Center \n     and the goals established in overarching public statements of \n     strategy issued by the executive branch;\n       (D) a description of the efforts of the United States \n     Government to combat Al Qaeda and its related affiliates and \n     undermine violent extremist ideology, which shall include--\n       (i) a specific list of the President's highest global \n     counterterrorism priorities;\n       (ii) the degree of success achieved by the United States, \n     and remaining areas for progress, in meeting the priorities \n     described in clause (i); and\n       (iii) efforts in those countries in which the President \n     determines that--\n\n       (I) Al Qaeda and its related affiliates have a presence; or\n       (II) acts of international terrorism have been perpetrated \n     by Al Qaeda and its related affiliates;\n\n       (E) the specific status and achievements of United States \n     counterterrorism efforts, through military, financial, \n     political, intelligence, and paramilitary elements, relating \n     to--\n       (i) bilateral security and training programs;\n       (ii) law enforcement and border security;\n       (iii) the disruption of terrorist networks; and\n       (iv) the denial of terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries;\n       (F) a description of United States Government activities to \n     counter terrorist recruitment and radicalization, including--\n       (i) strategic communications;\n       (ii) public diplomacy;\n       (iii) support for economic development and political \n     reform; and\n       (iv) other efforts aimed at influencing public opinion;\n       (G) United States Government initiatives to eliminate \n     direct and indirect international financial support for the \n     activities of terrorist groups;\n       (H) a cross-cutting analysis of the budgets of all Federal \n     Government agencies as they relate to counterterrorism \n     funding to battle Al Qaeda and its related affiliates abroad, \n     including--\n       (i) the source of such funds; and\n       (ii) the allocation and use of such funds;\n       (I) an analysis of the extent to which specific Federal \n     appropriations--\n       (i) have produced tangible, calculable results in efforts \n     to combat and defeat Al Qaeda, its related affiliates, and \n     its violent ideology; or\n       (ii) contribute to investments that have expected payoffs \n     in the medium- to long-term;\n       (J) statistical assessments, including those developed by \n     the National Counterterrorism Center, on the number of \n     individuals belonging to Al Qaeda and its related affiliates \n     that have been killed, injured, or taken into custody as a \n     result of United States counterterrorism efforts; and\n       (K) a concise summary of the methods used by National \n     Counterterrorism Center and other elements of the United \n     States Government to assess and evaluate progress in its \n     overall counterterrorism efforts, including the use of \n     specific measures, metrics, and indices.\n       (2) Interagency cooperation.--In preparing a report under \n     this subsection, the President shall include relevant \n     information maintained by--\n\n[[Page S8450]]\n\n       (A) the National Counterterrorism Center and the National \n     Counterproliferation Center;\n       (B) Department of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation;\n       (C) the Department of State;\n       (D) the Department of Defense;\n       (E) the Department of Homeland Security;\n       (F) the Department of the Treasury;\n       (G) the Office of the Director of National Intelligence,\n       (H) the Central Intelligence Agency;\n       (I) the Office of Management and Budget;\n       (J) the United States Agency for International Development;

REPORT ON NATIONAL SECURITY IMPACT OF RISING \n                   GLOBAL FOOD PRICES AND WORLDWIDE SHORTAGES OF \n                   FOOD AND WATER.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Rising fuel prices, increased demand for food, and \n     distribution challenges in developing countries have \n     contributed to rising food prices, which are adversely \n     affecting the security and welfare of millions of people \n     worldwide.\n       (2) In 2008, rising food prices sparked violent protests in \n     Haiti and Egypt, and have posed challenges to stability and \n     governance throughout the sub-Saharan region.\n       (3) The lack of access to safe water and sanitation affects \n     more than 2,000,000,000 people worldwide, posing a \n     significant global security, environmental, and public health \n     concern. Climate change may exacerbate these challenges.\n       (4) The World Health Report 2002 notes that effects of \n     climate change on human health will undoubtedly have a \n     greater impact on societies or individuals with scarce \n     resources, where technologies are lacking, and where \n     infrastructure and institutions such as the health sector are \n     least able to adapt.\n       (5) The United States National Security Strategy dated \n     March, 2006 states that the United States faces new security \n     challenges, including ``environmental destruction, whether \n     caused by human behavior or cataclysmic mega-disasters such \n     as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, or tsunamis. Problems of \n     this scope may overwhelm the capacity of local authorities to \n     respond, and may even overtax national militaries, requiring \n     a larger international response. These challenges are not \n     traditional national security concerns, such as the conflict \n     of arms or ideologies. But if left unaddressed they can \n     threaten national security.''.\n       (b) Report on the National Security Impact of Rising Global \n     Food Prices and Worldwide Shortages of Food and Water.--\n       (1) Requirement for report.--Not later than 180 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the President shall submit \n     to Congress a report on the national security impact of \n     rising global food prices and worldwide shortages of food and \n     water.\n       (2) Content.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include--\n       (A) a description of the economic, geographic, ecological, \n     social, and political factors contributing to the rise in \n     price and shortage of worldwide food supplies;\n       (B) a description of the impact of changing climate \n     patterns on global stability with respect to arable land and \n     water resources;\n       (C) an assessment of the implications, if any, that might \n     exist for United States national security and future missions \n     for the Armed Forces given the potential social and political \n     consequences of shortages in the global supply of food and \n     water;\n       (D) an assessment of the potential implications for future \n     demand for international humanitarian operations and other \n     international assistance activities given the potential \n     social and political consequences of shortages in the global \n     supply of food and water; and\n       (E) an assessment of the national security implications for \n     the United States of succeeding or failing to succeed, with \n     other leading and emerging major contributors of greenhouse \n     gas emissions, in efforts to reduce emissions.\n       (3) Form of report.--The report required by paragraph (1) \n     shall be submitted in an unclassified form, but may include a \n     classified annex.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5492.

SENSE OF SENATE ON MARINE CORPS PROFESSIONAL \n                   MILITARY EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Marine Corps University of the United States Marine \n     Corps was established in 1989 by the 29th Commandant of the \n     Marine Corps, General Alfred Gray USMC (ret.), with the \n     mission to develop, deliver, and evaluate professional \n     military education and training through resident and distance \n     education programs to prepare leaders to meet the challenges \n     of national security \\and to preserve, promote, and display \n     the history and heritage of the Marine Corps.\n       (2) The United States Marine Corps Professional Military \n     Education System educates members of the United States Marine \n     Corps, the United States Army, the United States Air Force, \n     the United States Navy, and the United States Coast Guard, \n     civilian employees of the Department of State, the Department \n     of Justice, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the \n     Department of Defense civilians, and military officers of \n     foreign countries.\n       (3) The national security of the United States depends upon \n     Marines who are educated in a military education system that \n     produces creative, adaptable, and critical who thinkers able \n     to meet the challenges of warfare in the 21st century.\n       (4) The Commandant of the United States Marine Corps' \n     Planning Guidance directed the President of the Marine Corps \n     University to assess the health of the professional military \n     education programs of the Marine Corps for both officers and \n     enlisted members and make recommendations for the \n     reorganization, resourcing, and adjustment of the number of \n     students enrolled in such programs.\n       (5) In 2006, the Marine Corps University conducted a study \n     under the leadership of General Charles Wilhelm USMC (ret.), \n     to assess the health of the United States Marine Corps \n     Officer Professional Military Education Program. This study \n     concluded that the Officer Professional Military Education \n     System was generally sound. However, without investment in \n     facilities and information technology infrastructure, the \n     system will be increasingly unable to meet the needs of \n     Marine Corps officers, the Marine Corps generally, and the \n     Nation.\n       (6) The Marine Corps has developed a comprehensive plan \n     that will address the inadequate information technology \n     infrastructure and the inadequate facilities with a realistic \n     military construction effort that will include the \n     construction of the new Academic Support Instructional \n     Facility for professional military education programs for \n     both officers and enlisted members.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the United States Marine Corps is to be congratulated for--\n       (1) remarkable achievement in providing creative, adaptive, \n     and critical thinkers able to meet the challenges of warfare \n     in the 21st center and the defense of the United States;\n       (2) conducting an in-depth, institutionally honest \n     assessment of the United States Marine Corps Professional \n     Military Education System; and\n       (3) pursuing the noble goal of creating a worldwide, world-\n     class professional military education institution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5493.
